         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving to contend with them who invite you to uphold their diſloyalty by your example, nothing can be more to our purpoſe, then to prefix your example in the front of this work to teach them Loyalty. During the Agitations of the State, your Church, as the Needle in the Marriners Compaſs, kept ſteady upon the point of reſt, which is God and the King: And your obedience ſerved as an Enſign on a hill to <hi>France,</hi> to guide the people to their duty. Whereby you have juſtified the holineſs of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, making the world know, the Religion you teach binds you to be good ſubjects, and that you honour the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye fear God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100918:9"/>Therefore the Engliſh Covenanters did very ill to addreſs themſelves to you, ſince they hold a method quite contrary, for they diſhonour and maſſacre their King, under a colour of devotion to God, and undertake to ſet up the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, by the ruine of the Kingdome of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; which is as if they would build the Temple of God with Cannon ſhot, and defend Religion in violating it.</p>
            <p>The truth of the Goſpel was never advanced by theſe wayes, but the patience, and even the ſufferings of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, was it which propagated the Chriſtian Religion, and rendered the Church mighty and glorious. Thoſe who ſuffered under the Pagan and Arian Emperours, conquered both the Empire and Emperours, and the Champions of truth purchaſed a Kingdome to Jeſus Chriſt, not in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of their Soveraigns, but in pouring forth their own for righteouſneſs, by a voluntary ſubmiſsion to their judgement.</p>
            <p>He who cannot frame himſelf to this Doctrine, doth not ſo much as God requires of him, if he makes profeſsion of Chriſtianity; for Chriſt tells us in calling us, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taketh not up his Croſs, and cometh not after me, cannot be my Diſciple; and commands him who would imbrace the Goſpel, to ſet down before and calculate the expence, as if he were about to build. Certainly he that cannot reſolve to ſubject himſelf to his Soveraign for the love of God, and never draw his ſword againſt him to whom God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, made an ill calculation before he dedicated himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, for he ought not to take upon him Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if he were not able to go through with it, and was not reſolved rather to ſuffer then reſiſt, and to ſpend his goods and life to preſerve himſelf in that ſubjection, commanded by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>For maintaining this holy Doctrine, we have been baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and purſued with Armes, and after we had defended our Soveraign with more fidelity then ſucceſs, we have been conſtrained to forſake our dear Country, driven from our
<pb facs="tcp:100918:10"/>
houſes, and ſpoiled of our revenues, but yet we praiſe God for giving them, ſince he hath done us the honour that we ſhould loſe them for his ſervice; and we ought this to our King, of whom our lands held, to abandon them for love of him: For to enter into a Covenant againſt him peaceably to enjoy his, and the Kings his Predeceſſors bounty, and to betray the truth, and our conſciences, to ſave our moneys, we could never reſolve.</p>
            <p>Now ſince thoſe who have done the evil, began firſt to cry out, and have ſpread their unjuſt clamours through all the Reformed Churches, we'll make the ſame journey with our juſt complaints, and after the example of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed Levite, by the Sonnes of <hi>Jemini,</hi> we ſend this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of our grievances through all the quarters of Iſrael; <hi>Judg. 19.30. Conſider of it, take advice, and ſpeak your minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The injury which doth touch us neareſt, is not our Exile, nor the loſs of our goods, nor theirs of our neareſt Relations, but the extreme wrong done to the Goſpel, and the Reformed Churches, to whom theſe new Reformers falſly impute their Maximes of Rebellion, and hereby render our moſt holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion ſuſpected and hateful to Princes of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>This (Gentlemen) toucheth you very near, conſidering your condition, and the Summons the Aſſembly at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> made to you to covenant with them, or to make a covenant like theirs. The Epiſtle was addreſſed to the Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the name of all the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and with the Epiſtle they ſent the Oath of their Covenant, which concludes with an Exhortation in form of a prayer to God, <hi>That it would pleaſe him to ſtir up by their example, other Churches who live under the Tyranny of Antichriſt, to ſwear this Covenant, or one like it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſame Epiſtle, together with the Oath, being ſent to the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Genevah,</hi> ſtirred up in
<pb facs="tcp:100918:10"/>
them a holy jealouſie, and drew from that excellent perſon, Monſieur <hi>Diodati,</hi> who is now in glory, an anſwer worthy of him in the name of all the Church: <hi>Repell this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcandal, which ſo extremely wrongs Chriſtianity in general; waſh and cleanſe this filthy attempt of the blackeſt oppreſſion, which above all is imputed to the moſt pure profeſſion of the Goſpel, as if the Goſpel oppoſed, and affronted by a kind of antipathy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hatred, all Royal Power of Soveraign Authority. Pacifie the exaſperated ſpirit, and too much provoked of your King, and drive him not upon Pinacles and Precipices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God who touched the heart of this great perſon, whoſe memory ſhall be for ever precious for rendring ſo open a teſtimony to the truth; And becauſe he have not ſuffered himſelf to be fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And of late the moſt enormous actions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drew from Maſter <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> Prince of Letters, and the Honour of <hi>France,</hi> a defence of the Right of Kings; God was ſo pleaſed to raiſe up the Learnedſt pen of theſe times to defend the beſt cauſe of the world, in which this great perſon hath highly honoured his country; But to ſpeak right, he more honoured himſelf, and the Church wherein he was educated. For if hereafter theſe malefactors dare be ſo bold, as to ſay the Reformed Churches approved their actions, they ſhall produce this book which condemns them, and defends the Royal cauſe with ſuch wiſdome, and efficacy of ſpirit, ſuitable to the dignity of the ſubject, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to produce, if they can, any one of the Reformed Churches who have in the leaſt manner written in favour of their proceedings: It ſhould have been a ſtrange and ſhameful

thing, if there were none found amongſt the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who ſhould not diſown their wicked Doctrines, and cauſe all Princes and people of the world to know that the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches are very far from following their counſels, and abhor their ſeductions to diſloyalty, from what part ſoever they come.</p>
            <p>Heretofore indeed it was accounted the duty of charity and prudence, to cover the faults of this faction, and if corruption enter into <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not to publiſh it in <hi>Gath;</hi> but when the Doctrine of Rebellion diſputed in corners, aſcends the Pulpit, hold aſsizes in open Court, ſends forth Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, invites the Reformed Churches to their party, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Goſpel, Piety, zeal of Gods Glory, to raiſe ſubjects againſt their Soveraigns; now 'tis time or never to pluck off their mask of hypocriſie, and ſhew where the evil lies, and diſcover the wickedneſs of a party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Tis the duty of the Reformed Churches to ſpeak aloud, that 'tis not we that teach the people are above their King, and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by Letters and Intelligences a general riſing, but that it's the Covenanters of <hi>England,</hi> who attempting to cut off their King and Monarchy by the ſword, labour in vain to ſeduce their neighbours, to encreaſe their party, thereby to hide themſelves in the multitude of their complices, <hi>they came forth of us long ſince, but were not of us,</hi> and for their Doctrines and actions (which are the only things evil in their Reformation) they never received any countenance or incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from us.</p>
            <p>We aſſure our ſelves Gentlemen, in that Divine aſſiſtance which hath to this preſent upheld you, that ye will never be ſeduced to defend evil, neither by complacency nor contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but will follow the precept of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James,
<pb facs="tcp:100918:11"/>
Jam. 2.1. My Brethren have not the Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord of Glory with reſpect of perſons.</hi> Ye will conſider that thoſe who chaſe us, ſeek not your alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but to ſtrengthen their ſeparation from us, and not to imbrace good Doctrine, or follow your councel, which if they had asked and followed, the one had never ſold their King, nor the other over maſſacred him.</p>
            <p>Believe it (Sirs) they are your beſt friends at diſtance ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then neer, and if ye never converſe with them, ye will never be weary of their company.</p>
            <p>Your free, meek and ſolid piety, which feeds it ſelf ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply upon the ſubſtance of Religion, without picking quarrels at the ſhell, is very far from ſordid ſuperſtition, and the Hypocondriak and bloody zeal of theſe Covenanters, who pretend to advance the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the throats of his Diſciples, and cementing his Temple with blood inſtead of the cement of charity; and in the mean while, make ſome petty circumſtances, the principals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and cut out their holy Doctrine according to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which they are forging, as he that cuts his fleſh to make his doublet fit for his body.</p>
            <p>By how much more theſe are wicked, by ſo much the more are they worthy of compaſsion, whom we muſt behold as people <hi>drunken with the Wine of Aſtoniſhment,</hi> which they themſelves confeſs in their Epiſtle they ſent unto you, they ſhall find the reſt of their deſcription in that place, where they borrowed thoſe words, and ſhall there behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſet forth, <hi>as a wild Bull in a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, Iſa. 51.20.</hi> For as the wild Bull ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth when he feels himſelf intangled, and intangleth, and inſnares himſelf more by raging; ſo theſe miſerable people, who by an impetuoſity without reaſon rid themſelves out of all Laws, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, are inſnared in ſtronger bonds then before, and by their bruitiſh fury are more and more intangled.

            <p>Your wiſdome will inſtruct you to profit by the folly of your neighbours, and their evil actions teach you to do well, they will let you ſee that to deſtroy the Eccleſiaſtical and Political Order, by a bloody war to reform Religion, is to commit the fault in the vulgar Latine Tranſlation, <hi>Evertit domum,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You will alſo learn by the proceedings of theſe Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that its impoſsible to alter the foundation of Church and State, without pulling down the houſe, which is the work of the blind, as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to over-turn the Pillars of the publick building, that thoſe that thruſt them down might be cruſhed to pieces under the fall; that thoſe that take the Church and State apieces to cleanſe it, have not the power to put it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and in order again when they pleaſe, and that all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent changes in a State, as in an old body, are alwayes for the worſt.</p>

of God in the movings of States teacheth us, that in chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Kings by the rebellion of their ſubjects, hereby he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the people more then their Kings, and thoſe very Kings that God gives people in his wrath, <hi>Hoſea 13.11.</hi> are not taken away without his fury, and the publick ruine, which is then greateſt, when he takes from an ungrateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a King whom he have given in his mercy; the wiſe, and fearing God, ſhould conſider their ſufferings under their Soveraigns, as ſiniſter influences of celeſtial bodies, againſt which no man in his wits will draw his ſword, for both the one and the other comes from heaven, and cannot be remedied but by humility, prayers, and veneration, all other remedies are worſe then the evil.</p>
            <p>Alſo amidſt your grief to behold the ruine of our not long ſince flouriſhing Churches, you may comfort your ſelves in the weakneſs of our condition, which now renders us leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the like dangers; for as full and ſanguine bodies, are moſt ſubject to violent feavers and ſharp diſeaſes, which thoſe of weaker complexions are ordinarily free from, ſo thoſe perſons who have power in their hands, and are puffed up with a long proſperity, ordinarily fall into moſt violent evils, which ſeiſeth not upon them, but with too much ſtrength: Then when the Church hath the leaſt luſtre, ſhe oft times is neereſt to God, as the Moon is never neerer the Sun then when ſhe is in the loweſt degree of her declenſion, and without light to our regard. The Power of God is made perfect in our weakneſs, and we hope to behold you ſubſiſt, yea encreaſe and grow in bowing down under the ſtorm, whilſt thoſe that have ſo ſtriven and contended againſt their Soveraigns ſhall be rooted out by their arrogancy.</p>
            <p>By humility and ſubmiſſion under the mighty hand of God, which leads his Church through waies he knows ſafeſt for them, and ſtopping the ear to all factious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils cloathed with the zeal of Religion, ye will at laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that teſtimony of God which he gives to the Church of Epheſus; <hi>I know thy works, and thy labour,
<pb facs="tcp:100918:13"/>
and thy patience, and how thou canſt not bear them which are evil, and thou haſt tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them liars, and haſt borne, and haſt patience, and haſt not fainted,</hi> Rev. <hi>2.2.</hi> and thus ye ſhall ſurely obtain the promiſed reward following, <hi>To him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, will I give to eate of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the paradiſe of God,</hi> v. <hi>7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hope is our ſupport in the depth of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for under that terrible weight of publick and particular miſeries, capable to bear down the strongeſt and firmeſt ſpirits, we are raiſed and kept up by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that we ſerve a good Maſter, who will never forſake them who forſake all which is moſt dear to them to follow him. What though our ſufferings be the effects of our ſinnes, yet are they alſo honourable markes of our loyalty, both to God and our King, and though we have left our eſtates a little before death would have taken them away, yet God hath by his grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in us a good conſcience, riches which is not ſubject to ſequeſtration, but dying we ſhall carry away with us.</p>
            <p>In theſe great tryalls of our faith and patience, whilſt we ſeek eaſe in pouring forth our griefs into the boſome of our brethren, behold yet another encreaſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon affliction; for we find to our great regret, that the ſubtilty of our enemies have begotten an evil underſtanding between you and ſome of ours, to which ſome have much contributed, if the complaints we hear be true, that they have manifeſted and declared themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, and that they have deſpiſed your aſſemblies, as not being Churches, and maintained that there could be no Church where there was no Biſhop.</p>
            <p>As for their Doctrine, if it be divers from our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Confeſſion, they are no more of our Church then of
<pb facs="tcp:100918:13"/>
yours; and to ſatisfie you upon this point, we have joyned the Confeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe who have been received into holy Orders, ſware to defend at their reception, and all who were to be admitted into Churches were injoyned at their entrance, publickly to read, and to profeſſe thereupon, their conſent to them, under pain of loſing their Benefices. If any have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from that profeſſion, which they did ſo ſolemnly make, the body of the Church which maintains that holy Doctrine, is no way reſponſible for their erring. If the Rebels had not prevented the King from aſſembling a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Synod, to which his Majeſty purpoſed to invite other Reformed Churches, your Judgments would have been heard for the purging our Churches of all new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which without all compariſon are worſe, and in a farre greater number amongſt our enemies, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Royall party.</p>
            <p>As for this poſition,<note place="margin">☜</note> that there cannot be a Church without a Biſhop, we account it full of raſhneſſe and void of Charity; It's indeed a cruel ſentence to deprive of the benefit of the Goſpel, and of their union with Chriſt, all thoſe Churches which live under the Croſſe, and cannot enjoy the Epiſcopal Order. That Famous <hi>Dr. Andrews</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was not of this opinion, for in one of his Epiſtles touching Epiſcopacy, He (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) ſhould be harder than Iron, who would not acknowledge that there are holy Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es that ſubſiſt and flouriſh without Biſhops; and with what reſpect our Biſhops ſpeak of your Church, you ſhall read in this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>It's eaſie to ſee that the Epiſcopal Order is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the preſent condition of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> for if there were twenty or thirty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops amongst you, that ſhould Govern all the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it would be eaſie for thoſe of the contrary Religion under whom you live, to fil up thoſe places with ſome perſons who ſhould be at their devotion; whence would follow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>If your Order of equality might or ought to be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if it ſhould pleaſe God the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy ſhould embra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Supper of the Lord is not onely a ſign of the love that Chriſtians ought to have among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one to another: but rather it is a Sacrament of our redemption by Chriſts death. Inſomuch that to ſuch as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the ſame, the bread which we break, is a partaking of the Body of Chriſt: and likewiſe the Cup of bleſſing is a partaking of the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Tranſubſtantiation (or the change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be prooved by holy Writ: but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sacrament, and hath given occaſion to many ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>The body of Chriſt is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper onely after an heavenly and ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And the mean whereby the Body of Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Compleat Hiſtory of our Affairs ſince the beginning of theſe Commotions, would be the beſt Apology for the Juſtice of our Cauſe; but this let ſome brave Spirits labour that are furniſhed with Records and Intelligences, and who are indued with a judicious Candor, which may leave to after Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed portraicture of the wickedneſſe of this laſt Age; but that we ſhall not undertake here: Yet nevertheleſſe, ſince the Queſtion of Right depends upon that of Fact, and that to judge of a Different, we muſt know who began the Quarrel, it is neceſſary that ſomething be ſaid of the occaſions and beginning of this here; for in regard of the progreſſe, it is ſo notoriouſly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly wicked on our Enemies ſide, that their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that formerly had too good an opinion of their Cauſe, acknowledge now that they have rendred it very evil.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be our Task then to let the world ſee that it hath been Evil from the very beginning, and that their firſt proceedings were contrary to the Word of God, to the conſtitution of the Kingdom, and to natural Equity; Yea, that all thoſe fearfull prodigies of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100918:25"/>
which the world beholds with a juſt execration, are the neceſſary conſequences of their firſt avowed and publiſhed principles.</p>
            <p>Ye muſt therefore know, that the Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1640, was compoſed for the moſt part of Perſons of Honour, affectious to their Religion, King and Country, and of ſome others alſo, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes aimed at a general overthrow of all things: Theſe finding themſelves to be few in number, labour to joyn to their Faction the numerous and meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>London,</hi> who being kept under a juſt and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign in their duty, and in happy ſubjection, could not be induced to mutiny by no other motive then that of Religion, which is the handle by which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians in all times have wound and turned about the Spirits of the people.</p>
            <p>We will not nevertheleſſe deprive them of this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it was they that firſt brought the Reformation of Religion upon the Stage, but the Honour is due to them who ſince have ſuffered for their Loyalty towards God and the King; that in this holy enterpriſe they only carried themſelves vigorouſly and ſincerely, but their good Zeal by the Cunning of the Party was driven ſo far, that labouring to reform the Clergie, they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without thinking, the deſign of them that would deſtroy them, and to cauſe afterward Monarchy to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the Ruines of the Church.</p>
            <p>This profeſſion of the Parliament to Reform the Church, fils the hearts of all good men with joy and hope; for although that the excellent Order in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church deſerves highly to be reſpected and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; the purity of the Goſpel there being clothed with Honour, and defended by an Epiſcopal Gravity, yet is it of our Government, and of all other in the world, be they Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, as with Watches, that how good and excellent ſoever they be, length of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100918:25"/>
time diſorders them, that ever and anon they have need of mending and making clean.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt an Age ſince the Doctrine and Diſcipline of our Church hath been renewed, and it is a wonder both the one and the other have been ſo well conſerved in ſo long a ſpace: Nevertheleſs, the faults of ſome Particulars ought not to be imputed to the General. The Church hath flouriſhed under our Diſcipline, and the Truth hath been preſerved, and the Good being put in the Ballance againſt the Evil, the people had far more cauſe to glorifie God, than to complain; but we have to do with Spirits whoſe nature is like Lapwings, which in a Garden full of fruits, feed only on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo well done, that doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe ſome, even the works of God diſpleaſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, becauſe they are well done; and in all thoſe works wherein the ſpirit of man hath a part, there is nothing ſo perfect which may not be amended. Our Lyturgie, ſo holy, and ſo highly eſteemed in all the Reformed Churches, hath nevertheleſs given offence to many perſons amongſt us. And although it was for a very ſmall matter, yet thoſe who were affectionate to peace, were content to change ſomthing, and ſo to purchaſe Concord with their Diſſenting Brethren at that price.</p>
            <p>Whence this overture of Reformation opened a gate to the Liberty of them that deſired a change, and the Parliament being compoſed of perſons of different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, in matters of Religion, every one had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſay and write what he pleaſed, and had a Party in the Aſſembly of Eſtates, that protected and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them: The <hi>Germans</hi> never wrote ſo much upon Logick in a hundred years, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wrote of the Deſigns of their Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline in three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths; every week brought forth a thouſand ſeditious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100918:26"/>
pamphlets, which ſupplied the ſcarcity of Coals; every writer made a Platform of Reformation according to his humour, and in this new building none would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf to be a Maſon, but every one would be Architect; and there was none of them who called not his reformation the only Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, out of which there was no ſalvation: But theſe Kingdoms of Jeſus Chriſt agreed one with another, and with the nature of the thing, as the Titles and Chapters of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagues Eſſays</hi>: The people are called a Beaſt with many Heads, and when all theſe heads ſhall cry out at one time, and every one with a different cry, I leave you to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſe what an odious diſcord they make in the ears both of God and man.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this univerſal diſtraction, it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that a certain number of Divines, differing in the point of Diſcipline, ſhould meet together to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about Religion, as well for the interiour as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour part, where many Biſhops and other of the chief of the Clergy men; the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> (who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi>) made this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, That the Divines ſhould in no wiſe touch upon the point of Diſcipline, until ſuch time as they were agreed about the points of Doctrine, hoping thereby that their ſpirits being united by the bond of one common, but holy Faith, they would eaſily accord about the exteriour Government or Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>This Counſel was embraced by all, and ſo wiſely managed by that great Perſon, that in three Meetings, the Divines accorded upon all the ſubſtance of Religion, and formed hereupon divers Articles, and with one conſent condemned divers opinions: This general conſent in Doctrine filled them with hope, that the points of Diſcipline would paſs with the like ſweetneſs; and indeed there wanted not much to have made us happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100918:26"/>But before the report of this good Agreement could be publiſhed abroad, the Factious party of the State, fearing above all things this accord in Religion, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed a ſtrong Quarrel againſt the Degree of Biſhops, as an appurtenance of Antichriſt; and another, about their ſitting in Parliament; and did ſo exaſperate the people againſt the Prelates, that in ſtead of purſuing their deſign of Reformation, they were conſtrained to provide for the ſafety of their own lives. After this, there was no more ſpeech of the Agreement in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that would utterly have ſpoiled their work, for it had never been poſſible to have raiſed the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, if the concluſion of this conference had been made known to the world, that the King, the Court, and the Biſhops, made profeſſion of the ſincere reformed Religion. Now, becauſe all the Lies and Subtilties of the Devil were not capable to impute unto them another Confeſſion of Faith, but that which they maintain, which was Holy and Orthodox, known eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and confirmed by the Confeſſions of all the reformed Churches of <hi>Europe</hi>; the Factious perſwaded the people, both by their Sermons and ſeditious Libels, that the degree of Biſhops was an eſſential Branch and Mark of Antichriſt, and that to pull them down, was to do the work of the Lord, and to ruine Antichriſt; and that if the King would maintain them, he would be deſtroyed with them, as being one of thoſe Kings who gave his power to the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>And beſides the deſtruction of Biſhops, they openly demanded the Abolition of the Divine Service received in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> condemning the uſe of all other prayers, yea even of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>; quarrelling with the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> denied the neceſſity of the Sacraments, boaſted of a new Light that had appeared to them from Heaven to draw them out of Popiſh Darkneſs; and all that was not compatible with their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100918:27"/>
extravagant Illuminations, they called Popery; and the Miniſters that diſobeyed them, <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, and the ſupporters of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>By ſuch kind of people were the great multitudes ſtirred, who came crying at the Gates of the King and Parliament for Reformation, threatning with fire and ſword all thoſe that ſhould oppoſe it: Of theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, we may ſpeak what is ſpoken of the uproar at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> Acts 19.32. The Aſſembly was confuſed, and the more part knew not wherefore they were come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for thoſe that called for Reformation, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not one another, and their opinions were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Religion, as appears at this day; agreeing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, to pull down the Eccleſiaſtical Government; and what New Government they will build upon the Ruines of the Old, we ſhall know, when the ſword hath decided the controverſie; but whilſt the Mariners ſtrive, the Ship ſinks. The Lord behold his poor Church in compaſſion.</p>
            <p>We have great hope now, beholding the diverſity of Opinions and Inclinations, that theſe evil ingredients will together make a good Temperature, and that the diſorder, yea, even the Licentiouſneſs it ſelf will inforce order, as commonly evil Manners beget good Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to attain this, it's required in this general confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe of clear and ſound judgments, who ſee the bottom of the evil, and know the Remedy of it: But having conſidered them that walk before in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Reformation, we find that they are ſuch that neither know the Remedy nor the Evil.</p>
            <p>As for the Evil, in ſtead of having their eyes upon the errors of particulars, againſt the principal points of Faith, and Confeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; they grew obſtinate againſt certain ſmall and indifferent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which the King had many times offered to change by a Synod lawfully aſſembled; and caſt all the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100918:27"/>
Fire of their paſſion upon the Epiſcopall preheminence, a Surpliſs, a Feſtival, Forms of Prayer, Painted win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; and condemning many good things amongſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he evil.</p>
            <p>And as for the Remedy, we have here whereat to admire, that ſtriking at ſo ſmall and light evils, they would employ ſuch extream Remedies, nothing being able to ſerve but general deſtruction, as if to heal the pain of the Teeth, they would cut off the Head, in ſtead of proceeding by an amiable conference, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deputation of the Clergy of the Kingdom to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in a Synod to calm the fiery ſpirits, and to keep the people in obedience to their Soveraign, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the building that ſhaked, by the Ciment of Charity; they made open profeſſion that the Reformation could not be effected but by blood, that they would have no peace with the Biſhops and their Clergy, that they muſt deſtroy before they build, raze <hi>Babylon</hi> (as they called our Diſcipline) even to the very foundations, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and ſacrifice all his Prieſts; that now the time was come, that the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God ought to pillage the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And that now the juſt ſhould waſh their footſteps in the blood of the ungodly, for ſuch they accounted us; and thus they did us the honour to plunder and kill us in Scripture Language.</p>
            <p>And with this Divinity the Pulpits ſounded aloud, and the people publickly exhorted to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and to deſtroy all Miniſters both of Church and State, that ſhould joyn with him; and for this effect, theſe following Texts of Scripture were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their zealous Preachers, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> Judg. 5.23. <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord, to help the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mighty.</hi> Jer. 48.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100918:28"/>
work of the Lord deceitfully, and curſed be he that keepeth back his ſword from bloud</hi>; and theſe they appropriated to their war againſt their King and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> and all that adhered unto them; there being no way of Reformation in theſe mens accounts but to kill us for the Love of God, and the Advancement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Now being exceedingly aſtoniſhed, how men of Learning could poſſibly be ſo bewitched with a furious and fooliſh zeal; we found at length, having ſounded the depth of their opinions, that their Brains were troubled with Propheſies and Revelations, that their principal reading was in Commentaries upon the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> which they interpreted according to their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and that they had ſtudied more, what God would do hereafter, than what their Duty was to do for the preſent; that they made no Conſcience to tranſgreſs the declared Will of God in his Commands, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſecret will of his Decree. That they were Millenari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, expecting a Temporal Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, believing that the time of that Kingdom was now come; and to eſtabliſh that Kingdom, they were to pluck down that of Antichriſt (as they underſtood) the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Order, and to diſpoſſeſs Kings, drive away the wicked, daſh the children of <hi>Babel</hi> againſt the ſtones, tread the winepreſs of the wrath of God, till the Blood roſe to their Bridle reins, that thereby Chriſt alone may reign in the world, and the meek inherit the earth: We have ſince enough ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the fruits of their meekneſs: All this is drawn from the model of the Common-wealth of <hi>John a Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and the Prophets of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of the Covenanters ſhall diſavow theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they cannot deny but they were preached pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and ordinarily; neither can they deny but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of this pernicious Doctrine were the chief of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100918:28"/>
their New Reformation, and the Authors of the war; people whoſe Counſels were applauded as Oracles, and who drew after them their party by the repetition of their ſanctified ſtrength of zeal; thoſe who dared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them, did it very fearfully, and kiſſing their hands before they ſpake, but they themſelves carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, acting with a prophetick liberty and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; alſo, after all, they only were the men to be truſted, and who were put upon all great deſigns and employments; for they feared that they who are leſs governed by Enthuſiaſms, might at laſt ſo far forget themſelves, as to be faithful to their Sovereign, and yield to a peaceable accomodation.</p>
            <p>Behold here then, wherefore we would not joyn our ſelves with theſe Reformers, becauſe we ſee that even they themſelves have the greateſt need of Reformation, being far gone from the Doctrine of the reformed Churches, erring in the Faith, but yet more in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; It's they would ſweep the Church, as God ſwept <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the Beeſom of deſtruction: They ſpeak not of reforming neither Doctrines nor Manners, but to ruine the Perſons: They account the moſt part of the Clergy of the Kingdom unworthy to be corrected, but altogether to be rooted out; that one part of the Reformation was to ruine the King, and to take the ſword from his ſide to cut off his head; the favourers of tumults were the only perſons that were careſſed, they lent their ears to the popul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r tumults, whilſt they ſhut the mouths and bound the hands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: It was they taught that the people were above the King, and that the Command of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that every one ſhould be ſubject to the higher Powers, obligeth the King for to obey the People; it was they that upheld, yea, favoured and courted all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Sects, provided that they would bandy with them againſt their King: It was they that ſuffered to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100918:29"/>
go unpuniſhed the Blaſphemies in the Pulpits, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, Sacriledges and horrible profanations of the Service of God, and permitted all things to thoſe who were of the zealous party.</p>
            <p>We beheld on the other ſide, that the King took knowledge of the grievances of his people, as well for the ſpiritual as temporal, and laboured ſincerely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy them; that he conſented to the alteration of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive things in Religion, and to the puniſhment of thoſe who were accuſed as troublers of the Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the things and perſons were examined by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and lawful waies of a general Synod, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to aſſemble; he alſo was pleaſed to yield of his own right to augment the rights of his Subjects, and daily multiplied acts of favour, capable to convert the moſt alienated ſpirits, paſſed by the many and great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts that were done to his authority, and endeavoured by all waies poſſible to overcome evil with good.</p>
            <p>But the more the King yielded, the more inſolent were the factious againſt him; he offered to reform both the State and Church, but they would not permit him, they themſelves would do that work without him. The King ſent divers meſſages to know of them what things they would reform, but to this they anſwered only with complaints. Neither could he obtain any declaration of that which they deſired, until that his Forts, Magazines, Ships and Revenues were taken from him; the reaſon of which hath ſince been given by one of their principal Champions. Having to ſow the Lords Field,<note place="margin">Fuller Anſ. p. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> they had need to make a fence about it before they begin, that the work-men might labour without interruption; and that to lance the Apoſtume of a ſick State, they muſt firſt bind the Patient.</p>
            <p>Our Conſcience could not accomodate it ſelf to this prudence, neither ever expect any good from ſuch a way
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100918:29"/>
of Reformation, which would bind the Royal hands and feet of Majeſty, before they would declare what they deſired of his Favour; and cut aſunder the Nerves of his Authority and ſubſiſtance, under colour to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A ſtrange proceeding to us that have learned of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul, that a Prince beareth not the ſword in vain,</hi> Rom. 13.4. But in that is the Miniſter of God to execute wrath; and that to reſiſt him, yea, when he ſhould make uſe of the ſword to commit injuſtice, is to reſiſt the Ordinance of God: But if he uſe it well or ill, that ought to be left to him who gave it him, and to whom only he ought to render account; his Subjects ought to counſel him, if he did ill, and refuſe to aſſiſt him in evil doing, and not repreſs him by Arms: That if this Command of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> obliged the <hi>Romans</hi> to obey a cruel vicious Prince, and enemy to God, we ſhould account our ſelves much more bound to obey a juſt, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, religious Prince, whoſe life was a rare example of piety and ſanctity, and his Government ſo juſt and peaceable, that he might well be called the Father of his Subjects; who wanted nothing to make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but to know their happineſs.</p>

            <p>THeſe violent beginnings of the Covenanters, and their Progreſs alſo, which overthrows all humane Authority, had great need to ſtrengthen it ſelf by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, to ſatisfie the Conſcience; whence is it that they made a great noiſe of it in their Pulpits, but not in their Diſputes; for thoſe that exhorted the people in Scripture-term to War againſt the King, hang down the head, when in conference their Proofs are demanded, ſaying; that, It is not for Divines but Lawyers to decide the preſent quarrel; Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that there is a great difference betwixt the terms and proofs of Scripture, and that many that have the voice of the Lamb, ſpeak as the Dragon.</p>
            <p>But fearing leſt they ſhould accuſe us, that we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their proofs, behold here all that they make uſe of, both in their Books and Sermons, part borrowed from the writings of the Jeſuites, and part from <note n="*" place="margin">Vindiciae contra Tirannos, &amp; De jure Magistratus.</note> two Books which are Printed with Machiavels Prince, and not without great reaſon, for there are three wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books together, and its a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how that in threeſcore years their Books have not been burnt for company by the hands of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Executioner.</p>

and under pain of damnation, there is need of a formal command, or of a permiſſion expreſſed, that exempts Chriſtians; at leaſt in ſome certain caſes, for the crime of reſiſting the higher powers, which is to reſiſt God, and from the puniſhment of eternal damnation; without this all the Examples of Subjects riſing up againſt their Princes from the very Creation of the World cannot, nor is able to put Conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a quiet condition: He hath but ſmall knowledge that knows not that Examples prove nothing, but that ſuch a thing hath been done, and is poſſible; not that it ought to be done, or that it is lawful to be done; if there be not a Law built upon the Example, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority given to it, that it may be a pattern for the future; and then its not the Example, but the Law that we are bound to follow, which cannot be ſaid of the Examples before alledged, which beſide the general inſufficiency of Examples in matter of proof touch not the point of Reſiſtance in queſtion, except the firſt, which is wholly contrary to it.</p>
            <p>Which is the Example of <hi>David,</hi> who being perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> took ſix hundred men for his Guard; this might ſuffice for Anſwer, That this action is not recommended by the Word of God, nor propoſed as an example for us to follow; Chriſtian piety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may imitate many actions of holy perſons, which are not formally recommended in the word of God; but the queſtion being to exempt us from a prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a formal threatning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. one of the moſt conſiderable and penal in all the Scripture, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no example to the contrary, if it be not expreſly recommended and turned into a command; and beſides the laſt command ought to have the advantage, and to be obeyed before the firſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, extraordinary Caſes in Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a Miraculous and Prophetick Conduct, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100918:31"/>
ſerve for a pattern in ordinary caſes: <hi>David</hi> was Anointed King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by a ſpecial command of God, and in all the Liſt of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> there were none but <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> called to the Kingdom in this manner. And this holy Unction gave them priviledges in <hi>Iſrael</hi> which were onely proper to them, and which the Gentlemen of the Covenant have not in <hi>England,</hi> for ordinary caſes there are perpetual and inviolable precepts, and theſe precepts are wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reſiſting of Soveraigns by Arms.</p>
            <p>Our Enemies nevertheleſs challenge a particular Intereſt in this example of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves the anointed of the Lord, but deny this Title to their King, if he be not one of the Elect of God; but let them learn, that that which renders Kings the anointed of the Lord, is not true Faith, nor the Gifts of the Spirit, but that Soveraign power which they have from on high.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Cyrus</hi> a Pagan King is called by God himſelf, his anointed, and his Shepherd, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.1. If then Kings are the anointed of the Lord, without conſideration of their Religion or vertue, it follows then that they loſe not their unction, neither by their Errors nor their Vices; and that falling from the grace of God, yet they fall not from that power which they held of him. This is ſpoken of by the way againſt the Hereſie of moſt part of the Covenanters, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the divine Unction of Kings, and faſten it to their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntaſies in Religion.</p>
            <p>And we have cauſe to give thanks to theſe men who alledge to us the example of <hi>David,</hi> there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the Scripture more contrary to them; for in ſtead of that they purſued the King with weapons in their hands, and gave him Battel; <hi>David</hi> fled conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from place to place, and never ſtruck one ſtroke nor drew his Sword againſt his King. Twice he let
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100918:32"/>
him eſcape when he had him in his power, and having taken away his ſpear, reſtored it to him again; and having but cut off the Lap of his garment, his heart ſmote him for it; and when one counſelled him to diſpatch him, then when he was in his hands, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord forbid that I ſhould do this thing unto my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Lords anointed, to ſtretch forth my hand againſt him, ſeeing he is the Anointed of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.6. And when his ſervants would have ſlain him, he ſaith, <hi>Deſtroy him not: for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords Anointed, and be guiltleſs,</hi> 1 Sam. 26.9. This Divine Title bound his hands; and poſſeſſed his ſpirit with fear and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>And ſince our Enemies make him to ſay that he would not ſtretch forth his hand againſt the King, if he deſcended not in Battel againſt him; let them well read the Text, but eſpecially in the Original, and they ſhall find no ſuch thing; <hi>David</hi> doth rather put <hi>Saul</hi> wholly into the hands of God, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to die, or he ſhall deſcend into the battel and periſh; The Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth my hand againſt the Lords Anointed</hi>: He doth not ſay that he will not ſtretch forth his hand againſt him, unleſs that the Lord ſmite him; for if God ſmite him, what need had <hi>David</hi> to ſmite him? He doth not ſay he would deſcend into Battel againſt him, for then his Actions would have contradicted his Words, for he always fled from him; the Event proved that his words were Prophetical, and that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> waited whileſt <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be ſlain in a ſtrange War, and that the hand of the Lord ſhould be upon him.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>David</hi> never gave him Battel, we cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to his weakneſs; for he might as well have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Army of <hi>Saul,</hi> as that of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Keilah,</hi> with his ſmall number; if God who gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in all his ways had found it good, ſince it had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100918:32"/>
been eaſie for him to have raiſed mighty Armies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigned the Succeſſor of <hi>Saul</hi> in the Kingdom; for people naturally adore the Riſing Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> retired into <hi>Keilah,</hi> and having heard that <hi>Saul</hi> had an intention to come thither to take him, enquired of the Lord, if thoſe in the City would deliver him up to <hi>Saul,</hi> and God having anſwered him, that they would deliver him, fled from thence; the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters therefore of the Covenant infer, that <hi>David</hi> had a deſire to fortifie <hi>Keilah,</hi> and to endure a ſiege. But all which they can gather from that Paſſage is, that <hi>David</hi> was not ſafe in that retreat, and that God adviſed him to ſeek another, for the Inhabitants of <hi>Keilah</hi> might have delivered him to <hi>Saul</hi> without attending a ſiege; but when they ſhall have proved that <hi>David</hi> would have fortified <hi>Keilah,</hi> it makes nothing for them, ſince God declares by his Anſwer, that it was not pleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>We would beſeech the Gentlemen of the Covenant to hold themſelves to this example which they have choſen, that they would caſhier their great Armies, for <hi>David</hi> had but a few people, with them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.16. that they would not rob the Subjects of their King, of their Goods; but imitate the Souldiers of <hi>David,</hi> who were a wall both by night and day to the Flocks and Herds of <hi>Nabal</hi>; That having ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Arms of the King, let them peaceably reſtore them again as <hi>David,</hi> and not with the points for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Let their Conſcience ſtrike them, and make them cry out, <hi>The Lord forbid that I ſhould do this thing againſt my Maſter the Lords Anointed, for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt him and be guiltleſs?</hi> Words which beſide the example carry with them a perpetual and expreſs command, and ſhall one day be produced in judgment againſt thoſe that defend the late Commotions by the example of <hi>David</hi>; and if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100918:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their continuance in the Kingdoms of his Majeſty, is either diſpleaſing or dangerous to them, in ſtead of oppoſing him, let them retire into ſome ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as <hi>David</hi> did to King <hi>Achis</hi>; let them alſo imitate his ſincerity in making uſe of ſtrangers onely for his protection, and not to invade his Country, and raiſe his Subjects againſt their King, which is that uſe the Covenanters imployed the Scots; In one point onely they imitate and ſurpaſs <hi>David,</hi> in that he fained himſelf a Fool, for they indeed act the Fools in good earneſt.</p>
            <p>In brief, the Example of <hi>David</hi> which they alledge, is ſo contrary to the Actions of the Covenanters, that they have great reaſon to fear leaſt God alledge this at the dreadful day of Judgement againſt them, ſaying, <hi>Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, then wicked ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> Luke 19.22. The other paſſages of Scripture are moſt ridiculouſly alledged, and ſerve only to ſhew their great weakneſs.</p>
            <p>They bring the action of the Army of <hi>Saul,</hi> that ſaved <hi>Jonathan</hi> againſt the Oath of his Father, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.45. but to what purpoſe is this? Doth this Army draw their ſword againſt the King? Uſe they any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence either againſt his Perſon or Eſtate? If a Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They make uſe alſo of the example of <hi>Ehud,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> who kept the Iſraelites in ſlavery, <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.21. we have often heard this example preſſed with much vehemency in Pulpits. The Preachers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Eglon</hi> to the King, affirming that <hi>Eglon</hi> was the lawful King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that it is lawful to kill a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate King, if he oppreſs the people of God; all this is falſe, and proper to be refuted only by the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whom we leave them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100918:33"/>The Example follows of the City of <hi>Libnah,</hi> which appertained to the <hi>Levites,</hi> which revolted from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of <hi>Jehoram, becauſe</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Lord God of his Fathers</hi>; the Covenanters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the word <hi>Becauſe</hi> to the intention of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Libnah,</hi> and not to the judgement of God; whence theſe Gentlemen conclude, That it is lawful for the people to ſhake off the yoke of their Prince, when the Prince forſakes God, of which they will be Judges. Although <hi>Libnah</hi> ſhould revolt for this reaſon, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that the reaſon is of ſtrength, or that it ought to be turned into example, a thing which requires a new proof of Scripture; but the drift of the Text is, to aſſign the cauſe of this revolt to the Juſtice of God, and not to that of men: Take the whole Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Alſo the ſame Author ſaith, that <hi>Pekah</hi> the Son of <hi>Remaliah</hi> ſlew in <hi>Judah</hi> 120000 in one day, which were all valiant men, <hi>becauſe they had forſaken the Lord God

            <head>CHAP. III. Expreſs Texts of Scripture which Commands Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and forbids Reſiſtance to Soveraigns.</head>
            <p>FOr to draw them from Examples and particular Caſes, which is their retreat, to general Precepts, we beſeech them as they love God and their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to review their proofs, and conſider that in all the Scripture there is neither Precepts nor Permiſſion that authorizeth the taking up of Arms againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, but there are very many formal Commands to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The firſt Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> binds us to honour the King; for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning Soveraignty appertained to Fathers, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived of the paternal power, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6, &amp;c. Now it is impoſſible to honour the King, and draw your ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; upon which we obſerve that in caſe of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, the Father was commanded by the King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his Son and Daughter, and the Husband his Wife, and to ſtretch forth firſt his hand againſt them to ſlay them; but neither the Son nor the Daughter ought to accuſe the Father, nor the Wife the Husband, much leſs to put forth their hand againſt them: Whence we learn, that neither Children nor Subjects ought to riſe up againſt their Fathers or their Kings, which have in them the Paternal Character, no, not for the ſervice of God; and that their Perſons ought to be inviolable; thoſe who confeſs this Truth, and yet in the mean while ſeparate the Authority of the King from his Perſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that which they have confeſſed, and expoſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King to violence, for it is the Authority that renders the Perſons of Kings unviolable.</p>
            <p>Therefore among ſo many Reprehenſions and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100918:36"/>
againſt Idolatrous Kings, whereof the holy Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is full, ye ſhall in no place nor part find that the people are reproved for not depreſſing or depoſing their King; ordinarily the puniſhment that God ſent upon them, came immediatly from himſelf, or out of the Kingdome, not by their own Subjects: Before God would employ <hi>Jehu,</hi> who was a Subject, to deſtroy the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> he anointed him King, and beſides, gave him a ſpecial and extraordinary Command.</p>

            <p>This likewiſe is to accuſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of want of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as if he taught patience and obedience to Kings, only to accomodate himſelf to the Times, and not to obey God; but he clears himſelf ſufficiently of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, ſaying, that we muſt not only be <hi>ſubject for wrath,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>for fear of puniſhment, but alſo for Conſcience.</hi>

            <p>Moreover this Doctrine is pernicious to the Church, for if it were embraced, it would render Chriſtians ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and hateful to their Soveraigns; as perſons who would ſubject the Conſcience of their Prince to theirs, and ſubmits to them only out of weakneſs, and wait only an occaſion to caſt off their yoke; which would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Kings ever to keep them weak, and to impoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burdens upon them, and ſo prevent their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>Alſo this Doctrine is pernicious to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, for it would much hinder the converſion of Pagan Kings, ſince that turning Chriſtians, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mode, they ſhould loſe their authority, there being no Pagan Religion, which teacheth Subjects to reſiſt their Prince by Arms; which would alſo indure Chriſtian Kings of a diverſe Religion, to hinder with all their might the Converſion of their Subjects: Bleſſed be God that there are none but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi> that maintain ſo deſtructive an Opinion: The Reformed Churches, and the moſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church give no jealouſie to their Princes hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

There is no <hi>Cymera,</hi> nor fantaſtical humour like this! Behold the work of the Spirit that now works efficaciouſly in the children of diſobedience! Behold another Evaſion! The Apoſtle (ſay they) doth not teach us who is the Superiour Power, but that it is the Superiour Power that we muſt obey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtrive to form in the Kingdom a Superiour Power above the King, a thing contrary to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Monarchy, as I hope to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>It's eaſie to gather which is the Superiour Power,

            </p>
            <p>This other ſtarting hole is of the ſame ſtuffe, they ſay that the defence not to reſiſt Supream Powers, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth only Particulars, and not the States of a Kingdom; this is to make another Goſpel for the General than for the Particulars; as if they ſhould ſay, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are directed to every one, but not to all, which is to overthrow common Senſe, ſince the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy are impoſed upon all the States of <hi>England,</hi> whereby they are bound alſo in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; none ſit in Parliament that takes not their Oaths at his entrance, neither is it in their power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw without and againſt the King that which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the King ſitting in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Alſo this is a thing that never entred into the ſpirits

of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> before the times of this epidemical phrenſie, that the Kings Writs which makes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to aſſemble, and the deputation of the people that ſends them, ſhould exempt their Deputies or Parliament men from the duty of Subjects, and abſolve them of their Oath of Allegiance and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

            <p>When we reaſon thus, our adverſaries are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily moved, and would take this matter out of the hands of the Clergy, ſaying, that the Lawyers, &amp; not the Divines are to decide where the Supream Power of the State reſts, whether it be in the perſon of the King or the people, and with what limitations the King ought to be obeyed, and that the Apoſtle requiring an obedience to ſupream Powers, intends an obedience according to the Laws, and the Laws are every where different, and that one and the ſame Rule of Scripture cannot ſerve for all Kingdoms; that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> not being formed as the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Commands of the Old and New Teſtament alledged, toucheth not the preſent Quarrel.</p>

            <p>Without exceeding then the limits of our vocation, we do acknowledg that the Apoſtle requires an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, according to the Laws of the State, not only of the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of every other form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and we deny, that there may not be found in Scripture a Rule of Obedience, which ſerves for all ſorts of Eſtates, for ſuch is that of the preſent Text, <hi>That every Soul ſhould be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi> and that <hi>he that reſiſteth the Powers, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and thereby ſhall receive to himſelf damnation</hi>; the reaſon inſerted between theſe two ſentences do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly regard all forms of States, that <hi>there are no powers but they be of God, and the powers that are, are ordained of God</hi>; therefore the Command that goes before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, appertains to all ſorts of Government: Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one be ſubject to the power, and let none reſiſt the power and threatnings; alſo which is the terribleſt of all threatnings, that thoſe that reſiſt the Powers, ſhall <hi>receive to themſelves damnation.</hi>

            <p>Indeed if they could produce a fundamental Law of the Kingdom, that did permit the people of <hi>England</hi> in certain caſes to take up Arms againſt the King, they had ſome reaſon then to ſay that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not forbid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to reſiſt their Prince, beyond the nature of their Laws, as the Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>

            <p>'Tis that which but of late hath been put to the Queſtion in <hi>England,</hi> and was never diſputed before the year 1642. where the Supream Power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reſides, unleſs when the Crown was in diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Princes: The Kings enemies employed all their forces to prove that the Soveraign Authority ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the people, to evade the Text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and other Texts of Scripture, which did marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly incommode their affairs, imitating thoſe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>One of their Authors, of whom they make great account,<note place="margin">Fuller Anſ. p. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> affirms boldly, that the paſſages in Scripture againſt reſiſting the Supream Power are of no force, but in ſimple and abſolute Monarchies, as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and do no waies touch ours: This is a clean ſhaver, who cuts the knot that he cannot untie; wherein he imitates the ingenuity of <hi>Buchanan,</hi>

            <p>Theſe their Confeſſions are very remarkable, and indeed moſt ſtrange, coming from Chriſtians, who ſhould rather frame their policy to Scripture, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Scripture, becauſe it contradicts the policy they would eſtabliſh: They have found out an invention to caſt off the yoke of their King, which is to caſt off that of the Word of God. After this ſo open a profeſſion, it's againſt all equity they ſhould make uſe of Scripture for their cauſe, either in their Writings or Sermons: They alledg nothing but examples, but there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the examples ſhould be made uſe of by them who reject the Commands, but after they have turned themſelves into as many poſtures as a Fencer, to defend

The laſt Figure of <hi>Proteus</hi> is the Natural, and after all their tricks of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hypocriſie, at laſt their Nature ſhews it ſelf.

               </gap> ſo high hopes as afterwards they effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they forged a form of State ſuitable to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility then, which was to conſtrain the King by the Terror of their Arms to accord to all that ſhould pleaſe them, and wholly to put the Government into their hands; notwithſtanding their Principles then led them to thoſe Concluſions which ſince followed, for they ſuppoſed that the Soveraign Power was inherent in the People, that the People elected the King, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him the Authority that he exerciſed, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to themſelves the Power to aſſume it again when the State ſhould judge it moſt convenient; and to take away the ſword of Juſtice and the <hi>Militia,</hi> to make uſe of it againſt him if there were need. That the King had not the Supream Power but by Paction, which being once broke by him, the Subjects were exempted from their Obedience, That he was onely Depoſitory of the Supremacy, but when the Eſtates were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Supremacy was joyntly poſſeſſed by him and the two Houſes; ſo that the King had but the thirds, and that but very hardly, for they held that the States had a Negative voice, and the King could do nothing without their conſent; and whether the King had the Negative Voice of right they were not ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now ſince God through his ſecret and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Judgments, hath ſuffered the wickedneſs of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100918:45"/>
this Age to have ſucceſs above their deſires, they built upon theſe principles this Concluſion, that the People may judge and execute their King, diſſolve the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie for ever, and turn it into an Ariſtocracy or Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government: for yet they cannot agree to which they ſhould hold themſelves; ſince then they would perſwade us that the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, exempts us from theſe two great dangers; Diſobedience to God, and damning our Souls in reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King; and ſince they would oblige us for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake to oppoſe the King in obedience to God and the higher Powers; and that our Clergie are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to exhort the people, that God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to draw their Swords againſt their Soveraign; there is a neceſſity to ſatisfie our Reaſon, and reſolve our Conſciences hereupon, to enquire whether the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the State be ſuch as they have painted it out to us.</p>
            <p>And for this we have not referred our ſelves to thoſe of the Royal party, but have conſulted with the moſt Judicious Writers of the Covenanters, who paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them as Oracles of the State, expecting that for proof of this form of Government, they would have produced the old Records of the Kingdom, which are now in their Cuſtodie, the ancient Statutes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Teſtimony of their old Hiſtorians; but they alledge no ſuch things, though much preſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by their Adverſaries, onely they make a Diſcourſe in the Air upon the Law of Nature, that hath given to every perſon, and by conſequent to every Eſtate, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for his preſervation; troubling the Ignorant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders brains with barbarous terms, and thorny diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Fullers Anſwer.</note> and extracting the Quinteſſence of the State into an inviſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: They tell us that the Parliament was coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and not ſubordinate to the King; That the three Eſtates of Parliament, whereof the King made one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

fundamental, admitted not of the difference of Higher or Lower: That the power of the King in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was not Royal but Political: That this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law of the kingdom was not written, for if it were it ſhould be ſuperſtructive, and therefore Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not Fundamental: That the mixture of the three Eſtates in Government was not Perſonal but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that underſtand not theſe Myſtical ſentences, ought to be nevertheleſs content; it being not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that they ſhould underſtand them better then the Authors themſelves.

            <p>Now is it not requiſite to ſubtilize upon the virtua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and actuality of the Peoples power, for to inform the Conſcience of the Subject, touching the Juſtice of his Arms againſt his King; but for that there is indeed need both of Divine and Humane Authority, and ſuch as is eaſie, and to be underſtood of all.

the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who after cauſed himſelf to be called <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, having prevailed with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to riſe againſt their lawful King, aſſembled a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, which he made to do whatſoever he would, and having depoſed and impriſoned this poor King, ſoon after cauſed him to be put to death; though this action were as juſt, as it is execrable, yet it would make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, where the Queſtion is, of that which the two Houſes may do, ſeparate from the King; for the depoſing of King <hi>Richard</hi> was by another King ſitting in Parliament; for until theſe laſt States, the two Houſes never thought that they were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing without the Royal Conſent; and ſince, the Parliaments held under the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Uſurper of the Crown, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned the Parliament which had confirmed his uſurpation.</p>
            <p>The other example is no better than this, the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, by the Conſpiracy of his Wife, and the Favourites of this Queen, who ſerved themſelves of a Parliament to execute this wickedneſs, and having depoſed the King, and crowned his Son, who was under age, cauſed the Father to be moſt cruelly put to death in priſon, &amp; yet the authority of the young K. muſt be made uſe of to make the reſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament paſs into an Act; for without the King the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can no more act, than a Body without a Head: But when the young King came to age, he cauſed the Authors and Complices of his Fathers death to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and cauſed all the Acts of this Parliament to be broken by another.</p>
            <p>And leſs than theſe to the purpoſe is, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, concerning the accord the Barons extorted from King <hi>John,</hi> by which this unhappy and imprudent King being reduced to a ſtraight, promiſed to put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the power of twenty five of his Barons, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>Theſe Articles of the Barons were much like thoſe the two Houſes ſent the King to <hi>Beverly, Oxford</hi> and <hi>New-Caſtle</hi>; the Covenanters imitate theſe Barons in their affectation of Piety, for they called their General the Marſhal of the Lords Army, and of his holy Church, and theſe perſwaded their Chiefs that they led the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the Lord of Hoaſts, but theſe transferred not the Crown to another Prince, as the Barons did, but have taken away both his Crown and Life, having long before declared by writing to their King, that they dealt very favourably with him if they did not depoſe him, and that if they did, they ſhould not exceed the Limits of Modeſty, nor of their Duty. This Judgment was pronounced in the Houſe of Commons without contradiction that, The King might fall from his Office, that the happineſs of the Kingdom did not depend upon him, nor the Royal Branches of his Houſe, and that he did not deſerve to be King of <hi>England</hi>: The Authors of theſe Opinions are declared in a Declaration of his Majeſties.<note place="margin">

            <p>HAving no better Authorities in all the Examples of the Ages paſt, they eſtabliſh a New one, which by the unlimited largeneſs, ſupplies what it wants of length of time; for when we require to be governed by the Laws, they anſwer us, that the Parliament is the Oracle of the Laws; that it is for that great Court to declare what is Law and what is not, to interpret the Laws, to diſpenſe with them, or to make new ones.</p>
            <p>That themſelves are the Parliament, excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that ſince they have declared that this War is according to Law, and that ſuch Maximes as they give us, are fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, we muſt remit our ſelves to them, and receive for Law what they ordain.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſtrangers may read, who have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Government of <hi>England</hi>; for to examine this Imperious reaſon, we are obliged to declare here what we know touching the preſent affairs.</p>
            <p>We have learned to acknowledg the Parliament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>England</hi> for the Supream Court of the Kingdom, that can make and unmake Laws, and from whoſe Judgment there is no appeal: But of this Court the King is the principal part, and it's he that renders it ſoveraign; the two Houſes in all their Legiſlative Acts acknowledg him their true and ſole Soveraign, the Houſe of Lords only can evert the Judgment of the Courts of Juſtice,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100918:49"/>
but not their own, without the conſent of the King and the Houſe of Commons; the Houſe of Commons is not a Judicial Court, having not power to adminiſter an Oath, inflict a Fine, or impriſon any, but thoſe of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r own Houſe; and theſe two neither apart nor toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot make a Law; but when they would enact any thing, they both together preſent a Writing to the King in form of a requeſt; if the King approves of them; the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal anſwers for the King in theſe <hi>French</hi> words, <hi>Le Roy le veult,</hi> and then it is made an Act; but if the King refuſeth it, he returns anſwer, <hi>Le Roy S'aviſera,</hi> and the buſineſs paſſeth no further: Before the conſent of the King, the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two Houſes contained in the Writing, is like unto that which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Rogatio</hi>; but when the King grants it, they may then give it the name of <hi>Lex</hi>; and in effect, it is but a requeſt before the pleaſure of the King makes it paſs into a Law, and was never other before this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lawyers call the King the life of the Law, for though the King in Parliament cannot make any Law without the concurrence of the two Houſes, yet nevertheleſs it's his Authority only that gives it the ſtrength and Name of a Law; and they are ſo far from having any Legal Authority in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, without the conſent of the King, that the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary right gives them not ſo much as a Name, neither takes any Cogniſance of them.</p>
            <p>To ſay then that the Parliament hath declared this War lawful, and that the Orders of Parliament are Laws, is by an ambiguous term to abuſe the ignorance of the people; for by the Parliament they underſtand ſomtimes one Houſe, ſomtimes both; and ſomtimes the King and both Houſes together; it's thus that men underſtand them, when they ſpeak of the Supream Court of Parliament, and of Acts of Parliament; for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100918:50"/>
the King was ever accounted the firſt of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, without whom the two other had not power to conclude any thing lawfully, for all their Authority is derived from him, not only for a time, but by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Influence, which being interrupted, the power of neceſſity ceaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her have power to interpret the Laws, to revoke them, and to make others, therein properly lies the Oracle of the Laws. A Judicious Writer of the Royal party, calls the union of the three Eſtates, the Sacred <hi>Tripos,</hi> from whence the Oracles of the Law are pronounced.</p>
            <p>When any one of theſe three are ſeparate from other, the other two ſtagger and are lame, nor cannot ſerve for a firm foundation for the ſafety of the State, and ſatisfaction of the Subjects Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But let us aſſume the buſineſs higher, you cannot more vex our Enemies than to tell them this Truth, that the Monarchy which is at this day, began by Conqueſt, this is that which by no means they will endure to hear of, but would perſwade men that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by an Election and Covenant, which indeed had never any being but in their own Fancies. If they would be believed for this, they ſhould then produce ſome Records. For the bold conjecturers are leſs cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible than all the Hiſtories, which aſſures us of three Conqueſts in this Kingdom, ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> Namely, that of the <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, thoſe that would aboliſh this Office and Dignity, deſtroy that of their own Laws, for all the Lands of the Kingdom are held of the King by right of the Sword, as appears by the nature of Homages and Services that the Lords of Fiefes owe to the King, when <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror took poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſtrengthening the Right of his Conqueſt by the laſt Will and Teſtament of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100918:50"/>
declared himſelf Maſter of all the Land, and diſpoſed of it according to his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>His Son <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt eaſed the People ſomwhat of the ſevere and unlimited Government of his Father, and confirmed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their ancient priviledges, which ſince after long and bloudy wars, were anew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and the Quarrel determined by that wiſe King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, who having as much valour as wiſdom, in condeſcending to the Rights of his Subjects, knew well how thereby to preſerve his own, for after all, the Soveraignty of Kings remained inviolable, and thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ives were preſerved which were only proper to him who is not ſubject but to God alone. Such alſo is the Court of Wards, by which a great many Orphans of the Kingdom are in Wardſhip to the King, and almoſt all the Lands appertaining to him until they be of Age. In this thing the Kings of <hi>England</hi> exceed all other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes. This being ſuch an eſſential mark of abſolute Soveraignty that there cannot be a greater. Certainly, if this Monarchy had begun either by Election or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Subjects would never have given the King ſo vaſt a power over their Eſtates and Families.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the priviledges of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> theſe three are the principal. That the King cannot make a Law without the conſent of his Eſtates. That no Law made in Parliament, can be revoked but in Parliament; and that the King can levy no moneys of his Subjects be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>des his ordinary Revenues, without the concurrence of the Two Houſes, in the intervals of Parliaments; the King according to his Supream Power may make Edicts ſeem burdenſom to the Subjects, or to impair their Laws and Priviledges, they humbly preſent them in the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, &amp; the K. when the complaint appears juſt un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o him, eaſeth them; for to make their requeſts paſs for Acts without the pleaſure of the K. they cannot, neither can the K. make new Acts in Parl. without their conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:100918:51"/>In the mean while, the King makes not them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Authority, but aſſembling them in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he renders them capable to limit his Authority, in Caſes that appertain to their cogniſance; for there are many caſes wherein they are not to meddle at all, in the point of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and for fear they ſhould forget that, even this power they have to limit the King, comes from the Authority of the King, and he can take it away from them when he pleaſeth; for when he breaks up the Parliament, he retires to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Authority that he gave them to limit his; and moreover if they ſtretch their priviledges beyond the pleaſure of the King, he hath power to diſſolve the Parliament, and after the word of the King is paſſed which diſchargeth them, and ſends them away, they have not power to ſit or conſult a minute.</p>
            <p>Whence <hi>Bodinus</hi> (well verſed in the nature of the States of Chriſtendome) concludes the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to have Soveraign Authority; <hi>The Eſtates of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">Bodin. de Repub. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> ſaith he, <hi>cannot be aſſembled nor diſſolved, but by the Edict of the Prince, no more then in</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain; <hi>which proves ſufficiently that the Aſſemblies have no power of themſelves to command or forbid a thing</hi>; and he laughs at the ignorance of <hi>Bellaga,</hi> who affirm the States of <hi>Arragon</hi> to be above their King, and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs confeſſeth the States cannot aſſemble nor ſeparate without him; <hi>Illud Novum &amp; planè abſurdum,</hi> That (ſaith he) is New, and altogether a moſt abſurd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And therefore it was that which occaſioned them, who had a deſign to overthrow Church and State to labour to draw a promiſe from his Majeſty, that the late long Parliament ſhould not be diſſolved without the conſent of both Houſes, well knowing, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that granted, the King when he pleaſed might have overturned their deſigns; which they having obtained,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100918:51"/>
ſhewed by their Actions that they thought themſelves then priviledged to do what they would without his Authority, and thus it is with us at this day.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo it is, that they themſelves do confeſs that this grant did not alter the Nature of the two Houſes, and the Gentlemen of the Parliament have often proteſted that they would not make uſe of this Act of Grace to the diſadvantage of his Majeſty: ſo then if there were no Soveraignty reſident in the two Houſes before this grant, there is no more after, and the pretended Fundamental Laws not written, that parts Soveraignty between the King and his Subjects, yea that tranſport it wholly to the people, are much to be ſuſpected of falſity, ſince they never appear; but ſince the promiſe they obtained of the King (both to his and their great damage) to perpetuate this Parliament as long as they pleaſed, and ſince they have begun to exerciſe the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty by force of Arms. Thus the new Nobility after they had obtained the <hi>Firſs</hi> by right or wrong, produce Coats of Arms and Titles which were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unknown.</p>
            <p>They maintain this their New Soveraignty by a Maxime of <hi>Stephanus, Junius, Brutus, Rex eſt ſingulis Major &amp; univerſis Minor,</hi> That is to ſay (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it) <hi>That the King is the Soveraign of Particulars, but the Repreſentative body of the State is greater then he, and have Soveraignty over him</hi>; and all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (and amongſt others the Obſervator on the Kings Anſwers) attribute Majeſtie to the Commonalty, and not to the King or Supreme; if this be true, it's very ſtrange how this Repreſentative Body of the State, the Parliament, have left it ſo long time to the Kings, the Court of Wards, and many other Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, which they have enjoyed without Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, until that preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>This vile Maxime then being deſtitute of all proofs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100918:52"/>
from the Laws and Cuſtomes of the State, ought to be deſpiſed; but moreover it is alſo void of all reaſon, for if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be ſubject to their King in Retail, are they not in Groſs; if in pieces, not in the whole? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born Subjects, have they power to give the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to their Deputies or Parliament men, and make them Chief? that is to ſay, can they give them that which they have not? And ſeeing alſo that they cannot aſſemble in Parliament without the King or Supreme Magiſtrates Writ; this Writ of the Kings doth it render them forthwith Soveraigns above the King? The ſtile of the Writ calls them, <hi>ad Conſul. andum de quibuſdam arduis,</hi> to conſult with him, about ſome difficult affairs, and not to maſter him, and to diſpoſe of his Authority.</p>
            <p>And ſince they call this great Court, the <hi>Body Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of Subjects,</hi> they muſt needs then be Subjects, otherwiſe they ſhould not repreſent them who ſent them, and that which the King accords to, ſhould be granted to Soveraigns, but his Subjects ſhould receive no benefit thereby: He who will well examine this Propoſition; That the Soveraignty over the Soveraign reſts in the Repreſentative body of Subjects, ſhall find it full of contradictions, and to deſtroy it ſelf.</p>

ſtile of their papers preſented to the King by this Body: <hi>The Two Houſes moſt humbly beſeech their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King, and they qualifie themſelves, the moſt humble and loyal ſubjects of his Majeſty. 'Tis the Preſentative Body of the Kingdome who ſpeaks, and nothing by way of Complement, but Duty.</hi> This Preface hath an excellent Grace in the beginning of a Declaration of the Two Houſes to their King, wherein they tell him, that they deal favourably with him, if they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and that they may do it without exceeding the limits of their Duty and Modeſty. This diſcourſe is like the Locuſts of the bottomleſs pit, <hi>Revelations 9.</hi> which had the faces of men, but the tails of Scorpions; and therefore to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this diſproportion, in their Articles preſented to the King at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> they left out the Qualification of Subjects.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Preface of Statutes do lively expreſs the Nature of the three Eſtates: <hi>The King by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Conſent of the Prelates, Earls and Barons, and at the inſtance and requeſt of the Commonalty hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</hi> For it's the King alone properly that ordains; the Peers as Councellors adviſe and Conſent, the Commons as Suppliants require and ſolicite. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held in the twenty fourth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, ſpeaks thus: <hi>By divers ancient and authentical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and Chronicles, it is manifeſtly declared that this Kingdome of</hi> England <hi>is an Empire, and for ſuch hath been known in the world, governed by one Soveraign Head, having the dignity and Royal greatneſs of the Emperial Crown, to which there is a Body Politick joyned, compoſed of all ſorts and degrees of people, as well Spiritual as Temporal, who are bound next to God, to render unto him Natural Obedience.</hi> If the Body Politick be naturally ſubjected to him as to its Head, it's contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it ſhould be ſubjected to the Body Politick;

Theſe good Subjects, could not find words enough, nor conſult of means ſufficient according to their mind, to defend the Authority of their King, eſteeming (and well they might) that the happineſs and liberty of the Subjects lay in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable power of their Soveraign, that the greatneſs of the State conſiſted in that of the Prince, and that there is no other way to crown the Body, but to place the Crown upon the Head.</p>
            <p>This ſtile is very far from that of the nineteen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions preſented to the King by the Two Houſes in the beginning of the War; which required that all matters of State ſhould be treated of only in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or if the King would treat of any Affairs in his Councel, this Councel ſhould be limited to a certain number, and the old Councellors caſhiered, unleſs ſuch whom it pleaſed the Two Houſes to retain, and that none hereafter ſhould be admitted without their approbation; that the King ſhould have no power in the Education and Marriage of his children without their advice; that all great Officers of the Crown, and the principal Judges, ſhould alwayes be choſen by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100918:54"/>
the approbation of the Two Houſes, or by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel authorized by them; the ſame alſo in Governours of places, and in the Creation of Peers, which hath ſince been denied to the King in effect. And as for the <hi>Militia,</hi> they would have the King wholly put it into their hands, that is to ſay, he ſhould take his Sword from his ſide and give it them, which he could not do without giving them the Crown; for the Crown and the Royal Sword are both of one piece; ſo alſo for the point of Religion, theſe propoſitions take from him all Authority and liberty of judgement, yea, even the liberty of Conſcience; <hi>for they require that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty conſent to ſuch a Reformation as the Two Houſes ſhould conclude upon, without telling him what this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is.</hi> Let all the world here judge if theſe men ſpeak like Subjects; they had reaſon to preſent theſe Articles with their swords in their hands, but the King had more reaſon to draw his to return them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>All theſe propoſitions are founded upon one only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which paſſeth amongſt them for a Fundamental Law, <hi>That the King is bound to grant to the People all their Demands:</hi> but this is a Fundamental in the Ayr, and made void by the practiſe of all Ages ſince <hi>Eng.</hi> was a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and by that Authentical Judgement of the States aſſembled under <hi>Henry</hi> the Fift;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.</note>

            </p>

            <p>The Learned in the Laws tell us, <hi>that to raiſe Troops of Horſe or Foot without Commiſſion of the King, or to lend Aid, is eſteemed and called by the Law of</hi> England, <hi>to levy war againſt the King our Soveraign Lord, his Crown and Dignity:</hi> In this point all that is done without him, is done againſt him, and this is conformable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Right of all Nations; <hi>As for the Royal Eſtate</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bodin.) I believe there is no perſon that doubts that all the Power, both of making Peace and War, belongs to the King, ſince none dare in the leaſt manner do any thing in this matter without the Command of the King, unleſs he will forfeit and endanger his Head.</hi> If the Two Houſes were priviledged to the contrary by any Statute, we ſhould have heard them ſpeak it, but for what they have done, we ſee no other Authority then their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>Therefore none ought to wonder if this their new

practice hath leſs Authority with perſons of a ſound judgement, then theſe practiſes of all ages paſt: and if we cannot perſwade our ſelves that without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King they cannot aboliſh thoſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Authorized by the King, let them not then make ſuch a loud noiſe with the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'Tis in obedience to that Supreme Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that we ſo earneſtly ſtrive to preſerve the Princes Rights: thoſe Acts of Parliament are in full force which have provided with great care to defend the Royal Prerogatives, judging aright, that the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the Pillar of the publick ſafety, and that it cannot be divided without being weakned, and without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the State that reſts upon it; But we leave the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the form of this Eſtate to them who formed it, contenting our ſelves to obey the Laws, until the ſame Authority that made them alters and changes them.</p>
            <p>This Authority being that of the Prince ſitting in Parliament, we hold not our ſelves bound by that which paſſeth in any Houſe or Councel without him, and againſt him, accounting that where the Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhines not, their power is eclips'd; above all ſince the Houſes at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were reduced to the fourth part of their number,<note place="margin">Ut igitur in natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus Capite de truncato reſiduum non Corpus ſed Truncum appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſic in politicis ſine Capite Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus nulla tenus corporatur. <hi>Forteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi>

            <p>BUt was there ever any thing more unreaſonable then this proceeding? They would that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Leſſer part of the Two Houſes without the King, and againſt all former Parliaments, ſhould be received, yea, in their own Quarrel; and that in the Controverſie, whether the King hath Authority above this Aſſembly, or it above him, this Aſſembly will be judge; 'tis for them (they tell us) to declare what is Law, and to make the Law: Now that Aſſembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that their Authority is above the King, that their Arms are juſt, and the Kings unjuſt; and that the Repreſentative Body of the State cannot erre in Law, and that it's your duty to ſtand to their judgement.</p>
            <p>Theſe people would be aſhamed to confeſs where they have learned thus to reaſon: Is it not of him who ſaid, <hi>Dic Eccleſiae, hoc eſt tibi ipſi</hi>; Tell it to the Church, that is to ſay, to thy ſelf; and truly to confute them, we will do them the ſhame, to employ the ſame words we make uſe of againſt him, changing only the perſons.</p>

               </note> one of the Controverſies is, Whether the Two Houſes at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> without the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100918:56"/>

In this Controverſie ſhould the Two Houſes be Judges, they ſhould then be Judges in their own Cauſe, and ſhould be aſſured to gain their proceſs. <hi>Item,</hi> if it be diſputed whether they can erre in this Controverſie alſo, they would judge they could not erre? Should they be Infallible Judges of their Infallibility? Who beholds not in this an evident contradiction? That it muſt be, that he that diſputes whether the Two Houſes can erre, muſt addreſs himſelf to the Two Houſes, as to Judges that cannot erre, to judge this Queſtion; ſo likewiſe in the Queſtion, whether the Authority of the Two Houſes be above the King, it's certain that the Two Houſes cannot be Judges, ſince by this ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion their Authority to Judge is called into doubt, the one pretends, that the difference hath been decided and judged by the Authority of a Soveraign and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judge; it's certain that hereby he renders the wound incurable, the quarrel eternal, and beyond all terms of reconciliation.</p>
            <p>It matters not to ſay, that between two parties that pretend to the Soveraignty; there can be no Judge, but that the ſtrongeſt muſt carry it; for if the two parties deſire peace, they may chooſe Arbiters. The King or Supreme being the Natural Soveraign of his Enemies, and he who gives vigor to the Laws, hath deſired not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that the difference ſhould be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Laws, he pretends not to infallibility: He hath alſo often choſen his Neighbours for Arbiters, and hath fully ſatisfied them by reaſonable offers, and ſuch as are worthy of him; witneſs the Report that the extraordinary Ambaſſadors of the States Generals made to their Lords, for which the Parliament of <hi>London</hi> declared their great diſcontent in writings: The King being to render account of his Actions to none but God alone, ſubmitted himſelf notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

            <head>CHAP. IX. That the moſt Noble and beſt part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment retired to the King, being driven away by the worſer.</head>
            <p>THat which doth ſtrongly perſwade us to believe, that the Priviledges of Parliament, which they would extend even <hi>in infinitum,</hi> have an ill foundation, is becauſe we have ſeen them oppoſed by the better part of the Parliament, both in Quality and Dignity: For beſides the King, an hundred ſeventy five of the Houſe of Commons, and the beſt qualified, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from amongſt them, and of the Lords eighty three, ſo that ſcarcely the third part remained at <hi>Weſtm.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100918:57"/>
Almoſt all the Gentry wholly followed the King; and when we conſider the perſons, the Condition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of thoſe that withdrew themſelves, we cannot ſee that they had any need to fiſh in troubled waters, or to warm themſelves at the Great Fire that began to ſlame, as thoſe had that remained. Without doubt that great Body of Lords and Gentlemen of the Kingdome loved their Liberty, and would never have aſſiſted the King to have obtained an unlimited power, break their Priviledges, and impoſe a perpetual yoak of ſlavery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and their poſterity.</p>
            <p>When need was, theſe Members of Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelves, and the King deferred to their Councels as much as their Priviledges required: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thoſe of the Parliament of <hi>London</hi> were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily vexed, maintaining that the Name and Power of Parliament, was from that time faſtened to the place where they ſate, which is a point that we will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, how ſtrange ſoever it be; but we would have them remember, that they have had their ſitting in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and have not for all that thought they had left their Authority at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; and we dare anſwer for them, that if the Lords and Commons which held with the King, had driven them away, and taken their place, they would ſoon have changed their Opinion.</p>
            <p>Beſides this ſtrong conſideration of numbers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all thoſe who know that the King is the Fountain of Authority, and that without him there is no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Power, then day without the ſun, would never make queſtion which were the true Parliament, that which act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, or that which roſe up and fought againſt him. But alas ſince, force and neceſſity hath conſtrained many poor Lords to return &amp; bow to their unjuſt power.</p>
            <p>It would be too long to relate all the reaſons that moved in the beginning, ſo many perſons of Honour to withdraw themſelves from <hi>London,</hi> in the general they

This baſe multitude might have been frighted and diſperſed by an angry look or word of this great and Noble Houſe of Lords, but this raſcality had friends in the Parliament, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened them to riſe, thereby to make uſe of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: For the ſame day (the ſeditious Rabble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there to ſerve them who ſent for them) the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100918:58"/>
Ordinance to take the Militia from the King, which had twice been caſt out of the Lords Houſe, was again preſented to them the third time by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with threatnings, giving them openly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that if the Houſe of Lords did not joyn with the Commons in point of the Militia, thoſe amongſt them that were of the Commons opinion, ſhould do wiſely to make them publickly known, that ſo they might diſtinguiſh their Friends from their Foes. This being ſeconded by the great cries of the mutinous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about the Houſe of Parliament, the moſt part of the Lords aroſe and left their places, and amongſt the Lords who remained, thoſe who were for the Militia, for fear or otherwiſe, carried it by ſome voices.</p>
            <p>Soon after many of both Houſes withdrew themſelves without ever returning; it was time to part company, when thy could not Vote without hazzarding their lives or Conſciences: For the Names of the Lords and Commons which pleaſed not the Zealous party, were poſted up to make them flee, or to be torn a pieces by the enraged multitude.</p>
            <p>And thus the ſmall party of the two Houſes drave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the greater; as a few Hornets which diſpeoples the whole Hive; being aſſiſted herein by the inſolent, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and meaner ſort of people, which were at their beck, through the Induſtry of ſome ſeditious Preachers of the populous Pariſhes of <hi>London,</hi> where the Browniſts and Anabaptiſts abounded.</p>
            <p>By the ſame Inſtruments the Lords had been before conſtrained to paſs the Ordinance for taking away the Biſhops Votes in Parliament.</p>
            <p>By the ſame Inſtruments alſo the King was driven from his Houſe and chief City, when the Factious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted a peaceable and diſarmed King, arming the people, and manning out Veſſels of War on the Thames, beſieging the Royal Palace, under colour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>But when the honeſt and moſt underſtanding of the City came in a good number to petition the two Houſes to hearken to peace, and ſatisfie the King, they were ſeverely rebuked, as ſeditious; and theſe Gentlemen let them know that they loved no noiſe but of their own making.

            <p>WHo ſo ſhall compare the holy League of <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Covenant, ſhall find that they are ſiſters, daughters of the ſame Father, and that the younger is to the life after the Image of the Elder; in both you ſhall find an Oath of mutual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to extirpate Hereſie, without the Authority of the King, and which at laſt is turned againſt the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: A Jealouſie without ground of the Religion of their Soveraign, and a War of Religion againſt a King of the ſame Religion, which they would make the world believe was a Heretick. A League with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Armies raiſed in the Kingdom againſt their natural Prince, who gave them no other occaſion of the War but his too much Gentleneſs. A King ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to reaſon, offering himſelf to remedy all the grievances of his Subjects, and a people refuſing to admit him to bring a remedy, and reſolved to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without him, the King driven from his chief City, which he had honoured by his ordinary preſence. The fire of civil war blown about by ſeditious preachers. The ſuperſtitious people tributary to the ambition of ſome particulars, weak Conſcience inſtructed to cut the throat of their King, for the love of God, and to gain Paradiſe; faſtings frequent, Devotions doubled, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Inſpirations, Examples of Angelical Holineſs, and all this to perſwade the ſuperſtitious people, that God favoured their Seditions as his cauſe, and that their Leaders took Counſel of none but the Holy Ghoſt, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100918:60"/>
had no other aim but the ſetting up of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt: Writers under pay to write ſcandalous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt their King; the people fed with lies to drain money out of their purſes, one while amazing them with fears where there was none, another while flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with falſe hopes and with forged news: A Parliament in the principal City, but in it a ſmal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who wanting the Royal aſſiſtance, ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by granting liberty to an inveagled people, and by power of rich and fooliſh Citizens. Nobility ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Artificers and Banquerouts bearing the ſway, all Order Divine and Humane overturned, the ancient Laws and Cuſtomes broken, and new fundamental Laws never heard of before, in their places. In brief, it appears at this day, that the Devil marches abroad, and walks in the ſame paths he did about fifty years ſince.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. The Doctrine of the Engliſh Covenanters parallel'd with the Doctrine of the Jeſuits.</head>
            <p>SInce the League of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Covenant were both made upon pretence of Religion, it's not unworthy our paines to conſider the conformity of the Doctrines they employed to maintain both the one and the other, and how the Jeſuits Maximes were the chief ſupport of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Both in the League and Covenant, the people were encouraged to take up Arms againſt their King, by this opinion of Car. <hi>Bellar.</hi> who teacheth,<note place="margin">Bel. de Con. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>19</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that in the Kingdoms of men the power of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100918:60"/>
the K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes from the people, becauſe it's the people that makes the King, and that the people do never ſo transfer their power over to the King, but they retain it</hi> in habitu, <hi>and ſo that in certain caſes they may in effect re-aſſume it again,</hi> which was alſo the judgment of <hi>Navarrus,</hi> whom the Cardinal highly extois.</p>
            <p>And thus alſo the Author of the Obſervations upon the Kings Declarations, who is the <hi>Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> with the Covenanters, teacheth us, <hi>That origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the power is in the people, who are the fountain and efficient cauſe, and that the Authority is not in the Prince, but ſecondarily, and derivatively</hi>: All theſe State Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are full of School terms, but little reaſon; and he adds, <hi>That this Authority founded by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cannot be diſſolved but by that power which gave it conſtitution.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may take away the Kings power and authority when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Another of the Sect, but more antient tells us; <hi>That Princes and Governours have their authority from the people,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gilby</hi> lib. <hi>de obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi> p. 25. &amp; 105.</note> who when they find it convenient, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and take it from them again, as every man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke when he pleaſe his own procuration, or warrant,</hi> but this reaſon ſhall by and by be examined and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal explains himſelf more clearly in that which before he had written in covert Terms, ſaying, <hi>That a King, ſuch as he there deſcribes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarm. l. 3. <hi>De Pontif. cap.</hi> 7. Goodman <hi>p.</hi> 144. and 149.</note> 
               <hi>may, yea ought, by the conſent of all, to be deprived of his Authority</hi>: and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is of his opinion, That evil Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be depoſed, <hi>and that this alone belongs to the inferiour Magiſtrates to put in execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We learn from Doctor <hi>Charron</hi> that the <hi>French</hi>

I have before ſhewed how <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Buchanan,</hi> and the Champions of Covenant, make uſe of the ſame reaſon and expoſition.</p>
            <p>But to clear the way, and make it ſmooth to come to depoſing of Soveraign Princes: Theſe two parties are wont to abſolve their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance. <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> the Jeſuite ſaith,<note place="margin">Emanuel Sa in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce Tyranaus.

               <hi>That its not Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide to kill an excommunicated perſon.</hi> The French League produced two examples in the perſons of their Kings; and this accords with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Buchanan, That Miniſters may excommunicate Princes, and that a King after he is caſt into Hell by Excommunication, is unworthy to live, or to enjoy life upon earth:</hi> But obſerve in paſſing, the Reformed Churches do not teach that the <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio Major</hi> do caſt any perſon into Hell, but onely excludes them from the outward communion of the viſible Church, and in this, as in other things, <hi>Buchanan</hi> hath ſhewed himſelf to be leſs skilled in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, then in Poetry.</p>

               <p>The next time they write to ſtrangers in this ſtile, I counſel them to ſend an Interpreter with their Letter; for this Latine Monſieur <hi>Salmaſius</hi> the Prince of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this age, could not underſtand: And in the mean while, theſe Gray Beards ſhould do well to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome time, when their State-affairs will give them leave, to learn their Grammar, that ſtrangers may not laugh at their childiſh Eloquence.</p>
               <p>And for the preſent they are obliged in Charity (for this their Epiſtle being printed and ſent to ſeventeen States and Churches beyond ſea) to ſome ſtranger, who out of compaſſion ſent it good Latine, but it was a year and half after: 'Tis pity he ſpoil'd their work, for he ſhould have left the form and the matter, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſutable to the other.</p>
               <p>Now ſhould we impute their Latine to their want of knowledge, did they not in this their Epiſtle tell us, <hi>That they were a moſt venerable Company of excellent perſons in Wiſdom, Learning and Piety.</hi> The ſame alſo ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by the Teſtimony of ſome of their company,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100918:67"/>
which were Members of the ſame Aſſembly,<note place="margin">Mulus Mulum fricat.</note> in which the other are not behind them in requital, and in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying their perſons and actions to the Skies.</p>
               <p>It's the old cuſtom of this Faction to commend one another, and when they print any Book, they borrow of one or two of their Friends Epiſtles and Prefaces in commendation of the Work, wherein ordinarily they give the Author exceſſive praiſes: Never did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops aſſume half the Titles that they give one another. As the Dunghil Cocks have the greateſt Combs, ſo the meaneſt ſpirits are moſt arrogant and proud, taking on them many high Titles. A great man in <hi>France</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſuch kind of perſons to the old Writings, full of abbreviations, ſaying, that where there are many Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, there is little Learning.</p>
               <p>But we will labour to decypher their Latine ſo far as may ſerve our preſent purpoſe, for which the laſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter will much help us. They pray the Forraign Churches,<note place="margin">Liceat interim apud Fratres quos ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat haec Epiſtola, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiſſimos innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae noſtrae testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; in ſacris eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum coetibus quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docun<expan>

Muſt the Churches then of <hi>France</hi> for to content them, without conſidering the ſalvation of their ſouls, the ſafety of their perſons, make publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their Aſſemblies for the Covenanters? Preach to the people that their War is lawful and holy? and that after being queſtioned by the Magiſtrates of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, conſtantly maintain that it is the cauſe of God, whatſoever may happen to their Goods, Lives and the profeſſion of the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:100918:67"/>But behold here that which is worſe, in the concluſion of the Oath of the Covenant, which they ſent with their Epiſtle to all the Neighbour Churches, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them earneſtly to take <hi>this Oath or the like:</hi> And above all, they invite thoſe Churches who live under the power of a contrary Religion: The Invitation is in form of a Prayer, <hi>That it would pleaſe God to encline by their examples, the other Churches that groan under the yoke of Antichriſt's Tyranny, to aſſociate themſelves with this Covenant or the like.</hi> For to take then their Summons in their own ſenſe, that is to ſay, That the Churches of <hi>France</hi> to pleaſe them, would make a Covenant againſt their Soveraign; expecting, as a thing which they need not doubt, that the Engliſh Covenanters would overcome their enemies in an inſtant, and would be ready at the day appointed, to ſuccour their Confederates beyond the Seas, with their victorious Armies, before their King juſtly provoked, ſhould ruine them. The Covenanters Declarations, eſpecially in the year 1642. flatter theſe poor Churches with this hope, and through all their diſcourſe clearly reſolv'd to go forth and pull down An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt in all Countries, and make a general conqueſt for Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe are very like the Meſſages that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> ſent to <hi>Munſter,</hi> to make all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in <hi>Germany</hi> to riſe, and all the world if it were poſſible.</p>
               <p>Not that the Leaders of the Covenant conſidering their ſtrength and intereſt, thought themſelves capable of ſo vaſt a deſign, but according to my opinion, they had two ends in making this ſo open a profeſſion: The one, to draw to their party the weak and paſſionate, who in enterpriſes, have regard to the luſtre and promiſe of the deſign, and not to the poſſibility of the execution. Of ſuch ſpirits the great Herd of the world is compoſed, who in the great and publick Motions, ſuffer their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to be bewitched with Poetical hopes, incompatible with the nature of the affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:100918:68"/>Such was the promiſe of another Declaration, which lul'd the imaginations of the adherents, <hi>That this War would bring them deliverance from all their ſufferings and fears,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Scots Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the year <hi>1644.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a new world of joy and peace, which God would create for their conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For this new world of peace and joy which was but three skips and a ſtride off, as they thought,<note place="margin">The Scots now feel it.</note> they found ſuch beſotted ſpirits who caſt themſelves headlong into a Gulph of evils, without bottom or bounds.</p>
               <p>The other apparent end was to gain credit to their party by the applauſe of Forreign Churches, to fortifie themſelves by the powerful aſſociation of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and to try whether the <hi>French</hi> of the Reformed Religion were ſo ill affectionate as to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their King, without ever caring what ſhould come after, when they were once engaged in a war wherein formerly they had ill ſucceſs. And theſe people were ſo void of charity and humanity, that they were content to buy an unprofitable reputation to their party, by the certain ruine of thoſe they invite to alliance with them: As he that cared not to cut down his Neighbours Oak, were it but to make himſelf a pick-tooth.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe that the <hi>French</hi> Churches ſhould have ſuffered themſelves to be gained by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions: In what condition were they in to ſuccour them? Could they have furniſhed Money, Armes, Men and Shipping? Had they the means to put out the Fire, when they had once kindled it? All the Succours that theſe Gentlemen could give them, would be to declare the Votes of the two Houſes, That the Armes of the Churches of <hi>France</hi> were Defenſive and Juſt, and thoſe of their King, Offenſive and Unlawful: Or have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100918:68"/>
his Majeſty fallen from his Dignity and Crown of <hi>France,</hi> as they declared thoſe two Illuſtrious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> Sons of the late King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> excluded from Succeſſion in the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; which Vote ſhall take place, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Covenant ſhall have Conquered the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> by their Armes, in ſpight of the Forces of <hi>France,</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Spains,</hi> and they become ſole Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Empire. Before the Covenanters come to the end of this deſign, a little too far off, theſe brave Princes will have leaſure to make their peace, and many things may intervene, which will induce their Judges to abate of their ſo great ſeverity.</p>
               <p>For to perſwade theſe poor Churches to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong into ruine, the Aſſembly at <hi>London,</hi> in their Epiſtle labour to exaſperate them, by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of all that they had ſuffered, and perſwaded them that all Churches on this ſide, as well as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Seas, were concluded to be ruined by the ſame Agents; that after the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be devoured, they would then fall upon their Neighbours; and that it was not againſt the men, but againſt the profeſſion of the true Religion, and againſt Godlineſs, that their Enemies made War: Whereby they would make the Neighbour Churches believe, that King <hi>Charles</hi> confederated with the Pope to ruine the Reformed Religion, and that after he had diſpatched his own ſubjects, he would do the like to his Neighbours of the ſame Religion.</p>
               <p>There needs no great meaſure of the Gift of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits, to judge by what ſpirit theſe Grave Divines were led, who take ſuch pains to ſend their Brethren to the ſlaughter, within and out of their Kingdome, and to make the Doctrine of the Goſpel a Trumpet of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to arm ſubjects againſt their Princes, and put all Chriſtendome into a flame of bloody and unnatural wars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:100918:69"/>And therefore they had reaſon to confeſs themſelves thus to Forraign Churches, they beſeech them <hi>to excuſe them that they had not writ ſooner, alledging</hi> (according to the ſecond Interpretation of their Friend) <hi>That ſince they were aſſembled, they found themſelves ſo amazed with the Wine of Aſtoniſhment, that God had given them to drink, that they had wholly forgot their duty:</hi> But in the Addition which they diſperſe amongſt all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>they do not acknowledge themſelves only</hi> Attonitos, <hi>amazed, but</hi> Ebrios, <hi>drunken</hi>; and both in the one and the other they had great reaſon. Oh the force of Truth! Oh the wonderful Providence and Juſtice of God, to draw from theſe ſubtil and crafty ſouls, their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation! How is it poſſible that ſo many choice and picked Divines, whereof this Aſſembly was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſhould be ſo blinded, as to let paſs from them ſo ſhameful a Confeſſion in the name of all their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of all their Party, to be divulged through all the Churches of <hi>Europe?</hi> And yet we are herein to praiſe God, that in this their aſtoniſhment, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a little interval, that they came to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to make this acknowledgement.</p>
               <p>They needed not to ſpecifie to us <hi>in what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of their Duty</hi>; their comportments juſtifie their words, <hi>that they had wholly forgotten it.</hi> It appears alſo that they had forgot their duty to God, their King, their Countrey, and to the Church from which they received their Miniſtry, and to which they had ſworn Obedience, and towards them alſo to whom they write: For if they had born any Brotherly affection, they would not have been ſo forgetful as to write to them, and in ſuch a ſtile, and by a publick Declaration. They would have taken heed to render them odious and ſuſpected without cauſe, and to draw upon them perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, from which there could proceed no other fruit, unleſſe to make them Companions in their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100918:69"/>
miſeries; for to render us Companions in their crimes, we hope they ſhall never obtain. But theſe Divines, and their Maſters who employ them, ſhall find themſelves deceived in their deſign, to induce the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> to ſhake off the yoke of their King, under colour of ſhaking off the yoke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
               <p>The fidelity and peaceable converſation of theſe Churches, doth take away even the ſhadow of ſuch things from their Superiours, whoſe juſtice is ſuch, that they will not condemn the Subjects of their King for the offences of ſtrangers, but will be more careful to protect the innocent, then their ill neighbours are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to render them blame-worthy and unhappy. The King and his Councel need not fear the <hi>French</hi> of the Reformed Religion will take the Oath of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to which they are invited with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and craft: For to ſpeak of them in the terms of one of their beloved Paſtors, <hi>They take no Oaths to others, but to their Soveraign Princes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Uſurpation des papes.</note> 
                  <hi>they caſt not their eyes on a ſtranger, they hold that it is not for a Subject to find occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſobedience in the Religion of his Prince, making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a Match to give fire to Rebellion, they are ready to expoſe their lives for the preſervation of their King againſt whomſoever it be, were it one of their own Religion; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould do otherwiſe, ſhould not defend Religion, but ſerve his ambition, and ſhould draw a great ſcandal upon the truth of the Goſpel.</hi> This is the Doctrine wherein they are inſtructed; this is the Profeſſion in which all good <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of the Reformed Religion will live and die.</p>
               <p>But if ſtrangers, whoſe heads run round with the wine of aſtoniſhment, will force the Churches of <hi>France</hi> to drink of their Cup, they will uſe the <hi>French</hi> freedome, refuſe to pledge them, and behold their zeal to preſs them to do as they do, with deſpite and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100918:70"/>
compaſſion: Let them not think it ſtrange that they run not with them into the ſame exceſs of riot, they do not offend them, for whilſt they have this ſtrong wine in their heads, they keep their ſobriety, and are filled; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching God to ſhew mercy upon thoſe who would ſeduce them. Now as it is the cuſtome of drunken perſons, who would draw others into the ſame exceſs with themſelves, and to drink according to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to make them believe that they have ſeen them themſelves in that condition; ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to defend their actions, and augment their Party, alledge very often to the <hi>French</hi> Churches their wars for Religion, the remembrance whereof is very ſad; and to uſe this Argument to ſeduce them, is no other thing then to counſel them to be miſerable becauſe they have been ſo, and to go with their eyes ſhut, and run the remains of their broken veſſel againſt the rock where they were ſhipwrackt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, its very unjuſt in them to impute to the whole body the actions of a party; for in the late wars all the Churches on this ſide the River <hi>Loyre,</hi> continued in their obedience, and very neer the half of the other Churches. The people were carefully preſerved in their duties by their faithful Paſtors. This holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which condemns the reſiſting of higher powers, and commands to wait patiently deliverance from God, and to ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, was moſt preſſed and urged in their Churches; and whilſt ſome of the Religion were in Arms during the minority of the King, they preached at <hi>Paris, Their ſtrength was to ſit ſtill.</hi> Iſai. 30.7.</p>
               <p>There fell lately into my hands an Epiſtle well penn'd, which was ſent to the State-Aſſembly of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> in the beginning of their ſitting, to encline them to peace, and the obedience of his Majeſty. Behold here a paſſage of it.</p>

                  <hi>I think it very profitable for you to be informed the truth, what the opinions and diſpoſitions of our Churches are, by perſons that have a particular knowledge of them: You are now debating (Gentlemen) of the ſeparation of your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly for to obey his Majeſty, or of its ſubſiſtence, and to give order to your affairs; I am bound to tell you, that the general deſire of our Churches is, that it would pleaſe God to continue peace unto us under the obedience of his Majeſty, and that ſeeing the King is reſolved to employ his Armies to make you obey, they promiſe themſelves ſo much of you, that you will do what poſsibly you can to avoid this tempeſt, and yield rather to neceſsity, then enter into a war, wherein the ruine of a great part of our Churches are certain, and into a trouble wherein we may behold the entrance, but cannot ſee the iſſue, and that ye will take away the pretext from them who drive on the King to fall upon us. Thoſe that fear God deſire that if we muſt be perſecuted, it ſhould be in bearing the Croſs of Chriſt, and for the profeſsion of the Goſpel. In brief, I aſſure you that the greateſt and beſt part of our people deſire you to decline this unjuſt enterpriſe.</hi>

               <p>Here is not the Authority of a Single Perſon, 'tis the teſtimony of <hi>the greateſt and beſt part</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>France,</hi> 'tis a general Declaration of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of thoſe <hi>amongſt them who feared God,</hi> that the duty of Chriſtians perſecuted is, <hi>to bear the Croſſe,</hi> not Arms. It's then very falſly and injuriouſly done, that the example of the <hi>French</hi> Churches ſhould be ſo often and importunately alledged by the Covenanters to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Subjects reſiſting their Sovereign, ſince that ever in the time of war, the greateſt and beſt part were againſt it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>French</hi> Divine, who loved both his Religion and King, found himſelf ſo prick'd by this reproach made to the generality of his Party, that he prayed us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert here this expreſſion of his judgement, and of the ſoundeſt part of the Churches of <hi>France.</hi> The war for

Religion in this Kingdome is a wound yet freſh, and ye can hardly touch it, but ye will hurt it, and make it ſmart; and its very ſore againſt my will that I muſt touch it: But I am conſtrained to it, by the frequent Declarations of the Covenanters, who have nothing ſo ſtrong nor ſo frequent for to move the people to take up Arms againſt their King, as to propoſe to them the example of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, as a pattern which they ought and are bound to follow. Would to God that in leaving us there, they would have given us liberty to hold our peace; but ſince they will not give over pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing abroad, and making all places ring with our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, the remembrance whereof we rather deſire ſhould be for ever buried, ſince they impute the actions of ſome few to the generality of our Churches, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Religion it ſelf; and ſince that they alledge our errors, for to exhort us to return to them again, and ſince they change the ſubject of our repentance and ſorrow, into rules for their imitation, and into precepts of the Goſpel. Is it not now high time to ſpeak, and prefer the Intereſt of Gods Glory, and of the Truth of his Word, above the credit of men whatſoever they be, yea, and of our own too. <hi>Let God be true and every man a Liar,</hi> Rom. 3.4. <hi>Confeſs thy fault, and give glory to the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> Jo. 7.19. <hi>Mr.</hi> Rivet <hi>was not aſhamed to call theſe our ſtirrings, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam noſtrorum,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:100918:71"/>It would be a great honor for the Churches of <hi>France</hi> with one conſent publikely to declare that they judge all wars of Subjects againſt their Soveraign, unlawful, and to exhort their Brethren of <hi>England</hi> to Obedience and fidelity to their Prince, then for to preſerve the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of ſome of their party, and ſuffer their actions to ſerve as ſnares to the weak conſciences of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and of pretext to thoſe who labour to corrupt the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>

Our Churches look upon the predictions of the fall of Antichriſt, and the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, as objects of their Hope, and not as Rules of their Duty. They govern not themſelves by Propheſies, but by Commands, and make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of tranſgreſſing the Laws of God, out of zeal to advance his Kingdom; ſo leaving to God the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his counſels, we keep our ſelves in a peaceable obedience to our Sovereign; and in doing that we yield obedience to God, who commands, <hi>to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. and <hi>to pray for Kings, and for all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and honeſty, for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God, and our Saviour,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the firſt King that was raiſed in the world, namely <hi>Nimrod,</hi> was raiſed by violence, and not by the ordinance of God.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That Emperors and Kings are eſtabliſhed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ways, whether they come to the Crown by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary ſucceſſion, or by election, ſince there is no extraordinary revelation, nor no rule in the Word of God, that a Nation are bound to follow rather Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is hereditary, than that which is by Election.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is no expreſs command of God, to obey <hi>Henry</hi> rather than <hi>Lewis,</hi> or to acknowledge this man rather than that for King.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That for theſe conſiderations, the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> calls our obedience to Kings, an Ordinance of man; ſaying, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, or unto Governours,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2.15.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ordinary reaſons of the Covenanters, if they ſhould diſavow them, their Books would witneſs againſt them, for they are full of them.

They object to us alſo, that the moſt part of the Empires and Kingdomes, have had their beginning by Conqueſt and violence, and therefore not by the Ordinance of God: And that if the Conqueror had invaded the Country of another, by the Ordinance of God, the Inhabitants of the Country had offended God in oppoſing and reſiſting him. Upon which, I ſay, that thoſe Inhabitants in a Country whom a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100918:78"/>
ſtrange Prince will invade, do well to oppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, and if in this defenſive war, the Uſurper is ſlain, he is juſtly puniſhed. But if he become Maſter of them, and if all the ancient Poſſeſſors of the Kingdome are extinguiſhed, and the States of the Country aſſembled contrive a new form of State, and all the Officers throughout the Kingdome give to the new King an Oath of Fidelity, then we muſt believe, that God hath eſtabliſhed ſuch a Prince in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; then, I ſay, the people ought to ſubmit to the Will of God, who for the ſins of Kings and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, transfers Kingdomes, and diſpoſeth of the events of Battels according to his good pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It matters not to ſay, that Princes, who enter Kingdomes by Hereditary Succeſſion, or by Election, come in by wayes introduced by Cuſtome, and not by the Ordinance of God: For the Queſtion is not by what wayes or means a Prince comes to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but whether, if being once eſtabliſhed by the Ordinance of God, we are bound to obey him? Our Adverſaries indeed would have the Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of Divine Right, although the Members of Parliament enter by Election, and oft-times by cloſe and under-hand dealing, and by ſome crafty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balle.</p>
               <p>Let them hold that the Parliament is by Divine Right; it appears by their authentique Catechiſme, that they teach us this Doctrine:
Page 5. <hi>It's a groſs error to ſay, that the King is the Supreme Power, but that power appertains to the Soveraign Court of Parliament, which not to obey, is to reſiſt the Ordinance of God:</hi> But let us hearken to a better Author.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That if there be no Command in the Word of God to obey <hi>Henry</hi> rather then <hi>Lewis, &amp;c.</hi> It's ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that there is a command for to obey the King, and a command to keep our Oath and Fidelity we have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100918:78"/>
ſworn, and by conſequence to be faithful to the King to whom we have taken the Oath of Allegiance. There is no more command of God found to injoyn us particularly to obey the Parliament that began <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> the third, 1640<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which nevertheleſs, our adverſaries, accounted themſelves to be ſubject by Divine Right. So that if this conſideration ſhould take place, it would follow, that none of them that are now in the world, are obliged by Divine Right, to fear God, or to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the Scripture hath not particularly appointed <hi>Thibalt, Antony</hi> or <hi>William,</hi> that they ſhould fear God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt; It ſufficeth that the Word of God contains Rules, which bind particulars without naming them.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> truly in the place before cited calls the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we owe to Kings, a humane Ordinance, and that either becauſe Kings command many things, which in their nature are not of Divine Right, as their commands which forbid wearing of gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or the like things on their apparrel, or becauſe they attain this power by certain humane means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by cuſtome, which notwithſtanding hinders not but their power may be founded in the Word of God, when they are once eſtabliſhed; for as we ſaid before, the Queſtion is not of the means by which a Prince comes to the Kingdome, but what Obedience is due to him, after he is once inſtaled. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> after he had called this Ordinance an humane Ordinance, commands us to ſubject our ſelves for the Lords ſake, and to obey his command.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever makes the Authority of Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the inſtitution of men, and not upon the Ordinance of God, leſſens their Majeſty more then three quarters, and takes from them that which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures their lives and Crowns, more then their Guards,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100918:79"/>
or mighty Armies, which plants in the Subjects hearts, Fear inſtead of Love and Reverence. Then the fidelity and obedience of Subjects will be firm and laſting, when it ſhall be incorporated with piety, and accounted a part of Religion, and of the ſervice we owe to God.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This foundation being over-turned, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Kings is but an humane Ordinance, that which they build upon it, muſt neceſſarily fall; for to reaſon thus, that the people may take away their Authority from the King, becauſe they gave it him, is to prove one abſurdity by another; as if one ſhould prove the Moon might be burnt, becauſe its made of wood. For to ſay the people gave the power to the King, is to imagine that which never was, no not in Kingdomes which are Elective. The People give not the King his Authority, for they cannot give that they have not, but he defers his obedience to <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Charles.</hi> But this Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected, receives his Authority from God, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ſource from whence all power flowes. <hi>By me Kings Raign, Pro.</hi> 8.15. <hi>And there is no Power but of God, Rom.</hi> 13.1. None ought therefore to take this Power which God hath given him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Wife choſeth her Husband, and gives him a promiſe of obedience in marriage, but it is not ſhe that gives him his Authority, that comes from above: And there is as great an abſurdity to ſay, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may depoſe the King, becauſe they chuſe him, as to affirm, that the Woman may put away her Husband, or ſubject him to her, when ſhe ſhall judge expedient, becauſe that ſhe made choice of him: For the woman loſeth the liberty of her choice by the bond of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the People likewiſe loſe the liberty to revoke their choice when the Prince Elected is declared King. 'Tis a ſtrange conſequence to ſay that the people may take away the Kings Authority, becauſe they have ſworn
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100918:79"/>
obedience to him, the Election is no other thing. And it's a reaſon that overthrows it ſelf, to ſay that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may take from the King his Authority, becauſe they gave it him: For put the caſe that it were true that the people gave Authority to the King whom they Elect; ſince then the people have given away their Authority, 'tis no more in them. This maxime being once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is lawful for every one to take back again what he hath given, it would break the Laws of Society, and fill the world with injuſtice and confuſion: But let our enemies know, that although the Authority of the King had not begun, before the Oath of Allegiance, which this Parliament took in a Body at the beginning of their ſitting, yet the Body of the State made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an irrevocable gift of their obedience to the King, and from this Oath we draw a better conſequence then theirs; namely, that they cannot diſpoſe of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſince they have given it to the King: So that were their reaſons good, they would be of no force, but in Kingdomes which were Elective, and make nothing againſt King <hi>Charles</hi>; for neither he, nor any of the Kings his Anceſtors in all ages paſt, ever came to the Crown by Election.</p>
            <p>It's not to purpoſe to alledge the Oath the King took at his Coronation, as an agreement and paction made with his people, equivalent to an Election; for the King receives not his Kingdome at his Coronation, he is King before his Crown is put on, and therefore <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> who conſpired againſt King <hi>James</hi> of glorious memory, were juſtly condemned as guilty of High Treaſon, although they alledged that the King was not then Crowned, and it was judged by the Court, that the Crowning was but a ceremony, for to make the King known to his people.</p>
            <p>It's the like alſo in <hi>France, I judge</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bodin) that no man doubts but the King enjoyes before his Anointing,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100918:80"/>
the poſſeſsion and propriety of his Kingdome.</hi> Before this ceremony, the King enjoyes as fully all his Rights as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and according to the Laws of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the King never dies, whilſt there remains any of the Royal Blood, for in the ſame hour that the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, the lawful Heir is totally inveſted of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherefore the Eldeſt Sonne of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who was murthered by his Uncle <hi>Richard,</hi> is by general conſent numbered amongſt the Kings, and named <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, although he never wore the Crown, nor took any Oath, nor exerciſed any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was not Crowned but in the ninth year of his Reign, and yet before his Coronation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were attainted of High Treaſon, which could not have been done, if he had not been acknowledged King.</p>
            <p>In the Oaths of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> at their Coronation, there is no image of ſtipulation, covenant or agreement betwixt them and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. They receive not their Crowns upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and their people owe their obedience, whether they perform or violate their promiſes. This Oath is a laudible cuſtome, profitable to bear up the Authority of the Prince, by the love of his Subjects, and to give to the people this ſatisfaction, that the King whom God hath given them, hath an intention to govern them with Juſtice and Clemency, and to preſerve their Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>If the King by his Oath ſhould bind himſelf to fall from the Right to his Kingdome, when he ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Promiſes, he would then be leſſer after his Oath then before; and ſurely if the Kings did believe they ſhould diminiſh their propriety by their Oath, they would never take it; and to ſhew that their Authority depends not of their Oath, but their Oath of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> form it at their pleaſure.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100918:80"/>
Very hardly ſhall you find three that have taken the ſame Oath without changing ſome things. That which was preſented to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which is to be ſeen in the Rolls, was corrected by his own hand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlined.</p>
            <p>And moreover, the Oath is made to God, and not to the People, and binds the Conſcience of the Prince, but doth not limit his Soveraignty; if the intention of this ſolemnity were to make a ſtipulation or agreement with the people, the people at the ſame time ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take a reciprocal Oath, and in a paction of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, there ſhould alſo paſs ſome publick contract, things which are not practiſed; ſo that hereby it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears, that this imagination of the enemies of Monarchy, have not any foundation neither in Law nor Cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Some perſons think they ſpeak very finely, in ſaying that the Authority of the King is an Uſurpation of the Sword, confirmed by Cuſtome, &amp; that if they could gain their liberty by the ſword, and confirm it by cuſtome, their Right would be as good as his; and upon this they Phyloſophy upon the Reſolutions of States, which are in the hand of God, and teach us to follow the courſe of his Providence.</p>
            <p>But by ſpeaking thus they commit a double errour, againſt conſcience, and againſt prudence.</p>
            <p>As for conſcience, the antient conſtitution of the State confirmed by ſo many ages, Statutes, Oaths of Allegiance, do ſuffice to learn all Chriſtians that live under this Monarchy, that it was God that eſtabliſhed it, and that by the command of God, they are bound to defend the State under which they are born, and whom the Body of the Kingdome hath ſworn to maintain. Theſe diſcourſes of following the Providence of God in matters of Revolutions of States, are then only ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, when the Royal Blood is extinguiſhed, or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100918:81"/>
when Uſurpation hath gained preſcription through length of years, but not when they are neer to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Eſtate, and ruine the King; theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are good when the evil is done, and out of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but not when they are acting ill, and when the obedience and loyalty of the ſubjects may remedy all. The providence of God will never ſerve for excuſe of the wickedneſs of men; let us do that which we ought to do, and leave God to do what he pleaſeth; and above all, theſe moralities of revolution of States are worſt in their mouths, who labour to make this revolution in the State, for it's their duty to prevent this revolution with all their power; poſterity may excuſe themſelves by the providence of God in following a new form of State, whilſt thoſe that introduced it, ſhall be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, there is a great want of prudence in this reaſoning, for in quarrelling the Rights of the King as uſurpations of violence and cuſtome, they teach the King to quarrel at their liberties and priviledges for the ſame reaſon; yea, and by one much greater, for the Priviledges of Parliament are much newer then the Royal Authority, and the King may ſay they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by force after many long and bloody wars: he might caſt off all preſcription gained upon the unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power of the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, and put himſelf into all the rights of their Conqueſts by another. Wiſe ſubjects who would keep their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,<note place="margin">Neque unquam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertas gratior extat quam ſub Reg.

Under a Royal Eſtate the principal means to preſerve the peoples liberty, is to maintain the only authority of the King; dividing it amongſt many, they do but multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Maſters: For its better to have one evil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then many good ones.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. How the Covenanters have no reaſon to invite the Reformed Churches, to their Allyance, ſince they differ from them in many things of great importance.</head>
            <p>WE wonder exceedingly how our Enemies dare ſolicite the Reformed Churches to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them: From whence comes this great familiarity? Is it becauſe of their great reſemblance one with another? Its that we cannot find. As for obedience due to the King, which is the principal point of the Covenanters, we have made it already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Divines of the Reformed Religion are as contrary to the Covenanters, as they are to the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This point being denied them, they care not much for the ſociety of any Church in other points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. This is the firſt and great Commandment of the Covenant, to obey the people againſt their King, maintain but this their fundamental maxime, and they will give you leave to chuſe your Religion, but in many other things this faction differ from the Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Doctrine of the Lords Day, they have a great quarrel againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> who is ſo far from conſtraining the Church to a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> obſervation of the Sabbath, that he accounts that the Church is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the keeping of the ſeventh day, a paſſage which

            <p>Although God hath no need of the errour of men to eſtabliſh his ſervice, we ſo much love the reverence due to that holy day, that we would not lightly quarrel at any thing thereupon. Let every one enjoy his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo that God may be ſerved, and the day which is dedicated to him, be not violated, neither by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs nor ſuperſtition.

when they pleaſe. 'Tis that which they do without naming them, then when they reject, as groſs idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the obſervation of the memory of the daies dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Nativity, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, and the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt into the Church. Behold here the Opinion and Practiſe of the Reformed Churches, declared by that Godly and Learned <hi>Feſtus Hominius,</hi>

               <hi>Its a thing of very great profit to the edification of the Church, to commemorate and preſs ſolemnly to the people at certain ordinary times the principal manifeſtations of God, and his moſt ſignal Benefits to his Church, ſince that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, even in the times of the Apoſtles, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certain daies to the Anniverſary Celebration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and ſending of the Holy Spirit. Its very well done to retain the practiſe of the ancient Church in a thing which is not ſimply indifferent, but ſingularly profitable to edification, provided that none attribute ſuperſtitiouſly any Sanctity to be in the daies; and impoſe not upon the conſciences of Chriſtians a yoke of abſolute neceſſity, contrary to the Liberty of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our new Reformers cannot affirm in ſincerity that the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> attributed any Inherent Sanctity to be in the daies, or made uſe of them to impoſe a yoke of abſolute neceſſity upon their conſciences, there was no need then to aboliſh them with ſuch rigour, not to ſcandalize ſo many pious ſouls, nor reſiſt a vain fear of ſuperſtition by inſolence and prophaneneſs, which is a remedy worſe then the evil. The day of the Nativity in the year 1644<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was changed by an expreſs publick Order into a Faſt, which was the firſt time ſince the Apoſtles that there was any Faſt kept that day in the Chriſtian Church, and becauſe many would not Faſt, they ſent Souldiers into their houſes a little before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to viſit their Kitchins and Ovens, who carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

            <p>And as for Eaſter day, on which and the daies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the people are enjoyned by Act of Parliament to receive the Bleſſed Sacrament; the devotion of the people in many places have been oppoſed by violence. We have heard of a Pariſh, where by main force the Bread and Wine was taken away from the people, who were aſſembled at Church for this holy action. Behold their wayes to change the times, and to reform abuſes, which is to reſiſt a ſuppoſed ſuperſtition, with a true and manifeſt one, and to make Sacriledge fight for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Lets paſs to other differences: The Reformed Churches do not believe as they, that all ſignificant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies excepting in the Sacraments, are unlawful; for then, it would follow that to keep off the Hat, and kneel at Prayer, ſhould be unlawful, for theſe are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which ſignifie reverence; whence many of the Covenanters for this reaſon refuſe to put off their Hats, or kneel at prayer, without being taken notice of, and reproved by authority.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Reformed Churches do not believe as they, that to be tyed to written prayers, or forms of prayers in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, is to binde the Spirit of God, many of the Covenanters are come ſo far as to call the uſage of forms of prayer idolatry; yea, even the uſe of the Lords Prayer, which the moſt part of this faction refuſe to ſay; although by a ſpecial priviledge its permitted the Miniſter by their Directory to make uſe of it if he pleaſe; for its not commanded him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100918:84"/>According to this Directory (as they call it) that is to ſay, an inſtruction how the Miniſter ſhould govern himſelf in the Church. The Miniſter muſt not ſay the Apoſtles Creed, nor repeat the ten Commandments of God, whereby the people ſhall be without any form of what they are to believe, or what they are to do; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the families of moſt part of this faction, they reach no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their children neither the Creed, the Lords Prayer, nor the ten Commandments; and as for the children which have learned theſe holy forms, they teach them to forget them: Above all things, they take a ſpecial care that the Miniſter tyes not himſelf to any form of words, as a thing of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and which hath a taint of Antichriſt. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward then there will be no uniformity in the Divine Service, nor no more help for the infirmity of aged Miniſters, nor for the underſtanding and memory of ſimple and dull Auditors, who cannot comprehend at the firſt aboard what the Miniſter ſaith, but had need to be well accuſtomed to him.</p>
            <p>Alſo there will be no more bounds to devour phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical ſpirits, which is the principal vice of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Every Church will have a particular Order, or rather will have none at all; for the Paſtor hath liberty to alter it every time he pleaſes, nothing being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den but to make uſe of the long eſtabliſhed forms, by the Authentical Acts of many Parliaments, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the publick devotion of ſo many years; and compoſed by the firſt Reformers, perſons excellent in piety and wiſdome, whoſe books theſe are not worthy to carry after them.</p>
            <p>If theſe Directors had had any fear of ſcandalizing the Churches, whom they invited to aſſociate with them, they would never have aboliſhed the cuſtome received in all the Reformed Churches, and generally in all the Chriſtian Churches of the World, who have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100918:84"/>
certain forms for the publick Service of God. If they had born any reſpect to Antiquity, and to the univerſal conſent of the Chriſtian Church in all ages, and in all places, they would not have begun in this age a cuſtome ſo prodigiouſly ſingular, as to baniſh out of the Church all forms and orders of prayers, the Apoſtles Creed, and the ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>There reſts yet ſome Liturgies of the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Hymns uſed in the Publick Service, as the eighteenth Canon of the Councel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> That the form or Liturgy of prayers Morning and Evening ought alwayes to be the ſame. There hath not, nor ever was there a Church, who had not ſome forms of prayers, but above all for the higher Powers, but that being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed in <hi>England</hi> by the Directors, we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if many Miniſters of the new Edition have long ſince forgot to make mention of the King in their prayers, and thoſe that pray for him, do it in odious terms, thruſt on by a perverſe and malignant zeal, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God a long ſtory of the ſins they impute unto their King, as if they would poure all their choler into the Boſome of God. If any amongſt them ſhould thus pray for his Father in the Pulpit, Lord grant Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to my Father of all his extortions, perjuries, thefts, murthers and adulteries, they would account him a fool, or exceedingly wicked, but againſt their King all things were permitted. Behold the fruits of aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Service, and the liberty of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Spirits of the times, fomented by publick order.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. Of Aboliſhing the Liturgy, in doing whereof, the Covenanters oppoſe the Reformed Churches.</head>
            <p>AMongſt their reaſons for the Aboliſhing ſuch good prayers in this time of Rebellion, this none of the leaſt, becauſe in the Liturgy there are divers clauſes which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each the people the Soveraignty of their Prince, and the obedience they owe unto him. There the King is called <hi>our moſt Gracious Soveraign</hi>: This would give the Miniſter the Lie, if after that he ſhould call him a moſt cruel Tirant, as it was their cuſtom: There they pray, <hi>that it would pleaſe God to ſtrengthen the King, that he might overcome all his enemies,</hi> which were to pray to God for the ruine of their holy Covenant: there God is called <hi>the only Governour of Princes,</hi> which would contradict the Doctrine and Practiſe of the times, which gives other Governours to Princes beſides God, and ſubject the King to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>There they pray to God that the Subjects of the King may <hi>duly conſider whoſe Authority he hath,</hi> namely Gods. If his Subjects duly come to conſider this, they would lay down their Arms which they had taken up againſt him, for fear of fighting againſt God, and would reject the inſtruction taught them, that the King holds his Authority of men.</p>
            <p>There they pray that the Subjects of the King <hi>may faithfully ſerve, honour, and humbly obey him,</hi> a prayer of a moſt dangerous conſequence, and would utterly ſpoil the affairs of the Covenanters, if the Lord ſhould hear them. There they alſo pray, the Lord would ſo bleſs the King, <hi>that under him we may be godly and quietly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,</hi> but it is not <hi>under him</hi> but <hi>without him,</hi> that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100918:85"/>
they would govern us, there being not according to their ſaying, any means to live godly and quietly under his obedience.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner they pray for <hi>all thoſe who are eſtabliſhed in authority under him</hi>; but according to the form of the State turned the bottom upward, as the Presbyterians would have it, they muſt now pray for all thoſe eſtabliſhed in <hi>authority over him.</hi> 'Tis alſo a moſt dangerous clauſe in that ſame Prayer, which prays <hi>to God to puniſh all wickedneſſe and vice, and to preſerve true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety.</hi> For if this Prayer were once heard, the Zealots of the State who draw their ſwords againſt the King, and the Preachers of Rebellion, would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to make their Speeches to the people on the Gallowes, and their hypocriſie would be unmaſqued, and they rendered the publick object of contempt and ſcorn, and the Browniſt and Anabaptiſt ſent into the Iſlands of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo the Prayer <hi>that God would give peace in our daies,</hi> would be very unſuitable to the Intentions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, who preach no other thing in ſubſtance, then that Text ill applied, Curſed <hi>is he that withholds his ſword from ſhedding blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have therefore voted it a point of prudence to lay aſide the Liturgy out of their way, which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their politick intentions; as for Conſcience and the Government of the Church, which is diſlocated and diſmembred by this Abolition of the Divine Service, they will then conſider of, after theſe Gentlemen have ſerved themſelves of the general diſorder, to build themſelves an Empire in the confuſion.</p>
            <p>Its moſt certain that in this change God is far worſe ſerved, there are indeed ſome certain Miniſters capable without the Divine Service, to make prayers full of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and truly every Miniſter of the Goſpel ought thus to be prepared, but how many are there amongſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100918:86"/>
them who for lack of being tied to certain prayers in publick, abuſe the patience of God and holineſs of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:<note place="margin">Charenton the name of the Protestant Church at Paris.</note> If the Judicious Auditory at <hi>Charenton,</hi> ſhould but hear what tales and news theſe people tell God, the inſolent familiarity whereby they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and reaſon with him, their Maledictions againſt their King, their humorous, mad and phantaſtical tricks, which paſs for ſallies of zeal, they would mark out lodgings for them in the <hi>petites Maiſons</hi> (with us here called Bedlam) which might exempt them from the <hi>Chatelet</hi> (but with us from New-gate.)</p>
            <p>Certainly as Liberty ought not to be a Cloak of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs, ſo it ought not to be a door open for folly. The Libertine and capricious humour of the Climate in matter of the Service of God, ſhould have taught theſe Directors to have reſtrained this licentiouſneſs rather than to have let looſe the rains, and the importunity of thoſe that demanded this liberty, ſhould have the more induced them to refuſe it. But what? thoſe who accorded this moſt pernicious liberty, were the ſame perſons who only demanded it.</p>
            <p>The prophane contempt wherewith they uſed this ſo holy Liturgy, ought not to be imputed to the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Souldiers, but unto the Inſtructions which were given them. The Parliaments Souldiers Catechiſme publiſhed and recommended by ſpecial Authority, teacheth them to tear it a peeces whereſoever they find it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. Calling it a moſt Abominable Idol, and a Nurſe of Ignorance and blindneſs, which foments an Idle, Lazy and diſſolute Miniſtry, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould reduce it to Aſhes, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Braſen Serpent, as the occaſion of much evil and an object of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing in ſo great a change they oppoſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of their Church, and that for one whom
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100918:86"/>
they pleaſe hereby, they offend more than a hundred.</p>
            <p>They labour to turn the eyes of the ignorant people towards the Churches beyond the Seas, hoping as well they might, that looking ſo far off, they could not know what they did. The Authors of the Directory affirm,<note place="margin">In the Preface to the Directory.</note>

This advertiſement might well be turned into a Propheſie, and theſe perſons who falſly alledge the Reformed Churches are offended with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of <hi>England,</hi> repent too ſoon that they had not followed their exhortations, and ſubmitted themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now the King hath offered to exempt tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from the obſervation of certain things which offend them; yea to ſubmit the whole Reformation to a lawful Synod: But in ſtead of receiving this Gracious offer of his Majeſty, they perſecute him and his Clergy with all violence; manifeſting thereby that it is not our Reformation, but our deſtruction which is capable to content them, and theſe tender Conſciences which tremble at the ſight of a Surplice, or the ſound of an Organ, are ſtrong and luſty enough to commit murder and Sacriledge; like the Phariſees, who ſtrained at a Gnat, and ſwallowed a Camel.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty made a Declaration to all the reformed

Where is their ſincerity? Do they hope by theſe wicked waies to draw down a bleſſing of God upon their cauſe? The Truth which they pretend to advance, muſt it be eſtabliſhed and ſet up by lying?</p>
            <p>By all this then it appears that their long experience comes to nothing, but if they are wanting in the old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, let them produce the new. Where are the Forreign Churches that require of them the abolition of the publike Service? Would they could cauſe them to ſpeak for themſelves: By Forreign Churches they cannot underſtand the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church; for ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this war, the Covenanters would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for ſtrangers, for fear of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for inviting and bringing in Forreign Forces, and keeping them under pay in the Kingdom. And as for other Churches, we account the experience of the Authors of the Directory do not much exceed ours: Now we have not known any Proteſtant ſtranger ever made it any difficulty to joyn in the publick prayers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> except ſome walking Anabaptiſts, as in <hi>London</hi> they have lately made to appear; and neither

            <p>To this grave counſel of S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> adds a Character to the life, of the imperious and ſcrupulous humour of our melancholy zealots, whom one would think had an intention to paint them out: <hi>I have oft perceived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with much grief and ſorrow, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weak and infirm perſons have been much troubled through their Contentions, wilfulneſs and ſuperſtitious fearfulneſs at ſome of their Brethren, for doing ſome things which could not be certainly defined by the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, nor by the tradition of the univerſal Church, nor by the utility that might thereby come for the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and amendment of our lives; only becauſe there is ſome matter for their conceptions to reaſon and diſcourſe upon, or becauſe they think the farther they go, or are able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from the Cuſtoms received, is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and neareſt to perfection, moving ſuch litigious and idle Queſtions, that they make appear to all, that they will never allow of any thing well done unleſs they do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>

Therefore the Directors refute themſelves by a manifeſt contradiction, then when by their publike Declaration they tell the people, that it is to conform themſelves to the Reformed Churches, that they preſcribe not an ordinary form of publike Prayers and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments.

            <p>IF theſe directors who boaſt themſelves of a new Light, had had at leaſt the light of Prudence, they would have conſidered that they had to deal with popular Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who were accuſtomed to a good and holy Liturgie, but ſince on a ſudden interdicted the uſe, they could not but think they were ſuddenly tranſported into another Goſpel, for the people are dull, and faſtned upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, and that if they be once faſtened to a form of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion which is good, although below perfection, there is occaſion to praiſe God that the people have any taſt of devotion, even in any Form, and it ſhould be cheriſhed and encouraged. And if there be any thing in this Form to be amended, it ſhould be done ſo mildly and dexterouſly, that the people be not exaſperated, and the change made in the outward skin of Religion, make not the ſubſtance diſtaſted; for the moſt part mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100918:90"/>
penetrates not much further than the ſuperficies, as indeed no further did theirs who came to reform us with the ſword. Its a very dangerous thing to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw an Order wherein the Devotion of the people hath taken root. For beſides the diſorder that follows commonly in the Church and State, they ſhall find that in tranſplanting Devotion into a new ſoil, they cauſe it to die; ſome being prophane, others deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and atheiſtical.</p>
            <p>For an exemplary conduct of Chriſtian prudence in this great point of publick Reformation, all after ages will admire the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformers under the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, who intrapt the people, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beguiled the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who confeſſed that being ſubtile, <hi>he caught them by guile,</hi> for to eſtabliſh the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo as it is contained in the Confeſſion of Faith in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and agrees with that of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, they kept themſelves from going o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and ſuddenly againſt the inclination of the people, above all in the exteriour, which although it is of leſs importance, hath notwithſtanding a very ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the common people. After the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was concluded upon by the Prelates and Nobles, Mattins were ſaid in the Cathedral Churches at their accuſtomed hours, with the ſame Garments they were wont to wear, and the ſame ordinary ſinging, but the Hymns and Pſalms they read in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were not read in pieces, but by whole Chapters, and Prayers were put to God only in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and in a known tongue; a thing which did much content the people, and much edifie them, and being accuſtomed to theſe things, they paſſed by the Maſs. Sermons became more frequent, ſimply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the people in the Truth and Holineſs without any bitterneſs or conteſt; whereby they gained the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the people by charity, which is the only method
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100918:91"/>
for to decide controverſies, and in a ſhort time, that which Superſtition had drawn over the Service of God, was inſenſibly aboliſhed, and there was a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Kingdom wrought without any noiſe.</p>
            <p>This prudent way wrought better effects than all the combats of Religion, whether fought by Armies or Letters, which have been ſince above theſe hundred years: Their enemies of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would much rather the Reformers had diſputed concerning the Doctrine and Diſcipline, and that they had ſet upon them with their utmoſt ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Our melancholy and peeviſh Zelots would have done no great good upon them by the waies they now take, if this task had fallen into their hands; for ſuch a great work there was need of better notions of piety and prudence than the fundamental Maximes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation at preſent,<note place="margin">The Book called Chriſt upon his Throne, p. <hi>23.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That the pureſt Religion is that which hath leaſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Church of Rome.</hi> That for to do well, they muſt do quite contrary to that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and hereby they make all that remains of the Inſtitution of the Apoſtles to become Antichriſtian, becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt hath practiſed them. Maximes which are only proper for poor ſeditious Spirits, whoſe nature is like the Crab-fiſhes, who know not how to go but back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Religion conſiſts not in negation, the ſaving Truths are affirmative, and it would be a dangerous rule to believe altogether contrary to that which the Devil believes, which would oblige us to deny the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>For ſo high an enterpriſe, which is equally as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as dangerous, there is required clear, ſeeing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, firm &amp; ſtable, ready &amp; charitable; who are able to penetrate and dive into the inſide of Religion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100918:91"/>
the meat from the ſhell; who without bending the Truth to the times, know how to accomodate their work to the nature of men and affairs; and who have the diſcretion recommended by Saint <hi>Paul, Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> wiſely diſtinguiſhing betwixt the Apoſtolical Inſtitution, and the ruſt that is grown on it through length of time.</p>
            <p>Theſe excellent perſons manifeſt to the world that they well underſtood this ſecret, that the matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a thing rather adored than known by the people; but the Form and Ceremony is that their eyes are fixed upon, and which fills their ſpirits, and he that pleaſeth them in the exteriour, ſhall eaſily prevail with them for the inward of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now it appears that Superſtition is alwayes of the ſame Nature, although ſhe changeth her object; for the Fanaticall zeal of the people of the Covenant being fleſhed and egged on to deſtroy the exteriour Order, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not in the mean while that they undermined the foundations of Faith; For we find amongſt our enemies, many different Sects; Some denying the Trinity, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God, and his Divinity, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe agree altogether to hate &amp; aboliſh our Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie with the ſword, without contending amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for theſe eſſential differences; neither are they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for theſe monſtrous errors, which directly oppoſe the glory of God and ſalvation of men; ſo much are men for the moſt part children, yea brutiſh in matters of Piety, faſtening themſelves upon appearances, and not upon things, conſidering more the garment then the body of Religion.</p>
            <p>The vulgar being every where of this diſpoſition, God ſhewed great favour to the ignorant people in times of our Fathers, to put them into ſo good hands, who knew how to lead them mildly to the Truth, without exaſperating them for the Diſcipline. For
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100918:92"/>
to provoke and irritate them, was not the means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them.</p>
            <p>Let all the world judge if the Reformers at preſent follow this example, and whether they ſearch to inſtruct or to provoke the people; for after we have made the beſt and ſoundeſt party amongſt them to confeſs that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was good and holy, and they be demanded hereupon, why they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the King and his people with ſuch rage? They pay us with this miſerable reaſon, that the people are affectionate to certain things as neceſſary, which are not neceſſary, and they would wean them from this opinion: And muſt they for this drown three famous Kingdoms in bloud, and ſnatch the Crown from off the Head, and the Sword out of the hand of a good King?</p>
            <p>We may well tell them that they undertake an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing; for there is no Religion, no Nation, nor almoſt perſon, who is not lodged there; but they themſelves, are they not more ſuperſtitious in this point, than thoſe whom they would correct? For what greater ſuperſtition, for to make a neceſſity to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and oppoſe things; where there is no neceſſity, yea to account the aboliſhing of things not neceſſary, ſo neceſſary, that for it they will maſſacre the King, and bathe themſelves in the blood of the Church and State. Can there be in the world a more pernicious ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? No verily, if they conſider that this ſuperſtition, kils the ſoul as well as the body. For thoſe from Whom they take the uſe of their holy prayers, have great cauſe to fear they will alſo take from them their Religion, whereupon ſome have Fallen into a deſperate Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; if they deal thus with us, becauſe they have a greater meaſure of light then we, it is much to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they had a little more; that they fall not into the offence condemned by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>through thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died, but

            <p>Heretofore this faction would be ſpar'd in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, pretending tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs of Conſcience; but now that they are become Maſters of the Laws, they regard not our weakneſs, but force us to follow their fantaſies, without conſidering our doubts and ſcruples. The King by the Articles of <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> offered them liberty of Conſcience, but they will not give neither the King nor his ſubjects the like liberty: Either take the Covenant or leave your Benefice, was the choice they gave many Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Alledge to them the great and deep affliction of the people, becauſe they had taken from them their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers, their Forms for the celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and of Marriage, their cuſtoms of receiving the Sacrament at Chriſtmas, Eaſter, and Pentecoſt, and the decent manner of burying their dead, with ſome Prayers and Texts of Scripture, which put the living in mind of their mortality, and raiſed up in them an aſſurance of their reſurrection. They will anſwer you, that theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are not neceſſary, and mock at the affliction of the ignorant people: But we hold that it is neceſſary to obey God, who <hi>hath commanded us to do nothing whereby thy weak brother ſtumbleth, is offended, or made weak, but be ſuch as give none offence, neither to the Jew, nor to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor to the Church of God,</hi> Rom. 14.21. Alſo the imaginary danger which they fear of things that may come to paſſe, is a thouſand times leſs then the preſent ſcandal and offence done to pious ſouls, to behold all Eccleſiaſtical order overthrown, and Liberty given to prophane and fanatique ſpirits, to whom any thing is permitted, unleſs to obey the King, and the orders eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Lawfull Authority.</p>
            <p>But let us paſs to other offences: There are many more beſides the violation of Orders, the very ſubſtance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100918:93"/>
of Religion is endamaged. What care do many people take to Baptize their children? How do they reprove them that Baptize no more in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt? Is it notpermitted to every one to Baptize or not Baptize their children? and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is it not refuſed to many Infants, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be Baptized?</p>
            <p>Theſe new Reformers find ſo many difficulties in the capacity of their Parents, that they are conſtrained many times to carry their children far from their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to be received into the Chriſtian Church; for 'tis one of the Errors of the Times, that if the Father hath not Faith (that is to ſay a Faith after their mode) the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant muſt not be Baptized; In ſtead whereof the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in Baptizing Infants, conſider not the Faith of the Parents, but of the Church in which they are born; and the Doctrine, not according as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but according as it is taught, <hi>Fidem non ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam ſed objectivam.</hi> For if they muſt be certain whether the Father hath Faith, they ſhould alſo be certain that he is the Father of the Infant, which the Charity of the Church queſtioneth not.</p>
            <p>Alſo it is an ordinary cuſtom amongſt them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize aged perſons, and to plunge women naked into the Water untill they ſay they feel faith.</p>
            <p>The abuſe of the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is yet worſe, becauſe it is more univerſal, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the body of their Divines. We beſeech all lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Chriſtian Religion to enquire themſelves of theſe Miniſters, how long time they have forborn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or adminiſter this holy Sacrament? when was it that the heads of the Covenanters received it? when is it that their Souldiers were partakers of it, thoſe zealous murtherers, whoſe aſſaſſinations and plunderings are ſteeped in piety? Is it becauſe they dare not receive the body and blood of our Lord, with hands defiled with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100918:93"/>
rapine and innocent blood? But this reaſon cannot ſerve for the Churches where the Miniſters are laid hold on, and forbidden to adminiſter the Sacrament where they are Miniſters. How many Churches are there where there hath been no ſpeaking of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe fifteen or ſixteen years? And is it not for them to mock God to make a Directory of the manner of receiving the Lords Supper, and not to make uſe of it, yea by force to hinder execution and performance of it?</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus hath commanded us, <hi>To do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. But behold here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who impoſe a neceſſity not to do, becauſe they know not thoſe who are worthy, and therefore they hinder others to obey Jeſus Chriſt, taking by force the Bread and Wine from the people, who were aſſembled to communicate, and carried away the Miniſter out of the Church, for fear he ſhould adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe actions cry to heaven, and will one day draw down a juſt vengeance. Theſe proceedings make us fear, leaſt they rank the Lords Supper amongſt the ſuperannuated ceremonies which muſt be aboliſhed; for in many Churches where the Covenanters are it's not uſed, which is a horrible thing to hear; the Church of God, ſince Chriſts time, never before brought forth ſuch examples.</p>
            <p>Certainly ſince Jeſus Chriſt would, <hi>that we ſhould do this in remembrance of him, until his coming again</hi>; if he ſhould come now, he would find it very ſtrange, that they had left before his coming this celebration of the memory of his death, which he had ſo expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and it is to be preſumed that he will receive no reaſon againſt his Command: for the coming of Jeſus Chriſt is the only reaſon which ought to make this holy Ordinance ceaſe.</p>
            <p>By this ſcruple, that they dare not adminiſter the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100918:94"/>
holy Supper, but to thoſe alone whom they know to be worthy (which is the general pretext of their party for their total abſtinence) they condemn not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, who exclude none from the holy Communion, unleſs they be ignorant and ſcandalous perſons, but alſo Jeſus Chriſt, who adminiſtred to the Diſciple that betrayed him; even then when he was plotting his treaſon in his heart.</p>
            <p>By this alſo they even bind themſelves not to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Supper of the Lord until they be inſpectors and lookers into Conſcience, that is to ſay, Gods: For otherwiſe they cannot be fully ſatisfied of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of perſons, and all thoſe who have a holy deſire to partake of the Lords Table, ſhall not be admitted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til theſe principal Clerks of the Councel-Chamber of God have formed a Church, which conſiſts purely of Elect.</p>
            <p>Its great pity when men will be too wiſe, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Laws of Severity into the Church which God hath not required at our hands: Theſe men ſhould meditate on the Text of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.16. <hi>Be not righteous over-much, neither make thy ſelf over-wiſe, why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> Or otherwiſe, <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou draw deſolation on thy ſelf?</hi> Thus the Phariſees by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent wiſdome and affected Authority, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Divinity of <hi>Chymeras,</hi> were confounded in the vanity of their underſtandings, and drew deſolation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and their Church.</p>
            <p>But yet there is a myſtery of Iniquity under this ſcruple, which doth deeply ſtain the Divines of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for their Maſters foment them for to advance their affairs, and it is eaſie to ſee, that if they once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſtrongeſt, they will exclude from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper all thoſe who cannot baniſh from their heart the love of their King, and the Church wherein they were born and brought up: In a Sermon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100918:94"/>
preached before the Houſe of Commons, and printed by command,<note place="margin">By Mr. Francis Cheynall.</note> we learn that their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will no more communicate with the Antichriſtian Faction; the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher explains himſelf, and tells us he means all thoſe that adhere to the King in this quarrel: They have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times preached that none ſhould receive the Lords Supper, but thoſe who had taken the Covenant; yea, they have ſpoke aloud, that the Oath of the Covenant, and the Lords Supper ſhould be adminiſtred together, ſo that the Communicants muſt ſwear upon the Body &amp; Blood of our Lord, and upon the hope of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they would be Rebels to their King as long as they live; and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the ſame uſe, the cup of mans blood which the confederates with <hi>Cataline</hi> drunk round one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in taking the Oath of Conjuration to murder their Superiours, and ruine their country. But this deſign is not yet ripe for execution, they defer it for a time: In the mean time, theſe Gentlemen and the Spiritual Fathers deny themſelves the Seal of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jeſus Chriſt, and hereafter they will diſpoſe of this Sacrament according as the neceſſity of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters do require. They forgot to put down this Article of their reſervation in the Epiſtle they ſent to forreign Churches, but in inviting them in general to conform themſelves unto them, they exhort them to this amongſt the reſt. What? Muſt the Reformed Churches then abſtain from the Lords Supper, and chuſe to interdict the Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then put themſelves in danger of adminiſtring to the unworthy? Muſt the Univerſal Chriſtian Church be gulled by their ſcruples, compoſed of the folly of ſome, and the malice of others? Muſt all believers in the World hold their Faith in ſuſpence, and deprive themſelves of the Sacrament of their Union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100918:95"/>
Chriſt, until the Covenanters of <hi>England</hi> have found a proper time to make uſe of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, to bind together a wicked faction, and have made the myſteries of Salvation their footſtool for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p>Rather then ſuffer by a criminal complacency, that Religion ſhould be ſo deſtroyed, and that theſe horrible things ſhould paſs for Doctrines of the Reformed Churches, let all thoſe who bear this title, defend the honour of the Goſpel, and thereby a publick deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo great a corruption. Let all thoſe who love God teſtifie by a juſt anger they hate the evil. It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not what fraternity theſe Innovators pretend with other Churches, if they corrupt the Chriſtian Religion, and invite them to do the like, <hi>Familiaris accipere haud familiariter,</hi> let them manifeſt, they have no fraternity with hereſie, and impiety, repulſe boldly the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who invite ſo baſely to do ill, that they may have no more courage to return.</p>

            <p>HItherto we have found no ſuch conformity as might induce the Covenanters of <hi>England</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the Reformed Churches to eſpouſe their quarrel, for they every where carefully adminiſter the Lords Supper, they take order that Infants be baptized, they ſuffer none to be re-baptized, they ſuppreſs hereſies, ſcandals, the liberty of fanatique ſpirits, they repeat to the people the ten Commandments of God, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith, they make uſe of certain forms of prayer in adminiſtring the Sacraments, and other parts of the Divine Service. They teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſubmit to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, and not to reſiſt Supreme Powers, but to ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake; they are free from a capricious weakneſs in matters of indifferency which are peculiar to our enemies; alſo theſe Churches approve of the Engliſh Liturgy, and without ſcruple joyn with it in prayer when occaſion ſerves; what is there then which ſhould oblige them to aſſociate together. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, ſay they, have no Biſhops; but we demand of them, whether all thoſe Churches which have Biſhops are not Reformed? They incline doubtleſs to this opinion, for in the title of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Reformed Churches, they name but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100918:97"/>
thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> the Low Countries, and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> they let the other paſs under an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If that be their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they have much forgot themſelves in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which they ſent to particular States, for they writ to the Churches of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> which are governed by Superintendents, that is to ſay in our Language, Biſhops.</p>
            <p>In all thoſe Countries ſubject to the Crowns of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> The Epiſcopal degree is kept; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt through all <hi>Germany,</hi> this degree is preſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Superintendent, and in ſome places (as in <hi>Brene</hi>) the name of Biſhops remain; although part of theſe Churches be <hi>Lutherans,</hi> we will not refuſe them the name of Reformed, there wanting but a little cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in them, to make both them and us to accord. So likewiſe in the large Territories of <hi>Bohemia, Polonia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> the Evangelical Churches are gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Seniors, (as they call them) who have Epiſcopal power.</p>
            <p>They ſhould not then boaſt of the conſent of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, nor complain to them, that the King would not admit a Reformation, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to aboliſh the Epiſcopal degree as an appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Antichriſt, which is in effect to condemn all Churches where there is any preheminence amongſt the Clergy. I forbear to ſpeak of the Churches of <hi>Ruſſia, Grecia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> and of the reſt of the world, whoſe Doctrine is leſs known to us, then the point of their Diſcipline, which are all governed by Biſhops.</p>
            <p>But the Covenanters Magiſterially preſcribe their Diſcipline to all the World, although they themſelves have none, vaunting themſelves of a piety without pair, and yet will not leave to other Churches any liberty.</p>
            <p>Therefore their Declarations give all to underſtand, that after they have planted it in <hi>England,</hi> they will go and do as much beyond the Seas. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It's eaſie to make the conſent of the Churches na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the title of the Epiſtle to ſound high, becauſe they have no Biſhops, but to prove their agreement with the Covenanters in this point, they ſhould do well to make theſe two things to appear; the one, that theſe Churches condemn the Epiſcopal Order as unlawful and Antichriſtian; the other, that theſe Churches do conform to the diſcipline of the Covenanters, things which they will find falſe.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, we ſee not that the other Churches quarrel at the Church of <hi>England</hi> hereupon, but pray God to bleſs them in the order; againſt this it matters not to alledge the thirtieth Article of the Churches of <hi>France</hi> confeſſion of Faith. <hi>We believe that all true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in what place ſoever they be, have the ſame authority and equal power under one head Jeſus Chriſt, and that for this cauſe no Church ought to pretend any dominion or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over the other.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now after theſe charitable judgements, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches do not believe, that which the Epiſtle of the Aſſembly of Divines would perſwade them; that the Biſhops hate forraign Churches, and reach that without Biſhops they could have no Church nor lawful call of Miniſters, ſo that if any of ours have offended of late the Reformed Church in the point of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they are diſavowed in it by their Biſhops.</p>

to have ſaid ſo much, there would have been no Covenant, neither would they have pulled down Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, for to pull down Biſhops, under colour of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Kingdom of Antichriſt: But if they would that in this quarrel the Reformed Churches ſhould joyn with them, they ſhould firſt have drawn from them a Declaration, that they held the Epiſcopal degree unlawful, and a mark of Antichriſt, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the Goſpel; and that rather then ſuffer it, they ſhould overthrow the State, and diſpoſſeſs your Kings; for leſſe then this perſwaſion could not induce the Reformed Churches to eſpouſe the quarrel of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>We will proceed no further in this controverſie, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Covenanters build their rules of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon the example of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, which the <hi>French</hi> Reformers never thought of, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech all equal perſons to conſider the Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe that put their hand to this great work in <hi>France,</hi> having the Court and Clergy contrary to them.</p>
            <p>The beſt that they were able to do in the matter of Diſcipline, was to provide Paſtors who ſhould teach purely, and leave them in a ſimple equality, there being no queſtion of governing in times of perſecution, but to inſtruct and ſuffer; and it being a thing ſubject to danger and envy, to erect new degrees, which could not be done without quarrelling at them which were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Neceſſity contributes to prudence, for the Reformation in <hi>France</hi> having begun by the common people, and ſome few of the inferiour Clergy, who were oppoſed by the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Power, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder, if the Government which they eſtabliſhed according to the time, was popular; if the Reformation had begun by Biſhops, the Government had been Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal; the Prieſts that were converted had not powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to convert their Biſhops; as the Engliſh who began the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100918:100"/>
Reformation, helped by their Authority, the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Clergy and people. For the inferiour Orbs, having a contrary motion to the ſuperiour, have not the power to make them follow their courſe: But the ſuperiour Orbs carry along with them the inferiour. It was a great matter that the Reformed people could gain any retrogation againſt the rapidity and ſwiftneſs of the greater Sphears.</p>
            <p>The diſcipline of the <hi>French</hi> Churches is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to their preſent eſtate, and hardly could there be found a more proper for a Church that lives under Magiſtrates of a contrary Religion, in expectation of the reformation of them who poſſeſs the Eccleſiaſtical degrees. The <hi>French</hi> Miniſters in this humble and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual order keep themſelves in a ſtate of obedience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſubmit themſelves to their Dioceſans when it ſhall pleaſe God to convert them, and we believe that their Fathers did choſe this equality, not as an oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the degrees of the Clergy, but as a way to diſpoſe them, and as a plank ready to invite the Biſhops to paſs over to their Reformation.</p>
            <p>But if the Churches of <hi>France</hi> ſhould come to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Doctrine of the Covenanters, that the Order of Epiſcopacy, is an appurtenance of Antichriſt, and that there is no Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, but there where the Miniſters are equal and poor; This would put the converſion of the <hi>French</hi> Churches out of all hope. But for as much as we deſire the advancement of the Goſpel, we keep our ſelves from re-inforcing the conſiderations of fleſh and blood, or from augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproach of the Goſpel; we are not offended at the degrees, nor revenues of the Clergy, we render not the entrance into the Church more thorny then it is: For to preach Reformation to a Clergy of a divers Religion, and bind them to degrade and ſtrip themſelves for to reform them; what other thing is this, but at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100918:100"/>
once to call them, and to ſhut the door againſt them? It's true, that notwithſtanding all earthly conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, God may do miracles for to convert them, but that hinders not but that we ſhould carry our ſelves prudently to invite them, and we ought not of deliberate purpoſe to make new Barracadoes between them and us, becauſe God can, if he pleaſe, break them.</p>
            <p>But to the end that the difference of diſciplines move no quarrel amongſt the Reformed Churches, this truth ought wiſely to be conſidered, that there is no entire rule of diſcipline laid down in Scripture; and that not to have an outward order in the Church, all the parts whereof not being expreſly ſet down in the Word of God, is to involve themſelves in great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and ſhut themſelves up into ſtraight bounds, it's to ſearch that in the Word of God, which is not there to be found. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Its a Scripture that may be ſtretched very far, and which remits to the Chriſtian prudence of the Miniſters of the Word of God, to adviſe of ſuch an order which is moſt expedient for the times and places wherein they live, provided that nothing be done againſt Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>It's then neceſſary that to the Divine Inſtitution the humane ſhould be joyned, and it was never otherwiſe in Church: Now that which is humane in the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, can never be ſo well united and fitted with the Divine, that there may be made of theſe two, a form entirely regular, and a perfect compoſition: It's like the iron and clay in the feet of the Statue of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> which could never well joyn themſelves one with another, for the Eccleſiaſtical Ordinances are the feet of Religion, bearing on them a head of gold, and a breſt of ſilver, that is ſtriving to uphold a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of great price? but they themſelves touch the earth, and are mingled, and there is not ſuch a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100918:101"/>
and ſanctity of Reformation, which can form a diſcipline purely celeſtial, nor joyn that which it hath of humane and Divine in it with ſuch a juſtneſs, as to compoſe a perfect order, with materials of ſo different a nature.</p>
            <p>This here is the cauſe of ſo many faults which may be found in all Eccleſiaſtical Order. For notwithſtanding the confuſion of Schiſmes and Hereſies, the ſharpneſs of perſecutions, the infinite revolutions of States, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſixteen ages, a pure and divine Doctrine remains in the World, as gold which is found alwayes at the bottom of the Furnace: The ſame cannot be ſaid of the diſcipline, for that is defective in all Churches, and varieth; yea, ought to vary according to the times and places, and it hath ſo much of man in it, that what it hath of Divine, is alwayes more or leſs Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by humane inventions; and will be alwayes ſo, until Jeſus Chriſt hath withdrawn his Church from the earth, and raiſed it to that great Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is the Rule of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Surely though there be certain rules of diſcipline Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and certain, there yet remains ever ſomething for Prudence to form, which ought to accommodate it ſelf to neceſſity; So bending according as occaſions ſerve, the rules that God hath left, to the wiſdome of men, as the Divine be not damnified, and that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church thwarts not that of the State, which is our miſery at this day.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever ſhall conſider the Kingdomes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths of Chriſtendome, ſhall find that every where the Religion of the State hath a diſcipline ſuitable to the civil Government, the Church taking hold of the State, as the Ivy that groweth about a tree: But the Covenanters pretend the quite contrary, labouring to form the State to their new pattern of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline. Hither tended the Petition of the rabble of

            <head>CHAP. XVIII. How the Diſcipline of the Covenanters is far from the practice of other Churches.</head>
            <p>THere is another point which the Covenanters ought to prove, before they aſſociate themſelves with the Churches of <hi>France</hi> in matter of Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>They muſt prove that they have an Eccleſiaſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline like unto theirs; For all Churches which had no Biſhops, have not for all that the ſame diſcipline. As for the diſcipline of the Covenanters, they need make none by theirs, nor receive any from them, for they have none at all, and they take the way never to have any. If the menaces of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, cauſe them to make an Ordinance in favour of the Presbytery, they make preſently an honourable reparation to the Independents; And much of their prudence lies in this, to accord all to the different Parties, but give them nothing; in making uſe of the ſervice of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sects of Religion, they take no care of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but of their Liberty to convert all; which will one day turn to their ruine, and confuſion, when they ſhall have no enemy to unite them. But in the mean while Religion is deſtroyed, and all the world behold with aſtoniſhment that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformers have left the Church without any diſcipline, now theſe many years; they have done much worſe then he who began to build, but was not able to finiſh, for theſe have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the antient order, without ever conſidering what they would build in the place; and yet they are not agreed thereupon, they made a great noiſe of the building they would erect; but this noiſe proceeded from their conteſtation, and their building advanced like
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100918:102"/>
that of <hi>Babel,</hi> that which the one builded, the other pull'd down, and in the end the diviſion of tongues will make them forſake their work.</p>
            <p>It's an eaſie thing to ruine, 'tis a work of ignorance and inſolence; 'tis the paſtime of the devil, and the occupation of his children: <hi>Deſtruction and unhappineſs is in their wayes, and the way of peace they have not known, Rom.</hi> 3.16. And ordinarily thoſe that burn down the houſe, know not what it is to build it up, and thoſe who build up a Church or State, proceed by wayes and rules quite contrary to thoſe that ruine them, the ſharp and rigorous proceeding of our enemies wholly to raze the eſtabliſhed order, witneſs they want knowledge to build an order in the Church; for to this purpoſe there is not only required to conceive an Idea of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but to conſider the matter they have in hand, and how to frame it; For as he is not the beſt Engenier who knows beſt how to make a Regular platform upon paper, but he that can beſt accommodate his rules to the nature of the place which he fortifies; and it would be a ſtrange method to pull down and lay level the place for to build it again regularly. But its that wherein our new Reformers have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Certainly they neither underſtand the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor the Practick of the work they undertake, and their knowledge goes no further then deſtruction: It's true, many of the Aſſembly deſired the <hi>Scotch</hi> Diſcipline, and to eſtabliſh it, courted the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>We alſo reſpect theſe Armies, hoping that God will one day touch their hearts to defend the rights and perſon of their Soveraign, and we pray God for their proſperity: But let them give us leave to tell them mildly our advice of their Diſcipline, the wiſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us commend the ſubordination, and concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Synods, and do confeſs that that was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100918:103"/>
wanting in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Order, judging that the Synodal Power is not incompatible with the Epiſcopal; but in an order well made, both the one, and the other is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, and it is impoſſible that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, excellent in knowledge and piety, who have lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe ninety yeares, ſhould not know this very well, above all thoſe who were imploid in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>But behold that which hath hindred the ordinary uſe of Synods amongſt us, incontinent after the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it had been to ill purpoſe to have given all the Clergy liberty to aſſemble in a Synod, Papiſtry being not then well rooted out of the Prieſts and Curates, and before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church was well healed of this old malady ſhe fell into a new one, and was infected with a fanatick and malignant Sect, who made piety conſiſt in overthrowing all order and ſuperiority in the Church, and to controle that of the Magiſtrate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Soveraigns and their Prelates beholding the body of the Church ſwollen with evil humours, and mutinous ſuperſtition, continually ready to break forth, feared leaſt the frequent uſe of Synods, ſhould not be made uſe of by the diſcontented, to gather and aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a faction; and therefore accounted the ſureſt way to maintain peace and truth, was to keep theſe violent ſpirits in their duty by the Epiſcopal rod, aſſiſted with the Royal Scepter, and certainly this way would have had better ſucceſs, if they had not let the bridle too looſe for ſuch hard mouths.</p>
            <p>The Synod is proper to make Ordinances, and the Biſhop is proper to cauſe them to be obſerved: The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod to hinder tyranny, the Biſhop to prevent confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Synod to determine in point of Doctrine, the Biſhop to maintain order and diſcipline; the Synod to remedy inveterate evils, the Biſhop to ſuppreſs immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent evils; and in the mean while, both the one
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100918:103"/>
and the other ſerve to all theſe uſes, and ought not to be ſeparated in a Church where there is freedom, and where the eſtate upholds the Religion.</p>
            <p>But in a Church which lives under a ſtate of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, order muſt bend to neceſſity; and as it is not poſſible to have all the parts of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, alſo there is leſs need, for common adverſity unite affections,<note place="margin">

               </note> and take away many occaſions of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and diſorder.</p>
            <p>Such are the Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> where the order is ſutable to their condition; and the native piety and ſimplicity of their Diſcipline is commended even by thoſe of a diverſe Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Now having had leiſure to examine their Diſcipline, we find not that it doth much reſemble the <hi>Scotch</hi> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; for the Conſiſtories and Synods of <hi>France</hi> have not Ruling Elders, whoſe voices alwaies carry it, as they do in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Their Elders paſs not any ſentence in matter of Doctrine, neither have they the power of the Keys to determine Cenſures: All that <hi>Calvin</hi> granted them, was but <hi>praeeſſe moribus,</hi> to have an eye to the manners and behaviour of the flock in which they ſerved as Aſſiſtants to the Paſtors, and this was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable uſe. But in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Elders command, for the Lord of the Pariſh is ordinarily the ruling Elder of the Conſiſtory, and in ſome manner is a Lay Biſhop, and although the Miniſter is alwaies Moderator, its but for form, for the Elders have the principal power, and being Deputies to the Aſſemblies, they keep there the ſame credit, above all in the General Aſſembly, where Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles and Barons have their voices, and decide the points of controverſies and the cenſures of the Church.</p>
            <p>We greatly reſpect the power of Synods, but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that it be purely Eccleſiaſtical, and that it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100918:104"/>
by none, but by thoſe who are appointed of God; lay perſons have not to do, but to aſſiſt them, except the King, who ought to have the exterior power (which the <hi>Scotch</hi> deny him) to convocate and diſſolve their Aſſemblies, to ſuppreſs diſorders, without medling himſelf with the interiour or ſpiritual, for it ſeems to us a thing unreaſonable and contradictory to it ſelf, that the other Laiques ſhould be admitted to the full capacity of the ſpiritual power equal or above the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and that the King only ſhould be excluded, and hath not ſo much as the exerciſe of his temporal and purely Royal power in the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>We could wiſh alſo that the power of their Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods were a little more limitted, for theſe Aſſemblies being Courts of Conſcience, which takes cogniſance of all the offences of the Church, they may encloſe in their Juriſdiction, all criminal and civil cauſes of the Kingdom, there being no cauſe which hath not in it a point of Conſcience: And ſo hereby it may come, that the ſentences of Judges may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled in the Conſiſtory, and the Officers of the Crown queſtioned about their managing of publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and ſo the Government of the State become pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arbitrary.</p>
            <p>And the power of the Eccleſiaſtical Councel being ſuch, the moſt unquiet and ambitious will be ever preſſing to be of it, whereupon ſidings and factions will abound, revenge and particular intereſt will turn the ballance; There they will form factions in the State, and parties againſt the King, for what is there that they dare not enterpriſe who have ſo vaſt a power, which have no other limits than the extent of the flitting and moveable conſcience of particulars, which give account to none, who pretend to have their authority only of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, and therefore are not ſubject to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled? Theſe are not conjectures nor ſuppoſitions,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100918:104"/>
but obſervations of long experience; certainly that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal citation which was ſent by the National Synod of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their King, when he was in the midſt of his Armies in <hi>England, Feb.</hi> 1645. filled Forreign Churches with amazement and ſcandal: And no leſs is the Authority they exerciſe even over their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which having demanded advice of the Synod, concerning what they were to do with their King, the Miniſters concluded that they ſhould not bring the King into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ought not to eſpouſe his quarrel, for to maintain his Rites in <hi>England,</hi> and their advice paſſed for an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; after this they cannot reprove the Biſhops for being Councellours of State.</p>
            <p>Monarchy which can endure neither Maſter, nor Companion, can hardly comply with this Court of Conſcience, which gives Laws, but receives none, unleſs themſelves make them, and limit the King, but refuſe to be limited by him, but the Magiſtrates of an Ariſtocratick, or popular Common-wealth will ſhift better with them, for this Court pretending an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Juriſdiction, purely Soveraign and Divine, yet nevertheleſs admit lay men to the participation of this power; The Lords never fail to be Members of this conſiſtory, and to govern there. And thus the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion touching the Eccleſiaſtical authority is Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Now although above all we deſire to enjoy an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical and Epiſcopal Diſcipline, where the Biſhop, aſſiſted with the Councel of his Clergy governs the Church, and admits other Paſtors according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and quality, to the participation of the power of ths Keies, yet nevertheleſs if the revolution of the State brings in another Diſcipline, our Miniſters ſubmit themſelves to it, not to be Actors there, remembring themſelves of their duties and promiſe made at their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100918:105"/>
reception of Orders, but to ſurfer themſelves to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, remembring that they are call'd to preach the Goſpel, and whether there be a good or an evil Order in the Church, or even none at all, the vocation binds them to feed the Flock and to maintain the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>But indeed its great pity to be reduced to expect a Diſcipline of thoſe that have none, and yet make the Kingdom of Chriſt to conſiſt in it, for which they made ſuch clamours, in their licentiouſneſs, and overthrow of all Order and lawful Vocation in the Church.</p>
            <p>The Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> who employ all their Zeal and Induſtry to maintain the purity of the Goſpel, without contending with any about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſcipline, look upon with contempt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion the impetuous weakneſs of our enemies, who overthrow the holy Doctrine, and ruine Church and State for points of Diſcipline, which is to loſe the end for the acceſſaries, yea although theſe acceſſaries are not good in this regard, there being but two things to reprove in the Covenanters, their end, and the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XIX. That the Covenanters ruine the Miniſters of the Goſpel under colour of Reformation.</head>
            <p>ONE of the points of Reformation for which they laboured ſo much with Cannon ſhot, was to abaſe and pull down the Clergy, which is a work already done without proceeding further.</p>
            <p>As for their greatneſs, the only thing wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted was taken from them in the year 1645. Which was the Biſhops ſitting and having power to vote in the Lords Houſe, the reſt is a ſmal thing.</p>
            <p>As for their Revenues, they are confiſcated and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred, and even the Revenues of the Biſhops were ſuch as might cauſe rather pitty then envy, except four or five Biſhopricks; the reſt were ſo poor, that for to help them to uphold their Degree, and pay their dues to the King, Tenths and firſt Fruits, his Majeſty ever out of compaſſion, gave them ſome other Benefices, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe very few would have hazzarded the taking of them, the Biſhopricks of <hi>England</hi> being like the ruined Monaſteries in ſome Countries, which have nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining but the wals, with nothing in them.</p>
            <p>The children of thoſe parents who had formerly f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves by the Biſhopricks, have now ſwallowed the reſt, and yet labour to begger the inferior Clergy: This is that they call Reformation, and in truth 'tis the Reformation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Tenths of the Clergy are poſſeſſed by the Ruling Elders, above all by the Lords, ſome of them having the Tenths of whole Provinces. Therefore ye need not wonder they fight with ſuch Zeal for a Reformation which is ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:100918:106"/>In <hi>England</hi> ordinarily the great Towns and rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes are impropriated, and in the hands of Lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the reſt of the Benefices have but to provide in a Mediocrity for Students in Divinity: Thoſe who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Clergy, are thoſe who poſſeſs the Goods of the Church; and beſides the Tithes that are alienated, many of them even make uſe of the Tithes of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, with which they are lawfully inveſted, terrify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g their poor Miniſters with Sequeſtration, too weak to contend againſt them, and force them to injurious and damageable contracts. How many Patrons are there who ſell their Benefices to them who will give moſt? And by the infamous Simony of theſe Gentlemen, who make a noiſe of Reformation, the door of the Church is ſhut to the Clergy, unleſs they have a golden key to open it; and thus they prefer profit before conſcience: 'Tis well done of them to mend that which they have marred, and they of all other have reaſon to take in hand the Reformation of Miniſters, becauſe themſelves have done what poſſibly they can to corrupt them.</p>
            <p>Of all Liberal Profeſſions, Divinity is the pooreſt, and have moſt Thorns in her way; and therefore Parents find it more profitable to put their children to a Trade, than bring them up in the Study of Divinity; and yet after all this, their very poverty ſeems ſuperfluity in the eyes of envy; and untill theſe hungry Harpies have caught that little which hath eſcaped the claws of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, they will never leave calling for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Clergy, that is to ſay, wholly to ruine them.</p>
            <p>The devil who hates the Goſpel, labours to ruine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by the poverty of thoſe who preach it, knowing well that the indigence of Miniſters brings contempt upon the Miniſtry; And that the Rewards being taken away, the Study of Divinity will be neglected, and then there will be none but the meaneſt of the people, like

to the Prieſts of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Poverty abates the courage, and clips the wings of conception, and oft-times oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions evil deſigns and Councels in thoſe whoſe means are too ſmall for their Degree. To do well in Pulpit, and by Writing to build up indeed the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and to deſtroy the works of the devil, they ought to have their ſpirits free, and not oppreſſed through neceſſity, <hi>Magnae mentis opus, nec de Lodice pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa Attonitae</hi>; They that require, and would a man ſhould do well, and yet will not do well to him, tis an unjuſt demand; and many now in <hi>England</hi> paſs the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> requiring double the number of Bricks, and yet give to them leſs ſtraw.</p>
            <p>If they alledge to us that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles were poor, we anſwer, that ſo were their auditors; and the condition of our Lord and his Diſciples is a pattern as well for Layicks as the Clergy. And if the Primitive Church of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Acts,</hi> ought to be propoſed for an example of the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Government of all Chriſtendom, the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> humbly beſeech the Gentlemen, our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, to imitate theſe pious ſouls, who ſold their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and brought the price, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet. Let them ſell their Lands, and bring the mony to their Paſtors to diſpoſe of according to their diſcretion, and the Miniſters will part with their Tithes.</p>
            <p>If we were now to ſpeak to the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> we would exhort them to love their Office and their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and now that God hath called them to the Croſs and poverty, to rejoyce in their conformity to Jeſus Chriſt, who made himſelf poor to enrich us, expecting their reward in Heaven, bearing patiently the ſpoyling of their goods, accounting themſelves rich enough if God be glorified, and his Goſpel purely Preached, but theſe Exhortations have an evil grace in the mouth of

them who come to plunder or Sequeſter them, which is as if a thief in robbing a traveller, ſhould preach a Sermon to him of Chriſtian patience and contempt of the world; 'tis the method of our enemies, who driving their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from their houſes and Revenues, read ſuch Lectures of Divinity to them.</p>
            <p>For the preſent, ſome Miniſters who have been the principall inſtruments of their party, have means and honour, and yet little enough, conſidering the great ſervice they have done them. <hi>Peters</hi> their great and active agent, had for a recompence given him, but with great glory and oſtentation, two hundred pound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </hi> of the Faction will judge that, that little good they do now to their Miniſters, will not long continue. It were a pleaſant thing to conſider, if there were not greater cauſe of ſorrow in it, how of two Ambitions, the ſimple ſerves the Ambition of the crafty; for the Miniſters who animated the people againſt their King, are people impatient of ſubjection, who would be every one of them Kings and Biſhops in their Pariſhes, and during theſe agitations, they reign in the Pulpit a time, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they are ſet a work by thoſe who manage the publique affairs, who raiſe them up and flatter them to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, untill they have done their work with them, for when theſe Gentlemen ſhal have done to deſtroy Church and State, and built their Imaginary Throne of Jeſus Chriſt, upon the ruines of the Kingdom, they will have ſo ſtrict a hand of the Diſcipline, that the power and the profit ſhall remain with them, allowing their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fathers a portion purely ſpiritual, and will diſcharge them of thoſe cares which accompany the riches and honours of the world.</p>
            <p>Before theſe Civil Warres, the Biſhops were profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Miniſters, friends and enemies, for thoſe who ſubmitted themſelves freely to them enjoye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſtubborn and refractory Miniſters have ſtruck ſo violently at the root of that great tree which they have now made to fall, after they had been a long time cover'd under the ſhadow of it, but they may aſſure themſelves that it will not be long before they themſelves be cruſhed under the fall of it, and draw upon themſelves a juſt puniſhment: They will then conſider too late, that they have been but Inſtruments to the covetouſneſs and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of others, and in the diſſipation of the Goods of the Church, they ſhall be dealt with as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to whom the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the keeping of the Gate, where the Proviſion was to enter, then when the people after a long Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine preſſed to enter, they ſhall behold the plenty, but not taſte of it; but be trodden under foot.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. Of the Corruptions of Religion objected to the Engliſh Clergy, and the ways that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters took to Remedy them.</head>
            <p>WEE will anſwer to the Objections againſt the King and his Party, and will begin with the moſt ordinary.</p>
            <p>Now they reproach us with corruption in Religion: in ſuch an accuſation we muſt have regard to them

that ſpeak it; its thoſe who turn the riſing up of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt their King, into a Doctrine and Article of Faith; its thoſe that have abſented themſelves from the Lords Supper for theſe many years, thoſe who ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their King before them to give account of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe who have committed againſt his Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon an execrable Paracide, thoſe who will employ the Body and Blood of our Lord to knit up a conſpiracy againſt their King.

               </gap>each to ſuffer for righteouſneſs, and not to reſiſt the Supream Powers, to all theſe we might add many more hateful Truths; but we will not without neceſſity publiſh the evil that may be hid, for we love not to teach evil by repreſenting it: Whoſoever ſhall conſider their belief and practice, will never wonder that ſuch kind of People find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt our Religion. God be praiſed that thus oppoſing us, they make all the world to know that we are not guilty of their evil opinions; amongſt men, blame and praiſe take their force from him that gives them. Thoſe who accuſe us of corruption in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhould do well to tell us firſt, amongſt the ſcores of Religions that are, what their Religion is; for there are many Religions which are together with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, and live together, as ſo many wilde beaſts in the Ark, who when they are gone out thence, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another, or flee one from another, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they all agree to tear us a pieces.</p>
            <p>Now to theſe accuſers of Corruption, we preſent the thirty nine Articles of our Confeſſion, which they and we have ſworn and ſubſcribed, and let their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences judge between them and us, which of the two Parties have violated and falſified their Oath. How
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100918:108"/>
have they obſerved the thirty ſixt Article, in which they acknowledged that the conſecration of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops uſed in <hi>England,</hi> and confirmed by Act of Parliament, contains nothing in it, that is either Superſtitious or Impious; and yet now thunder out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Order as a mark and branch of Antichriſt; Is this to want memory, or conſcience? Can they upbraid us with any thing like unto this, to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a Body, and condemned an Article of our Confeſſion. The corruptions which they alledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, are falſely ſo named, or at the worſt they are but faults of particulars. But the Body of the Church hath kept and doth keep the Confeſſion of their Faith inviolable. If they produce any we would have brought in any new Doctrines or Cuſtomes, who can produce others that have oppoſed them, and that the Religion ſubſiſted entire, whilſt they ſubſiſted.</p>
            <p>Let them not rob thoſe Divines of their due praiſe who in the beginning of the Parliament laboured ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to confirm the Doctrine, and to ſtifle the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about Diſcipline. We have before repreſented with what Wiſdom, Piety, and Vigor, many Biſhops and Divines choſen by his Majeſty, had lead the two Parties to accord upon a certain number of Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which contained the Body of Religion, and what great hope there was, that the point of Diſcipline would be amiably compoſed; and how a Faction, enemies to the peace of the Church, and jealous leaſt any good ſhould come by the means of the Biſhops, broke off that excellent accord, which could never ſince be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; perſecuting the Prelates with all rigor, never giving them reſt, until they had impriſoned them as Criminals, although they were not guilty of any other crime, then becauſe they would have terminated the differences of Religion. But this was to ſtifle the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the cradle, and take away all pretext from this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100918:109"/>
holy Rebellion. It's not then a wonder if this ſin be not pardoned them; it appears by the teſtimony of the Reverend Paſtors of the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in what eſteem our Religion was amongſt our Neighbours, for in their Epiſtle to the Aſſembly at <hi>London, They beſeech God that he would reſtore our Church and Kingdome to ſuch a high degree of holineſs and glory, as it had ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in until that preſent</hi>: By this they acquit us of the corruption, which they impute to us, and do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely accuſe this Aſſembly, and thoſe that imploy them, that by their means the Kingdom hath loſt his glory, and the Church her holineſs.</p>
            <p>Now put the caſe that the Corruption were as great amongſt us, as they make it, yea put the caſe alſo, that even in our Liturgie, compoſed with ſo much piety and wiſdome, that there were ſomething to mend, as a Freckle in a fair Face, and that the Diſcipline ought to be over-looked; what could there be more expected of the King and the Clergy, then to ſubmit the Perſons and things to be Reformed? How often had the King offered to joyn his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Advice of Parliament, and a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Synod, to examine and puniſh the faulty, and correct diſorders, yea and even the Laws themſelves, if there were need?</p>
            <p>To theſe ſo reaſonable commands, behold here what obedience they yielded: A part of the Houſe of Commons, having driven away the other by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and popular tumults, and put to flight nine parts of ten of the Houſe of Lords, beſides the Biſhops who repreſented the Body of the Clergy; this ſmall reſt, in lieu of a National Synod, by lawful deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, choſe ſome Miniſters of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for to make uſe of their Advice ſo far as it ſhould pleaſe them. Theſe Miniſters who had no Deputation, nor Repreſentation, nor Authority from
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100918:109"/>
the Body of the Engliſh Church, and having divers Lay perſons joyned with them, who wholly govern them, mould a Religion all new, defame the reputation of the Church and Confeſſion, to which they had ſworn Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; invite to their aid Forreign Churches, as their brethren, and ordain that which ſerves the intention of their Maſters.</p>
            <p>We know that amongſt theſe Divines, there were ſome men of Merit, Perſons which we know, had it been in their power, would have overcome evill with good; but amongſt pieces of gold, there is many times a great deal of ſmall money, like unto our clipped half Teſtors; they are the little heads without learning.</p>
            <p>If the two Houſes had aſſembled the body of the Clergy, as was propoſed to them by his Majeſty, they had found themſelves filled with Orthodox Perſons, and they cannot complain if thoſe perſons whom they had moſt deſire to, received not the publike cenſure of the Clergy, ſince they would not permit the Clergy to aſſemble themſelves; neither can they complain, that any guilty hath gone unpuniſhed, for they have taken a ſure courſe, for by the univerſal ruine of the Deans and Chapiters, they have involved the innocent with the guilty.</p>
            <p>Hearken what the King ſaid hereupon: <hi>I was content to accord and render to the Preſbyter</hi> (that is to ſay, to the Body of Paſtors) <hi>all the right which with reaſon and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they could pretend in their conjunction with the Epiſcopal degree, but to ſuffer them wholly to invade the Eccleſiaſtical Power, and to cut off altogether with the ſword, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this ancient Order, for to inveſt themſelves in it, it was that which I accounted neither juſt, in regard of the Biſhops, nor ſure nor profitable in regard of the Presbyter himſelf, neither any way convenient for the Church or State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A right and good Reformation might have been eaſily produced by moderate Councils, and I am perſwaded ſuch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100918:110"/>
Councils would have given more contentment, even to thoſe very Divines, who have been perſwaded, with much gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and formality, to ſerve the deſigns of others, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, many of them now acknowledge, although they dare not make their diſcontent appear for finding themſelves fruſtrated of their intentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am very well aſſured, that the true method to reform the Church, cannot ſubſiſt with the perturbation of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil State, and that Religion cannot juſtly be advanced in depreſſing Loyalty; which is one of the principal ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients and ornaments of true Religion; for after the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to fear God, the next following is, to honour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I make no doubt but the Kingdome of Chriſt may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, without pulling down mine; and in a time free from partialities, its impoſſible any ſhould paſs for a good Chriſtian, who ſhews not himſelf a good Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Government of Chriſt ſerves to confirm mine, and not to overthrow it, for as I acknowledge, I hold my power of him, ſo I deſire to exerciſe it for his glory, and the good of his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any one had ſincerely propoſed the Government of Chriſt, or underſtood in their heart what it required, they would never have been ſo ill governed in their words and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as well towards me, as one towards another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the good ends cannot juſtifie the evil wayes, ſo alſo the evil beginnings cannot produce good concluſions, unleſs God by a miracle of mercy make Light to ſpring out of Darkneſs, Order out of our Confuſion, and Peace from our unruly Paſsions.</hi> This is ſpoken as a King, as a Phyloſopher and as a good Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Our enemies to blind the eyes of their Neighbours, made them believe a long time that they deſired ſuch a reformation as theirs, but the hypocriſie of this profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeared then, when the King offered to aſſemble a National Synod, and to invite the Neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100918:110"/>
to it, whom theſe people would ſeem to imitate. And this the good King would never have named, had he not an intention to defer much to their Judgement. But of this his Majeſty could never obtain an anſwer; for it was that which the Independents feared above all, and we ſee not that the Presbyterians did any way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this propoſition; the actions both of the one and the other were ſuch, that it was the ſureſt courſe for them to palliate them with Declarations ſent a far off, rather then to have them brought to light here at home in a Synod; and they were very well content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Neighbours to their Society, but not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to their Counſel. They have hereby made it appear, that it was not reformation, but the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Church they purſued; otherwiſe they would have imbraced the propoſition of his Majeſty, and the requeſt of the Clergy, who deſired nothing more then to be heard in a lawful Synod, and to reform willingly, that which was diſpleaſing to ſome. But this had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted the deſigns of their enemies, who then ſhould have had no pretext to ruine the Clergy, and enrich themſelves with their ſpoils, and take from Monarchy the ſupport of the Church, if the Eccleſiaſticks had been reformed.</p>
            <p>Then let the rage and invective malice of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies greaten our faults in quality and number, as much as they can, let them make ſmall ſpots, impoſthumes; Let them paint us out in falſe colours, and disfigure us like devils to the eyes of all the world; All that the ſevereſt Juſtice can require of us, is to amend and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit our ſelves to the cenſure of a lawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and then when a great King, who is ſubject to none but God, ſhall come to them, and offer to change that which hath been practiſed or tolerated, and to lend his ear to receive better information. O this was a grace capable to molifie hearts of ſtone, and to turn the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100918:111"/>
complaints of his ſubjects into acclamations of joy and praiſes.</p>
            <p>But they will neither the grace of the King, nor our amendment. To theſe offers of the King ſo ſincere and frequent, they anſwered not but by complaints and blowes, and they conſulted not of means to correct us, but to deſtroy us; they will not take the pains to cleanſe the Church, they will cut it up by the root, root and branch. 'Tis the Watch-word of the ſeditious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they pretend to know thoſe that are of the godly party; and they have alſo put an unnatural maxime in the mouth of the furious and blind people, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation muſt be made in blood. This they call to renew, or revive the Church; but it's as the Daughters of <hi>Pelias</hi> undertook to make their Father young again, who to that end cut his throat to let his old blood paſs out of his body, but after, it was not in their power to put in new. God keep us from them who come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church their Mother with a Sword, and that would cut our throats to make us young again. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholding Chyrurgeons coming to let us blood with a Sword in both hands, we have reaſon to withdraw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſafe quarter, and to fear a healing which will not take away the evil, but in taking away our life.</p>
            <p>We dare ſay for our Clergy, that if it ſhould coſt them their lives to redeem the peace of their King and State, they would account them well imployed, and willingly conſent to be caſt over-board with <hi>Jonas,</hi> that their loſs might appeaſe the tempeſt.</p>
            <p>This is of greateſt anguiſh and affliction, to ſee Murther paſs for Piety, then to ſuffer in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and they cheerfully wiſh, that a potion of their blood could quench the heat of their bloody zeal.</p>
            <p>This zeal appeared in the title of <hi>Sions Plea,</hi> and in the book called, <hi>Chriſt on his Throne.</hi> The firſt pleads
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100918:111"/>
for the Presbyterian, the other for the Independent.

            <head>CHAP. XXI. An Anſwer to the Objection, That the King made War againſt the Parliament.</head>
            <p>IT'S the ordinary complaint of the Covenanters, that the King made War againſt his Parliament, a phraſe which ſeems tacitly to imply, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt his Superiours; and indeed there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that underſtood it ſo in good earneſt, conceiving the Parliament to be above the King. And hereupon it was declared by the Houſe of Commons at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> That the Kings coming to their Houſe was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if the Majeſty reſided in the Commons, but how ridiculous and falſe this is, hath heretofore been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and yet they could in no other ſenſe call the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> his Parliament, ſince they had taken up Arms againſt his Majeſty; doubtleſs thoſe of both Houſes, who adhered to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> without compariſon the more conſiderable in quality, were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Parliament, for theſe were for him, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt him.</p>
            <p>Moreover by this frequent expreſſion, they would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignifie, that the King was the Aggreſſeur, and he that firſt aſſaulted them; a thing which they have much laboured to perſwade the world, although it be notoriouſly known that his enemies had ſeized upon his Forts, Towns, Magaziens, Ships, Revenues, and Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souldiers, before ever the King had ſo much as one ſingle company of Horſe, or Foot. When he firſt came to <hi>York,</hi> he had not ſo much as his ordinary guards, whereas his enemies had all the ſtrength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they wanted only God on their ſide: and this great
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100918:112"/>
power encouraged the ſeditious in all countries where he paſſed to entertain him with the ſame courteſie the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſites</hi> received Chriſt Jeſus, beſeeching him to depart out of their quarters, and the good King had then this conformity with his Saviour, that he had not where to lay his head. He was then in a condition to ſuffer, but his enemies in a poſture to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>When he would in a peaceable manner without Arms enter into his Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> he found the gates ſhut, and the walls garniſhed with Souldiers, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Muskets againſt him; upon this his Majeſty levied fix companies of Foot, and two Cornets of Horſe, for the Guard of his Perſon, but ſet not up his Standard until four moneths after this prodigious act of hoſtility and rebellion, having often before endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reduce his Subjects to their obedience by all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and Chriſtian offers, witneſs a number of moſt excellent Declarations compoſed and written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wherein the world beheld the ſincerity of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with the piety and candor of his ſpirit, worthy ſo great a Prince.</p>
            <p>The Covenanters conſidering that they could not perſwade them who had any remembrance or common ſenſe, that the King began the War, laboured to prove that although they began, yet their Armies were but defenſive; affirming, that a War undertaken, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a juſt fear, was defenſive, yea although they ſtruck the firſt blow; and that they ſeized upon the Forts, Magaziens, and Revenues of the King, becauſe they feared he would make War upon them; That is to ſay, that they made War upon him, leaſt he ſhould make War upon them. A reaſon much like that of Count <hi>Gondomore,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who by his cunning and ſubtilty had wrought ſo far, as to have a gallant <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight to be condemned and put to death; being demanded what evil he had done
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100918:113"/>
that he ſo perſecuted him: Anſwered, That it was not for any evil he had done, but for that evil which he might do.</p>
            <p>But the Court that did it, had juſt reaſons, far from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſts; but in theſe mens dealings with the King, were he even a Subject, the injuſtice is both without reaſon, and without example: For, was there ever any Court of Juſtice, which condemned a man to loſe both his goods, and his life, not becauſe he had done any evil, but for fear he ſhould.</p>
            <p>That which would be moſt unjuſt againſt the meaneſt Subject, can it poſſibly be thought, and reputed a work of Piety and Juſtice againſt their lawful Soveraign? But leaving theſe perſons, who from the beginning had this Diabolical deſign, which ſince they have inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely executed; we will believe of many of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, that the intent of their Army was not to puniſh the King for the pretended exorbitancies of his paſt Government, although they laboured by all means to perpetuate the memory, and to ſtifle thoſe eminent and ſignal acts of grace, by which the King had merited the love of his people beyond all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. We are willing alſo to believe that ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them condemn the Doctrine of <hi>Goodman,</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince into ſad practice, <hi>That Judges ought to ſummon Princes before them for their offences, and proceed againſt them, as againſt other Criminals and Malefactors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were not then for the puniſhing of what was paſſed, it was for fear of the future, they took up Arms, which indeed is the only reaſon left them. For after the King had promiſed to give content to his people, in all their reaſonable requeſts repreſented to him, and they had taken the power out of his hands, then when he would have accompliſhed his promiſes; all the reaſon they give for ſo violent a proceeding is, <hi>That they durſt not truſt the King</hi>; Which verily is a moſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100918:113"/>
and injurious excuſe. Which is as if one had a Neighbour that dwelt by him, more mighty then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and whoſe diſpleaſure he feared, it ſhould be permitted him to watch his opportunity to ſurprize his houſe, ſeize upon his revenues, and drive from his poſſeſſions, to free and deliver him from fear? But ſuch an action as this from Subjects towards their Prince, is beyond all compariſon more unjuſt. The Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his Subjects, being not, Whether they may with confidence leave the Sword in the Kings hand? but whether God hath committed the Sword to the King to be born by him?</p>
            <p>Now in this their dealings with the King, they give him an evil example, for by the ſame reaſon he may take from his ſubjects the propriety, they have in their eſtates, becauſe he dares not truſt them, and finds by ſad experience, they uſe it for his deſtruction; And he ſhould have much more reaſon to do it, ſince the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects hold their Lands of the King; but the King holds not his power of the people; Prudence ought not to ſeize upon Juſtice. The care of a mans ſelf cannot give him a right to the goods of another: The duty of a Chriſtian is not to fortifie himſelf againſt his fears, but to obey the Commandments of God: But if his fear and forecaſt carries him beyond his duty, he ſhould above <hi>all fear him that can caſt both body and ſoul into hell. Yea, I ſay unto you, fear him,</hi> Luke 12.5. Taking then that which themſelves accord, that the Subjects took up Arms to ſecure themſelves againſt their fears; Had not the King as much reaſon to take up Arms after their example to provide againſt his? If he had been their equal, this reaſon had been ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, how much more then being their Soveraign, for the ſword that they had drawn againſt him, was his own; thoſe Forts, Towns, Ships, Arms and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, which they imployed againſt him, were his;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100918:114"/>
therefore he had a double reaſon to take up Arms, one to defend himſelf, and another to recover his own rights.</p>
            <p>By all Laws Divine and Humane, the King alone hath the power of the Sword, whoſoever ſtrikes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him is a murtherer. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> preaching to the Knights Templers of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>; to perſwade them from Duells,<note place="margin">Sermon <hi>1.</hi> of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers.</note> ſaith that two things are required to make a combat juſt and lawful; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a juſt cauſe, and obedience to a lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The laſt of theſe is the principal, and that alone which gives to Souldiers a juſt call, for in wars ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the intereſts of Princes are only known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and often the right and wrong being of two ſides, we eſteem it not neceſſary that every Souldier be perfectly ſatisfied of the Juſtice of the Armies of his Soveraign; but as for obedience to a lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, its a condition abſolutely requiſite to juſtifie the taking up of Arms of a Souldier, and there is no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor modification, that can be brought againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. <hi>21.</hi> Contra Faustum Cap. <hi>75.</hi>
               </note>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a juſt man bearing Armes under a ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, may juſtly obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, if he knowes not the war where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſerves, is againſt the Commandment of God, or if he be doubtful of it; So that the Prince may be faulty in commanding, and the Subject innocent in rendring the duty of his obedience:</hi> According to this wiſe Councel, if it be not palpably manifeſt that the commandment of the Prince do tranſgreſs the Laws of God, whom we muſt ever obey rather then men, the ſubject in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of war, be it forraign or civil, hath but one thing to conſider for conſcience; namely, where the lawful
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100918:114"/>
power is? Who he is to whom God hath committed the ſword, and who hath power to give it to others, and to whom God hath ſubjected him? in taking up the ſword at his command, we cannot do amiſs.</p>
            <p>This gives full ſatisfaction to their conſciences who took up Arms and fought for the King, for beſides the goodneſs of his defence which is juſt and neceſſary, if ever any were, they learn that it is poſſibly to fight juſtly for him, even when his cauſe may be unjuſt; but without him it is impoſſible to draw the ſword juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, much leſs againſt him, how juſt ſoever the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and fears of the contrary party that draws the ſword be. All lawful demands, religious intentions, ſpecious pretexts, pretended neceſſities, the publick good (the Maſque of all Rebellions) prayers, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Covenanting with God, all this and much more can never make a war juſt, which receives the ſword from him to whom God hath not given it, and draws it againſt him to whom God hath committed it.</p>
            <p>Therefore the principal of the Covenanters well perceiving this, endeavoured from the beginning to make the King either give them, or lend them the power of the Militia. In doing whereof, they did much wrong to their cauſe, for if they had the lawful power of the ſword, why did they then ſo often demand it of the King? And if they had it not, why did they draw the ſword without the lawful power, and againſt him to whom the power appertained by their own confeſſion? Why elſe ſhould they ask it of him? They either did injuſtice to the King to take from him the Militia, or elſe they did injuſtice to themſelves to demand it: Certainly by their importunity for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, they manifeſtly condemned themſelves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the Militia belonged to the King, and that they made the war without his authority, and therefore they had great need of many Sermons,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100918:115"/>
faſtings, prayers, proteſtations, Oaths upon Oaths, to bind in many knots this Covenant, which otherwiſe held by nothing; and to perſwade the people, that in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of the Lawful and Ordinary Power, they had an Extraordinary one, which was conducted by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>Rebellion is againſt nature, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Its as the ſin of Witchcraft</hi> or Divination, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſuch charms which for a time corrupts the uſe of reaſon, but cannot deſtroy the faculty, but at laſt the cloud will vaniſh and they ſhall retain nought, but the impreſſion of ſhame and aſtoniſhment for their paſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and an earneſt deſire of an acknowledgment. This natural notion is imprinted in the hearts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>That they ought to obey the King, and that to him pertaines the Power of Peace and War.</hi> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name of King will make even Souldiers ſpring from the ground to ſerve him, the Plow-ſhares ſhall furniſh him with Swords, and the Flayls and long Staffes ſhall fight ſo: his Crown. The Arms which they have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht from him, ſhall acknowledge their Maſter, and return of themſelves to him, as thoſe which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly taken from <hi>Ajax.</hi> It's a very hard thing to fight againſt nature: This appeared in the Counties of the Covenanters, wherein whilſt the King was Maſter, he raiſed Ten Thouſand men in Eight Daies, but after the Covenanters commanded in them, although they levied Souldiers continually, their Forces ever decreaſed, and thoſe they liſted in the day, disbanded and run away in the night. That if the ſecret judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God which would chaſtiſe us, had not rendred the people fearful and diſmayed for a time, ſuch was their number and hatred againſt the Party of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, that they had eaſily diſpatched the Countries againſt the King, though themſelves were diſarmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it muſt be in the end that Nature ſurmounts the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100918:115"/>
conſtraint, for the King is the center of the State, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all parts tend by their own proper weight, and wherein all the lines of the common intereſts ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
            <p>Their complaints of violence by the Kings Forces, are of no conſideration; the Armies of the King as well as thoſe of the Covenanters were not compoſed all of Saints, but theſe complaints ſound ill in their mouths, who lifted up their hands againſt their Soveraign, thoſe who had ſo often planted their Artilery againſt the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron where the perſon of the King was, and had ſhot fifty Cannon ſhot againſt the Queen in her bed, and after all this, cut off the Head of their lawful Soveraign, can they aſſume the impudence to complain of our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers taking away their poultry and killing their ſheep? If thoſe who were in actual Rebellion againſt their King, had been puniſhed by our Souldiers as they deſerved, they would never have had the power to complain that their houſes were plundered, or that they ſpoyled and deſtroyed their Goods: We dare maintain, that thoſe amongſt the Covenanters that ſuffered leſs than death, have ſuffered leſs than they deſerved; we do not deſire that every one ſhould be puniſhed according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, for we would not that God ſhould ſo deal with us, but that our enemies may know, both by the divine Law, and the Law of Nations, every perſon that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt his Prince, is guilty of death, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.18. and loſeth his propriety in his Goods and Poſſeſſions. Let them know alſo, that being deſtitute of lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the war, and drawing their ſwords againſt him that bears the ſword by Divine Authority, every ſtroak they ſtruck againſt the faithful Subjects of the King, they committed an execrable Murther, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.12. And every Penny they levied upon them, they committed Rapine, employing their Robberies to maintain Murther and Rebellion: If the Names of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100918:116"/>
theſe crimes offend their ears, the crimes themſelves ſhould much more afflict their Conſciences; theſe terms proceed not from paſſion, but flow from the neceſſary conſequence of this Truth, <hi>That the war of the Covenanters is deſtitute of all Authority, lawful and divine.</hi> Oh that every Chriſtian who hath drawn his ſword in this ſinful cauſe, would ſeriouſly conſider how he ſhould anſwer it before God and man, and that he may have horrour and dread in him for the evil he hath deſerved, and yet much more for that which he hath committed.</p>

            <p>BUT we cannot ſo ſlightly let them paſs with their fore-alledged excuſe for the War, that they durſt not truſt the King. The cauſe is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which is becauſe they had taken from him all the ground of reaſon that might be, that he ſhould truſt them; nothing being more to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted than a Depraved and Ill Faith: The King permitted them to perpetuate the Parliament as long as they pleaſed, he committed himſelf wholly over to their Faith, Affection and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if any thing obligeth a man to be faithful, it is to repoſe an entire and free confidence in him, and there is nothing more odious and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of man, than to employ that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and confidence they have freely committed to us, to deceive and ruine them. They themſelves after
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100918:116"/>
this ſignal favour, without example, often declared to the world, that if they ſhould abuſe ſo great a truſt to the dammage and detriment of his Majeſty, they ſhould be unworthy to live upon the earth, but this was before the Loyal Subjects had ſeparated themſelves from their company. They are then condemned by their own confeſſion, for that moſt ſignal Act of Truſt, ſuch as never King gave to his Subjects, they returned him the moſt infamous and perfidious Acts, and baſe ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that ever Subjects rendred to their King. He that ſaid, <hi>Fidelem ſi putaveris, facies,</hi> the means to make men faithful, was to think them ſo, was never known to theſe men.</p>
            <p>In Conſcience can ye believe that when the King committed to them this great power, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it thus, That when he ſhould refuſe to do any thing they requeſted him, he gave them liberty to force him to do it, or to do it without him, to take from him his Children, to ſeize upon his Revenues, to turn his Armies, Navies, and Forts againſt him, to make a broad Seal, and to break his, to diſpoſe of all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Crown, to levy Forreign Souldiers, and bring them into his Kingdom, to deprive his Subjects of their Goods and poſſeſſions, to drive the Miniſters of the Goſpel from their flocks, to rob the Church of her Revenues, to overthrow the ancient Laws of the Land, and to make a Religion all new? After all this, can any man wonder if they durſt not truſt the King? For where is the Criminal or Malefactor that dares commit himſelf to, or truſt the Judge? and where is the Cozener and Deceiver, who being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, dares truſt him whom he hath cozened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</p>
            <p>If by theſe vile actions they have violated the truſt the King repoſed in them, and if by the Act for the continuance of the Parliament, the King gave them a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100918:117"/>
power to deal thus with him, we refer our ſelves to the better part of the Parliament, who withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King, abhorring ſuch a prodigious violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publick faith, and of the duty of Subjects and Chriſtians unfaithfulneſs; they committed the like to the people, who deputed and committed to them the publick ſafety: For doubtleſs in their choice it never enter'd into the Spirits of them who ſent them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them with an abſolute power over their goods and perſons, much leſs over their King, for they could not give that which they had not, nevertheleſs they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted this power, caſting their fellow-Citizens out of their houſes and poſſeſſions, and gather'd together great treaſure out of the rents of the King and his Subjects, manifeſting themſelves very liberal of the goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>But they defend theſe actions by a new Maxime of State, invented upon this occaſion; Some of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Citizens of <hi>London</hi> being oppreſſed by their great and often Taxes, came to the Houſe, and repreſented to them that it was their duties to maintain the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the propriety of their goods, and beſeeched them, not to fall themſelves into that inconvenience which they were bound to remedy. The Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons anſwered them, that in truth the Subjects might plead the propriety of their goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, but not againſt the Parliament, to whom it appertained to diſpoſe of all the goods of the Kingdom; but to perſwade the people to believe this, is a very hard task, who rather judged, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whom they had choſen, had violated the publick faith and the truſt committed to them, and had taken that into their diſpoſing which was never committed them. Let theſe Gentlemen never hereafter ſpeak ſo loud of their publick faith, ſince they have loſt it, nor ever attempt to borrow more money upon ſo ſorry a caution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:100918:117"/>There were none in either Houſes who had not often taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, by which they acknowledge the King their Soveraign, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of none, and had ſworn to him loyalty and obedience. They moreover took the proteſtation made in the beginning of the Parliament, and impoſed upon the whole Kingdome, wherein alſo they ſwear the ſame thing. The Oath of the Covenant which was taken after, renew'd the ſame promiſe, and there they ſwore <hi>to defend the Perſon and Authority of the King, and cauſe the world to behold their fidelity, and that they would not in the leaſt thing diminiſh his juſt power, and greatneſſe.</hi> Conſider here (good Reader) Oaths enough to binde them to perform and keep their promiſe. But this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of oaths is a kind of proof of their ill faith, for they that ſwear often, manifeſt thereby, that they think themſelves unworthy to be believed, and diſtruſt, that every one miſtruſts them; It had been better for them to have been faithful to their King without ſwearing: for as in the Grammar Latine, two Negatives make an Affirmative, theſe on the contrary in ſtead thereof, would ſeem to make two Affirmatives to make one Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and that many oaths to be faithful to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign bound them to do the contrary; for in effect theſe laſt oaths were ſolely imployed to ruine the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Oath of Allegiance, for if their intentions had been ſimply to be faithful to their Soveraign, they needed have taken no other oath then the firſt. Therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe two new oaths, came the third, which they called the <hi>Negative Oath,</hi> in which they cauſed men to ſwear, <hi>That they ſhould neither directly, nor indirectly aſſiſt the King in this war.</hi> And thus behold in fine the mask taken off, and the intention of their former oaths unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater ſymptome of a deſperate ſick State, then the multiplication of oaths to form par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100918:118"/>
and factions; and we may ſay after the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> 23.10. <hi>The land mourns becauſe of Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the principals who impoſed the Oaths, they made uſe of them to halter, and intangle the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people, for to ſerve their ambition, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Doctrine of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who taught that men ought to be amuſed with oaths, as children with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and as for the people upon whom the oaths were impoſed, for the moſt part they took them rather for i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, then knowledge, or for fear, or from a blind zeal, or an implicit faith. Moreover the multitude of Oaths do imbaſe the dignity, and a people accuſtomed to them, reſpect no more an oath, then their old ſhoes. Thoſe alſo that ſwear often, are often forſworn, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing one oath with another.</p>
            <p>But the Oath of the Covenant hath this ſingular, wherein it ſurpaſſeth all <hi>Chymera's, Centaurs, Hypogriff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing that they would defend the Perſon and Authority of the King, and make the world behold their fidelity, according to their opinion they are bound to make war againſt him, and by virtue of this Oath, they perſecuted, rob'd, and after all depoſed him. Oh ſupreme degree of perfidy, and frantick blindneſs? Have we not whereat to mourn and lament, to behold theſe illuminated Reformers ſo plunged in the gall of bitterneſs, and bonds of iniquity, for to perſecute their good King with all rage and violence, becauſe they had ſworn to defend him, and to be faithful to him.</p>
            <p>This Oath was called Covenant, that is to ſay, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or confederation, becauſe thoſe that took it (for at preſent its forbidden to be taken) pretended to make an Alliance and Covenant with God: This Oath is yet in vogue in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It's their New Covenant,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100918:118"/>
beſides that of the New Teſtament, and the modern Canonical Scripture, which is Judge in all caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and from which there is no appeal.</p>
            <p>Their ill faith is moreover evident in the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Oath, and certainly it's the only thing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in the third Article, which is a diſcourſe ſo twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and interwoven, compoſed expreſly not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: <hi>There they ſwear to defend the Perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King in defence of Religion and the publique Liberty.</hi> It's very hard to ſay what that ſignifies, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good ſoul who ſuffer'd himſelf to be perſwaded to take this Oath, underſtood thereby, that to defend the Perſon of the King, was a neceſſary point, both to preſerve their Religion and Liberty, and that they could not fear God as they ought, without honouring the King; and thoſe that took the Oath in this ſenſe, were bound to fight againſt the Covenanters for the defence of their Religion and Soveraign.</p>
            <p>But the unworthy companions of the Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted it thus, that they bind themſelves to defend the Perſon and Authority of the King, ſo far forth as it is compatible with the defence of Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Now (ſay they) we find that the defence of the Perſon, and Authority of the King is incompatible with the defence of Religion, and the Publique Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore we are bound to oppoſe and ruine the King for the defence of Liberty and Religion. And thus it appears that this malicious obſcurity is a fold of the Serpent, and a lurking hole of the evil ſpirit, even the rather when we narrowly conſider this conſtruction, <hi>to defend one thing in defence of another,</hi> which ſignifies nothing, and wants both true Logick and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The Oath being a profeſſion before God, and the ſtrongeſt affirmation of all, had need to have been clear, and couched in ſuch terms, that every one might
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100918:119"/>
have underſtood it in the ſame ſenſe they took it; but to inſert ſuch equivocations, was to abuſe the Name of God, whom they took to witneſs, and the ſimplicity of the people. He that takes a forked Oath, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it not in the ſenſe that he that gives it, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it not at all, ſwears not in Truth, in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Judgement, which are the qualities required in an Oath, for he calls God to witneſs his hypocriſie, blindneſs and temerity.</p>
            <p>The ſame Article makes profeſſion <hi>of fidelity to the King, and to diminiſh nothing of his juſt Authority and greatneſs.</hi> It's no new thing for Rebels to take the Oath of Allegiance to their Soveraign, to combine a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt him. The Mutineers in the time of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second, took an Oath to be faithful to the King and people, and yet nevertheleſs made uſe of this Oath to ſtir up the people to ruine the King: And theſe did the like; and when hereupon we tax them with unfaithfulneſs, and breach of their Oath, they anſwer, and pay us with a diſtinction betwixt the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and perſonal capacity of the King, and they tell us that it was againſt <hi>Charles</hi> they made the Warre, and not againſt the King, making the King a pure Idea, an Accident without a Subſtance. It's very hard for them to ſay what became of the politick capacity of the King, then when they beheaded him in his perſonal capacity, for they ſo long honoured him in Idea, that at laſt they maſſacred him in ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>But they forget that in the ſame Article they had ſworn to be faithful to the Perſon of the King, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to defend <hi>his Perſon and Authority</hi>; as things conjoyned and inſeparable: So ſtrong is truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to Soveraignty, ſo natural to Subjects, that even in the Oath which they formed, to confederate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, their duty is couched in expreſs terms, which will one day be produced in judgement againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100918:119"/>But in good earneſt have we not much to wonder at, and to acknowledge the wrath of God, in the blindneſs of theſe men, that ſo many millions of men ſhould think they were bound to perſecute the King to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and to take away his goods, honour, liberty, ſafety, and at laſt his life; becauſe they had ſworn <hi>to defend the Perſon and Authority of the King, and make the world behold their fidelity, and that they would diminiſh nothing of his juſt Power and Authority:</hi> Is it poſſible that their by-got zeal could ſo diſlocate their brains, and a-brutiſh their ſpirits, as to make them commit ſo many crimes and enormities, upon ſo unreaſonable a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. <hi>Oh Lord create in us a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth Article of this Oath, they promiſe to endeavour with all their power, to bring to condigne puniſhment all thoſe who were the cauſe of ſeparating the King from his people; and according to this, it was, they made the people believe a long time, that the occaſion of their taking up Arms was to bring the King to his Parliament; but the hypocriſie of proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is now clearly manifeſted, for when the King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to return to his Parliament, they utterly refuſed to receive him; telling him plainly if he came, he <hi>ſhould come at his peril.</hi> Forbidding all perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, under pain of death, to receive or entertain him in their houſes. Let all good ſubjects who have taken this Oath, open now at laſt their eyes, and acknowledge that the intentions of their Guides, was quite contrary to their profeſſions.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Article required every perſon to ſwear; <hi>That this cauſe touched the Glory of God, the happineſs of the three Kingdomes, and the Dignity of the King.</hi> Indeed this cauſe touched the Glory of God with ſuch fowl hands, as have defiled it as much as poſſible men could, and it touched the happineſs of the three Kingdomes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100918:120"/>
with ſuch malignant claws, as have torn them to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But if they will that we take them in their ſenſe, namely, that their cauſe defends and advanceth the Glory of God, the happineſs of the Kingdomes, and the Dignity of the King, we behold and feel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But grant that this ſhould be true, 'tis not a thing for which we muſt ſwear. Oaths are of two ſorts; the one ſort are to affirm the truth of a thing preſent or paſt, the other for to promiſe and oblige our will for the future; theſe two ſorts of Oaths cannot be taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The Oath of the Covenant is of the latter; and therefore it is very ill done of them to confound it with the firſt, which is altogether of another nature and uſage, and in a promiſe for the future; to thruſt in an affirmation of a thing preſent, yea, of a thing falſe, or at leaſt doubtful, and whereof they of their party are not accorded.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that this Oath were of the firſt ſort, the things which we ſhould affirm upon Oath, are ſuch as require the teſtimony of the perſon who ſwears: Such are all queſtions of fact. But as for queſtions of right, they ought not, neither can they be decided by Oath; and it is to want common ſenſe, to make his neighbour judge, to know which is the true Religion, and to judge whether the Cauſe of the Parliament is better then the Kings. There the Oath loſeth his uſe, for its made to perſwade and give Authority to the thing, by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the perſon. If the Cauſe of the Covenant be the Cauſe of God, there is no need to ſwear it, but to juſtifie it by reaſon and practice. And although we ſhould even believe that it ſearcheth and advanceth the Glory of God, the happineſs of the Kingdome, and dignity of the King, it were unjuſt and ridiculous, to preſs us to ſwear it; for moral truths, and even alſo Theological, ought to be believed, not ſworn. Civil
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100918:120"/>
things only, and thoſe amongſt them which are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, ought only to be affirmed by oath; we have a very firm belief of the truth of many points of Religion, and of the honeſty of divers perſons, and yet nevertheleſs, for all the world, we would not ſwear to them; all who have any ingenuity, or good ſenſe acknowledge, that to force us to affirm the goodneſs of the Covenant by Oath, is an extreme tyranny, and full of ignorance and abſurdities. And alſo ſeeing we are very ill ſatisfied of the goodneſs thereof, its ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyranny to make us ſwear to defend it; and a moſt barbarous cruelty, to confiſcate our poſſeſſions, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter our Miniſters of their benefices, becauſe they refuſe to take ſo unreaſonable an Oath, and yet all this was practiſed during the Presbyterian Reign.</p>
            <p>The Articles of the Covenant were aſſiſted with a Religious Prologue and Epilogue, full of proteſtations of zeal and repentance, and therefore it was almoſt impoſſible, but the moſt part of them that took it ſhould be perjured, conſidering the generality of the people are evil. And this ſhould have prevented the Gentlemen to impoſe the Covenant indifferently upon all, under ſuch great penalties. For as they will not ſuffer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the people, for fear to encreaſe their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: They ſhould have by the ſame reaſon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their principles, have withheld to adminiſter theſe proteſtations of zeal and repentance, to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whoſe diſpoſition they were ignorant of.</p>
            <p>Now a great evidence of their depraved and evil Faith, conſiſts in their proteſtations of ſanctity and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative expreſſions of zeal; in which the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent party who rejected the Covenant, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, fly higher then their Predeceſſors; All their Ordinances, and Declarations, yea even their Letters of News, were ſallies of zeal. All their murthers and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100918:121"/>
robberies were to eſtabliſh the purity of the Goſpel, to conquer a Kingdome for Jeſus Chriſt, and that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might reign and flouriſh.</p>
            <p>If they ſpeak of the abominable parricide commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt their Soveraign, they ſay that God made bare the Arm of his Holineſs, that the Lord is on their right hand, that he hath ſmote Kings in the day of his wrath, and that they may waſh their feet in the blood of the ungodly. Thus they made their horrible crimes march diſguiſed in terms of Scripture, and the devil borrowed the language of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever ſhall well conſider the uſe they made of the Scripture, and whereto they imployed their great ſhew of holineſs, ſhall find an Anſwer to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the 50 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>But to the wicked God ſaith, what haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy mouth.</hi> Behold here the work of the Covenanters; they declare the Statutes of God, and take his Covenant into their mouths, to put on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the mask of Religion, and to inveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without trouble, of the Authority and Revenues of the Crown, the goods of the Church, and without ſuſpition to grope the purſes of the people; for the outward ſhew of devotion, doth much amuſe the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and gain their belief; for who can fear any evil from thoſe who ſo piouſly invite them to repentance, and the advancement of the Glory of God? who would not confide and truſt in them that declare the Statutes of God, and take his Covenant in their mouth? Satan in all forms is dangerous, but he is never ſo pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as when he clothes himſelf as an Angel of Light, and it is ill going Proceſſion when the Devil carries the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Moreover by their fruits ye ſhall know them. How often abuſed they the credulity of the people, when they <hi>conjured them to help to fetch the King from his evil
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100918:121"/>
Councellors, and to bring him gloriouſly to his great and faithful Councel,</hi> that is to ſay, to themſelves; but their faithfulneſs appeared then when he departed from them whom they called his evil Councellors, to yeeld himſelf up to them; for then their terrible mennaces againſt him, and all thoſe who ſhould dare to receive him, forced this poor Prince to travel diſguiſed in great danger of his life through their Armies which beſieged <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to go and caſt himſelf into the arms of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as a chaſed Boar caſts himſelf into the toils.</p>
            <p>He found by ſad experience in this his miſerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, that the Covenanters were of the ſame Genius in other Nations, and of the ſame evil Faith. It imports not much whether it be true or falſe, which was ſaid of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they had ſecretly invited him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to expoſe both their goods and lives for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſafety; but how ever it was, they were bound by their natural duty to do ſo: But inſtead of rendring him the duties of faithful ſubjects, as crafty Merchants they made their profit of him; for after they had kept him captive ſome moneths, at length they drew two great benefits by him; the one upon their promiſe to imploy their Armies for his ſervice, they made uſe of his Authority, to make that Miracle of Valour and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, the Marqueſs of <hi>Mentr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon which this moſt wiſe Prince, being demanded whether he had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with his Scottiſh Subjects, or go to his Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> anſwered with an excellent grace and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, <hi>Without queſtion, I muſt be with thoſe who have bought me, and not with thoſe who have ſold me.</hi> And in his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100918:122"/>
meditation upon this ſubject, <hi>Since I am thus ſold by them, I am only afflicted for the evil they have done, and to behold my ſelf valued at a higher price then my Saviour.</hi> Theſe words proceeding from a quick and well govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit, a King of his paſſions, and ſo conforming himſelf to the paſſion and obedience of the Sonne of God, cannot be heard, nor read by good Chriſtians with the ſame moderation they were pronounced; but this magnanimous patience, ſhould produce in every pious ſoul, a moſt juſt execration of this the moſt baſe and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous treachery, that hath been committed ſince that of <hi>Judas,</hi> and which in iniquity yields only to the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable paracide, to whom he was deliver'd by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous ſale.</p>
            <p>It matters not much what is ſaid hereupon, that the <hi>Scots</hi> in delivering up the perſon of the K. to the Gent. at <hi>Weſtmin.</hi> drew from them a promiſe to treat him with ſafety, liberty and honor; for they ought not impoſe upon other then themſelves, this duty which was natural to them. Neither could they expect that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould render him that ſafety, liberty and honor, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves refuſed him, or that the buyers ſhould not as well ſearch to make their profit by him, as the ſellers, and to reimburſe themſelves with uſury by his ruine.</p>
            <p>But for their care they took of the K. when they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him, let us do them the favour to paſs by their perfidiouſneſs, and behold how the Gent. at <hi>Weſtm.</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their promiſe to treat the K. with ſafety, liberty and honor. Behold how they led him captive to <hi>Holmby</hi> houſe, where they ſet a guard of ſouldiers, his enemies upon him, denied him his Revenues, Rights, liberty, children, ſervants, and (that which with greateſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he deſired) his Chaplins, and the free exerciſe of his conſcience, extremely miſuſing him with inſolent threatnings and injurious demands,</p>
            <p>And for all this the <hi>Scots</hi> never ſeemed to be moved or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100918:122"/>
troubled, whilſt the K. was in the Presbyterian parties cuſtody. But when the Independents had ſeiſed vpon his perſon, although his captivity was a little ſweetned over it was before, the <hi>Scotch</hi> began to demand aloud the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their promiſes for his liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Gent. at <hi>Weſt.</hi> made a Declaration, to break and null all their former promiſes of loyalty, and reſpect made to his Majeſty by this Parl. <hi>Telling the Scots, that theſe promiſes were formed, publiſhed, and imploid according as the ſtate of affairs then ſtood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Husbands</hi> in his book of Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, p. 557. and 663.</note> 
               <hi>but they might now be altered, and yet nevertheleſs theſe promiſes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the perſon and authority of the K. had been made with the ſolemneſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt proteſtations, we proteſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in the preſence of Almighty God, which is the ſtrongeſt bond of a Chriſtian, and the publick faith, the moſt ſolemn that any State can give, that neither adverſity nor ſucceſs ſhall ever cauſe us to change our reſolutions.</hi> Now at this day it ſadly appears how much they reſpect the preſence of Almighty God, and how much they find themſelves obliged by the ſtrongeſt obligation of a Chriſtian, and the Publick Faith, the moſt ſolemn that the body of an eſtate can give. It is to be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe there is a God, or that he is Almighty, or ſo juſt as to call them before him in Judgment for the prophanation of his moſt Holy Name.</p>
            <p>Before theſe Gentlemen did openly manifeſt that they would not grant the King neither liberty, honour, nor ſafety, they ſet awork their hypocriſie and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Independent Army having taken away the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King from the Presbyterians, began to uſe him more Honorably, but not out of love to him, but in hatred to his former Goalers, and to flatter and lull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep the Royal Party, and for this effect this Army made ſome Declarations in favour of his Majeſty. See here ſome of their expreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:100918:123"/>
               <hi>Foraſmuch as a ſcandalous information hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the two Houſes, importing that his Majeſty is kept priſoner amongſt us, and uncivilly and barbarouſly dealt with, we judge our ſelves bound to declare that this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and all other of the ſame nature, are moſt falſe and abſolutely contrary, not only to our requeſts, but alſo to our principles. And a little after, we profeſs openly that we ſee not how there can be any firm or durable peace in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without a due conſideration and proviſion for the rights, repoſe and immunities of his Majeſty and his Royal Family. And in another place they promiſe, that until ſuch time as there be made a ſettlement, his Majeſty ſhall find amongſt them all civil and perſonal reſpect, with all reaſonable Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us next ſee how they performed this promiſe, after they found this great Prince inflexible to all their unjuſt and diſhonourable propoſitions, and eſpecially to thoſe which concerned the ruine of the Church, they reſtrained his liberty, and ſet over him more inſolent guards in his houſe at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court; at which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> who was then in effect chief of the league, ſeemed to be much troubled, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the life of his Majeſty, and therefore perſwaded him to eſcape by night, and to ſave himſelf out of ſuch wicked hands into the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi>; for being reſolved to charge the King with a criminal proceſs, which was the way as he thought moſt proper for the deſigns of his ambition, then privately to make him away; but he durſt not proceed thus far, whilſt the King was ſo neer the gates of <hi>London,</hi> and in the heart of his Kingdome, the hearts whereof he poſſeſſed. I will not undertake to ſound the myſteries of iniquity of this Agent of Satan, but ſhew you a piece of his perfidiouſneſs, and profound hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>The night before the King ſtole from <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, <hi>Cromwell</hi> came to viſit him, cauſing all perſons to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100918:123"/>
out of the Chamber, except Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> in whom he only confided, and taking the King aſide, had a long diſcourſe with him, which <hi>Huntington</hi> could not hear, but could well behold his paſſionate geſture, which witneſſed a ſingular freedome and affection. <hi>Cromwell</hi> at his departure caſt himſelf upon his knees, and took the King by the hand, kiſſing it many times, wetting it with his tears, and at length lifting up his voice, ſaid to him: <hi>Sir, ſo God bleſs me and my children, as I am reſolved to endeavour to place you and your children in your rights and dignities</hi>; after this, approaching to <hi>Huntington, Major</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tarry with the King, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> there happen any thing now this night, take a good horſe, and come with all ſpeed and acquaint me.</hi> This night then the King paſſed ſecretly the Thames, and taking poſt, caſt himſelf into the trap they had laid for him in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired place: So ſoon as <hi>Huntington</hi> knew of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the King, and whether he was gone, he went in all haſt to give advice to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that the King had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> who beholding him aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and amazed at this ſudden change, laughed at him, telling him, <hi>That the King was there where he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that there wanted nothing now to the ſatisfying of his deſires, but that all his children were there with him.</hi> This hiſtory is atteſted by <hi>Huntington</hi> himſelf, a perſon of credit and repute, whoſe eyes this action and the like hath opened, and turned his heart towards the King his Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Now the King being confined into this little Iſland, where all the avenues might eaſily be kept by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the other Gentlemen of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the Mask was preſently taken off at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and in the Army, and all their oaths and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to maintain the perſon and authority of the King, were changed into loud cries, in calling for Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, to which the Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> eaſily
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100918:124"/>
condeſcended, and for this effect declared him inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to govern; charged him with all the crimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could deviſe, forbidding all perſons to make any more addreſſes to him: But in this fair way, they had ſome diſturbance, by thoſe Parties that in the year 1648. roſe for the King, but God juſtly provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſinful Nation, ſuffered injuſtice to triumph through the diſloyaly of perſons, who having until that time born Arms againſt the King, took part with him expreſly to betray and ruine him.</p>
            <p>And thus from the beginning to the end of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, falſhood hath plaid his part, and at length this juſt Prince loſt his life by the hand of thoſe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who had called Heaven and Earth to witneſs their Loyalty and Affection; and this is very admirable and memorable to all ages, how the Conſcience and conſtancy of the King took a way altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the Covenanters, for whilſt the Covenanters ſwore themſelves to deſtroy him, he would do neither the one, nor the other to ſave his life, or Crown; for its manifeſt that there was a time, wherein if the King would have promiſed that which he was reſolved not to have kept, he had in a ſhort time been put into ſuch a condition (according to all humane appearances) as would have put him out of the power of all the diſcontented to conſtrain him to have kept his promiſe.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs the laſt Act of this hideous Treaſon, without letting the world behold another piece of the damnable Hipocriſie of <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi> The day aſſigned for the Execution of the King being come, the Councel of War ſate, which was then the Great Councel of the Kingdom: A Letter without Name was addreſſed to this Councel to repreſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſeemed to be much touched at it, (which cauſed ſome ſuſpicions, as though he himſelf underhand had procured it) and propoſed it to the conſideration of the Councel, part of this company began to yeeld to the force of Juſtice, and their duty, and to lean towards compaſſion: <hi>Cromwel</hi> beholding this made a turn to the door, and ſent one of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to thoſe to whom the Execution was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to command them to diſpatch the buſineſs: Then returning to the Councel Table, made a long Diſcourſe ſhewing the inconvenience of this executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and adviſed them ſo to ſecure the perſon of the King for the time to come, that he might neither do nor receive hurt. This Diſcouſe was ſeconded by others, and then again re-aſſumed by himſelf with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to lengthen the Conſultation, until that one briskly entring into the Chamber told them, Gentlemen, You may ceaſe to conſult, the work is done, the King is executed: Upon this <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> ſuddenly fell upon his knees with ſigns of great devotion, crying out, That this was the work of God, and a true ſtroak of heaven, the Councel being diſpoſed to ſave his life, but the Divine juſtice would not ſuffer ſo much innocent blood ſhed by this Tyrant to paſs unpuniſhed, and hereupon made an eloquent Prayer to give glory to God, and acknowledge his providence.</p>
            <p>And from this Hiſtory I leave the Reader to draw a Character of this Perſon, whoſe perpetual method was to make his Impoſtures to paſs for miraculous and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine managements. When he would make his Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons paſs into publike reſolutions, he would ſuborn a Prophet or Propheteſs, who ſhould come and find him in full Councel, or in the head of his Army, for to enjoyn him on the behalf of God, that which before he had reſolved; he cauſed all the Councels he propoſed to paſs for motions of the bleſſed Spirit, therefore if
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100918:125"/>
his Councels and Actions did ill accord with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding profeſſions, his inſpirations from above excuſed all, and he laid all the fault upon God; when any mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his Proteſtations made to preſerve the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, and reſtore him to his Dignities: He would Anſwer, That it was indeed his Intention, but that when he ſought God to open him a way for the performance, God had ſilenced him, and ſhewed that it would not be acceptable to him. His partie ſeriouſly give him this commendation, <hi>That he was ſo affected with the glory of God, that if he had promiſed any thing with the moſt ſolemn and holy adjurations, and that afterward God ſhould put it into his ſpirit, That the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what he had promiſed was moſt expedient for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he preſently forgot all his Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore when he had the K. in his power at <hi>Hampt. Court,</hi> and often conferred with him; his Majeſty expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his perplexity to perſons of Honour, telling them, <hi>I cannot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>treat with theſe people upon any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who refer me to their inſpirations, for that which they promiſe me to day, they contradict too morrow, if the Spirit dictate to them</hi>; but you muſt note that the Spirit never dictates any thing to them but for their profit.</p>
            <p>The wrath of God is great againſt us in ſuffering us to be ruined and deſtroyed by fraud and hypocriſie, but verily his indignation is yet greater againſt thoſe who are ſeduced; for it is a leſſer evil to be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Devil, then to miſtake him for the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider other Acts of the evil faith of the Covenanters. How have the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwered the intentions of thoſe that ſent them? Was it the deſire of thoſe Countries and places for which they ſerved, that the Divine Service ſo much loved by the people ſhould be taken away, and their Miniſters driven from their Benefices, and

And it would be very hard to tell, who gave them the power to diſpoſe of the goods and lives of the people, and to govern the Kingdome by an Army, of which <hi>England</hi> hath never hope to be delivered, but by an abſolute victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obtained by the King. Of theſe high actions of Preſumption and Tyranny, warranted by no Authority, and upheld onely by the ſtrength of Arms, they muſt render account to God, and ſince they maintain that the Soveraignty reſides in the people, they muſt alſo one day give an account to the people of their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>They made an Ordinance, That no Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould exerciſe any Office in the State, but how well did they keep it? Did they not make amongſt themſelves a Monopoly of all the gainful Offices? They gave out they would give an account of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure expended of the State, but in the mean while they followed the Councel of <hi>Pericles,</hi> which was to ſtudie how never to give any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:100918:126"/>They invited the people to preſent their plaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Members, but thoſe who dared to do it were ruined in the proſecution, and ſerved as a ſad example to all others to beware and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from ſo dangerous an enterpriſe for the future.</p>
            <p>They have alſo forced the Conſciences of men to break their Faith, witneſs the breach of Articles ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> whereby the Gentlemen engaged on both parties, were mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obliged to lay down their Arms and live in peace, but the Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> frighted with this <hi>Hideous</hi> name of Peace, declared this accord <hi>Null,</hi> as deſtructive to their affairs; for both the Devil and the Covenanters maintain themſelves by diſſention.</p>
            <p>They forced the <hi>Londoners,</hi> taken and releaſed by the King at the Battel of <hi>Brainsford,</hi> to take up Arms againſt him the ſecond time, againſt their Faith ſworn to his Majeſty, who moſt graciouſly gave them both their Lives and Liberty, releaſing them without any ranſome.</p>
            <p>But as for them they wickedly maſſacred thoſe who yielded themſelves upon their promiſe of life, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the gallant and noble Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>They being thus habituated in diſloyalty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, their great quarrel againſt the late King of bleſſed and glorious memory was, That he would not break his Faith, nor falſifie his Oath he took at his Coronation, to maintain the Rights and Priviledges of the Church, and to defend the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>And as they were perfidious to us, ſo were they alſo to one another, they falſified their faith to their Army, which had too well fought for them, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and disbanded them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their pay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:100918:126"/>But another Army paid them for this perfidiouſneſs by another. The Independent Troops were thoſe which profeſſed to them fidelity with the greateſt zeal: And theſe were they which unrooſted them at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and pull the Gentlemen out of their Thrones, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there, only ſuch as pleaſed them.</p>
            <p>And in paſſing, let us mark another ſeat of activity, of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he perſwaded the Houſe of Commons to caſheer this Army, promiſing them that he would lay down his Arms at their feet, but he gave them this counſel only for to provoke and irritate the Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and to ruine them, as indeed it did.</p>
            <p>Then when the Army began to preſent criminal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations againſt the King, they ſent an Embaſſie of ſix Collonels to the Houſe of Lords to keep them quiet, promiſing to maintain their priviledge of Peerage, but as ſoon as the King was beheaded, they caſheered the Houſe of Lords, and thoſe Lords having baſely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their Head to the ſlaughter, preſently loſt the Life of Honour, which flowed from thence upon them, and were moſt juſtly laid aſide as dead and unprofitable members.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> alſo for having been too faithful to their Brethren in Rebellion, were paid with the like treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for all that power and intereſt which they ought to have had in the affairs of both Kingdoms, according to the Articles of their League, was denied them with ſcorn and inſultation.</p>
            <p>Amongſt our miſeries, this is a recreative ſpectacle to us, to behold the Thieves who pillaged us, to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and rob one another, and to deal treacherouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves after they betray'd us.</p>
            <p>To their diſloyalty let us joyn their falſhood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſted the Foundation and Building of all their Fabrick. This appeared ſingularly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100918:127"/>
of the Covenant. Then the Gentlemen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered daily ſome Treaſon or other, with as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility as the Labourer finds his work.</p>
            <p>News of <hi>England,</hi> written from <hi>Spain, France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Denmark,</hi> Politick Diſcourſes of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Mariner, to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hoſtler, of Armies kept under ground by the King, to cut the Throats of all the Proteſtants in a night; and the greateſt danger of all, which cauſed the chiefeſt fear to the ſubtle ſpirits of <hi>London,</hi> was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign laid for a mine of Powder under the <hi>Thames,</hi> to cauſe the River to drown the City; but this dangerous enterpriſe was diſcovered a little before the Execution, whereupon the devout people very conſcientiouſly gave thanks to God, and they took ſpecial order for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the <hi>Thames</hi> ſhould not be blown up. In two or three moneths theſe Treaſons amounted to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of nine and thirty, according to the account of a venerable Member of the Houſe of Commons, in one of his Speeches. This indeed was the time they had moſt need of them to form a Party.</p>
            <p>They made uſe of the ſame path according to their occaſions; after a defeat, they uſed to keep a day of Thankſgiving for a victory; if the King offered peace to his Subjects, they gave ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XXIII. Of the Inſtruments both Parties made uſe of, and of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs.</head>
            <p>LET us now come to the accuſation which made the lowdeſt noiſe: Our enemies reproached the King, that he made uſe of wicked Inſtruments. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to their great regret, that the perſon of the King was without blame, they caſt all the ſins of his Court and Armies upon him. But we will ſee what Inſtruments the two Parties ſerved themſelves with, and whether the conſideration of the Inſtruments can alter the nature of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all let us make our advantage of that which our enemies are forced to yield us, for envy which tare a pieces thoſe which ſerved the King, found nothing to faſten on, in his perſon, yea though conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually endeavoured, even after his death, when the Covenanters entertained, and yet do, Writers in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100918:128"/>
pay, to write ſandalous and defamatory Libels againſt his ſacred Majeſty.</p>
            <p>There was never Rebel which called not his Prince unjuſt, otherwiſe they would condemn their own party of injuſtice: But the open converſation of the King was a ſubject very improper, either for the detracter or flatterer; he lived not obſcure and hidden as the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> but made appear to the eyes of all the world what he was, as the Sun makes himſelf ſeen to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe by his own proper light.</p>
            <p>This Prince whom the Covenanters perſecuted under colour of Piety and Reformation, was four times a day upon his knees at his devotion, was guided by the fear of God, and comforted by his Love, made his Word the Rule of his Belief and Actions, humbled himſelf in his adverſities under his mighty hand, and repoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a firm Faith upon the ſame hand which ſmote him. His diſcourſes were honeſt, religious, pertinent and judicious, and his Writings were the ſame; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhined forth a Vigor and Majeſty truly Royal. And the ſanctity of his retired Meditations, which are now publick, will for ever fill all good ſouls with conſolation and inſtruction, and his enemies with confuſion, He was a Prince ſober, continent, temperate, a ſpirit compoſed by ſingular Geometry, ſo equal in all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, that it is hard to ſay, to which paſſion he was moſt enclined.</p>
            <p>Greatneſs arms vices with power, and tempts the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by the facility; and the Devil hath his Agents in the Courts of Princes, who obſerve and watch their humours, and advertiſe them of all the evil they may do; for to reſiſt ſuch trials, one had need of a Soul wherein Nature and Grace had contributed to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en againſt ſuch temptation; this our Prince ſhewed by his behaviour, that he believed there could be no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure where there was ſin, <hi>Abhorring that which was evil,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100918:128"/>
cleaving to that which was good,</hi> Rom. 12.9. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours of vice had here aſſayed in vain, all which might move youth or power: If in any thing he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted paſſion, it was in favouring Vertue, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Arts, which he loved by judgment and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>The injuſtice they are able to reproach him with, is that which he committed againſt himſelf, having taken from his own Rights to preſerve and augment thoſe of his Subjects. It were to be wiſhed for their good, that he had leſs loved them, and himſelf a little more; for if he had given them leſs, they would have had more than they have at this day.</p>
            <p>Of his Clemency, none can ſpeak more than his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for his greateſt adverſaries were thoſe who were the principal ſubjects of it. He preſerved the lives of thoſe who purchaſed his deſtruction: He reſtored the Inheritances to the children of them, which raviſht and took from him his own, and who died with their ſwords in their hands againſt him, he offered a free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to them who would not pardon him. But if this way hath not gained their affections, doubtleſs it hath Gods.</p>
            <p>Certainly ſince they have rejected and deſtroyed their good King, they deſerve God ſhould give them ſuch Maſters, like the King of the Frogs in the Fable, Storks and Herons which ſhould devour them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them one after another; but if he doth not, I fear there will be ſuch good order amongſt them, that they will mutually devour one another, there being no tyranny ſo cruel as that of a multitude, nor worſe ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than to want a Maſter.</p>
            <p>Behold here then a great point gained, That the King was a juſt and good Prince! Thoſe who ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his evil Counſellors or Inſtruments, ought to love him ſo much the more, and to acknowledge that he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100918:129"/>
could find no Inſtruments like himſelf; there is no Malady in the body of State which is not curable, whilſt the head is found: In all Kingdoms, the injuſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Courts of Judicature, is done in the Name of the King; and there is no Government ſo juſt and prudent, no, even that which is governed by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical conduct, as that of <hi>Davids,</hi> which have not faults enough, to give occaſion to an <hi>Abſolom</hi> to ſay, <hi>Oh that I were made Judge in the Land, that every man which hath any ſuit or cauſe, might come unto me, and I would do him juſtice,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.4.</p>
            <p>In publick grievances, good Subjects are wont to caſt the blame upon the Miniſters of State, and reſt ſatisfied in ſeeing ſome of them puniſhed, accounting it their principal intereſt to preſerve the honour of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; and good Princes when they are informed that the Miniſters of State have abuſed their Authority to the damage of their Subjects, which is theirs, are wont to examine them, and judge them according to the Laws. And in this, the King did as much as poſſible they could require of him, having ſubmitted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe whom the Covenanters complained againſt, to be judged, and tried by lawful and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waies: But whilſt they tread under foot the Royal Authority, the Power of Parliament, and the Majeſty of the Laws, and that they were in open war againſt him, what reaſon had he to ſubmit his Servants and Miniſters to the judgment of his enemies? Being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that whilſt the War continued, they would aim moſt at them who ſerved him beſt.</p>
            <p>Then when the Parliament was whole and entire, there paſſed a Vote worthy the gravity of that great Court, That the King could do no wrong, and that his Officers, and not he were guilty of the evil which was done in the publick Government: But ſince thoſe who loved the King departed, and withdrew themſelves
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100918:129"/>
to him, thoſe which remained at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> followed a way quite contrary, for they caſt upon the King all the faults of his Servants, and made uſe of them againſt him, whom they ought &amp; ſhould have puniſhed for having ill ſerved him. Then when they took in hand to examine the Miniſters of State, in ſtead of puniſhing them which were guilty, they received them into favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, after their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aults proved againſt them, and turned all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the people upon the King: What a great noiſe was there in the Houſe of Commons againſt the forgers of Monopolies? One would have thought that hardly any ſhould have eſcaped with their lives, but there happened altogether the contrary: For becauſe the Monopoliſts and other accuſed perſons, made a conſiderable number in Parliament, they made uſe of their faults, to make a ſtrong faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, terrifying and making them underſtand, there was no way left to preſerve them from utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, but to joyn with the new party which was forming, and hereupon they were promiſed impunity for what evils they had done, on condition they ſhould do greater.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe were ſent to the King to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> in the behalf of their companions, to whom his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſaid theſe words, capable to convert them, or to make their Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Others which were not of the Parliament, but under cenſure, for having been Councellours, or Inſtruments in the Impoſts and Taxes of the people, were releaſed by them, and employed for the ſame buſineſs, as perſons who well underſtood the Trade, who pillaged then with a good Conſcience, for the advancement of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. Thoſe whoſe infamous life was the ſhame of the Royal Court, were the honour of the Court at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Pillars of the Covenant. Likewiſe the Judges accuſed of corruption, and the Miniſters of a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous life, in taking the Covenant, obtained a plenary indulgence of all their ſins, for after that, there was no more to ſay to them, for thoſe who waſhed themſelves in this water, returned as white as if they had been waſhed with Ink, or with the ſecond Baptiſm the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts uſe at this day.</p>
            <p>But now let us look upon the Armies: Our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies cry aloud, that the King made uſe of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſerve him in his Wars. Upon which, an excellent Writer makes this gentle Queſtion to them, How many were in their Armies, or how many they would have had? For if the common report do not much wrong them, they employed divers perſons of that Religion, there were perſons of Honour and Quality, who aſſured us, that they Priſoners of the ſame Religion, ſerved the Covenanters. We refer our ſelves to their own Conſciences, if they gave not a Commiſſion to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> to levy Forces.</p>
            <p>The Relation in notable, the King being at <hi>York,</hi> this gallant man, accounted the moſt experienced, and beſt Commander of War of his time, came to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100918:130"/>
preſent his Service to his Majeſty, the King gave him thanks, and withal told him, he was reſolved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy none of his Religion in his Army. Well (ſaith he) I will go then to thoſe who will employ me, and indeed went preſently to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he was received with open Arms, and a Commiſſion given him written and ſigned, which he carried to the King; Ye cannot wonder then, that the King made uſe of him, and others of his Religion, whom before he was reſolv'd not to employ, although he had, to take away all ſhadow of occaſion from his enemies, who ſought ſomthing whereat to quarrel with him, made a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that none profeſſing the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould come neer his Court.</p>
            <p>After this, the Covenanters uſed all their power to make them draw to the Kings Party, well conſidering, their party being ſo ſmall, would bring more hatred than help to the King; and for this effect, they treated them with great inhumanity, forcing them to forſake their Houſes, and Lands, and run and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Kings Protection, and this the King could not refuſe them, for as they owed him their Subjection, the King owed them his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo long as they governed themſelves according to the Laws, and accompliſhed the Conditions whereby they were permitted by Act of Parliament to live in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>By this reaſon of Reciprocal duty, the King protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as his Subjects, they were bound to defend him as their King, and ye ſhall not find in all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes which concern them, that they are exempted to ſerve the King in his Armies, neither is it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they only ſhould be free from the perils of war, whilſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir fellow Subjects venture their lives, and are ſhedding their bloud for the defence of their Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:100918:131"/>The Covenanters made it appear ſufficiently to the world, that they judged that Religion ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any from bearing Arms in the publick danger, for in their Armies they made uſe of all Religions, yea that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. If it were lawful for them to make uſe of thoſe who denied the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, and of others that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Divinity, and thoſe who were re-baptized and denied Baptiſm to Infants, and the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church, it were not leſs law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the King to make uſe of Souldiers of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion; and if thoſe whom they now call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, embrace the Doctrine of the Jeſuits, touching the depoſing and murdering of Kings, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion reject this, and joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Reformed Church in this point, the King had reaſon to ſerve himſelf of the Laſt as well as of the Firſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover the King had but two Religions in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which were too many: And although the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is not tolerated by the Laws, yet the Statutes give protection to the perſons which make profeſſion of it, but the Covenanters Motly Army conſiſted of many Religions, there can be no certain number of them, for they multiplied and ſubdivided daily; and theſe Religions had no tolleration by the Laws, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which made profeſſion of them.</p>
            <p>But put the caſe that the Covenanters were a party Reformed, uniform and illuminated, ſince they have deſtroyed their King, what Law Divine or Humane, doth hinder him for uſing all means that God gives him to defend himſelf? And if amongſt his Loyal Subjects, there be ſome who are blinded in matter of Religion, why ſhould he not make uſe of thoſe who are blind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe who are illuminated; and maintain his Life and Crown?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:100918:131"/>'Tis then a ridiculous Queſtion, which they demand of the King, whether he will defend the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with Souldiers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion? for he makes not uſe of them to defend his Religion, but his Perſon and Scepter, which thoſe whom they call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, would wickedly pluck out of his hands. 'Tis fooliſhly and unjuſtly done of them to complain that the King made them to kill the Proteſtants, a name which they make a great noiſe with, when they have loſt the thing; they were not Proteſtants but Rebels, whom the King killed in his juſt defence. The King was not to enquire of what Religion they were that made War upon him; the true Religion gives not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to Malefactors to do evil, and to binde the hands of the Judge, that he ſhould not puniſh them; chiefly, when the Malefactor fights againſt the Judge, and he to whom God hath committed the ſword to execute vengeance in wrath, is conſtrained to make uſe of it to defend his life and authority; the Malefactor who is inſtructed in a holy Religion is doubly guilty, he is the evil ſervant in the Goſpel, who knows his Maſters will, but does it not, and therefore he ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of our enemies, That the King cauſed an Armie of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts to come over to kill the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>England,</hi> for it matters not what Religion the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be of, if they be Rebels, and who can blame him for employing Rebels converted, againſt Rebels obſtinate, but onely thoſe that periſh by them: But that which gives occaſion of laughter in this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that there were none, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have not yet ſent over their Army into <hi>England,</hi> according to their promiſe to help the King. We grant that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are far more conſiderable to the King then the <hi>Iriſh</hi>; ſuppoſe the difference be as great as betwixt a Son and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100918:132"/>
a ſervant, but if the Son prove unnatural and draws his ſword againſt his Father, who can blame the Father if he arms his ſervant, were he a <hi>Barbary</hi> ſlave, to defend his life? 'Tis not to purpoſe then for them ſo often to object to us, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were the Executioners to cut the throats of a multitude of Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that it's a horrible thing to bring them over into <hi>England</hi> to do as much here; for at the worſt they were but Executioners of Rebels; Certainly civil War is a horrible thing, where one deſtruction draws on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, <hi>Abyſſus abyſſum advocat</hi>; but ſince the enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and implacable obſtinacy of the Covenanters, brought the King to this extremity, that he could not quench the fire that they had kindled in his Kingdom, but by ruine; like thoſe who would quench a Town all in flames with Cannon-ſhot, what could we do other then call in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to his ſuccours? having rebellions then on all ſides? Was it not wiſely done of him to make an agreement with the moſt tractable and pliant, and to ſerve himſelf with their Forces to make head againſt the others? If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not have had the King made peace with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> why did they then refuſe the peace and pardon which the King ſo often, and ſo graciouſly rendred them? And did he enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Treaty with his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects, before he had a long time in vain ſollicited his <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their duty? Should he rather willingly have loſt two Kingdoms to help his enemies to render themſelves Maſters of the third?</p>
            <p>But ſay they, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhed abundance of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants blood in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſhould have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged in ſtead of granting them peace. Its true, they committed many fearful and ſtrange cruelties, but this blood hath been ſufficiently revenged; For, for one which they put to death, five of theirs have been killed ſince the beginning of the War: And
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100918:132"/>
moreover this reaſon ſounds ill in the mouthes of Chriſtians, who ought to leave vengeance to God. We could not expect that the Covenanters would ever commend this peace, which might have been ſo diſadvantagious to them, and might have ſupplied the King with many Souldiers, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had kept their word.</p>
            <p>The principal reaſon of their complaint was, becauſe the <hi>Londoners</hi> loſt much hereby, for they had advanced great ſums of monies to the two Houſes, for which they were to have had the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels Lands, after they were extirpated; which was to buy the Bears skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was killed; and this partly was the cauſe of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> for the Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> would by no means hear of Peace, unleſs the King would break his faith with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and root them out; for the quarrel that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Covenanters had with them was not for their Religion, or Rebellion, but becauſe they would not ſuffer themſelves to be killed in a peaceable and quiet manner, that thereby the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Adventurers of <hi>London</hi> might have their Bargain. And thus the Covenanters as much as in them lay, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified the unjuſt arms of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſince they would by no means have peace with them: And after all, the King hath the ſole power of Peace and War, and if he will receive into grace, and pardon his Subjects who have offended him, he is to give account to none. Yet nevertheleſs that it may appear to all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches how much our good King departed, loved his Religion, he would not grant peace to his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects on the conditions they demanded, advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to their Religion; which if he had accorded, he might have had Legions in ſtead of Regiments, and not wanted neither the help of his Subjects, nor their neighbours; but rather then he would buy their aſſiſtance at that price, he choſe to ſink and fall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100918:133"/>
under the oppreſſion of the Covenanters; after this piety or humanity ought to have converted the enemies of the King, if he had had to do with perſons who had either the one or the other. But if the Gentlemen at <hi>London</hi> loſt their monies which they advanced upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> affairs, they have cauſe to complain of the Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who made uſe of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not to reconquer <hi>Ireland,</hi> but to make war upon the King, who had a great deſire to terminate that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and would have gone in Perſon, but not to ſerve the avaritious and barbarous intentions of theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of blood, but to recover his Rights, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a number of his exiled Subjects to their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Thoſe ruined and remaining Families of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maſſacre, cried aloud in the ears of the King and Parliament. For to help them there was a generall Collection through the Kingdom, and the Miniſters by Order of Parliament were to excite the charity of the people to a liberal contribution, which was done, and great ſums of money were raiſed for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War. But to what was the charity of many pious ſouls imployed? to make War againſt the King; The Armies which the cries of the poor exiled <hi>Iriſh</hi> had raiſed, and were ready at their Port to be ſhipped, were called back, and conducted againſt his ſacred Majeſty; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many in thoſe Troops had their Intereſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they were conſtrained to forſake them, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Intereſts, and an open Hoſtillity againſt their Soveraign. 'Tis no wonder then, if part of thoſe Troops at the battel of <hi>Keinton,</hi> turned to the King; and took a bloody revenge of ſo great injuſtice. For what a moſt horrible tyranny was this, to make them fight againſt their King in <hi>England,</hi> whileſt the throats of their wives and children were cutting in <hi>Ireland</hi>?</p>
            <p>We earneſtly beſeech the Covenanters, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they curſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, they would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100918:133"/>
theſe two things; the one, that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhewed them the way, having before made a Covenant for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and levied Arms to maintain it, and obtained by this way, all that they deſired. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeeing this was the way to obtain the liberty of their Religion, preſently followed the example of their Neighbours, and as a judicious Writer ſaith pleaſantly, That if the <hi>Scots</hi> had not piped, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had never danced.</p>
            <p>Let them remember alſo, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> as wicked as they were, had without compariſon more reaſon for their riſing, then either the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scotch,</hi> for it's moſt certain that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were held in with a bridle, which had a ruder bit then the other Subjects of the King. Many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for their former Rebellions were diſpoſſeſſed of their Lands; and although the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was juſt, the loſs nevertheleſs was ſenſible; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they had not the free exerciſe nor liberty of their Religion, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor <hi>Scotch</hi> cannot alledge any thing like theſe. Hardly ſhall you find in any Hiſtory a raign of fifteen years more flouriſhing, peaceable, and mild, then the fifteen firſt years of the Reign of the late King, notwithſtanding all the grievances the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters reckon up to his diſadvantage: There never ſhined more happy days upon <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; In effect, they were Nations ſick of too much eaſe. When Subjects undertake to criticiſe upon myſteries of State, and come to quarrel amongſt themſelves for ſubtilties of Religion, or points of Diſcipline, its a ſymptome of an eaſie yoke, and of exceſs of eaſe and proſperity.</p>
            <p>Moreover the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fought againſt men of another Religion, and of another Nation, they fought not againſt the Perſon of their King, cut not the throats of their Brethren, nor ruined thoſe of their profeſſion; impoſed not neceſſity of Conſcience upon others; but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded publick Liberty of Conſcience for themſelves, although many amongſt them contented themſelves
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100918:134"/>
with leſſe; for by the Articles of peace in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1646. the King gave them no Toleration for the publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion; Certainly therefore as thoſe of <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſo ſhall the <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenanters.</p>
            <p>Further, our enemies are very unjuſt to complain, that the King aſſailed to bring over <hi>Iriſh</hi> Armies into <hi>England,</hi> ſince they in effect a year and half before had brought Armies of <hi>Scotch</hi> into <hi>England</hi> to ſerve them. If they take the boldneſs to entertain the Armies of ſtrangers within the Kingdome of their Soveraign, ſhall it not be lawful for the King to defend his perſon and Kingdom with his own Subjects, which in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are not ſtrangers in reſpect of him, but the <hi>Scotch</hi> are ſtrangers in regard of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Hiſtories furniſh nought parallel to this crime, to have brought the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and to move them to come, gave them part of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi>; but its eaſie for them to give that which was none of theirs; with the ſame right the Devil offered to Jeſus Chriſt all the Kingdoms of the world, for they can produce their Authority no other where.</p>
            <p>This Nation abounding in men, living in a barren Countrey, will be eaſily induced to plant Colonies in a more fertile ſoil, and who will believe that having their weapons in their hands, and being in <hi>England,</hi> backed with their forces from <hi>Scotland,</hi> they will govern themſelves at the devotion of thoſe that ſent for them, and go no further then they are comanded; there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leaſt it happen as to the fountain of <hi>Lucian,</hi> which a ſtudent in Magick, with certain words he had learn'd of his Maſter ſent to fetch water, to which the fountain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but the poor apprentiſe knew not the words to make it ſtay, which in the mean while went and fetched water without ceaſing, till it filled the houſe up to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100918:134"/>
windows. Certainly our Mutineers had the wit to make the <hi>Scotch</hi> come to their help, and there needed no great charm to perſwade a people which had nothing, and had nothing to do, to come and fiſh in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in their neighbours pond: But I have great fear, that thoſe which cauſed them to enter upon their March, were ignorant of the charm, to ſtay them that they ſhould go no further, and that the <hi>Scotch</hi> will not have done, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have done with them.</p>
            <p>It was not then an action of judgment to cauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> to enter <hi>England,</hi> without having power to make them return, and to hinder their coming again, much leſs an action of piety, for God needs not the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men to advance his Kingdom, it was an action purely of ſpight and ſtomack, a ſtroak of deſpair, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from perſons reſolved to deſtroy their Country with them, rather than to ſuffer the inſultation of a Conqueror, or the reproach of their treachery: But in doing this, they have rather augmented their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and drawn upon themſelves perpetual infamy: For as long as there is a God in Heaven, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the world, the memory of thoſe, who had but a finger in ſo baſe an action, will be hateful to all good men, their names will offend their ears, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity will be forced (if any remain) to change their Names, for fear of being ſtoned by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>But lets return to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and poure into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of our enemies the Objection they have ſo often preſſed againſt his Majeſty, that he invited <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts over to his party; and ſhew to the world, that it was the Covenanters, and not the King, who really employed them.</p>
            <p>For to unwind this intangled and intricate buſineſs, we muſt take the thred of the affair higher; ye muſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100918:135"/>
then know, that there are two ſorts of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts; the one, ancient Inhabitants of the Country, who ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> bear an hereditary and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable hatred to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; the other, the poſterity of thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies which were planted in <hi>Ireland</hi> about four hundred years ſince, to preſerve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and are accounted as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the ancient Inhabitants, for they yet preſerve the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, manners and inclination of the Country from whence they iſſued; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> are new Colonies, which during theſe forty years of peace, have encreaſed in number almoſt equal to the others.</p>
            <p>When the Rebellion brake out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that in <hi>Scotland,</hi> being encouraged by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the old <hi>Iriſh</hi> and the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies joyned together in one common deſign to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, whereupon the Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuppreſſing them ſpeedily by Arms, (which his Majeſty deſired, and offered to go in perſon) made an Ordinance wholly to extirpate them, to which the King would never conſent, alledging that it would be a means to cauſe the Colony of Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were without defence, to be extirpated; as it came to paſs, for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being provoked by that bloody Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, did what they at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> had taught them, and extirpated the moſt part of the Proteſtant Colonies, killing man, woman and child, with moſt horrible bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſs. I leave to the juſt Judgment of God to decide againſt whom this Sea of innocent bloud cries.</p>
            <p>In this Butchery, the old <hi>Iriſh</hi> were the moſt active and cruel, the others went along with them only for company; and beſides, their intereſts were different, for the intention of the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies went lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further than the deſign of freeing themſelves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100918:135"/>
of Religion, but the native <hi>Iriſh</hi> would as well be freed of the Nation, as have the freedom of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and would ſhake off the yoke of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, take poſſeſſion in the name of the Pope, of the Abbies which were all in the hands of Lay men, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all that they had loſt by Confiſcation, for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rebellions, and for this effect, null all Titles which held of the Crown.</p>
            <p>This Intention was contrary to the old <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who held all their Eſtates of the Crown, and poſſeſſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Abbies by Pattent Royal, and beſides this, had an hereditary affection towards their King and ancient Country; and therefore they had reaſon to fear, that after the extirpation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, their throats ſhould be cut, and upon this conſideration they liſtned to the overtures of an accord the King made to them, in the year 1643. And although they brake not off ſuddenly with the old <hi>Iriſh,</hi> yet they looſed themſelves by little and little, and in the end, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves for the King; but it was not until a long while after they did him any Service, having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed and abuſed a long time by the ſubtilties of <hi>Rome,</hi> who upheld and inſtructed the old <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for to paſs into <hi>England</hi> and ſerve the King, if ever they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, the ſame ſubtilties and their diſſentions would never permit them to do.</p>
            <p>No man of underſtanding or ſenſe can blame the King to receive from them the ſervice they owed him, neither did he ever make any profeſſion to the contrary, as they at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who paſſed a Vote of extirpation againſt them, and ſtirred up the people againſt the King by this pretext, that he made uſe of perſons of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion; now after this, if they themſelves ſhall make uſe of them, they are inexcuſable before God and man.</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee how their actions agree with their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100918:136"/>
words and looks. The Royal party being greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially by the converſion of the Proteſtant Forces which before ſerved the Parliament: The Gentlemen of the Covenant finding themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low in that Kingdom, found no better expedient to repair their languiſhing affairs there, than to joyn their intereſt with the Popes, and the old <hi>Iriſhes,</hi> for it's moſt notoriouſly known, that before the death of the King theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts took pay of the Parliament, and ſerved them in the warre, and have ſince rendred many good Services to the holy Covenant, above all, before <hi>Derry,</hi> which the Covenanters held, but was beſieged by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Royaliſts, and had been taken without the coming of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> conducted by <hi>Owen Row O Neal,</hi> who forced the <hi>Scotch</hi> to raiſe the ſiege with a ſignal loſs, when the beſieged were in great diſtreſs, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to yield up the Town. And this conjunction endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red near a year, for it was not till after <hi>October</hi> 1649. that theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> returned to the obedience of their King.</p>
            <p>And indeed we have not here any thing to wonder at and be aſtoniſhed, if two ſorts of Rebels who agreed together to caſt off their King, joyn themſelves together in one party, and if their temporal intereſt which binds them be preferred before the ſpiritual, which both in the one and the other League ſerved but as a pretext to their covetouſneſs and ambition, the Gentlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> judged right, that the advancement of the Pope in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was leſs diſadvantagious to them, than the whole reduction of that Kingdom under the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>This ſcandalous conjunction having much exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſpirits of the by-got people, whom they had taught to hate the King, becauſe he had made peace with the Papiſts, and murderers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> after they had a long time deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100918:136"/>
it, and ſeeing they could not any longer diſſemble this infamous action, publickly called before them in examination Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> who was employed in this agreement, and demanded of him, who cauſed him to make it? he being inſtructed beforehand, anſwered, that he had done it of himſelf, of his proper motion; then being enquired why he durſt make ſuch an accord without a Commiſſion, he anſwered, that he judged his agreement then profitable for the intereſts of his party; and hereupon he was diſmiſſed and ſent away without any puniſhment, and theſe Gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned this accord and allyance by a publick Act.</p>
            <p>But where is the man that is ſo ſimple as to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſo ſottiſh a force? But to undecive the abuſed, and to ſhew that theſe Gentlemen gave no orders for to break this agreement; they had news a while after, that great ſuccours were put into this Garriſon of <hi>Derry,</hi> (then the Covenanters) by the Troops of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then all the Jugling was diſcovered; and there reſted then no other anſwer for them to give, but that of the <hi>Italian,</hi> who being exceedingly pained with the Gout, and having prayed to God and all the Saints, and yet found no eaſe, began to call and pray to the Devil for help, and gave this Reaſon to them that rebuked him for it, <hi>Ogni adjuto e bono,</hi> all help is good from whomſoever it come.</p>
            <p>Now every man who ſhall compare their Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with their Actions, may demand theſe Queſtions with aſtoniſhment and horror. Are theſe the men who have ſo cried out againſt the murtherers, which maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred ſo many thouſand Proteſtants? Are theſe they who before and after the Maſſacre, did ſo preſs the King to ſign their utter extirpation? Are theſe thoſe who rendred the King odious, only for offering them peace and pardon? Are theſe the men that ſtirred up the people againſt their King, becauſe he had
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100918:137"/>
ſome few Souldiers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion ſcattered here and there in his Armies (for he never had an entire company of that Religion) and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they themſelves, entertain a great Body of an Army of the moſt refined Papiſts, and the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent enemies of the Reformed Religion, to whom (when the King treated with them) he refuſed to give them any toleration. Behold the Army of the Popes become the Parliaments, behold the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers whom they would have rooted out, become their Souldiers; Behold the revenge of the blood of their Brethren, which they made ſuch a noiſe of! The Maſſacre of the Proteſtants is pardoned the Murderers, provided they maſſacre thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of them. Is it to pay the Armies of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that ſuch great Summes of Money are raiſed of the Proteſtants? and that they ſuck the poor Families even to the very Marrow? Is this the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſo many ſolemn Profeſſions, of ſo many Faſts and publick Humiliations for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel in <hi>Ireland</hi>? Where is their ſhame? Where is their Ingenuity? Where is their Conſcience?

            <head>CHAP. XXIV How the different Factions of the Covenant agreed to ruine the King, and contributed to put him to death.</head>

Actors in that exectable paracide, committed upon the Sacred Majeſty of their King; an action which being the ſhame of the Nation, and reproach of Religion, was nevertheleſs ſet forth to the eyes of the world, with the oſtentation of Juſtice and Piety; and for this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible execution, there was a ſolemn Thankſgiving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to be rendered to God by a publick Ordinance. It's true, this Ordinance was ill obeyed, and many Miniſters cryed out againſt it, which did ſo provoke their new Maſters, that they appointed a Committee, to eject the Miniſters out of their Benefices, and to place in Lay perſons.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the Presbyterians thunder aloud againſt this action, we will ſee whether they have not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it, and if their behaviour to their good King gave him occaſion to hope for better dealing at their hands.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe we may do well to conſider the Propoſitions which they preſented to the King at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly,</hi> and ſince at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> then when the Presbyterians held the better end of the ſtaffe; they required of him in ſubſtance, that he ſhould not diſpoſe, neither of the Militia, nor of the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor of his Townes and Revenues, nor of his Children, nor of his Court, nor of Honours, nor of the Offices of the Crown, and that he ſhould hold no power in the Treaties of peace, of War, and of Commerce with his Neighbours: That his Councel ſhould no more depend upon him, that he ſhould have no Negative voice in Parliament, and ſhould be bound to grant whatſoever the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would demand of him; that he ſhould ſhew no Acts of Grace, nor execute Juſtice, and not have the power to do either good or evil; that he ſhould conſent that his party ſhould be for ever ruined, and deliver up all thoſe who had ſerved him to their rage
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100918:138"/>
and Butchery: That he ſhould utterly overthrow both the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Government, cut all the Nerves of Government, and diſpoſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his poſterity without reſource: In brief, that he ſhould betray all the truſts God had committed to him, and render himſelf the moſt miſerable and guilty creature in the whole Univerſe: All the choice left this poor Prince, was, whether he would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by his enemies, or by his own proper Act, for if he condeſcended not to theſe demands, being then in their hands that made them, the leaſt he could expect, was to be depoſed; and if he granted them, he depoſed himſelf: Every man that hath either pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Conſcience, will chuſe rather to be executed by another hand, than be his own proper Executioner: Read the Articles, which are too long to be inſerted here, and if there were any thing that was his, or which God had given him to keep, that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men demanded not of him, except his life, and if he could aſſure himſelf of his life, after he had given his enemies the Sword of Juſtice, and had by conſequence acknowledged them his Superiours, before whom he was Juſticiable: The Sequel of Affairs have ſhewed the truth of this conſequence, for it was upon the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Principles, that the Independants built their Concluſions.</p>
            <p>Let them weigh well this reaſoning, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. that the Supream Magiſtrate beareth the Sword by God, he is his Miniſter; upon this ground the Supream Magiſtrate exerciſeth Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the earth, by way of force: Obſerve that the Apoſtle ſaith not, he beareth <hi>Swords,</hi> he aſſignes him but one, and this ſword, both executes Juſtice, and the Militia by one and the ſame power. Now the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians have a long time taught, that the Sword of the Militia appertained of right and originally to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100918:138"/>
of whom the Parliament is the Repreſentative, and if this Doctrine be not true, their Arms were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; but if it be true, the ſword of Juſtice alſo belongs to them; for if upon theſe grounds it was lawful for them to wreſt out of the hand of the King, the Sword of the Militia, to make uſe of it againſt him, it was no leſs lawful for them to employ the Sword of Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; all their Philoſophy cannot divide theſe two Powers, which have the ſame foundation both in Scripture and reaſon, and which have been equally violated in beheading him, and making war againſt him.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Presbyterians who now cry ſo loud, that the Perſon of the King was inviolable, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſword of Juſtice, condemns by this all their paſt actions; for if it were an execrable paracide, to cut off his Head upon a Scaffold, it could not be the action of a good Subject to take off his Head by a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Bullet in the field, as they many times aſſayed. And in employing the Militia againſt the King, they gave the Independants the Sword of Juſtice, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily maſſacred him: After they took from him, his Sword, his Crown, his Revenues, his Servants, his Children, the Liberty of his Perſon, and which is much more, of his Conſcience, they left the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants but a ſtep to go further, which was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. And all wherein theſe laſt ſurpaſs them, was that they gave the laſt blow to the King; the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians laid his head on the Block, and the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants cut it off.</p>
            <p>The name Independant was hardly known then, when his Majeſty complained in one of his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that divers perſons to the number of ſeventeen, had been accuſed to have ſaid, they would kill the King, and how the Accuſers could obtain no Juſtice againſt them; if the Members of Parliament who now abhor
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100918:139"/>
this murder, had then had any care of the ſafety of his ſacred perſon, they would never have ſtayed the courſe of Juſtice againſt theſe crimes. They had not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in pay <hi>Mercurius Britannicus,</hi> and ſuch Raſcals, by horrible Libels to defame his Majeſty, and enflame the rage of a fooliſh and ſeditious people againſt him. If the quarrel had been only againſt his evil Counſellours, (which is the old and ſuper-annuated pretext of all Rebels) they would never have caſhiered the Army of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> for to employ a—and a medly of peſtilent Anabaptiſts, whom they knew to be mortal and ſworn enemies to the King and Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Certainly we have ſo much Charity as to believe, they had not an intention to put him to death, when they began the war againſt him, no not even when they impriſoned him; as <hi>Judas</hi> according to all appearance, had no intention to cauſe his Maſter to be crucified, when he ſold him to the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and never thought that the Prieſts would proceed ſo far; for when he heard they had condemned him to dy, this unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted blow ſo ſurprized him, and moved him in ſuch a manner, that he preſently brought back again the reward of iniquity, and rendred witneſs to the Truth, and to his Conſcience before the Council, <hi>I have ſinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying innocent blood:</hi> 'Tis more than the Presbyterians have declared, beholding their K. condemned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by their practiſes, although it was beyond their intention, neither have they been ſo ſmitten with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience, to bring back again that which they have got by ſacriledge and rebellion, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, Jeſus ſaith of <hi>Judas,</hi> much more peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then ſome of them, <hi>That it had been better for him he had never been born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking thus, we have no deſign to lead them to deſpair, but to repentance, to which the mercy of God is ever open, ſince we ſpeak of the party, and not of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100918:139"/>
particulars; many whereof deteſt their Councels and paſt actions, and we do not doubt but that of ſuch, the King ſhall yet receive moſt ſignal ſervices: Its that whereof his wiſe and glorious Father aſſured him in his laſt inſtructions: <hi>Be aſſured</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as I am, that the moſt part of thoſe who have injured me, have done it, not through malice, but through miſinformation, and a ſiniſter apprehenſion of the affairs. None will be more loyal and faithful both to me and you, then thoſe ſubjects, who being ſenſible of their errors, and of the wrongs we have received, ſhall feel in their ſouls moſt vehement ſtirrings to repentance, and ardent deſires to do us ſome reparation for their paſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without queſtion there are many that yet ſerve the Covenanters, eſpecially thoſe in civil imployments, and even ſome in the Parliament, who groan under the yoke of impiety, and ſigh after Religion, peace, their King, and their duty: But alas 'tis but to think of liberty when they are in chains; although ſo afflicted as we are, we have great compaſſion on them, and eſteem their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worſe then ours. Its a great miſery to be obliged to evil, becauſe they have done evil, and to do the work of the devil, and to know it, and cannot retire. Behold the fruits of affranchiſing themſelves in the beginning to do evil, to the end that good might come of it; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering themſelves with a good intention (which pretext cannot be wanting to any injuſtice) and with a vain hope to return to their duty when they ſhould ſee it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to amend when they would, what they had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; they offended God with gladneſs of heart, but now they find themſelves fettred in a cruel neceſſity, continually to offend him, or to caſt themſelves into our condition; they were better to come and keep us company, and generouſly to be ruined for the love of God, then to be perpetual Actors in the ruine of their King, their Country, their Church, and their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100918:140"/>
and by <hi>their hardneſs and impenitent heart, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the declaration of the righteous judgement of God, who will render to every one according to his works.</hi>

               </gap>d alive; there you ſhall behold thouſands maſſacred, ſtretched upon the ground, the Flower of the Church and State cut off, the grandure of the Kingdome redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a heap of ruines, upon which ſet ſome petit Gentlemen, enriched by the general wrack, and fatted by the blood and bowels of their miſerable country, there you ſhall behold the Grandees of the Kingdome a foot, begging the favour of their inferiours a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and beholding their offices and revenues diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among common perſons, and their enemies.</p>
            <p>Againſt them and all the Nobility is the great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, the Covenanters hate them, becauſe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honour, and acknowledged the King for the Fountain of Honor, and as ſuch for the moſt part, they have followed and ſerved him; thus almoſt all the rich and wealthy families of the Kingdome were wholly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100918:140"/>
not by the inſolent ſouldiers pillaging in hot blood, but by the extorſion of a new Committee, and robbery, which was done upon the carpet, and in cool blood.</p>
            <p>Of theſe grand revenues, they accommodated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the firſt place, and then thoſe who have ſerved them, aſſigning for a recompence to their inſtruments, perſons of no worth, and newly raiſed from the duſt, the antient rights and revenues of Lords and Gentlemen, they wanting nothing to be ſuch but blood and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The Covenanters party often celebrate the feaſts of <hi>Saturn,</hi> where the ſervants ſit at the upper end of the table, and are ſerved by the Maſters, and this fanatick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence proceeded ſo far, that theſe ſpoilers eſteemed themſelves as lawfully inveſted in the inheritances of their ſuperiours, and country-men, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were of the lands of the <hi>Amorites</hi>: There is but this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took poſſeſſion by the command of God, theſe againſt his command.</p>
            <p>Now by the ſpecial favour of the Gentlemen at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> it was ordered that the fifth part of the revenues ſhould be for proviſion for the wives and children of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, (ſuch they call them, who ſo little reſpected the Majeſty of the Houſe of Commons, that they were faithful to their Soveraign.) Thus their wives ſometimes were admitted to be Farmers of their husbands eſtates, and reſerving themſelves the fifth part, paid the reſt to the State. But at laſt, even the Delinquents were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to compound for their eſtates; thoſe who were beſt dealt with, paid two years value of their rents, others this double<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ſuch be their compaſſions, what is their ſeverity? Is not this for them to comment upon the ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>The mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But moreover theſe favours were not granted to all, there being many who were never admitted to farm their eſtates, no neither to redeem them by compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100918:141"/>
and whoſe wives and children have ſcarce bread, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the confiſcation of their eſtates, their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual baniſhment, the ſentence of death pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, are honorable marks of their great and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſervices to their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Of all thoſe who ſuffered in this quarrel, the Miniſters of the Goſpel were the moſt barbarouſly dealt with, and for the leaſt cauſe, very few amongſt them, who ingaged themſelves in the war. The Biſhops whom the Laws gave the precedency in the Houſe of Lords, have wholly loſt their places, through the violence of the Houſe of Commons, aſſiſted with the ſeditious multitude; their Houſes and Eccleſiaſtical revenues have been ſold, and are torn from the Church for ever, their perſons a long time impriſoned, and the moſt eminent of them had his head cut off upon a Scaffold.</p>
            <p>This cruelty executed upon the heads, deſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the members, all the revenues of the Dean and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters through the Kingdome are become the prey of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and of lazy bellies, which cram and fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the patrimony of the Church; the lawful poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, without any diſtinction good or bad, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed: whereby the gentlemen of the Covenant clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that it was not the amendment of the Clergy, but their own enriching with the ſpoils of the Church, was the mark and ſcope of this Reformation.</p>
            <p>In the ninety ſeven Pariſhes within the walls of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> there were found upon account, that there were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and five Miniſters driven by violence from their Churches and houſes; and to number the Suburbs and Pariſhes adjoyning to <hi>London,</hi> the number of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, were a hundred and fifteen, without compriſing thoſe of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note that this book in the French was printed in the year <hi>1650.</hi>
               </note> where the Deans and Prebends ran the ſame fortune; of this number, twenty were impriſoned, and of thoſe who are dead
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100918:141"/>
by diſtreſs, and anguiſh in divers priſons, in the holds of ſhips and baniſhment, they reckoned five years ſince twenty two; but this number is almoſt doubled ſince, and the others diſperſed and fled into ſtrange countries, or otherwiſe oppreſſed and ruined, are left to meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, he ſhall maintain me,</hi> for any other of the Church its denied them. In the other parts of the Kingdom, many faithful Miniſters to the King had the like uſage, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who poſſeſſed the faireſt and beſt benefices, for this was an unpardonable crime, and ſome of them were maſſacred by the furious Anabaptiſts, as a Sacrifice well pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>Now whereas ſome other Delinquents have liberty to dwell in their houſes, to farm their rents, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for the principal; to the Clergy nothing like this is accorded, but they are turned out in their ſhirts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a total ruine without reſource. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Ordinance of Parliament, that the wives and children of ejected Miniſters, ſhould have the fifth part of the revenues of their benefices, but it is very ill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for the new incumbents into theſe benefices, carry themſelves with ſuch pride, and inhumanity to theſe poor women, refuſing to obey the Ordinance, conſtraining them to plead before Judges, their adverſaries; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſpeedily relieving them, delay them with length of time, and make them conſume in Suits that which they borrowed to plead their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>So that theſe poor deſolate perſons, through the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the expence, and tediouſneſs of delays are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to deſiſt their proſecution; and many being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected out of ſmall benefices, dare not preſent their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for the fifths, becauſe the expences will amount higher then the principal: Certainly if there were any charity or ſincerity in the Authors of this Ordinance, they would cauſe it to be ſtrictly obſerved, they would
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100918:142"/>
not permit that the poor wives and children whom they have ruined, ſhould be ſhufflled off with litigious and crafty tricks, and oppreſſed with charges, when they come to demand that ſmall alms which is granted them out of their husbands eſtates, they ſhould not deny them that in retail which they have accorded them in groſs.</p>
            <p>Moreover you muſt know that this pretended gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is but for the wives and children, but as for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who have neither the one nor the other, they are accounted unworthy to live, and not any part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates is given to them; and thus they have rendered the Miniſters of the Goſpel conformable to their Maſter, who had not where to lay his head, and Jeſus Chriſt is yet perſecuted in his ſervants.</p>
            <p>But the perſecution ſtaid not at thoſe whom they E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Behold a new invention, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oot out at one ſtroak, all thoſe who remained loyal, or Orthodox in the Church and State. It was ordered that all who had any office either in Church or State, ſhould ſubſcribe to be faithful to the preſent conſtitution of Government, by the Houſe of Commons, without King or Lords, but the principal aim was to pick a quarrel with the Miniſters of the Goſpel upon their refuſing, and to aboliſh the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for which they had already prepared the people, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appointed a Committee, <hi>to diſplace diſobedient Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and to put thoſe in their places, who condemned their vocation:</hi> theſe are the terms of the inſtruction given the <hi>Committee,</hi> this horrible menace ſhould give to all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtors, cauſe rather of hope then fear, for he that ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>He that refuſeth you, refuſeth me,</hi> finds himſelf refuſed, and rejected in the perſons of his ſervants, and yet more in their Miniſtry; without doubt he is provoked to jealouſie, and will take upon him the cauſe of the Miniſtry of his Word.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly conſider all that hideous ſpectacle of devaſtation of the Church, the abolition of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100918:142"/>
Government, the ruine of the Paſtors, the corruption of Religion, the profanation of the ſervice of God, and ſhall compare this perſecution with that the Greek Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſuffer at this day, ſhall find that all the ravages of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſince the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> have not ſo disfigured the Church in two hundred years, as theſe Reformers did in ſix or ſeven years in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and amongſt their brethren in the faith.</p>
            <p>But paſs we from the Eccleſiaſtical to the Civil, the new Courts erected to hear complaints, and to receive the compoſitions of Delinquents, were as ſo many But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Shambles, and Flaying-houſes, where they tore off the skin, and pulled out the bowels, and where they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and cut in pieces many antient and good houſes; our miſerable party had to do with worſer Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then he ſpoken of in the eighteenth of S. <hi>Luke, which feared not God, neither regarded man</hi>; and yet he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be overcome by the importunity of the afflicted Widdow, and ſaid, <hi>I will avenge her,</hi> or I will do her Juſtice; <hi>We propoſe him for an example to theſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſouls, and ſay after our Saviour, Hear what the unjuſt Judge ſaith; And ſhall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them, I tell you that he will avenge them ſpeedily.</hi>

            <p>There could be expected no juſter ſequel of iniquity from their beginnings, then when it was commanded for every perſon through the Kingdom to bring in their Plate and Jewels, which the ſeditious Zealots contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as freely as the idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to make a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf, but thoſe who did not bring their Plate, they plundred their houſes, and took it away by force; at the ſame time they commanded the people to take up arms under the penalty of being hanged, and this ſentence was executed in the Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi>; the principal actor of this tyranny, was the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> who cauſed ſome to be hanged, who

not being well learned in the Catechiſme of ſedition, refuſed openly to take up arms againſt the King, others for the ſame reaſon were tyed neck and heels, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably miſuſed, and caſt into priſons until they had learned Rebellion, and the reſt of the people affrighted hereby, went peaceably to commit treaſon againſt his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Therefore the greateſt cruelty of the Covenanters, was not in rendring their country miſerable, but in having rendred it wicked, and forced ſo many ſimple people to be inſtruments of their ambition, and partakers of their crimes. How will they anſwer for the blood and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of their Souldiers killed in the act of paracide, then when they diſcharged their Muskets againſt the Squadron where the perſon of the King was? How will they anſwer for them who were actually imployed in the maſſacre of the King, and who have ſince felt a hell in their conſciences? we muſt confeſs that they have been more cruel towards their own party, then towards ours, ſince they have only made us to ſuffer evil, but they have forced their adherents, both to ſuffer and do evil, which are the two principal things wherein all the work of the devil conſiſts.</p>
            <p>After this execrable murther of their excellent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, how many murthers did they heap upon this? Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> the truly Noble and loyal Lord <hi>Capel</hi>; many others killed in their armies in divers places, many in every County condemned to death by partial Judges, who received all accuſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who had ſerved their King, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands good ſubjects murthered in <hi>Ireland</hi> by theſe San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary Zealots.</p>
            <p>It would be infinite to reckon up all their crimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, their Religion, their Church, their King, and their Country, and all that can be ſpoken, is nothing in compariſon to that prodigious maſs of iniquity, which ſtricks heaven with its height, and makes even the earth

            <p>Oh our good God, art thou ſo wrathfully diſpleaſed againſt theſe Nations, as to give them over to a rebrobate ſenſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to do the will of the devil, and eſtabliſh his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Oh Religion, Conſcience, King, Church, State, Order, Peace, Juſtice, Laws, all are violated, defaced, disfigured and melted into a horrible Chaos of obſcurity and confuſion! Alas how can it be that this people enlightened with the knowledge of God, abounding with the riches of heaven and earth, ſhould fall into ſuch a diabolical frenzy, as to trample under their feet their Religion, cut off the head of their King, pluck out the throat of their Mother, the Church, and deal with their Fellow-countrymen, and Brethren in Jeſus Chriſt, more cruelly then the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> deal with the Chriſtians, who drives them not from their houſes and patrimonies in <hi>Turky,</hi> nor reduce them to the fift part of their Revenues, <hi>How is the faithful City become an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot! it was full of Judgement, righteouſneſs lodged in it, but now murtherers, Iſa.</hi> 1.21.
