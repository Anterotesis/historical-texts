            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7209:24"/>
with that which the Lorde hath ſent me notwithſtanding I wyll ſhew you ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thinges, inſomuche that the ſeconde night after I fel ſick of this my preſent ſickneſſe, being of perfect memory, and in my bed broade awake, there appeared vntoo mee ſuche ſtraunge and fearefull thinges which greatly amaſed mee, and put me in a wonderfull feare, I cannot tell what I ſhoulde tearme them or call them, but as I remember they were like Puppets which ranne vpp and downe my chamber, my bed, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my body, toſſed mee, pulled mee, ſtirred mee, and ſo vexed me as I was neuer in my life ſo troubled, ſhewing me ſo terrible &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſightes, that I was almoſt brought to deſtruction vtterly, ſo far foorth that I coulde not tell what too doe. Yet at the laſt remembring my ſelfe calling too minde the wonderfull graces, that my Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, had at diuerſe and ſundry times ſhewed mee, I ſayde in my ſelf (O good Lord) what doe all theſe thinges meane? With that there appeared vnto me my former viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe, and ſhewed me in writing all the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7209:24"/>
ſummes of vſury money which I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in my lyfe time, ſo plainly that I read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And indeede the ſummes were true &amp; euery man named with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had occupied that trade, and the ſeuerall ſummes, ſhewing mee ſo plainly euery thing as I aſſure you I much marueiled at it. At the laſt I made anſwere too my viſion and ſaide, O Lord all theſe things be true indeede, what ſhall I doe to it? Then my viſion made mee anſwere, and comforted me very much, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mee too repaye all the Vſury money againe to euery man as hee had ſhewed me the ſummes which came vnto 18. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. Then he bad me pay again fiftie pound which I had gayned for buy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of a houſe, and a hundred and twenty pounds which I had gotten by ſtrangers as <hi>Italians</hi> and ſuche like, and becauſe I knewe not where the ſaide ſtrangers dwelt, to giue it to good priſoners, &amp; good men that were in Priſons. And maiſters I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tell of what religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you be of, nor to tel you the trueth I care not to the end too accuſe my aduerſary the Deuyll:
<pb facs="tcp:7209:25"/>
So as indeede I haue reſtored ſome part already, and wil render al, God willing, and wyll pay all the money gayned by Vſury as my viſion commaunded mee, and doe ſo intende God willing to do to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrowe if I liue ſo long: If not, I will deſire a ſpeciall friende of myne as my truſt is in hym, to ſee the ſame diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and preſently to paye out the ſame, that my ſoule may abide no perrill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And theſe thinges haue iuſtly hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vnto mee, for I aſſure you I haue not vſed to pray as I was woont to doe, nor neuer went to the Church at time of common Prayer, becauſe it condemned myne owne conſcience, for ſuffering mee to commit ſuche abhominable ſinnes of Vſury, and others moſte deteſtable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wyll of my heauenly Father, who of the largeneſſe of his mercy ſo manyfold and ſundry times did ſhew me ſuche euident and ſinguler tokens of his graces and mercies. And thus my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionleft me, ſithence which time I aſſure you I haue had aſmuch quietneſſe as any man can wiſhe, and haue ſeene ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſightes, as neither hearte can
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7209:25"/>
thinke, nor tongue can expreſſe. And ſo this reconciled perſon deſired the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter being preſent to ſay the vii. Pſalme, <hi>Glory bee to God on high,</hi> and then hee thought to haue died. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breath being geuen him, he reuiued again, and fell to prayer, and gaue himſelf wholy to quietneſſe, but ſhortly after he departed this life. And as I finde of this one ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, ſo I can not learne, but that as the number of ſuch are very rare and contrary to many ſuch as God hath ſuffered to periſhe through that ſinne as appeareth vnto what miſerable end, the trade of Vſury brought manye Iewes who occupied the ſame trade in this lande in former ages, in ſuche wyſe as it is affirmed in our chronicles. Thatthere were certain Iewes inhabiting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of York. Inſomuch as for ſome one of theyr profeſſion exacted vpon a Chriſtian <note place="margin">An. 2.

<pb facs="tcp:7209:26"/>
money to bee in ſauegard, but the people woulde not accept it: In ſomuche as it is ſaide that through the wicked counſell of one of their men of lawe, all the ſaide Iewes ſo diſtreſſed agreed too cut the throates of al theyr wiues and children, and to caſt theyr dead bodies ouer the Walles vppon the Chriſtians heades, which horrible fact they hauing deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately perfourmed the reſt not ſo ſlayne ſet fier on the Tower wherin they were, and conſumed themſelues by fire. Loe heere a iuſte rewarde for ſo damnable a trade, themſelues to be the executioners of theyr owne wiues &amp; children heaping vengeaunce vpon them ſelues in a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable maner: So as it is noted 600.

               <p>And as a falſe Diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is not ſet in a Ring without a ſubtill foyle, in ſuch wiſe as the deceite of the deceiuer may hardly be diſcouered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the help of an expert Lapidarie: So Vſurers are not without theyr ſubtill ſhifts &amp; argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour &amp; defend their falſe and deceiueable practiſes.

For then ſay they, that no man may buy and ſell without committing of Vſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, and ſo they doe dwell vppon a nyſe point of definition what Vſury is, albeit the euill nature thereof doth demonſtrate and declare it ſelfe contrary too the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuch commendable buying and ſelling as ought to be orderly performed in the fellowſhipp of men, without the compaſſe or hauing to doe with Vſury. As it is manyfeſt, that when any honeſt Merchaunt or Retayler of wares, doo put the ſame to ſale, the maner thereof is put in vſe in open market, and that by ſome knowne ſigne, without the ſiniſter dealings that vſurers doe practiſe, whoſe dwelling places are not eaſie to finde out from other mens, for want of a Signe, which is not ſo agreeing to theyr profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as experience teacheth, for aſmuche as the name of an Vſurer, is not onely hatefull to all good men, but alſo lothſom vnto the Vſurers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: So as theyr dwelling places are as ſubtill as the lurking of the Serpent that lieth hidden vnder greene leaues, and Vſurers by theyr apparell may as hardly be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

hearbes doe worke much in curing, but the better if they be applied in their right nature and condition: in ſuch ſort as men can not vſe the Surgions practiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much payne to be indured by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, eſpecially if the Surgion bee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of hart: So aſſuredly men can not goe to lawe one with an other with ſuche quietneſſe of mynde, as it is by ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. For proofe whereof, if men would examine in them ſelues howe difficult a thing it is, for Chriſtian bretheren too ſpende their tyme in folowing lawe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: It will eaſily appeare, that for the moſt parte, ſuche common poſting to law as nowe a dayes is vſed, is not perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without greate greefe and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mynde.

And nextly, their money in their purſes will not bee at quiet tyll their proper owner bee eaſed thereof by Lawyers: although with the more paine if the Clyents are dwellyng farre from London, folowing oftentymes their own euill affections, as they are mooued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe

As a ſtrange caſe that ſenſible men ſhold delight to weary their bodies by trauey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from farre: to the ende to departe from their goods in ſo ill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in truely the Lawyers are not ſo muche to be blamed in the attentiueneſſe of their priuate gaine, as many fond Clyents by procuring their owne paine. For before the Lawyer was troubled with ſuch Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and their troubleſome cauſes, and fraighted with their harde gotten mony, the Lawyer did ſit, and perhaps might

For proofe thereof, my ſelfe haue learned by experience, included in theſe verſes folowyng:</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Whereby it is to bee noted, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce wherein many doe ſhewe them ſelues to bee blynded, with the litle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7209:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which one neyghbour ſeemeth to haue in an other. In ſo much as I haue thought both my ſelfe and many others deceiued in that behalfe, who ſettyng a parte the truſt of affiaunce, which ought to bee repoſed in honeſt &amp; diſcreet neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, haue obſtinately throwne them ſelues into great charges, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodittes before rehearſed. Albeit, dayly experience teacheth, that after long and tedious ſute mainteined, the ende of all iſſues growe to one of theſe two poyntes, that eyther the parties are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by, friendes, or by their Lawyers to put the matter in comprimyſe, or els the nature of the lawe doeth award a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of twelue men to trye the iſſue, in ſuch wyſe as perhappes no one of the ſayde twelue are knowne, neyther vnto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye playntyue, or defendaunt: or if to the one, yet not to the other. Wherevpon I deeme this old adage dyd grow, That as a man is befriended, ſo is the law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So as often tymes it falleth out, that thoſe carrye awaye the blowes, who leaſte diſtruſted theyr cauſe: farre

contrary to their expectations: In ſuche ſort, as were it not much better that ſuch vnſkilfull perſons had neuer hazarded them ſelues in the fray. As often the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doeth hang a yeare or two doubtfull, in whom the victory ſhal reſt: and yet in the ende one worde may bee ſo taken at the vantage, as the ſpending of many a pounde may not cure the wounde made thereby.</p>
               <p>And by ſuch means the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amitie is much impaired. In ſo much as Chriſtian loue and neighbourhead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be very cold, where the people may not be perſwaded ſo to frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, as to commyt their common cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of controuerſie, to the hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the worſhipful Gentlemen nere vnto them adioyning, or vnto their honeſt diſcreete neighbours. For it is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke that a ſtranger who dwelleth farre diſtant from vs, and altogether ignorant of our diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and conuerſations, ſhold ſooner prouide a redemie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our knowen neighbours, and ſuche as wee are daily conuerſant with all: and vnto whom our inclinations &amp; maners of liuing is better

               <p>As alſo no ſenſible man ought to bee ignorant, that honeſt neighbors wil hold themſelues more thankfully content with one friendly intertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles vſed in ſuch behalf, then the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers will accompt of their many fees. But me thinketh, I heare ſome ſay, mine aduerſary dwelleth farre diſtaunt from mee: vnto whom I anſwere, not ſo. But that if thou accompt anye thy Chriſtian brethren for thine aduerſary, then take heede of thy Aduerſary the Deuill, for he is nearer vnto thee then thou art aware off: And appeareth not to be farre from ſuche, as haue choſen to dwell in malice and grudge of conſcience many yeares, yea, perhappes to their ending day.</p>
               <p>And againe me thinkes I heare ſome ſay, that my neighbors vpon ſome grudge may be corrupted, which I can not deny: But then it muſt needes folowe, that the people are very euill diſpoſed, and in a badde caſe, where corruption may ſo take place in the hearts of ſuch as profeſſe the name of God: that ſo many may not bee founde to ſpeake in true iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

To try all whereof let
<pb facs="tcp:7209:43"/>
it be noted how euery company of good Bees being ſeperated from their hiues in gathering of their prouiſion far from home, who vpon their ſeuerall returnes againe, no one will couet any other hyue but their owne proper, and that which is incident vnto them ſelues, neyther ſhould be ſuffered if they would, for that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it ſhoulde ſeeme, euery company of Bees doeth ſo holde together, in ſuche wyſe, as euery one of them doeth in the wynter poſſeſſe the fruite of their paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour gathered in the ſomer. Being perfourmed by equall labour not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger to bee croſſed in their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, ſome tyme by one meanes, ſome tymes by an other.

perfourmaunce whereof, the good wil of each one, ſeemeth to be well allowed, not onely to the comfort of their own felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp, but alſo to euery common wealth, whereas they are ſetled and cheriſhed, declaryng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſo worthie to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Wapſes, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euil ſtinges in the gathering of their badde prouiſion: And that often tymes doeth appeare by the ſhrewde harme and damage that many an honeſt man doeth ſuſtayne by dealyng with ſuche vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cattayle: whoſe ſeperation is, not onely required from among good Bees, but alſo their company from among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neuertheleſſe many of that ſort woulde be thought and reputed as good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Bees, although no honeſt bare faced man can well away to haue to doe with that ſort. From whome it may bee thought that many people in this age haue taken enſample, to deale ſhrewde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and vniuſtly with their neyghbours, as dayly experience teacheth. In ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as it was a common ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the people not longe ſithens, that where any one intended to do dammage

to any other their Chriſtian brethren or neighbours, it was ſpeeched in a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner thus: I warrant you to bee ouertaken with a crooked meaſure, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng to doe with ſuche a one: which God knoweth appereth yet to be too too truly perfourmed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, contrary to this one good inſample. For the true meaſuring of corne in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate Cities and Townes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, where the true meaſure is well knowne to be faſtened in a certaine place neare vnto the market, where as euery one may at their pleaſures, haue the true vſe thereof, and not denyed to any: which notwithſtanding, the greateſt number of the people in their common buiyng and ſellyng, doe ſeeme to haue ſet a parte to deale in true meaſure, as hardly to bee perſuaded to take ſo litle paynes as once to ſteppe ouer the way, or to their nexte neyghbours doore, to the ende to ſpeake or deale in trueth and true meaſure, by reaſon that the crooked meaſure is euery where ſo readie. As often tymes it falleth out too true, that many a true meanyng man is ouertaken, &amp; ſome tymes vndone
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7209:44"/>
by ſuche lyke euill crooked &amp; deceiueable meanes, and yet the Lorde hath ſayde, <note place="margin">Luke. 3</note> that all crooked thinges ſhall bee made ſtraight, &amp; all rough wayes ſhalbe made playne, and all fleſhe ſhall ſee the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their God.</p>
               <p>And although all men can ſay, playne <note place="margin">Chapmen or retaylers of wares.</note> meanyng and playne dealyng is beſt, as in very deede and in trueth none can deny it, ſo fewe doe folow it.

But what may be ſayde then to ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible monſters, for I may not terme them men: If there be ſuche as I haue hearde to be, who will not let to ſweare vpon a booke, and that before any Iudge, beyng hyred therevnto for money. And ſuch are called by the names of Knightes of the poſte, more fitter for the Gallowes, then to liue in a common wealth where Chriſt is profeſſed. For by ſuche wicked &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable meanes, truth is oftentimes put to ſilence, and the lawe is ſubuerted contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this doctrine, that who ſo liſteth to liue, and would faine ſee good dayes, let him refraine his tongue from euil, &amp; his lippes that they ſpeake no guile.

<pb facs="tcp:7209:46"/>
one thing, howe that one day is with the Lorde as a thouſand yeares, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares as one day. The Lorde that hath promiſed is not ſlacke, as ſome men count ſlackneſſe: but is patient to vsward. Foraſmuch as he wold haue no man loſt, but will receiue all men to repentaunce. Neuertheleſſe, the day of the Lorde will come as a theefe in the night, in the which day, the heauens ſhall paſſe away in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a tempeſt, and the Elements ſhal melt with heate: the earth alſo and the workes that are therin, ſhall burne. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng then that all theſe thinges ſhal periſh what manner perſons ought yee to bee in holy conuerſation and godlines: looking for, and haſtyng vnto the comming of the day of God, by whome the heauens ſhall periſhe with fyre, and the Elements ſhal melte with heate. Neuertheleſſe, wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to his promiſe, looke for a newe heauen and a newe earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſneſſe. Wherefore dearely beloued, ſeeyng that yee looke for ſuche thinges, be diligent that ye may be found in peace without ſpotte and vndefiled, and ſuppoſe that the long ſuffring of the Lord

               <p>By this doctrine euery Chriſtian ought not to be ignorant howe there is a great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> record of God and the witneſſe of men, &amp; that euery one ſhould ſo growe in grace &amp; knowledge of our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt: As that we be not plucked away thorow the errour of the wicked. In reſpect wherof to the ende that all men may haue a due conſideration what manner of dealing God alloweth among his people in their buiyng and ſelling, I haue here ſet down ſuch certaine notes as the worde of God doeth direct vs vnto.</p>
               <p>When thou ſelleſt aught to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or buieſt any thing of him, deceiue <note place="margin">Deut. 25.</note> nor oppreſſe him not.</p>

               <p>A falſe Ballance is an abomination <note place="margin">Prou. 11.</note> vnto thy Lord God. Moreouer thou ſhalt not haue in thy bagge twoo manner of weightes, a great and a ſmall: neyther ſhalt thou haue in thy houſe two manner of meaſures a great and a ſmal. That thy
<pb facs="tcp:7209:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lyfe may be long in the lande which the Lorde thy God giueth thee: for who ſo doeth contrary, is an abhomination vnto the Lord God.</p>
               <p>Haue therefore a regarde vnto this doctrine, leſt that God beholdyng your miſoemeanour towardes him and your neighbour, ſay this vnto you, Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple drawe vnto mee with their mouthes <note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> and honour mee with their lippes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit their heartes are farre from me: but in vaine doe they ſerue me.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is written, if any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you ſeeme deuout, and refraine not his tongue, but do deceiue his own heart: this mans deuotion is in vaine.</p>
               <p>By which doctrine wee are learned, that the eyes of the lord are ouer the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, &amp; his eares are open to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and the face of the Lorde beholdeth all thoſe which doe euill and wrong. Wherby it is to be noted, in what dread men doe ſometime ſtand in of their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, leſt that for ſome contempt or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the tranſgreſſours are ſubiecte to be ſent to ward, in ſuch wiſe as in ſuch caſes men doe ſeeme to bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. And yet a great number, thorowe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7209:47"/>
their neglecting their duetie &amp; obedience to God, do vnto him ſtande ſubiect euery houre, to be caſt into a woful priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: where it will be too late for ſuch to ſay, I would other my friends were warned by mee. For then that may neither auayle thee, nor amend them. As wee finde it written: That when <hi>Diues</hi> deſired that his other <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue knowledge of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: It was anſwered him: They haue Moyſes, the law, and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>By which enſample all people are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in this lyfe while they haue time &amp; ſpace euery one both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to do nothing againſt a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to examine in them ſelues, how they doe delight to lyue in the feare of God, and by their innocency of lyfe, doe indeuour them ſelues to obtayne Gods fauour, and ſo to be brought into the fold me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Wherin it is noted, <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> how the ſheepe of Chriſt are marked: and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ſeales they are ſealed againſt the day of the Lorde: By which parcell of ſcripture, Chriſt doeth acknowledge his: In that hee ſayeth, My ſheepe heare my voyce, I knowe them,
<pb facs="tcp:7209:48"/>
and they followe mee, and I giue vnto them eternall lyfe, which is to bee obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by earneſt repentance, and mortifling of our earthly members, framyng our felues to bee obedient vnto the voyce of that good ſhepheard of our ſoules. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee feede all in one greene paſture vnder ſo good a ſhephearde nexte vnder God: as our gratious Queene, of whom rightly it may bee regiſtred in <hi>perpetuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> That by the permiſſion of God &amp; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, her Maieſtie hath raigned the peaceable Queene and ſhephearde ouer the litle ſhepcoate of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Wherefore it behooueth the people to be as ſimple as ſheepe, &amp; in their yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lyke due obedience to God, and our ſo bleſſed a gouerneſſe, &amp; not to ſet light by the callyng of the Paſtors, who watch for our ſoules euen as thoſe that muſte giue account therefore, and vnto ſuch we owe a duetifull reuerence, eſpecially if they be ſuche Paſtors and Miniſters as are required in ſo weightie a buſineſſe: and whatſoeuer the Miniſter be, be hee good or badde, whoſe conuerſation if we will needes looke vpon, yet wee muſt ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7209:48"/>
looke, that our looking be rightly. And although we are forbidden to do as ſome of them doe: yet we are not forbidden to folowe the doctrine which by them is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto vs, out of the worde of God. And to trye whether our followyng bee rightly, and howe wee doe profite euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the courſe of this our pilgrimage, Let vs examine it by theſe twoo rules. Firſt, as huſbandment can make no perfit reckoning of his painefull labour &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, <note place="margin">The meanes wherby eche man may era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in himſelfe how he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rich to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> nor of the increaſe of his ſeed ſow en in the ground, vntill he haue had ſome certaine tryall of the yeelde which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes is hindered in the commyng vpp, in ſo much, as although it haue a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tyme, firſt in growyng greene and pleaſant to looke vppon, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is apparant, that in that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may happen great imperfection, as to be choked with weedes or blaſted. And albeit, it grow to a more forwardneſſe to earyng, yet it is ſeene oftentymes that a tempeſt commeth and beateth it downe. And if there remayne a hope of plentifull increaſe, yet the ſame is not certainely knowne, howe much it will profit the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandman,
<pb facs="tcp:7209:49"/>
vntyll it bee houſed in the barne.</p>
               <p>And againe as the Merchant aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer can not perfite their accomptes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dangerous aduentures be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſafetie, to their wiſhed and deſired port: So as after their merchandiſe and commodities beeyng vended, then fall they to caſting and Ballaunſing of their recconings. Vpon the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they doe diſcerne, what and how much they haue profited or loſt in their voiage or aduenture: and if they finde that they are brought behynde hand, and fall ſhort of their recconing, then they examine the cauſe, which beyng founde, they become more carefull in their; next aduenturing. An ſuche wyſe, as by their diligence, and God his bleſſyng of their trauayles, in ſo good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as their former loſſes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme is reſtored againe with double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, to their great comfort and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of all ſuche as doe fraudently deceiue or waſtfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume their goods, and ſo become bankerupt.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples I woulde wiſhe all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7209:49"/>
men to imitate, by examinyng euery one in him ſelfe, howe they doe growe riche in the perfityng of their accompt to God warde. Although it is apparaunt that there are ſome men which waxe riche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe, who ſhewe them ſelues not to knowe what it is to heare the Lord God ſpeakyng to them by his Prophets: and in this our age deliuered vnto them by the mouthes of many learned and godly Preachers, whoſe callyng if they may not be heard and receiued, accordyng as it is written in the Reuelation. Hee that hath eares let him heare, That is to heare rightly, and with ioy, and to expreſſe the fruite thereof in a lyfe agreeable to the ſame, which if riche men doe refuſe to practiſe, then let it be examined how, and what ſuch and their poſteritie ſhall be the better for riches vnlawfully gotten: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the more they haue, the more they want. And that which they haue ſo gotten and ſcraped together, ſhel one day bee a witneſſe againſt them. For it is true, that although wee haue here many dayes, God ſhall haue one day. As the
<pb facs="tcp:7209:50"/>
worde of God teſtifieth, That the day of the Lorde ſhall come vpon all fleſhe. And as it is written in the Goſpell of Saint Marke. Except that the Lorde ſhoulde ſhorten thoſe dayes, no man ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: <note place="margin">Mark. 13.</note> but for the elects ſake which he hath choſen, he hath ſhortened thoſe dayes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is written in the ſame Chapter, Thus ſaith the Lord. Til theſe thinges be done, heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, but my wordes ſhal not paſſe. But of the day &amp; the houre knoweth no man: No not the Angels which are in heauen, neither the ſonne of man him ſelfe, ſaue the father onely. Take heede, watch and pray, for ye knowe not when the time is. As a man which is gone into a ſtraunge countrey, and hath left his houſe, &amp; giuen authoritie to his ſeruauntes, and to euery one his work, and commaunded the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to watch: watch therfore, for ye know not when the maiſter of the houſe will come, whether at euen or midnight, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Cocke crowing, or in the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng: Leſt if he come ſodainly, he ſhould ſinde you ſleeping.</p>
               <p>And that I ſay vnto you, I ſay vnto
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7209:50"/>
all men, watch and pray.</p>
               <p>The due conſideration of this doctrine hath mooued many good and godly men to become ſtedfaſt in the faith of Chriſt, as the beſt meanes to the attainement of ſaluation. But this fayth that is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, muſt be no idle fayth: for a perfecte <note place="margin">Faith is of a forcible effect. and the ſtay of our life.</note> fayth is as a conſumyng fyre to burne vp all infidelitie, ſinne, and wickednes.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And as faith of it ſelfe</l>
                  <l>Is the ſumme of our Creede:</l>
                  <l>So good workes are not excluded,</l>
                  <l>in word nor indeede.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>As teſtifieth theſe neceſſary places of ſcriptures. Thou haſt fayth, and I haue deedes: ſhew me thy fayth by thy deeds: belieueſt thou that there is one God? thou doeſt well: The Deuils alſo beleeue and <note place="margin">Iames. 2.</note> tremble.</p>
               <p>If a brother or a ſiſter be naked, and be deſtitute of daily foode, and one of you ſay vnto him, depart in peace: God ſend you warmeneſſe and clothing. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng, ye giue them not thoſe things that are needfull to the body, what ſhal it
<pb facs="tcp:7209:51"/>
helpe: Euen ſo, faith if it haue no deedes is dead in it ſelf. As for enſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, a needle is a needfull thing to make the way, but a threed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it more proſiteth the workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>And Sainct Paule to the Hebrewes writeth, Fayth is a ſure foundation of <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> thinges which are hoped for: and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of thinges that are not ſeene. For by it the Elders obtayned a good report. By Fayth <hi>Abel</hi> offered a more plentiful ſacrifice then <hi>Cayne:</hi> by which he obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned witneſſe that he was righteous, God teſtifiyng of his giftes.</p>
               <p>And in his Epiſtle to the Galathians, <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> Beare yee one an others burthen, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt, for if a man ſeeme to him ſelfe that he is ſomewhat, when in deed hee is nothing the ſame, deceiueth his owne minde. Let euery man prooue his owne workes: for whatſoeuer a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reape. For hee that ſoweth in the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſhe receiue corruption: And hee that ſoweth in the ſpirit, ſhall reape lyfe euerlaſtyng. Let vs not be weery of wel doing, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyme is come, we ſhal reape without
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7209:51"/>
wearineſſe: While wee haue therefore tyme, let vs doe good vnto all men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto them which are of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde of Fayth: for ſo ſhall we liue and not dye.</p>
               <p>And that I wryte not theſe thinges forth of mens dreames or fables, nor out of prophane hiſtories painted with vaine eloquence, but forth of the infallible truth of Gods worde. As by the authoritie of Saint Peter in his firſt Epiſtle doeth <note place="margin">Pet. 1.</note> leade vnto.

howe many nowe in this age are ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſet vpon couetouſnes, as to incroche into one mans hands ſo many tenements and houſes as by all meanes poſſible hee may compaſſe, eyther in buying the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple, or els the graundeleaſe ouer the tennantes heades, in ſuche wyſe as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng obtayned the ſame, and doing ſome ſmall reparations thereupon: then doeth the new Landlord not onely inhaunce the rent for which ſuch Tenements went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tyme: But alſo the Tenaunt muſt giue a large fyne, beſides ſome reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons left vndone for him to doe, for the eaſement of the houſe, although the poore Tenantes purſe bee ſo wronged therby, as oftentymes it ſo falleth out, that all the ſhiftes that hee can make, may hardlye recouer ſo chargeable a ſickneſſe as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to many by ſuche yll meanes, in ſuch ſort as ſometimes the tenant grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſo weake a caſe as not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde the ayre, or to goe out of the doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by reaſon of the infection of priuate

               <p>Sometyme there was a great Turke <note place="margin">An enſample of a great Turke.</note> whoſe name was called <hi>Soldanus Egypti.</hi> who was touched with the conſideration of the profeſſion of Chriſt his religion: as that he was mooued and ſtirred in mynd, to haue forſaken his abominable errour

and become a Chriſtian: So as he might bee aſcertayned that the lyues of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were agreeable to their profeſſion. Wherevpon in the conſideration of his intention, after hee had long pondered with him ſelfe howe hee might beſt bee reſolued in ſo weightie a cauſe, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to breake the matter vnto one nere about him, in whome hee had moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and vnto him the ſaid great Turke declared the ſome of his intention, and findyng his truſtie friende readye to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe his requeſt: who ſecretly was furniſhed about that buſines: So that in ſhort time he arriued in ſome parts of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, as a part of Chriſtendom: to the end there to diſcouer the maners and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the people, where bee founde the maner of their liuyng, ſo farre vnagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the names of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as the ſaide meſſenger of the.

maſter the great Turk in this wiſe. True it is, that thoſe people where I haue byn in Chriſtendome, &amp; that beare the names of Chriſtians, doe in their outwarde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce profeſſe to ſerue a Godwhom they knowe note, and otherwiſe theyr lyues in deedes, are diſtayned with all abominable loathſome ſinne and wye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.

In ſo muche as God be prayſed there are ſome certaine, that willingly and gladly doe ſhew them ſelues to bee faythfull labourers in the houſe of God. But the greater number beſides, ſeeme to be ſuche as in very deed woulde be accompted good labourers in Gods Vineyarde, who in deedes doe appeare playne, to bee but Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, when as the maiſter of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde ſhall come to tryall.

Whereby it is manifeſt, that the ſame good huſbande man who is our Sauiour Chriſt, hath alwayes had a lyke care for all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and will deny none of their hyre, that came vnto him in any tyme, in mind to be accepted.</p>
               <p>But alas, what may be ſayd or thought of ſuche as doe deferre and ſet off their commyng into the Lordes Vineyarde, euen vntyll their laſte houre.

Wherein is not to be forgotten, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our heauenly huſbandman, hath dealt and doeth deale ſo fauourably in his mercyes, with ſo many as hee findeth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful and careful to lyue with him.

               <p>By theſe words, ſome may doubt what

               <p>So ſhall we bee ſure that though all the worlde beſides were in an vprore and troubles: Though warres and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, plagues, &amp; peſtilence, and all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences were round about vs, yet ſhold we be defended and protected.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7209:73"/>
at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to keepe the feaſt of paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the ſeconde moneth.</p>
               <p>And the tenour of his letters was this:</p>
               <p>You ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> returne to the Lorde God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac &amp; Iacob,</hi> and he ſhall returne to the reſidue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth from the handes of <hi>Aſſur.</hi> Be not as your fathers, and as your brethren were, who haue tranſgreſſed againſt the Lorde God of their Fathers, who hath made them deſolate as you ſee. Holde not your heartes therefore. But giue your hands to the Lorde, returne to his Sanctuary, ſerue him and hee ſhall. ſhewe mercy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, to your ſonnes and daughters that be in bondage, for he is pitifull and eaſie to bee entreated. Thus farre dyd <hi>Ezechias</hi> by letters and meſſengers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the people declined from God, to repentaunce, not onely in <hi>Iuda</hi> where he raygned lawfull Kyng, but alſo in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſubiecte then to an other Kyng. And albeit, that by ſome wicked men, his meſſengers were mocked, ſo lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they not theyr iuſt puniſhmentes: For within ſixe yeares after <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7209:74"/>
was deſtroyed, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ledde captyue by <hi>Salmanazar.</hi> So dyd not this zealous King <hi>Ezechias</hi> deſiſt to proſecute his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in reſtoring the religion to Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ordinance, remauyng all wickednes.</p>
               <p>And again, in the Prophecie of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> it is written thus: If a man nowe <note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> heare the noyſe of the Trumpet, and will not be warned, and the Stewarde come and take him away, his bloude ſhall bee vpon his owne head: for hee heard the ſounde of the Trumpet, and woulde not take heede, therefore his bloud be vppon him. But if he will receiue warning, he ſhal ſaue his lyfe. Moreouer, if the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſee the ſworde come, and ſhew it not with the Trumpet, ſo that the people is not warned, if the ſworde come then and take any man from amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, the ſame ſhall bee taken away in his owne ſinne: but his bloud will I require at the watch mans hande.</p>
               <p>So is it required at the handes of all good Gouernors in this age, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">An order of planting or graftyng.</note> of plantyng may be obſerued in ſuche fourme, that euery tree may be ſo orderly planted and ingraffed, that there may be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7209:74"/>
no confuſed growyng. For it is written, that ſuche as are not ingraffed in Chriſt, ſhall be pulled vp by the rootes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behooueth that euery good Tree may be framed to be comfortable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencible to the other his neighbour and ſtander by, beyng all of one Orchard, the higher to the lower, and the lower not to be ſlacke in vpright growyng, to the end to doe their office, duetie, and good will, vnto the higher. For ſo is it required by the worde of God, and no politike wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome rightly may deny the ſame: as that when any ſtormy weather ſhould happen to blowe vp, that then ſuche as before would haue beene iudged Okes, ſhoulde not ſhew them ſelues as tottering reeds, ſubiecting them ſelues to bee ouerrunne with euery ſickle and ſythe. But that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the time, that god ſhal pleaſe by his prouidence to call vs vnto him more nearer, by any Croſſe of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that wee the people of this age may rather goe forwarde to meete with God in all reuerence, and valiantly to fight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his banner. Then that we ſhould goe backeward with faintyng heartes, and
<pb facs="tcp:7209:75"/>
ſeeke to hide our ſelues from his preſence which no man may eſcape, for that his glorious preſence is euery where, both on high vpon the Mountaies, and beneth in the vallies. How much more ought we miſerable creatures to bee vigilant, and that by continuall prayer and watching, thereby to mooue his Godhead not to be greeued nor diſpleaſed for our diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in tranſgreſſing of his Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: And that it may pleaſe him in his mercie to accept of our contrition in our returning euery one, forſaking his frowarde and vngodly wayes. And that with ſuch repentaunce and mortification, as ſinne may be abandoned and haue no place any longer to dwell in our mortall bodyes: And not to ſeeme too haue more care of thinges temporall, then of things eternall. For ſo nowe is it required at our hands in good earneſt, thereby to ſtop the mouthes of all enemies, as that other nations beholding the perfect fourme of our returning, may haue iuſt cauſe ſo to ſay of England:</p>
               <p>Lo theſe are the people whome God
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7209:75"/>
hath choſen vnto him ſelfe, and that the troubles of our neyghbours may ſounde a continuall watche worde in our eares, to amendment of our former euil liuing, or els wee may aſſure our ſelues, that wee doe but haſten the lyke meaſure of Gods diſpleaſure towardes vs, which I pray God graunt to keepe farre from Englande.</p>
               <p>And in the manner of our retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, let vs take and ſette before our tyes, this holeſome doctryne of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to <hi>Timothie,</hi> in his fyrſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <note place="margin">Tim. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I exhort therfore that aboue all things, Prayers, ſupplications, interceſſions, and giuyng of thanks be had for all men: For Kynges and all that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that wee may lyue a quyet and a peaceable lyfe, with all godlineſſe and honeſtie. For that is good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in the ſight of GOD our Sauiour, which will haue all men to bee ſaued, and to come vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth: For there is one

God and one Mediatour, betwixt God and man: Euen the man Chriſt Ieſus, which gaue him ſelfe a raunſome for all men. That it ſhould bee teſtified at this tyme, I tell the trueth in Chriſt and lye not. Beyng the teachers of the Gentiles with fayth and veritie. I will therefore that the men pray euery where, liftyng vp pure handes without wrath or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Likewyſe alſo the women, that they aray them ſelues in comely apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſſe and diſcreete behauiour, not with broydered heare, eyther gold, or pearles, or coſtly aray: but as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth women that profeſſe godlines tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row good works. Let the women learne in ſilence with all ſubiection, in ſuch wiſe as all ſuche as pray, may obtaine the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of prayer, which ought to be framed in all zealous maner, and with ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull obedience as we doe owe vnto God in making our prayers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: As we haue ſundrye enſamples ſet owne vnto vs by the word of God.</p>

And in this our age, no doubt of it, by the good prayers of godly men powred out before the Lorde God, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdyng of the people of Englande, in ſuche an acceptable a tyme, as God hath bene mooued in his mercyes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his flocke hitherto in a miraculous wyſe, with nowe full twentie yeares paſt of returnyng, which large tyme no doubt of it, hath pleaſed God in his mercy to vouchſafe to aſſigne vnto vs the people of England, the rather for the good affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he hath and doth beare vnto our ſo gratious and ſoueraigne Queene, vnder whom by Gods permiſſion we do enioye ſuch good bleſſings, as <hi>Moyſes</hi> gaue vnto the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in time of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, who is like vnto the people.

art ſaued in the Lord, which is the ſhield of thy helpe, &amp; ſword of thy glory. Thine enimyes haue loſt their ſtrength to thee ward, &amp; thou ſhalt treade vpon the height of them. But then it foloweth, that when <note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> as God did behold the grudging and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the Iſraelites, hee appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Moyſes</hi> to commaund them that they ſhoulde not preſume to come vp vnto the Lord leſt be deſtroyed them.

Wherevpon God gaue foorth the Table of the ten Commaundementes, left vnto all that ſhoulde come after, to folow them as children of obedience.</p>
               <p>And for that cauſe doe all the godly Preachers crye out daily foorth of the worde of God, Repent betymes as wee all doe admoniſh yee, repent, for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and wickedneſſe ſo plainely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in ſo bleſſed a tyme as God was not more profeſſed in woordes in many yeares before. But alas, too too farre out of the way in deedes: wherfore we are ſtil called to repent, for repentance is the onely way of our redreſſe &amp; deliuerance.
<pb facs="tcp:7209:78"/>
For, dyd God euer ſo long ſpare anye whome he hath taught by his Prophets without ſome euident repentaunce: Or vſeth any father to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his childe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome token of amendment: Conſider howe the Lord hath intreated <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iuda,</hi> his owne people. Howe ofte they treſpaſſed, and howe he gaue them ouer into the handes of their enemyes. But when ſo euer they repented and turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to God vnfeignedly, he ſent them Iudges and deliuerers, Kyngs and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours. This way then of repentance and vnfeigned turnyng vnto God by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is the onely way before God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and allowed.</p>
               <p>Therfore was <hi>Noah</hi> ſent into the old worlde to bring this doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and all the olde Prophets, as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Eliſeus, Eſaias, Ieremias,</hi> and <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> and hee who excelled all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Iohn Baptiſt, whoſe ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes for ſinnes woulde nowe be hardly abyde and ſuffered. Yet are they not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittyng to this age, for that the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſtil ſtriueth againſt the malice of our tyme. Albeit, in diuers ſortes and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7209:78"/>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> pronounced that within an hundreth and twentie yeares all fleſhe ſhoulde bee deſtroyed. Wee haue many <hi>Noahs</hi> that doe crye in our tymes, yet fewe repent. All that tyme that <hi>Noah</hi> was preparyng of the Arke, to auoyde Gods vengeance, the multitude derided this holy Prophete, as many nowe doe make a ſcoffe at all them that by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods worde, ſeeke the meanes appoynted to auoyde Gods indignation and iudgements. Then the people wold not repent: but as they ſhoulde lyue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they maryed, they banquetted, they builded, they planted, but not in God. And ſo it is muche to be feared, that in this age, there are many that do the like: they marry, but not in God: they builde, but not in trueth and righteouſneſſe: and therefore becauſe their buildyng is not accordyng to Gods direction, they know not howe ſoone it ſhall fall downe. And that it may appeare howe God hath vſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſetteth downe a very notable enſample, what returnyng God requireth of his people, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if thou wilt turne thee then vnto me, ſaith the Lorde, and if thou wylt put away thine abominations out of my ſight, thou ſhalt not be mooued, and ſhalt ſweare the Lorde liueth, in trueth, in equitie, and righteouſneſſe, And the people ſhall be fortunable, and ioyfull in him.

Wherein is expreſſed a wonderfull comfort: firſt is to be conſidered, how the Lorde our God maker of heauen &amp; earth, doeth humble him ſelfe, not onely to bee called a huſbandman, a houſholder, and ſuche lyke: But he abaſeth him ſelfe of mercy, to vs vile earth and aſhes, that his ſonne became man to make mankynde glorious in his ſight, to make all thoſe that do not refuſe his grace offered, of the ſlaues of Saten, his ſonnes by adoption: We are his ſonnes, we are his Vinyard, wee are as deare vnto him as the Apple of his eye: As <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſpeaketh, if you can beleeue it, hee ſweareth that you ſhal be his inheritance, and he will be yours: If yee will onely beleeue his grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and beleeue him when hee ſweareth.

               <p>But what is in this great matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it onely remaineth, that all do repent and returne vnto the Vineyard, with the firſt Sonne.

And it is certaine, that Chriſt preached three yeares in thoſe two famous Cities, and the Countreys vnto them adiacent. And after fortie yeares <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed, ſo long a time dyd God giue vnto them of repentaunce and returning from their froward wayes wherein thoſe people ſo proudly walked in diſobedience. And the ſame God of long tyme hath called his litle flocke of Englande, as the remnaunt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:7209:85"/>
the largeneſſe of his mercy offered. But the ſame ſeemeth to haue taken ſo little effecte, as that a great number with the conſent of diſobedience, haue taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by their owne wickedneſſe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke <note place="margin">Tob. 12.</note> almyghtie God vnto diſpleaſure, in ſuche lamentable wyſe, as many are become enemyes and betrayers of their owne ſoules, for which their ſo greeuous contempt none may eſcape the puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As it hath bene declared in all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table puniſhmentes from the beginning. For when the originall worlde periſhed by water, when <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 7. 19.</note> was conſumed by fyre. And finally, when <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was horribly deſtroyed, doeth any man thinke that all were lyke wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: it is euident that they were not Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, although ſome were young, and dyd not know what oppreſſion ment, neyther coulde defile them ſelues with beaſtly and vnlawfull luſtes, ſome were pitifull and gentle of nature, and dyd not thirſt for the bloud of Chriſt his apoſtles.

witneſſe, and the hiſtories be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which plainly doe teſtifie, that by the waters all fleſhe in earth at that time dyd periſhe, <hi>Noah</hi> and his family reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: That none eſcaped in <hi>Sodome</hi> and in the other Cities adiacent, excepte Lot and his two daughters. And euident it is, that in that famous Citie <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in that laſt deſtruction of the ſame, none eſcaped Gods vengeance except ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as before were diſperſed. And what the cauſe was of this Gods ſeueritie, we are forbidden to diſpute with God. But let all men by theſe examples learne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, to flee and auoyde to commit ſuch lyke abominations as the proude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God doe proſecute, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue liſt not to bee partakers of theyr plagues. And yet the cauſes are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for which GOD brought ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deſtruction vppon thoſe Cityes, manifeſtyng that wee ſhoulde bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect without grudgyng vnto Gods will and iudgementes, which in them ſelues are moſt holy and iuſt.

Wherefore it behooueth that we of this age, ſhould all humble our ſelues vnder the mightie hande of God, in ſuch wyſe as he in his mercy, beholding our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, may bee mooued to turne away his wrathfull diſpleaſure from vs. For in the originall worlde, none was found in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that eyther dyd reſiſt tyranny, or oppreſſion, that vniuerſally was vſed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet that earneſtly reprehended the ſame.

And let it not be forgotten, howe that <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet, was but three dayes in his deliueryng of the Lordes meſſage vnto that great Citie of <hi>Niniuee:</hi> That after fortie dayes the ſame Citie ſhoulde be deſtroyed.

As God graunt Englande, in rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their due obedience to do the like, in expreſſing our vnfeigned repentance, by our outward actions: for wee can not excuſe our ſelues by ignorance, as to ſay, that we want of ſuch like warning. For common experience may teache ſenſible men, that if one man receiue a hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from an other, great credite is giuen therevnto, eſpecially when there is fayth and confidence betwixt the partie who ſent the writing, and the parties vnto whom the ſame is ſent. In ſo muche as euery man and woman ought to examine in them ſelues what confidence euery one doeth repoſe in God his written worde: and what zealous loue euery one beareth in his heart toward the ſame. And let vs not be vnmindfull that there is a time to laugh, and a tyme to weepe, a tyme to go forwarde, and a tyme to goe backwarde. Wherby all are forewarned from goyng backwarde, like the frowarde nature of the Sea Crabbe.
