            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Although I know that worthy Knight, the Author of thèse Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes, hateth nothing more then comming in publick, yet many Copies of them being bestowed, by often transcription (as it many times hapneth) they might haue
<pb facs="tcp:9160:5"/>
beene by a mercenary hand fowly corrupted and altered in sence, and both in his absence and mine, deliuered to some Printer, who to make present gaine, would haue published them vnpolished, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without any correction: to preuent which, hauing in my hands a perfect Copy, and being inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuate with his priuatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, I thought it better to divulge them, then to aduenture that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. To couer this presumption, I haue made your Ladiships part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the patronage, because I am sure howsoeuer he shall dislike the publishing, yet it shall please him that your Ladiships names are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the forefront of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. I know also, that if himselfe could haue been perswaded to make
<pb facs="tcp:9160:5"/>
them thus vulgar, out of his owne choise, to your Ladiships they had beene directed, of whose vertues I haue heard his owne tongue vtter such worthy praises, that I doubt not but his Heart (which alwayes agreeth with his tongue) and all his other powers, are, and shall euer be consecrated to your Ladiships seruice.</p>
                  <p>The worke of it selfe being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, it cannot but be gracious to your Ladiships: for in this back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Age (too much declining from Vertue,) who are more fit to protect and defend her then your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, who are so neerely allied to Vertue, that she hath chosen you for her Temple, therein inshrined her selfe, and in you onely desireth to be adored. Your Ladiships are
<pb facs="tcp:9160:6"/>
neerely conioyned in blood, three of you being Sisters by nature, the fourth by Loue: but that coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is nothing so noble (although very noble) as that sweete combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your spirits, which are all so deuoted to Good, that though there be a Quaternity of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet those persons are so guided by those Angel-like spirits, that they make vp a delightfull harmony, a Soule-rauishing Musick, and a most pleasing and perfect Simpathy of Affections.</p>
                  <p>If then your Ladiships shall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize these Essayes, what vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tongues shall dare to infect them?

there belonges so to the basest trades, and shall thy estimation be so tender hearted, as to refuse it for so meane a price: beware of such couetousnesse, for it is worse then to loue money. Our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in general, me thinks should not be so neare a kinne to vs, they are no part of vs, wee may stand without them. God hath giuen vs Bodies, Soules seperate from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and hath tied neither lands nor treasures vnto them, they are no part of their buildings, we are worse then women, if we cannot see without these Habiliments and tricks: without question, it is a true signe of a maimed Soule, and a deformed Body, to seeke lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker from these outward things. It is more base then to bee out of countenance at a feast, if not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Hoste. I am my selfe

                  <p>If I loose ground in vertue, I will repent, not wash Handkercheifes in my teares. Man knowes not himselfe vntill he hath tasted of both fortunes.

You shall finde no man that dares goe wet-shod, but will protest in his Ambition, how much he loues Honour, what exploits, what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Acts he would do, if he had bene borne mightie: do you heare my friend? you are out of the way, if you thinke any other estate but

Now to particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
                  <p>In the outward habit, and in some actions, I am not so precise, I like not to be bound to one, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not secular men, it tastes of affectation and Hipocrisie: It is naught, it comes too neare singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, and a desire to be noted: for those things I would conforme my selfe: I am not of their mindes that tax <hi>Alexanders</hi> putting on the habit of the Persians.

course my lease might bee long, yet I am not afraid to be put out of my Farme: It is a dyrtie thing I dwel in, ful of mistie grosse aires, and yet barren; I haue bene so vaineglorious sometimes as to say so, when I haue bene answered by more yeares, that I would change that minde, when I grew older. I haue searched into that speech, supposing there had bin some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed mistery in it, but I could find none: then I thought they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my boldnes, the effect of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: if it be so, I shall loue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the worse while I liue. To cure this disease in a woman, I would apply no other medicine but example: It is euery bodies case, the fortune of Princes, as wel as Beggers, it is the fashion. To conclude, the first causer said it should be so: and if thou art not

<pb facs="tcp:9160:15"/>
Infamy, beggery, and misery, but alas they cannot: wisedome and vertue preuailes, and before them these names of shelter are but the surnames to our folly. Our actions are in our owne hands, and it were pittie else, for vertue &amp; vice shuld be confounded, were our deedes necessited. The world were no world, if they could not be cut asu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a distinction: there were no paines, no hier, there were no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, no glory, all were one and this one were a <hi>Chaos.</hi> But there are differences, There are good, and they are to be praised, bad, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for them yet indifferent, to eschewe badnesse by their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, youth readie for impression, Age wherin may be read the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of youth: Times christned by our vse Ages past, to light vs the way: others to come, the Iudges

of our deserts. If the end of life be to be good, if the safest purchase of goodnesse bee counsayle, if counsaile without scarres be most profitable, why eschew wee the blessing of Aduise? let vs alter this tradition, let vs not be so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; let vs make our beauties, our strengths, our abilities compleate, with making the proportion of the mind answerable to the beautie of the body, with giuing Strength direction, Abilitie iudgement. Warres, and States, and Counsells choose men practised in warres, in states, and in counsells. Wee are to aske counsell for the passage of our circuite of them that haue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, of Age, and Bookes: we aske to know, we cannot know except wee beleeue, wee must aske if wee will knowe, wee must beleeue, or else our asking is vaine. We giue,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:16"/>
and rightly giue preheminence to Age; wee haue found out a word to beautifie the wrinckles, and hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse thereof, we call it venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: why? meerely in respect of the Apparence? no, but in respect of the annexion; because wisdome commonly accompanies such a presence: for should we see it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing, it would be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and called riueld, and ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Let them in Gods name then shew vs their inward excellencies, and as our eyes beleeue them to be old, let our minds beleeue them to be wise: I see nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay the fairest braunches of our Commonwealth, then this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; either wee will not endure Aduise, or not beleeue it vntill our owne perills, and ouerthrows make vs see it, to our shame.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:17"/>We are inquisitiue of Trauailers concerning straunge Countries; our eares stande wide open for newes; and sometimes we swallow matters improbable: but when we are Aduised for our owne sakes, perswaded by Vertue, tolde the passages of the world truely, and haue all this sealed vp with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of a fathers, or a friendes loue, whom we haue no cause to suspect, as speaking either for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation, or Flattery, yet we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not. Let vs supple our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with reuerence, and regard of their words: let vs prepare our selues to receiue this inheritance, which feeds the minde, though it doth not durtily pamper our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it fortifieth all, and costs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with safetie it giues you that which another perhaps purchased with daunger, in an houre his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

of yeares. It would doubly blesse you with youth, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which seldome happen in our Age, because our Age is so obstinate as not to bee capable of Aduise.</p>
                  <p>Let vs aske, and follow: The life of Industries first fruite is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what sweatie, and painful, but then pleasant, and euer pleasant. A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory stored with the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of gallant actions is onely rich, it is a sweete meditation, that may be often read ouer without tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The most leaden spirit that euer was, at the hearing a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an vnusuall excellency, though he be more beholding to his eares, then his head, yet feeles Emulation tickle him, and wishes his brand were set vpon those ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

vaine.</p>
                  <p>First let vs proclaime warre against delicious nicenesse, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn our affections to a good vse, or turne them out of doores, <hi>Semen Laboris, Honoris Seges.</hi> It was pittie <hi>Pirrhus</hi> had no more to giue, he knew so well to whom to giue, naming him his Heire whose sword was sharpest, the height of whose spirit should carry him to the conuersation of actions stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with magnanimitie, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>I would allow a man to keepe the house no longer then till hee be able to flie, vntill his mind and body are able to carrie themselues without falling, not vntil hee bee past reeling, and staggering, for that abilitie we neuer haue: but in this time let bookes, and Aduise rectifie, and prepare vs fit for the entertaining of all fortunes; victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ouerthrowes: calamitie, and happinesse. Let vs robbe and suck from our Parents experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and iudgement: let vs bee acquainted with the successes, and sequences of the worlde, tracke their obseruations, bee acquainted with the mindes of times past, and let their bodies goe: If wee loue what they did, we haue the best part of them, for

                  <p>These licourous Humours, and Affections, are the out-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our mansion, &amp; the respect ought to be giuen to the Director whose high erected scituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth his prerogatiue: from the Rayes of this sun proceed all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, Aduise is the <hi>medium</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them, our braines like a sense able to performe good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if imployed. Let vs receiue, and vtter, be capable, and returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of this fruite. What a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious sight is it to see a temperate young man, how he shines, Glory, and admiration attends all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It is good in age, because the

contrary were abhominable, but it is common, &amp; their night being almost come, they cannot but looke grauely, and liue temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well to preserue them from paine, as to eschue shame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.

<pb facs="tcp:9160:20"/>
need not wish youth, for we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it, but iudgement that may make vs worthy to possesse it: then begin with Hearing, next with following Aduise and Counsaile: let vs beginne with our selues, and marshall, and dispose our owne course; let vs determine it, &amp; leaue nothing to vncertainties, but draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing out our intents regularly, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that delineated, and wayed maner: Here liues Happinesse, for here liues wisedome: this musicke of two strings is the most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful harmony, for the world affords not a more admirable excellency then youth, and iudgement inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one substance: both partes showe their richest Treasure, the Soule iudgment, the Body youth: let vs then infranchize Aduise, and perswade our eares to become good common-wealths men, to respect the generall profit: Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,

If we like not this, let vs deliuer men ware more precious, and wee shall not be offered such base stuffe in exchaunge. It is the trafficke of Humours that disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our conuersation, and a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a present itching content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brings repentance on the one side, and derisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the other. Thus are our liues either weeping or laughing: and euery one by turnes either feeles his own paine, and laments, or seeing better a far off then neare hand, laughes at his own imperfections in another. Who seeth a Louer, &amp; loues not? forcing his imagination to draw a

portrature of perfection, and then Pigmalion-like inamoured of his owne workemanship, and laughes not? Who seeth this creature feed vpon the Suspition of a Riuals en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining his mistresse, his eares not hauing abilitie to performe their office, and therfore teaching his eyes a new occupation, measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wind that proceeds from her mouth, and spelling words by the obseruation of her lippes, and pitties not? when in another vice this pitying laughter may deserue these marks of reproach, and haue his Iudges part taken from him, and condemned by his owne sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

thus Amendment which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly good: Reproofe receiues the nature of all things performed for anothers sake, they being la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and painfull: besides Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition cannot detract from acted Aduise which is example. What this humour doeth vndirected, it vndoeth: what directed sul of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. Suspition will accuse a friend, and fearing enemies, make an enemy: Wisedome knowes Trust ought heere to be applied, and makes Suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iealous of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him, not loosing him by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition: Certainly though it tastes of the grossenes of the parents, yet it is refined, beeing a knowledge forced out of ignorance, and not like the mother distracted, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding daunger: more subtil, for feare vnderstandes nothing that lookes not terribly, and frownes

not: Suspition out of smiles, and courtesies, can picke dangers, and Distrust venome out of sugar: but thus if not gouerned she wil go too farre, and starue her selfe with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting all thinges daungerous: but Wisedome applies it selfe to the place, and time, and out of them frames the allowance, or disallowance of Suspition. One thing makes mee thinke it not so naturally ours, seeing it seldome lights vpon things not precious in estimation, as among poore men iealousie of their wiues: but no where so conuersant &amp; powerful, as among Princes, vnto whom to say rightly, it rightly belongs: for how soeuer they are, they haue enemies: If good, enuious: If euil, some that lay holde vpon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: Yea, euen their friends are doubtfull, not beeing easily

                  <p>Among these States, Suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dissimulation are to be allowed, as beeing the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maydes of Pollicie, they ought to be conuersant among them, not to offend, but to defend: not in respect they are men, but in regard they are princes, whose liues trauel among dangers, &amp; therfore ought

warily to keepe this case of Pistols continually readie charged, and bent? but downwards they are not to be allowed, not dissimulation at all, for in a priuate Fortune it is a fearefull basenesse, and a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shift: neither will Suspition then serue to looke vpon our own liues, to obserue whether we goe backward or forward in Vertue: for we haue neither poysons, nor any other kind of treasons among vs: our enemies are more open, and touch vs slightly, and yet so plainly, as without the spectacles of Suspition we may see them. Thus are things different in name and nature, according to the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor: and as Princes and priuate men differ in the outward magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, so in their inward mindes.

Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this name of Friendship, which name co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, is the messenger of Peace, is included much daunger: for to leaue a friend, testifies either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie, or treacherie: and to be constant is not without perill: In the choise rests some apparence of safetie. In this choise there ought to be much vigilancie, for vntill the marriage of loue, hath coupled paires, wise natures are timerous in dilating themselues: and after that celebration, it is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious to diuorce a friend thogh guiltie of many deformities.

it is not tollerable, neither Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor nature, allowes it: we must then choose, we are compelled to choose: but here is diuersitie, the choise of a great man differs from a priuat man; the choise of a friend, from that of a faction. It is for a meane fortune to thinke of such as are able to better his minde, for a greater, of such whose strengths are able to vphold his fortune. In friendship I wil regard Vertue, In factions power: vnder this olde sentence, <hi>Simile simili gaudet,</hi> there was once much certainty, but now pollicy can put on all shapes, so that the Wolfe and the Lambe are hardly to be distinguished, either by their habit, words, or actions. It is lesse difficult for persons in indifferent estates to make theyr choise, then for great men, yet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly safe to pouertie, for there hee must be in loue with himselfe, or

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:37"/>I loue not <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor <hi>Caesar,</hi> nor none of these auncient glorious ones so well (in plainnesse I speake it) but I could be content their good Sayings, or good Actions were mine. I would haue them willingly with the appurtenances, and with the paines, and cost they were purchased with: but since I cannot haue them so, I will take patterne by their example: I will liue temperately, and loue valour to atchieue the like Ornaments. Doo you not thinke Aemulation doth handsomely here? yes, yes, without question shee is the very spirit of whatsoeuer rastes well. When we begin to liue, we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally giuen to followe what wee know, and so wee liue vanquished by pleasure, vntill Aduise or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course tells vs the way of Vertue, and commends it; and at that time we onely apprehend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:38"/>
and would faine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the like: thus is Aemulation the baite of Vertue, for looking into the sweetnesse of the reward, we vndertake the labour. Behold the power of Vertue, euen they that dwell not with her, but speak of her, it makes their speech grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. I remember the time when I my selfe was thus caught: I heard the report of the vertuous, and presently I emulated the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers good deliuery, and began to get his Tale by heart: but vpon the repetition I began to thinke, if speaking well were so gratious, how excellent would it be to doo well? thus the aemulation of good wordes, begot the aemulation of good deeds; which one day may come to the ripening &amp; to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of worthy matters. Come then, put away your rustie traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all you that thinke not thus:
<pb facs="tcp:9160:38"/>
banish not Aemulation, except you determine to haue all your yong men vnthrifts of their time, for thus youth must be entered: marry for age, Time hath brought them nearer their graues, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them a Gods name, loue Vertue for her own sake: let them define Vertue, and her reward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisibly: but those that are now in the quickest of her sensibilitie, must see her in a bodie sensible, or they will not know her. Parents thus wrap your Aduises, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeued any aduise of mine, vntill the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their speech came to persons knowne, and so quickened me vp with an honest Aemulation.</p>

                  <p>TO the thing so ful of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as nothing can be added Glory must bee attributed, for it is a title onely due to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame point of all perfection, to things acknowledging an original Praise: Glory goeth vpward, and is the Attribute to God; Praise the reward of men reckons down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, chalenging nothing respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his worthines, but that there are worse, and so much goodnesse is allowed him, as to ouercome ill in comparison: we must giue Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then, not vsurpe it, but Praise i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:39"/>We that are left beggers by our first Fathers vnthriftinesse, haue onely a possibilitie to recouer left vs: wherfore Vertue comes hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vs with difficultie &amp; paines; neither will our pouertie permit vs to be content with reuersions, and to possesse the reward of our trauailes after our decease: and therfore God hath giuen vs vpon deserts, the liuelihood of praise, and after death, the recouery of our first rich inheritance: so that Vertue hath praise here, and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie heereafter. This praise must be deriued from Vertue, for we must loue deserts as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or else our mindes are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary.</p>
                  <p>The respect must onely be to Vertue, which obtained, the rest are obtained; without which, to snatch at praise is vaine-glory, at heauen, presumption. Accidents
<pb facs="tcp:9160:40"/>
cannot stand without a substance, neither haue these seperated any Essence, but are rather names then things: Vertue must beget them, for without her they are not. Let vs see Vertue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and afterwards Praise: what comes within the circuite of our thoughts or deedes may be adorned with Vertue: to thinke wel constantly is vertuous, and vertue giues it praise: for deeds are begotten by thoughts, &amp; good deeds without good thoughts are not. In things indifferent a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ornament onely is obtained: Thus are our Habits, and part of our Behauiour, which depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion, and are either grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or disgracefull, according to time, and place.</p>
                  <p>Curtesie, liberalitie, gentlenesse, and such like are outward vertues, and termed the parts of a winning behauiour: good they are, not to
<pb facs="tcp:9160:40"/>
be missed, but yet not the end of the desire of Vertue. But shewing our chiefest treasure, wee must bring forth Temperance, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Patience: so ample is the scope of these perfections, as what else in moralitie may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, comes within the compasse of their Dominion.</p>
                  <p>Temperance is the hardest lesson, so contrary it is to our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, so seldome vanquished: but this difficulty is rewarded with the most resplendent shining of all: for Fortitude carries safetie with it, and present commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Patience often proceeds not from the rebutting choller, but from a coldnesse of constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but to possesse Temperance, there is no Temperature hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, for none are so weake, as to want abilitie to maintaine Desires, and Affections: none so

paine, and yet seemed not touched with paine: It was a pretie triall, and he that vpon the like, cannot perswade Magnanimitie to resist weeping, let him obscure himselfe, and make account to doo nothing but preuent paine, and resist infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with Phisicke. When For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude feeles oppression, and an impossibilitie of being victorious, to eschew rashnesse, desperation, and fury, he turneth to Patience, which defends him from beeing ouercome though vanquished. No Fort can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare with the strength of this, which suffering makes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction angry, rather then himself to be moued. Nothing here is comparable to the vnmoued dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrought by Reason.

and mortalitie, and yet not to be loosened, nor in danger of falling, is the most bewtiful, the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and the most renowmed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of man, so full of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as drawing liking to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pitch, as it ends with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Who enioyes this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue really (for there are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faits resembling it) hath the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oussest Iewell of the world: the vertue of stones expelling poison, skins, bewitchings, and thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, hearbes, spelles, and Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, are not comparable, they are poore in vertues, and perhaps estimation in spight of them giues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qualities: &amp; though they haue them, it is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly but one: but Patience resists poysons, bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, thunderbolts, spelles, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations, &amp; all calamities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our life is subiect. Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saith some things wil foretoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mishap,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:43"/>
and breake before the euent: but Patience in the midst of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties breakes not, no nor crackes.</p>
                  <p>The attribute of these outward Iewels of estimation, if we receiue good by them, must goe to them: but all these blessings light vpon our selues: we haue not onely the happines of safetie, but the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of not receiuing it from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Lastly, no casualtie can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of it, for wee loose our selues if it: nor can we be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with missing it, since he parts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe that wants it. Al these blessings are the trapers of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of Patience, which no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no strength, no authoritie can make recreant. Then Praise bring the Garland of Victory, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of Triumph to adorne this Conquerour, and Fame out of the mouth of Enuy hale commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and praises: who denies the

attendance of his tongue vppon this Trophee, let him be cursed with being not capable of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Thus Patience, thus Fortitude, thus Temperance, if Temperance, if Fortitude, if Patience be vnited, one is not enough, nor two, the consorting Harmony is not full enough: besides wanting one, the contrary not wanting, duskes all with counteruailing vices: but to be compleate, is to haue all, from which though we sometimes slide, let not that discourage vs, but vp againe, and happily with being ouercome, we may learne to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which yeelds the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of being victorious: Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brings forth Praise, and Praise ends with Eternitie; Eternitie to our name, and to our soules.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hee is my enemy that thus eates vp my meate, and Time, without any cause that perswadeth his stay.

I haue a medicine for these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I will not be consumed liuing by these wormes: what's your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? this is my answere, farewell. These wordes haue an excellent vertue in them, they deliuer you to Solitarinesse, the mother of Contemplation, they keepe your house sweete, and at dinner if you like a dish, it is your owne faulte if you haue it not cold. When my occasions grow so desperatly mad, as in despight of me they will hale me abroad into throngs, and great assemblies, he that entertains me, I will him, speake to all, reserue a straunge familiaritie for the best, and my good word, and courtesie generally.

I goe to this Vessell, and thirsting after some good licour, hastily pierce it, when there issueth medicines, or Lawe-tearmes: alas, it is either a Surgeon, or an Atturney, my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation hath broken her necke. Well these are places to grow fat in, not wise. Let vs trauaile some-whither else, to the Vniuersitie: Their discourse is good, but too fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, you vndoo them if you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them not to goe Methodically to worke. <hi>Nego maiorem, aut mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, probo, Ipse dixit, &amp;c.</hi> I like not this, except his aduersary be a Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer too, there is no vnderstanding one another: It is a generall fault among the best professions: For

Mercenary, and Mechanicke, it skilles not, It becomes them well to discouer themselues by theyr speech, but a Gentleman should talke like a Gentleman; which is, like a wise man: his knowledge ought to bee generall, it becomes him not to talke of one thing too much, or to be wayed downe with any particular profession. Heerein I admire <hi>Plato</hi> his Description of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who though a Souldier, and a Scholler, yet he discoursed still like Wisedome, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds ouer all.

We patch and lengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hopes with such fraile and slender stuffe, imputing our misfortunes to our Desteny, and to the Tune, like <hi>Tiberius,</hi> asking a Gard of the Romane Senators, saying his loue had purchased the hate of the Common-wealth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was his vnmeasurable crueltie. Neither in publike, nor in priuate liues, neede we be in this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is no bodies fault but our owne: for Fortune hath no power of Wisedome, but of Sensualitie, and of liues that swimme and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigate without the Load-stone of Discretion, and Iudgement.

his owne time: Euery man may be blest, and rich in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if his owne dissolutenesse, and vnthriftinesse, incurres not the contrary. I wish we were all thus carefull, and if I can, I will begin, which I should the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, if a generall consent of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment were in euery bodies minde. Let vs one helpe another with laying open our diseases to one another: If our titles in our lands be neuer so litle cracked, or seame-rent, wee sweate with our blacke boxes, we are diligent in searching to recouer them, but our minds are seam rent, cracked, and bawdie, but we aske no helpe, nor endeuour to do any thing but to conceale them. For euery head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache our vrines knock at the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions doore, and we are inquisiue about the state of our bodies, but our conscience may exclaime, and
<pb facs="tcp:9160:56"/>
cry out to vs, how sicke, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed our soules state is, and we wil not heare her. Times past were not more carefull, but imployed their care more worthily: I will be bounde in the Romane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in the time of one mans Consulship more excellent deeds were performed, then there is now throughout the worlde in many yeares. Who can match me, <hi>Sceuola</hi> burning his hand without motion? Where is there a <hi>Rutilius</hi> that wil prize his Commonwealth so dearly, as to run into the Iawes of torment, and death? No, we drawe not euenly, but are carried away with particular Humours.</p>
                  <p>Lawes and inforcements, must keep vs from the extremitie of ill; what slauish mettalls are we made of in the meane time, that choose to feare punishment, rather then to loue Vertue? I blame nothing
<pb facs="tcp:9160:56"/>
for this but Custome: It is in her power if shee will, to make shame smart as ill as whipping.</p>
                  <p>Lawes keep but the dregges of a Common-wealth in obedience, and them only from being too ill, but vpwardes it prouokes them not, nor any thing but Custome, and the estimation of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>All this time I haue built but the bridge I meane to trauaile vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not that annointed with a finicall Exordium. I trauaile where I list, and when I list, and will not binde my selfe to more then I list. Let my feete be bounde to come into the hal before the great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, my head shall see which I list first.</p>
                  <p>I hate the dulnesse of my owne feete, and my horses, when I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and cherish the nimblenesse of my thoughtes which can flie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the world in an afternoone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:57"/>I am determined to speake of bookes next, to whom if you wold not say I were too bookish, I shuld giue the first place of all thinges here. The best witte of man that euer was, not assisted by such helps as may make my comparison blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, neuer brought so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, as by their assistance he hath had. When I heare a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man speak in his best, I can say but wittie, My comendations are at the farthest; but the tongue steeped in the true vnderstanding incident to learning, hath Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for his reward. Experience doth much, but it is too ful of scars and wounds, and is brought with gray haires, and danger: when the other hath no lesse that hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed but in his study. In a word propounde any course sauing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and sleeping, and wanting this, you are maimed: euen in the
<pb facs="tcp:9160:57"/>
life of blowes, and warres, where strength seemes to beare more sway then vnderstanding, yet Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Discipline, Marshalling, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of number, and scituation of the place, ends with the wel tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Harmony of an Oration, whose force hath often beene as much as all the rest, and with the sweetenesse, added vigour to the harshnesse of Valour. Of Bookes, for both Philosophies, I onely esteeme <hi>Plato,</hi> who doth so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly weaue them together, as (me thinkes) he saith he is content to giue you knowledge, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you should be honest. In the person of his <hi>Socrates,</hi> hee setteth downe one of the most absolute formes of life, that is possible to be imagined. I doubt whether he were so wel as his picture, yet <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> telles it so with the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as I am afraide sometimes by
<pb facs="tcp:9160:58"/>
doubting, to do him wrong: If he wanted not very much he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of admiration, if very much, of applause, being the onely man that euer I heard of, most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of entertaining a forced grace for some second cause.</p>
                  <p>Of History if you wil haue me showe you the best first, I must begin, and ende with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> so graue a stile, so Iudicial a Censure, and so piercing an eye into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of Princes, and States, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer met in one man: he is so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, that I wish hee were as rare, for I holde no eye meete to wade in him, that is not at the helme of a State.</p>
                  <p>For profitable Recreation, that Noble French Knight, the Lord <hi>de Montaigne</hi> is most excellent, whom though I haue not bene so much beholding to the French as to see in his Originall, yet diuers of
<pb facs="tcp:9160:58"/>
his peeces I haue seene translated: they that vnderstand both lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages say very well done, and I am able to say (if you will take the word of Ignorance) translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a stile, admitting as fewe Idle words as our language wil endure: It is well fitted in this newe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Montaigne</hi> speaks now good English: It is done by a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe lesse beholding to nature for his fortune then witte, yet lesser for his face then fortune; the truth is, hee lookes more like a good-fellowe, then a wise-man, and yet hee is wise, beyond ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his fortune, or education: but his Authour speakes nobly, honestly, and wisely, with little method, but with much iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Learned he was, and often showes it, but with such a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as his owne following is not
<pb facs="tcp:9160:59"/>
disgraced by his owne reading: He speakes freely, and yet wisely, Censures, and determines many things Iudicially, and yet forceth you not to attention with a hem, &amp; a spitting Exordium: In a word hee hath made Morrall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy speake couragiously, and in steed of her gowne, giuen her an Armour; he hath put Pedanticall Schollerisme out of countenance, and made manifest, that learning mingled with Nobilitie, shines most clearly.</p>
                  <p>I haue done with Bookes, and now I wil sit in iudgement vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all those that my memory can readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce, and it is no presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>L'euento spesso è giudice non Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perito delie cose:</hi> Seeing the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ending, the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fal easily into euery head, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering my opinion of these things is no part of my faith,

not to endure prouocation, one of these resistances shines beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith of <hi>Caesars</hi> clemency, is an action purchasing glory without sharers: His foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was answerable to so high an enterprise, sharing out his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reuenewes among his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which wonne their loue: for meane fortunes loue wealth, high Fortunes Glory.</p>
                  <p>Among these, <hi>Perdiccas</hi> spake to my liking, who being offered an ample Patrimony, asked his maister what hee would leaue to himselfe, <hi>Alexander</hi> saide Hope, hee desired to rest there too: excellently well plaied on both sides: hee was a rare young man, whom Fortune followed, &amp; with whome Death plaied good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for I thinke if hee had liued, hee would haue lost by the world, and growne downeward: so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

was his youth, as I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid his Age would not haue bin answerable, and then his Cornet would haue fallen out disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, therefore he did well to die.</p>

my pen: his Gouernment gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally was like <hi>Caesar,</hi> onely there rests two thinges that I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to touch: the one his erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again the Statues of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> throwne downe by theyr misfortunes, it was too late for their memories to hurt him, yet this eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy to his enemies, made his friends not doubt to speed wel vnder him, and those indifferent to finde him a good Lord: this was wel done. The other as ill, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brought a gouernment free to a particular, and forestalled all Dominion, not to be content with the thing, but to thirst after the name of a Monarch, it was vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably done, and in my opinion the hastener of his death. This puts me in minde of the contrary course vsed by the house of the <hi>Medici,</hi> who did pull the staffe of liberty so easily out of the peoples
<pb facs="tcp:9160:61"/>
hands, that they had it before they were mistrusted: so by degrees did the sonne get farther then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Grandchilde farther then the Grandfather, as if their soules before their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with their bodies had set in counsell about it.</p>

he turned their eyes from loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into times past, or practising to recouer libertie. But of all the Princes that euer my eyes haue met with in my reading, or my eares haue heard of by others, the onely Politian was <hi>Tiberius:</hi> his beginning was not ill, but full of wisedome, and somewhat vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet somewhat the better (as it is thought) for feare to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Germanicus,</hi> whose power in souldiers, wisedom to mannage great matters, and loue to possesse himself of great matters, was such, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> liued iealous as long as <hi>Germanicu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> liued at all: there was no lesse honest pollicy in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> who sawe <hi>Tiberius,</hi> yet was not able to shunne him: After a great Conquest of the Germanes, markes of Tryumph being set vp, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculpture, and the Conquerour
<pb facs="tcp:9160:62"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiberius</hi> course with <hi>Germanicus</hi> was full of safetie, I cannot say honestie: first to remoue him from the gouernment of <hi>France,</hi> where he was stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the loue, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his souldiers, was vnder the cloake of rewarding his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with Tryumph: afterwards an Insurrection in the East parts was acceptable vnto him, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse which, he sent <hi>Germanicus,</hi> where he might bee nearer daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, remote from Loue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaunt with Chaunce: to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which, hee sent thither <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> by base flattery to winne the Souldiours, and by opposing himselfe to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> to keepe forraine Princes from vniting themselues to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:63"/>
                     <hi>Germanicus</hi> died there (as it is thought) poysoned, which the people desirous to reuenge, hee suffered to keepe himselfe out of suspition, and yet with such hope to <hi>Piso,</hi> as kept him from discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the secret. His speech (euen in light matters) was obscure, and subiect to a subtile construction.</p>
                  <p>In the gouernment of forraine Prouinces, he made choise rather of a slowe delicate people, then of spirites of more excellency: as <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith he did of <hi>Vitellius, In inferiorem Germaniam missus est, contemptu magis quam gratia ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> In the ende this course made him grow doubtfull: for such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being vncaple of those places, indaungered the Empire; and such as were worthy, hee thought dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to his particular person: to auoyd which, he chose Gouernors of abilitie, which exercised their
<pb facs="tcp:9160:63"/>
wittes in their places with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their Lieutenantes, and themselues hee kept neare him in person. I make no Apology for his vertues (for he was vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vicious) but his pollicy neuer failed him but in his affection to <hi>Seianus,</hi> who surely had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him, had he not bene hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the peoples hatred, and the number of his successours, rather then by himselfe. In the end, let me ende with Death, which last part giues either lustre, or blemish to our memories: nothing heere can stand, therefore let vs make it in our powers to goe out hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely.

                  <p>MEe thinkes this same Youth is a very sicknesse, a malady full of distemperatures like an Ague, it wisheth for what would hurt it, is daungerously sicke, and yet will take no phisick. It is a straunge thing that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of life should bee death thus full of vncurable diseases.</p>
                  <p>I haue long laboured in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, euer since I was borne, I am not yet cured: they say there is nothing good for it but time, which I cannot yet get, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am still sicke, though not so ill as I was: for I borrowed a litle of Experience, which hath done me
<pb facs="tcp:9160:67"/>
onely this good to know I am not well, which hath made mee sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: since I came to which my Occupation hath bene to obserue my selfe, and others. And if it be not the effect of a cruell nature, it would make a man laugh to see the diuersitie of their fittes, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all madde, but differing in the maner of their furies. Theyr braines are all so hotte, that they haue no vse of them, they are all numme, onely their senses are lest them, in whose pleasure they liue. Some giue all to their sight, and loue to looke vpon nothing that lookes not faire, &amp; yet they looke in the Glasse to finde themselues, when a more beastly sight they cannot finde in the world. Thus doo they attribute all to their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though they differ in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preheminence.</p>
                  <p>It is with them as with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<pb facs="tcp:9160:67"/>
for their Gods, some worship the Sunne, some the Moone, Beastes, Fishes, and Foules, or whatsoeuer else it pleaseth theyr fancies to preferre. Sometimes they growe inconstant, and vary their delights.</p>
                  <p>There is most hope of these, for I holde, that Inconstancy the working of theyr soule, who loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this language of earth which shee vnderstandes not, sheweth them betimes the ende of theyr delights to be griefe.</p>
                  <p>I haue noted when these sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasers haue come from any of their sportes, what a naked dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:9160:68"/>
all their time, and some worse: and yet these are the best sorte of youth, there is great hope of these: mee thinkes there should be so of their Dogges too, for they receiue all from them.</p>
                  <p>In the other sort more riotous, I can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend nothing but their resolution, surely they meditate much on Death, and thinke not to liue till to morrowe, for they take care onely for to day.</p>
                  <p>Thus much I know of Youth, I would I could tell you the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Age too, for I am weary of this life.</p>

                     <hi>Essay.</hi> 15. Of the obseruation, and vse of things.</head>
                  <p>I Come nowe from discoursing with an Husband-man, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent stiffe slaue, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, respect, or ciuilitie, but not without a great deale of wit, if it were refined, and seperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the durt that hangs about it. I haue sold him an houre of my time, and haue ware for it, good sound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in truth becomming a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune: This time hath not bene lost, for his experience, his learning of Tradition, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall witte hath enformed mee of many things, I haue picked out of him good Philosophy, and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and other obseruations of Time, and of the world: all which though hee imployes about durt, and allotteth to that ende, hinder not me from making a more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy vse of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:69"/>There is not that thing vppon the Earth, that well examined, yeeldes not something worthie of knowledge: that diuine Artisan that made them, neuer fashioned any thing vnprofitably, nor euer set forth any of his workemanship without some inward vertue. I do first prescribe them that desire to proue excellent in distilling these simples, to lay in good store of the fuell of learning: whatsoeuer he hath of his owne naturall witte is not sufficient, it makes not the fire hotte enough: for there is a great deale of tough vile stuffe to be drawne out, before what is pure can be gotten: but then (I tell Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance a miracle now) hee shall not see, nor touch that thing, that will not adde to his wisedome: for thinges are a kinne to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they come all out of one Fountaine, and the knowing one,

bringes you acquainted with an other, and so to others. All kinde of bookes are profitable, except printed Bawdery; they abuse youth: but Pamphlets, and lying Stories, and News, and two penny Poets I would knowe them, but beware of beeing familiar with them: my custome is to read these, and presently to make vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for they lie in my priuy, and when I come thither, and haue occasion to imploy it, I read them, halfe a side at once is my ordinary, which when I haue read, I vse in that kind, that waste paper is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect too, but to a cleanlier profit: I see in them the difference of wits, and dispositions, the alterations of Arguments pleasing the world, and the change of stiles: this I haue in despight of him, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so ignorant: and if hee hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing good among such store
<pb facs="tcp:9160:70"/>
of ill, why that is mine too. I haue not beene ashamed to aduenture mine eares with a ballad-singer, and they haue come home loaden to my liking, doubly satisfied, with profit, &amp; with recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to see earthlings satisfied with such course stuffe, to heare vice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, and to see the power of Vertue that pierceth the head of such a base Historian, and vile Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.</p>
                  <p>The recreation to see how thoroughly the standers by are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, what strange gestures come from them, what strained stuffe from their Poet, what shift they make to stand to heare, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities he is driuen to for Rime, how they aduenture their purses, he his wits, how well both their paines are recompenced, they with a silthy noise, hee with a base re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

My after life (though I lament the bestowing it, because I shuld haue put things more precious in first, yet it) is not without profit. I was bound then to <hi>Arthur</hi> of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and things of that price, for my knowledge was not able to trafficke with any thing more rich, <hi>Stowes</hi> Cronicle was the highest, yet I haue found good vse of them, they haue added to my experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

If out of these dregs there bee good iuice to bee got, what is there out of more noble obseruations? truly an incredible knowledge: he that can make vse of them, may leaue reading, and profit no lesse by these. If out of these blotters of paper many things may be extracted not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of note, what may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and such Poets?

It is often a cause of things looking like good, &amp; faire, more often of wickednesse, and

                  <p>MY custome is about this time of day to sleepe, to auoide which now, I choose to write: so, if this be a drowsie stile, and sleepily done, yet if it be not worse then sleepe, I goe not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for it serues in sleeps roome. This Sleepe is to me in the nature that Dung is to Ground, it makes the soyle of my Apprehension more solid, and tough, it makes it not so light, and pleasant, and I am glad of it, for I finde my selfe too much subiect to a verball quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: thus I thinke it good for me that am of a drye barraine mould; but for others it may hap to make
<pb facs="tcp:9160:80"/>
them too waterish: the cause of this is common as the effect, yet as some bodyes are more subiect to it then others, so meates of one kinde prouoke it more then another. This makes me often play the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, making my stomack a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, to fight with Partridge, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and such fowle, whose Airye parts are more fine, and poyson not the Braine with thick vapours. These foure-footed Beafts are dull and grosse, and so is what proceeds from them. Well, for my part I will put away this sleepy Humour, for it is an extreame spender. When I come at the end of a weeke to reckon how I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed it, in that seuen Dayes I finde nothing, but Item in sleepe, Item in sleepe: And in the end <hi>Summa totalis,</hi> seuen nights, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Afternoones, beside halfe houres, and quarters, at vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed

I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame <hi>Alexander</hi> though he misliked it, and held that, and Lust, the Arguments of Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: If he had vsed eight of clock-houres, the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire might yet haue stood.

I would liken it to Death, but that it is more terrible, for it is Idlenesse; yet thus it is Death, for it killes Eternitie. Fame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet knew a perpetuall Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presser. Is it not a pittifull thing to see a fellow bestow halfe his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in hobby-horses? then pitty all them, who hauing but a little time, dedicate halfe that to sleepe. But this is the effect of our Bodies, who in despight of our soules Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,

Earth &amp; Heauen cannot be made one, therefore impossible to ioyne them together: onely thus much I haue done, they are content I shall take my choise. All this time I was not Masterlesse, nor idle, I put the common phrase out of fashion: he that sayes of me onely, He liues well, speakes too sparingly of me: for I liue to better my minde, and to cure my body of his Innate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.

so short was my stay, that I trust more to my reading then to my Experience. <hi>Plutarches Liues</hi> are aboundantly stored with men of both kindes.

There is a braue satisfaction in a minde that conuerseth with Daunger; hee dooth rightly serue his Countrey, whose Body executeth what his wisdome plotteth. Sometimes when I haue read the life of <hi>Cicero,</hi> I thinke him a good Oratour, he deserued his fee: but <hi>Caesar</hi> is so much beholding to me, that I put

When I heare of any famous Action of our time, I suffer with <hi>Themistocles,</hi> it takes away my sleepe, not with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, but with an honest Emulation.

There is a certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty in Behauiour well-becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, without pride, or Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for they spoile all, the least dram of them makes all taste of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion: no, this is the naturall Garde of Vertue, the fortification to resist basenesse, and to keepe out sawcy incrochers. We must not be carelesse of these outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but seeke to make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, yet there is an inward thing which vnlesse it be added to this, makes all this to be nothing. A Schoole-master had in his place of Exercise a Glasse, wherein he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Schollers to behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; If they were faire, &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, he would tell them what pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it was, such goodly bodyes should be possessed with defectiue mindes: If foule, and ill-fauoured,

The first note here is to see how honestly euery place speakes, and how ill euery man liues: not a Poste, nor a painted cloth in the house, but cryes out, <hi>Feare God,</hi> and yet the Parson of the Towne scarce keepes this Instruction. It is a straunge thing how men bely themselues: euery one speakes well, and meanes n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But why should these Inferiours be blamed, since the noblest professions are become base? Their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rest in the Example of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fortunes, and they are blinde,

and lead men into sensualitie. Me thinkes a drunken Cobler, and a meere hawking Gentleman ranke equally, both end their pursuites with pleasing their sences, this the eye, the other the Taste. What differs scraping misery from a false Cheatour? the directour of both is Couetousnesse, and the end Gaine. Lastly courting of a Mistresse, and buying of a Whore are somewhat like, the end of both is Luxury. Perhaps the one speakes more finely, but they both meane plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

The excellent Artisan that made all, gaue all his Children portions of qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting them, as Heate to Fire, Moisture to Water, Trees to be plentifull Mothers, and Hearbes to haue an healing ability: should these fall to affecting, and to like others Qualities better then their owne, what a confusion would it beget? how much wrong to the workeman? Thus is it with vs: Euery Soule casts a colour vpon the Body suteable to it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not like our common colours which will endure a second Dye, but which at first is naturally in graine.</p>
                  <p>Euery one in truth is fitted by nature, whose fashion if he likes

I haue seene some seely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that haue had the extremity of this disease in words, but what hath beene the end? alas they haue deliuerd Prisoners that haue turnd Traitours, and instantly betrayed them to Derision.</p>

                  <p>As my youth hath been spotted generally with entertaining my Affections too neerely, so by this the number hath beene increased, and I may safely say, it hath beene the last extraordinary illnesse that I haue had to do with. My occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath beene vehemently boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish; I haue beene counselled by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> for Philosophy.

                  <p>Since I haue kept my body from madnesse, my minde hath doted, I thinke it is with ouer-much ioy, that it hath gotten imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Among my readings Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy hath made me honest for two houres after, and I thinke I could haue held out if I had found any drawing that way, but euery man is so busie in the quest of Fame, that they neglect the desert: they aske
<pb facs="tcp:9160:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which way she went, but not how she went.</p>
                  <p>History hath added to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall desire of louing fame: I was there set a fire with conuersing with braue spirits: I like deeds well, but they were not within my reache, and so I sought to buy what my stock would reache to: though I cannot clime so well as <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet I should thinke my selfe happy, if I could but get vp to his Stile: But he was a <hi>Romane</hi> borne, and borne vnder a climate of more wit: we are so colde, and so dull, that we thinke of nothing beyond the compasse of our inheritance, iust like the <hi>Swissers</hi> we will lose no ground; leaue vs in durt, and finde vs in durt.</p>
                  <p>The Graecians and the Romanes were Monarches of the world, not by sitting still, and keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues warme, but Industry, and
<pb facs="tcp:9160:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Aduenture were the wings that made them flye high. We will aduenture vpon nothing except it be on a surfit, and sixe pence at Tables.</p>
                  <p>I wonder why we estimate our selues so preciously, or keepe our limmes so carefully, except we haue indented with our church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes, not to coozen them of any part or parcell of the said Trunck. Since we are so stupified, it is well we liued not in their times, for we had surely gone to the mill: our bodyes should haue beene branded with the markes of a slaue, as well as our minds are with the deformitie of ignorant Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>But these are no sutors at the court of Fame? Yes, as earnestly as Desarts: they can finde Titles as fast as Herraldes deuise Armes:
<pb facs="tcp:9160:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If for nothing else, put him in for prouidence, and for leauing as much to his sonne as his father left him.</p>
                  <p>Honour is to be bought chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then with blood: It is possible to haue Titles not Honour thus, for Honour is vniuersall, and runs thorough all mouthes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth Enuy, and Vice, to doe him Iustice, and to giue him his due.</p>
                  <p>But where is <hi>Caesar, Cato, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas, Alexander, Eumenes,</hi> and the rest? Dead: and with them Desartes; their names are inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Vertue, ours of this sicke Time in Fame: they searched for Substance, we for Shadowes, they should be our Cognisances, for we are walking Ghostes.</p>
                  <p>I could write more in this kinde, Vehemency sharpens my Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

brings all things to triall by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, reason carrieth them to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition of the soule, who regardes not their colours, nor those sensuall qualities, but makes them confesse how much they haue of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, how much of Fortitude, and of those inwarde qualities of the minde. Doubtlesse then, this power of affection carrieth no farther grace then the preseruation of life, which regarded no farther then right is a care of the last place, for speaking of this life, mee thinks there is no other thing presented to our view, then some handsome Table or Picture that lookes pertly for a time, but will not last, and should receiue of vs in exchange a contentment of the present state, and a determination to vse it to the best purpose whiles we haue it, and when we are to part, a pacient farewell without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance or feare.</p>

This life is but a Prentishood, the freedom immortality, &amp; mee thinks it fittes well in respect of the ones shortnesse, and the others eternitie, life being but like a Prentises holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, but more neere when we thinke of our knowledges which are here impotent and defectiue, but are there complete and full, all things appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there vnmasked, and the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed coulours and vaine appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Affection beeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, those vnlimmtied and rich lights of the minde, beholde eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing in the right proportion, all the deformities and misdemeanors
<pb facs="tcp:9160:111"/>
of the world are the children of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which bindes vp our sight in darkenesse, and leads vs blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: from hence Opinion, which is the destinated censure of Affection, as Iudgement is the Soules, from hence proceedes the irresolution of our thoughts and our wauerings, and changings from one thing to another; for Affection, likes his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent satisfaction, and iudgeth that best, which if in Opinion bettered, he changeth his sentence, and so not able to penetrate into the depth of things, is euery day ready for a new impression. All that I haue heard, all that I haue read, all that by any meanes hath come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge performed well, hath beene where Reason hath made Affection his seruant: contrariwise, destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dishonours, dangers, haue beene inforced by the tyrannie of Pride, Disdaine, Hate, Selfe-loue, or some
<pb facs="tcp:9160:111"/>
other of those Affections vnrestrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: so can I fetch Calamitie from none other originall but this; not happinesse but from the depriuation of this frailtie. Euen that honest harmlesse Affection, which posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Parents towards their children, me thinkes whiles they are yet but lumpes of flesh, and things without all merit, should not be so ardent and vehement, pitty and commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration fits them better then Loue, of which they are no way worthy; for howsoeuer we abuse loue with cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it away vpon trifles, yet it is the pretiousnesse of Loue, appointed onely to attend deserts, and to ioyne no peeces together that are not of this kinde; but it is well that Nature hath cast the extremitie of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease vpon mothers, it becomes them not so ill to be fond as men, besides these little ones being their charges, Affection makes them more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:112"/>
and so it is for those first yeares neuer the worse for the childe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is for the mother. Iustice being for example, and no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying a common-wealth then the husbandman the trees with execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the water boughes, which he dooth as well in respect of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitablenesse, as also to shew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors in a glasse their owne state while they beholde the guiltie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-going the seueritie of the lawe, but yet the creatures bound to profit others with their owne destruction, should bee picked out monsters whose natures might be seene incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, and those of whom mercy may coniecture amendment, to be spared: thus in the ambiguitie of things which doubt will not haue resolued, mercy may haue a hand. Thus commiseration and a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eye to the distrested, all which though they leaue more to affection
<pb facs="tcp:9160:112"/>
then to the strictnesse of iustice, yet must we so farre tolerate them, for so God lookes vpon vs, and so should we vpon our bretheren, being all borne lame, which fault of ours if it were punished with death, none should liue; yet I go not with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangnia,</hi> who in his Essay of Crueltie, bribes wit to take part with commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration so extreamly and so woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish as not to indure the death of Birdes and Beasts; alas this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of nature is a plaine weaknesse, wee may safely see the deaths of these, yea of men without motion, it belongs to vs to looke into the cause of their deaths, not into the manner onely, but fetching it from the desert wee shall see plainely, it is not the Iudge nor the execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that committes this abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red spectacle, but them-selues, them-selues doe execution vppon them-selues; Might there bee
<pb facs="tcp:9160:113"/>
that vnspeakable blessing giuen to the imprisoned soule, that she might here view things in sincere trueth, how would vice and sinne flie light, when vnmasked light might disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their deformities, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly should we be able to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure things, how would we scorne lawes and compulsion, when the most ragged-vnderstanding should flye farre aboue them.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, all the enemies of wealth and pouerty should be banished, for we should not know want, and so should want them, and the laborious life of Studye should end, whose trauels ayme at no other end, but an ability to knowe euery thing in his propper kinde; this is not, because Affection is, who dayly ouercomes reason, not by strength but flattery, and sometimes makes the weapons of Reason, treacherously turne head vpon Reason, with corrupting his
<pb facs="tcp:9160:113"/>
taste, and making him fortifie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with arguments. I would be glad to looke vpon my brother with the same eye that I behould a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and may the strangers worthe excell his, I would preferre him. He is deceiued, that thinkes vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects bloud and aliaunces: she is not so bodely, hauing commerce with vs whiles we haue bodyes, not because we hauing bodyes, should loue our bodyes: but because we should with the ordering and subiecting them, win her. It is Affection that hath skil of colours, and hath set vp the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of White and Red. I verely beleeue Vertue was neuer Paynter nor Armorist, all those choyses and allowances that come from tall, and fatte or slender and well bodied, are all Affections choise, the minde sees the minde, and giues the body leaue to looke how it will, for she loues the abilities and graces of the mind,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:114"/>
whose neuer fading beauties, makes their imbracements blessed. Here is the choise of all things made sure; thus friends are to bee entertained, whose perfection may be better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of, then it is possible to finde it actually, the reason because Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beares so great sway, our causes of combination being commonly more beholding to Affection then Reason, which makes vs so often complaine of the vnstablenesse of friends &amp; friendships inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancie. No other are those leauges which looke into the fortune rather then vertue of friends, that cunningly make Loue the broker to supply their wants; how can these hould, since the hould of their hould blinde Dame Fortune is brittle and flitting. But amongst all I finde no body hath so iust cause to complaine of this as Iustice, which being the very soule and life of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is oft time compelled to
<pb facs="tcp:9160:114"/>
help the lightest scoale with her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whiles Partialities burden makes the other heauie. I can pittie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of no vertue so much as this, since no vertue carryes with her a greater maiestie, and in that maiestie knowledge, the life of life, the ioy of man, &amp; his surest euidence of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating with the deuine nature. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were it not for the orderly working of this vertue, we should make the world in a worse state the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Chaos,</hi> where was a confusion, but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent though deformed: but now it would be turned into a guilty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, the picture of which though not fully, are those sick states that are continually letting blood; where the sweet wisdom of laws, are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those doubtful arbitrators blowes, and where Iustice executes not with her sworde, but fights for her right, but I haue destinated a whole Essay to Iustice, wherefore I wil speake no more of her now.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:9160:115"/>Of all our delicacies or imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of any kinde, there is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor but Affection, whose intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brings on equally both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and obstinacie, witnesse the many idle lines of Louers, who haue made many foule Papers, for the sakes of their faire Mistresse, whose luxurious conceits they haue made loue answer for, &amp; called them loue.</p>

But the pretence here was the purchase of a more ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard amongst men, whose states com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly being full of darke ignorance, is muth more rauished with thoughts of superstition, then things apparent, for they can gesse so neere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as to determine things of their owne pitch, base &amp; triuiall, which brings them to a retchlesse respect of what they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant with, &amp; to lend admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only to things rare, finding what they know vnworthy, they are much more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with what they know not.

I haue not yet spoken of those far fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched feares that are drawne not from any apparencie of danger, that is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt or seene, but from dreames, incountring with Hares, and the Salte spilling, other that go by the signes, or by Prognostications, prophecies, and auguries; times past were much gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by these. It is said <hi>Augustus</hi> was verye inquisitiue about his owne dreames and his friends; it was great pitie, for he was otherwise a very wise Prince, but he had a great fortune, and a mortall body, which are still at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and blind-foldes the true discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in which time, feare creepes in &amp; ouer-valuing life, drawes preseruation from wrong places.

                  <p>It was well aduised by <hi>Cleanthes</hi> to one that intreated him to instruct his sonne, hee saide, be silent, for besides the aduantage that he hath of a talker, of hauing all he knowes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying him any thing for it, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it scot-free, it is also more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

being content to heare, as the other confidence in telling, for we are bound once more then we were, by his disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and perhaps drawne, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eschew the dooing a fault, for if his secret be pernitious, I must betray him, or my selfe sinne, then he must go, and so I forfet a friend, and breake a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of friendship. I would heere vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a desire, demaund if he sought it for counsels sake, if so I would heare him, if otherwise deny him hearing, for howsoeuer he meaneth, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth vpon mine aduise, he shall meane, as I would haue him. Many States vsed to punish the laying open of secrets, with the losse of their babling instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was a very iust lawe and a sure, for no example preuailes with a borne tatler, but the losse of his pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock; I wonder that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally doe not with those slaues they imploye neere them, depriue them of their tongues, as they doe of their

stones, for feare of the abusing of their wiues and concubines, me thinks they should be as iealous of their secrets, as they are of their lusts. The Turkes they haue certaine Mutes to performe their executions, which since they are in for worse matter, may be put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest for veniall; But to speake as I thinke, I hould the people subiect to this flux of words very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for by such, <hi>Scilla</hi> found where the possession of <hi>Athens</hi> might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest be attempted, by <hi>Flauius</hi> that had this disease. The citie of Rome had the plague of a tyrant continued, I neuer knew tatling a safegarde, but the geese that preserued the Capitoll, which the <hi>Romaines</hi> rewarded with great care, popular states being neuer ingratefull to geese, these are all to be shunned, for their couuersations are more vnsafe then the fellowship of the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, wordes being more pernicious then blowes, for no Fencer can warde
<pb facs="tcp:9160:156"/>
them. Of our owne secrets the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie bewrayes a great feeblenesse and impotencie, it resembleth a clowde, that by the sunne is possessed of hotte exhalations, but is so weake as not to keepe them, desire drawes vp thoughts of assistance, but when the desirer hath them, ouer-burthened with their strength, they burst out and dissolue him; thus all his attempts ouerwaying the minde, are brought to nothing, which weakenesse of mans were ill, were not man so ill as to haue ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thoughts, but hauing such it is well, for thus most conspiracies against Princes are preuented: for an honest man, it is a great blessing, for a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest the contrary, an excellent punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>I Had not neede to teache the world new opinions, for I holde all I know, more by tradition, then reason, I haue a braine like a French force, that dooth it best first, my incountring an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is most vigorous at the prime op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. I after fall and waxe lazie, and in truth shallowe, I doe nothing well, but speake much worse then I write, and perhaps worse (in something) then I can doe, which I must confesse the fault of my braine, for I neither lispe, stutt, nor speake in the throate, nature hath made the cariadge of my wordes large, and swift enough, but I wante marchandize and stuffe, the Italian ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie would well fitte mee, where the ouerthrowe of an Appositor is counted discourtesie, and they call him

in disgrace, <hi>Vince guerra.</hi> The reason of this <hi>exordium,</hi> is the view of the workes of Nature, and our varietie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, fewe men receiue any thing with the like vse, but occasions or things represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, begets in one, feare, in another, furie, in a third, feares har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger amazement, in a fourth despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, some of these differ much, yet shall one occasion beget all these at one instant, which makes me thinke our discourse findes out more vses of things, then our senses qualities, yet am I not of <hi>Empericus</hi> minde, who holdes the quallities of things to be more in number then our sences, and that we recken our knowledge to see all, as <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered the world, because in his time there was no more knowne. I am not of his opinion, for all things being made for man, and his sences being fit for both life &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, his seruants sure which are all things sensible, haue no more trickes
<pb facs="tcp:9160:159"/>
then he knowes of. But thus new am I in opinion, that the receptacle of our sences intelligence, with ioyning, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and mixing things, imploye them farre from their accustomed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, which my subiect here will plainly exemplifie. Man being the most substanciall and most canning peece, accompanied with a head that masters and is Lord of all things; How hath he fallen this second time, more vainely deceiued, and more miserably punished then in the first? He fell then with a baite pleasing to one sence, and when he fell, fell vpon a good substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall body, where there was good foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hope to, of rising, but here he is fallen into smoake where he may be choaked, but cannot liue nor walke, he is fallen into fame; to entertaine which I know no sence destinated, vpon a thing not to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, not to be ridde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to be seene; children would not haue doted thus; not to be eaten, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
<pb facs="tcp:9160:160"/>
would not haue so miscaried, not to be touched, an amorist would not haue beene in loue with it, not to be heard by himselfe, a light headed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition would haue shunned it, not to be seene, a Faulconer would not haue lured it; yet all these that are able to make so good an election of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, sacrifice to fame, and flatterie is their priest. There is certainly but one end, whereto the intendments of man are destinated, which prosecuted rightly, is eternall happinesse, this is not fame, for she dyeth often in her birthe, commonly ouercome by time, and sometime men famous haue had their memories dispatcht, eyther by obliuion or detraction, before death hath made an end of their liues; all these working where the bodyes growes couetous, and would haue the gaines alone, are vicious, he must not determine any thing particulerly, for he is none other then a hired seruant,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:160"/>
and his wages is life, the proffit must be giuen to the soule, whose predominant power, is also compelled to vse the body, for the soules performances without the body are not vnderstood, contemplation being a good vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table naked life. Both working toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both agreeing in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose questionlesse, they would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine vpon some more lasting rewarde then fame. They would lay for vertue, for eternitie, for the fruition of a neuer dying happinesse, but this Essay must speake like it selfe, not what should be, but what is, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the baites for fame: The actions of these differ not, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prouocations of vertue, for as much as appeares outwardly, for they professe valour, temperance, liberalitie, and the rest of the lims of honor and honestie, but in the minde that works these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the disagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the one being spurred by vertue, th'other importuned by the tickling of applause. This same those ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Philosophers that so much

enueighed against fame, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tyrannie of such thoughts, which where they get entrance, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe all that rest in the place more modestly humored. Infinite are the baites that are laide to catch this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farre surmounting the number which curious Fishers haue found out, and yet in one thing they well agree, for they fit the couerer of their deceit to the time; Fishers hauing flies for the spring, the fall, and the winter, fame catchers, countenance, seemings, and aspects, for a state good, or bad, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, both their baites go downe the streame, both purchase not by force but deceipt, both looke pleasing, but swallowed, are dangerous, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, both labour for their bodies not their mindes. To speake of those petty fishers, that nip their bodies, and cast them into more mowldes, then their mothers bellyes, that neuer read any thing but how their ruffes stand in a

glasse, or of those that growe olde in the obtaining the name of a good Fencer, dauncer, vaulter or wrastler, were to no purpose. These are but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, and indeed, though not vertuous yet plaine dealers, for a ietting behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or an action with their hands, or the curiositie of their clothes discouers them; no I will speake of those that Painte so in oyle, as the examination of a sharpe raine will hardly discouer them, of those that carry the worlde about by the nose, of those that keepe their mindes more hid in, then women their limmes, how many of these mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked creatures haue mine eyes beheld, laden with the honors of the world, and set in the highest top of estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who, were the world inquisitiue any further then the outward sight, they should haue found, not vertuous, but betrayers of vertue, Rogues with counterfait pasports, and coyners of false money, inwardly though they be

I confesse there is a great satisfaction in the executing of these high attempts, and I hould them not hurtfull, but restoratiues to the

minde, if managed by the skill of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and thought of by a knowledge, able to limit the desert. I would choose a young man that loues fame, much sooner then a heauy spirited fellowe whose sluggish earthly thoughts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mount so hie. A young man of this fierie condition, a little allayed, will make a wise man and a vertuous man, but in age it is a disease incurable. I do owe very great respect to those metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led yongsters, that thinke of honor and of high practises, euen that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned fellow of the worlde, that sought Fame in the ashes of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> I thinke he would haue equaled <hi>Caesar,</hi> if he had had educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answerable to his spirite. Honor hath but two wings wherewith shee mounts aboue the vulgar, daring, and applying, and this fellow had one of them, he durst, but wanting the other, the poore creature fell, &amp; ruined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

This is not they but the false ground they build vpon, which is euer shrinking and showing his burthen, it is impossible that the motions of a minde led onely by fame, should be otherwise, then a trembling vnsettled thing, that is vertue only, that repells feare, and feare only that makes life troublesome, without Vertue, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is not; without Iustice, no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, <hi>Iustus a perturbatione remotis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus, in iustus perturbatione plenus est.</hi> Well may these fellowes follow and

a debt. The suddainnesse and vnexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted view of a thing, makes it admirable and beautifull, which made that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philosopher <hi>Pittacus,</hi> forbid the talking of what he will do. <hi>Quod facere instituis, noli praedicare, nam sifacere nequi veris, rideberis.</hi> Now he that in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire or customes affects a singularity &amp; an odnesse, proclaimes it with many tongues, for euery gesture, euery moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; euery thing about him is a tong.

<pb facs="tcp:9160:173"/>
very behauiour, may be easily seene how they labour for applause. But for the true deuoted seruants of letters, they are questionlesse, the happiest and worthiest of all, receiuing from the pure springs of knowledge, a water so quickning and cleering the sight, that nothing is impenitrable, be it armed, eyther with distance, darkenesse, or with neuer so many intricate passages: how much doe we owe to times past, that left knowledge so discouered and open, as we with much ease in respect of theirs inioye a riche patrimonie thereof? surely we owe a reuerence to their names, and should neuer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, without acknowledgment of their excellencies, which though they feele not, yet doth it nourish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie in the hearers, and explane vs not robbers but debtors of the dead. I happened very lately amongst my bookes to meete with <hi>Diogenes Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> where I was much delighted, euen
<pb facs="tcp:9160:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more then euer I was with any booke, for I do beholde their words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with nothing so good a stomack as I do their liues, and to know what they did; I found hardly a page, but I wished my memory, to gather some griftes in them, not a line but so full of precious liquor, as the words were too shorte wasted for the matter, he is in great estimation with me, and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be one of my neerest companions, and by <hi>Plutarche</hi> his leaue, haue the vpper hand, for I finde fewe of his captaines Philosophers, but amongst <hi>Laertius</hi> Philosophers, many captaines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for common-wealth causes, not inferiour to <hi>Plutarche.</hi> But in the meane time the sight of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance brought me to feele more senciblie our dearth, such is the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our time, as the worlde in an age hardlye brings forth a famous man, which whether it be the fault of our idlenesse, or that our industries are
<pb facs="tcp:9160:174"/>
killed by sensuality, or tendernesse or gluttony, I finde it is so, the cause were to much curiosity for mee to hunt for. But fame may rightly hang ouer their memoryes, and rightly, since they all imbraced the sweete effects of vertue without caring for the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of men though all the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Princes of the worlde continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye made loue to them and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them aboundance; See the confession of <hi>Antigonus</hi> to <hi>Zeno Citicus.</hi> In fortune and glory (I thinke) I exceede thee, but in the liberall studies and perfect felicities, which thou possessest, I beleeue, I am by thee farre excelled, and toward the end of his Epistle, this periode, for he that teacheth and instructeth the king of Macedon in vertue, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely instructeth also both him and his subiects to fortitude and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie. How would our glorye hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue accepted of such an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage
<pb facs="tcp:9160:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from a Prince, certaynely it would haue burst them, or at the least wayes haue distilled them into an Epistle most flaunting and adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, but hee farre otherwise, comming no nearer commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to encourage him on in the continuaunce of his good deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and sending a scholler of his to him, himselfe through age, beeing vnfitte for trauayle. Thus happye were many of them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the reputation of the worlde for vertues sake, liuing liues so temperate as instructions came doubly from them, for they that coulde not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vertue through the difficult pathes of Philosophy, might reade it and vnderstand it in their liues and examples, yet this, abhorring the vulgar licentious waye, leades mens eyes to suspition, whether the entent bee fames or vertues; let it, mee thinkes I heere them say
<pb facs="tcp:9160:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it shall not turne vs, for vertue were not precious, if not accompanied with danger and detraction. I thinke they would haue said thus, and so charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble am I as the actions of them draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more neere the affectation of fame, I interpret otherwise; euen that excellent head of our time, the elder <hi>Scaliger,</hi> though he wrote many things tending to his owne glory, and did himselfe turne the inside of himselfe outwarde, yet I thinke he wrote it to spurre on sluggish spirites to the race of vertue, rather then for his owne glorie or memorie. And euen for <hi>Montania</hi> and my selfe (who in these matters of excuse I may safelie ioyne with me,) though we doe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mention our selues, yet are we not to bee suspected of intrapping fame, wee allowe men in their liues to build their tombes, and we allowe charitie to set the first letters of their name vpon the gownes and coates
<pb facs="tcp:9160:175"/>
they giue in almes, shall it not be lawfull then for vs to build our tombes in our papers? and to weare our names in our labours? yes surely, it cannot be denied vs they are our children, which if they resemble vs, it is not a thing monsterous, but pleasing and naturall.</p>

not bestowing too much vpon our selues, not bestowing, where it may bring foorth pride, rather then defend want.

Out of these foure constituted bodies, hath shee made all things, there belonges no more to her whole frame, whose situation and whose number is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other lesson, they are foure, so are the different states of a common wealth in her exactest constitution.

                  <p>EVer your commaundements (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lady) are conceited: for by your commaundement I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of conceit, which I finde so like yourselfe, as to resemble it to your selfe, were a true and quicke descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it is in you mixed with iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without which it often goes, though it often goe with it. That it goe without, it makes it differ from you, for you cannot go without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I must speake no more of you, I must then speake of perfections whose want in the world makes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect iudgements determined com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, and due praises, Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye or Flattery. But either conceite is two sundry things, or conceite is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused; for to tuck, &amp; to be stuffed with apish tricks, to weare greene cut vpon Yellow and to be a very meriment to the eyes, I haue heard termed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite: when they are no other but Tailour-like friskes of the sences, which they haue seene, allowed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking eouncell euen of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence, the ware-house common to beasts, and to men. But the worthies Conceite leaues postes betweene the sences, and the fancie, which speedily conuey inttelligence, &amp; are as speedily
<pb facs="tcp:9160:206"/>
answered. It is a fruitfull land sowed, &amp; reaped at an instant; it is a quick work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which sendeth &amp; receiueth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is presented in a time: It is in a word, a fancie well disposed, not onely to her owne faculty, but to the abilities of both neighbors, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sence &amp; the memory: Her power is doubly set a worke in words, &amp; in deeds. In these she differeth from Iudgement, not in successe, but ready paiment, for where the successe is ill, I call it not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, but rashnesse. Words vttered, turned vpon the vtterer, is conceite, when nimblie like a weapons Artisan, he makes his enemies armes his enemies destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> to the fellowe, who to showe that his eloquence was merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, demaunded of him what hee should giue him: any thing (answered he) but a Tart; for with a Tart it was thought he poisoned his father: this was a prety Brickwall, &amp; bounded the slaunder into his owne bosome. There is no such stillitorie as a quicke braine,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which refines and makes vse of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer comes within the Pan of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Thus to <hi>Hortensius,</hi> who told him he vnderstood no ridles, and yet saith he, thou hast a sphinx in thy house: kuowing that <hi>Verres,</hi> whose cause he defended, had a little before giuen him an Iuory sphinx; his intelligence was good, and his vse good: thus doth wit whip oppositions, &amp; out-run his riuals, &amp; manifest the quicknes of his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> conceit was nothing resty, when being mocked by a theefe called <hi>Calchas</hi> for his nightwatching, &amp; studying by Lamp-light; Indeed, said he, I know nothing so contrary to thee, as to see light in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s houses. This tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> youth to play withall, and it is a prety gift to begin with. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had done well, if therwith she had taught vs the vse, which is (as I thinke) for defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce only, for offensiue, it is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue, getting enemies beyond the power of conceite to defend. Besides who knoweth whither not borrowed,
<pb facs="tcp:9160:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which if it be, he becomes disgracefull, and ill becomming. To be without the right vse is to be naked, not to haue it without study is as vnfruitefull as a Hargabush making a full point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the firing and the report. I like that fellowe well who desired the hangman not to fasten the rope about his neck, protesting the tickling would moue him too vnmeasurable laughter, I see not how he could haue scarfed his shame more handsomely: his last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge then was to mock the hangman, and the rope, and to dispise life as a runnagate seruant, wee haue another English shot as quick as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing showed a faire woman, was asked what he would doe if she were in his bed, he answered, I would play the watchman of Callis, either serue my selfe, or hire another in my roome. It was quicke and ingenious, pleasant, or serious, or betweene both, doe euery way handsomely. It reprehendeth vice
<pb facs="tcp:9160:207"/>
as effectually as a sower chiding, or downe-right blowes, and yet is wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp finely, is gilt, and lookes sweet. So <hi>Archelaus</hi> to a pratling Barbor, that asked him how he would be trimmed, he answered, silently: this was for both parts better, then plainely to haue bid him hold his peace. The wantonnesse of aboundance mingles sharpe things with our meates, and when we haue no stomacke, makes a counterfait sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, giuing a sharpenesse like the humor of appetite: Thus is the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of wordes made not distasting, with giuing the apprehensions of the auditories vnexpected acutenes, and meeting with the thrust of a iest, thrusts it backe vpon the iester. In the times of danger, conceite hath a much brauer lustre, it manifests a minde not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken vp with paine, or with perill. Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> aduised by his Phisition to eate Thrushes, and no man hauing any but <hi>Lucullus,</hi> what (saith he) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:9160:208"/>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> liue without <hi>Lucullus</hi> Thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes. A slaue being racked to accuse <hi>Neroes</hi> wife of dishonesty, stoutly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that her part capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that crime, was much more honest then the mouthes of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: there was an honorable minde in the body of that flaue: and if euer the <hi>Pythagorean Metempsychosis</hi> had any colour, the soule of this slaue did surely belong to some worthy perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, which held it first excellencie in despight of Fortune and opinion. Now to the quicknesse of deedes, which seemes to be the Hatte sutable to this Night-cap. This neuer is without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; Fortitude must be here aswell as wit, otherwise feare will turne wit into feare. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Hanniball</hi> may be had more of these patterns, then from any one within the compasse of my memory. As his deluding the Romaine armie with Oxen carrying fire-linckes on their heads, whose strangenesse in the
<pb facs="tcp:9160:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
night astonished his enemies, &amp; made waye for him to escape, being before incompassed in a straight. It was then a stratagem of great wit, and is now for all the age worthy of memorie. His attempt to make vse of the slaine Consuls seale of Armes, was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy though vnfruitefull. His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his warres in Italy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue them out of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines was an Acte of a iudiciall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour: but this I thinke was put in practise vpon great aduisement: these other no sooner thought vpon, but done, are excellent armours against daunger. Feare is content to haue his throate cut, so he see it not, and at the approache of his enemie turnes his backe, because his backe hath no eyes to beholde danger, he lurkes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers his bloodlesse face to keepe it warme: but to meete danger halfe way, and in the meane time to deuise to shun, nor to runne from it, becomes

valour and resolution. You know now (Lady) what I thinke of Conceit, and I know that you are able to touche it with a sweeter stroake: may heauinesse presseth it downe with a clacking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then with a sounding, yet because I am obedient, let me haue the censure not vtterly voide of good.</p>

                  <p>HOw true a principle of vertue is it, that crossing our appetite is the way of vertue? Appetite is the childe of the sences, and sencelesse when hee vseth but his parents counsaile: how true a testimonie is this Axiome of our vile inclinations, when it needes not the exception of good desires, for all our desires ate naught. Thus hath soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse fallen into knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause speach and reason loue trafficke and exercise, the former of which is vnecchoed without company, the last naked, for reason is made forcible by exercise. Societies sweeten the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, for life without societie is <hi>Viuere, non bene viuere</hi>: the obiection of calamities attending it as well as happinesse, is resisted by the whole vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

The life of contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at once bearing the functions, and pleasures of the body, makes the body striue for imployment, helpes not that it is wholy incompassed, for it makes it the more furious, as when one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t imbraceth another, the stricter his kindnes, the more viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the others rage.

He must thinke, and those thoughts come through his body, and there are polluted with vaine-glory, or hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or some other such malady incident to this retired course. If from the scorne of the worlde, or the being scorned by the worlde, if from the despaire of not being greatest, we can feede vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but extremities, and therefore will be least: if from losses, or a feare of loosing, we are not eased of the cares and danger of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse a map of her miseries, and differ from the other life onely in desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for we steale the deuouring mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of dispaire, selfe-loue, disdaine, &amp; scorne, into a corner, and there sacrifice ourselues vnto their insatiate appetites, past danger, for hope here cannot hope of rescue, vnknowne diseases beeing diseases vncurable. For secular fortunes

this cloystered life is not tollerable, it resists reason and goodnesse, which both ioyne in guiding vs to societie, &amp; the common good, which hath neede of the worst of vs, euen of those whose handes are their best partes: for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sets more a worke then direction. There is a last time of life, when decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitnesse kills experience, and when age hath not onely set vp his markes of triumph, of wrinkles, and gray haires, but playes the Prologue of death, and drawes the Curtaine not onely before our sences, but euen before meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; It is then time to giue that life leaue to thinke onely of death, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for his last iourney. Thus haue many kings wilfully deposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for which power, &amp; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, I thinke they were more bound to God, then for making them kings.

Euery head begets thoughts indifferent, euen our Mechanick Trades, as well as Artes witnesse it, for the lightes of these came not from one lampe: our proportions, &amp; casts are to little to comprehend the vniuersall knowledge of things: therfore one helpes another with the conference of one another: minds traffick like bodies, a Hat for a Ruffe, the Shoomaker with the Tailour.

Among these, vse the seamans plummet, sound them, see where their best lies, and follow that argument: it is good for both partes, for euery man loues to talke in his own element and his talking there yeelds most profit to the hearer. I would heare
<pb facs="tcp:9160:227"/>
speake no more then would bring on speache, for silence among strangers is safe besides. Obseruation loues not to speake, but to heare, and from obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, comes experience, and wisdom. To the company and time wee must lend respect, for high fortunes loue not to be asked questions by inferiours, but to heare: If content, it is where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories may pull out threds of their owne praises. Age loues it well, disburthening the memorie of times past:

I know we are the sonnes of a fallen father, but mercy hath helped vs vp againe, and though we be original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sinfull, we may be eternally happy: we need not still buy Apples, we payed too dearely already for that purchase.

Pull man from vanity, and he is like Birdes that are nothing but Feathers. The incomprehensible soule of Heauen, of whom we are but drops, yet that we came from him, we hold that preciousnesse, that sodainely our mindes can drawe the picture of the bodyes passages, and so fruitefully as to runne diuision vpon it: then is it possible to ouertake vanitie spurred by the minde, since horse and rider runne so fast, so quicke, and so farre? A little though I wil follow it to the descrying

Some I haue, which beeing a kin to more, bringes me acquainted with more.

                  <p>Of wordes first: for it is one of the first things we do, they are but the Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies of reason of which, to send more then will performe the busines is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, me thinkes, an <hi>esse videatur</hi> at the close of a period, is as nice as a Tumbler ending his trickes with a caper: and <hi>Tullies Venit, imo in senatum venit,</hi> moues me no more against <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> then the first <hi>Venit.</hi> Me thinkes, this same rethorick the child of words, is but as a pickled Herring to bring on drinke, for his diuisions and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

are for nothing but to bring his memory acquainted with his tongue, and to make three works of one. How shall a man hope to come to an end of their workes, when he cannot with two breathes saile through a Period, and is sometimes grauelled in a <hi>Parenthesis</hi>? I wonder how <hi>Cicero</hi> got the people of Rome tyed so fast to his tongue, for which his matter, no better then his stile, hee shoulde not perswade mee to looke vpon him? I make as great difference betweene <hi>Tacitus, Senecaes</hi> stile, and his, as musitions betweene <hi>Trenchmore,</hi> and and <hi>Lachrymae.</hi> Me thinkes the braine should daunce a Iigge at the hearing a <hi>Tullian</hi> sound, and sit in counsaile when it heares the other.</p>
                  <p>But his matter is substantiall, and honest, and though hee bee betrayed among Pedauntes, and Boyes (which hee may thanke his Style for) yet hee is meeter for

greater persons, and sounder iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But eloquence (as we take elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) it is of no vse, but among such eares as call a Bag-pipe musick, it fittes them, and among them must be vsed; but among wisemen, it is to distrust their vnderstandings, loosing time in repetitions, and Tautologies. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of things is not in their bignesse, but quality, and so of reason which wrapped in a fewe words hath the best tang. Those which are subiect to this prodigalitie, they should helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as stutterers, by learning to sing, so these by making verses, whose num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber tyes vp wordes and giues reason li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, carrying reason leuell to the soule, and giuing a reporte out of the mouth, as Gun-powder from Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. This disease of wordes let in by <hi>Cicero,</hi> was not long after letten out: for <hi>Augustus</hi> following almost in the furie of the shower, was faine to arme himselfe with writing all he meant to
<pb facs="tcp:9160:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speake, seriously, euen his speaches to his wife, which was painfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: for if the women had beene ledde by his example, the worlde sure at this day had beene inhabited by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but papers: yet he durst not doe otherwise, least <hi>Plus, minusue loqueretur ex tempore,</hi> which cannot choose but happen to a tongue that runnes proud after wordes. But they are worse that send messengers without an errand, that speake, and yet gelde their speach of meaning, like a foulded sheete of paper without any infoulding. Thus I haue heard speach cast out of a mouth worse then ridles, which neither spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker nor hearer could interpret. In the same file are Prouerb-mongers, whose throates are worne like roade-wayes, with little saide is soone amended: It is no halting before a Criple, and such like: when I heare one of these I looke for his drye nursse, for from her armes he plucked this language.

                  <p>The tongue is the key of the mind, the minde the casket, holding all our ritches to discouer which ordinarily, is to make another key besides his owne to commaunde your owne, which makes yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anothers. To dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer bright things so often, as may bee called wearing them, soiles them: but to discouer all you haue, and that all shall proue nothing, is the most miserable: so doth the mediocritye

betweene too much speach, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence fit both wise-men, and fooles, for the ones ware is to good, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to bad.</p>
                  <p>Mee thinkes, this same vanity of clothes hath done vertue wrong, for wee discry great men as much by their clothes, as actions, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improper: for we allow not houses by their plaistering, and gaynesse, but by their roomes, and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Hath it not also weakened our best force, and made vs call in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helpes? for not of our heads, but of our Tailours wee aske aide, where power languisheth with entertaining these baudes of pleasure, seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comes in, for when pouerty findes her endles labours end with powring her gaines into excesse, mutinie counsailes want against this too much plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<q>Thus to these miserable ones speakes a seditious fellow in the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> state, strip vs all naked (saith he)
<pb facs="tcp:9160:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and you shall perceiue no difference, cloathe vs with their garments, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ours, &amp; doubtlesse we shall looke like noblemen, they looke like vassalls, for it is onely pouerty, and riches that makes the disparity beweene vs.</q>
It is the lustre of greatnesse, &amp; yet the most daungerous: daungerous, for it feedes enuy, daungerous, for it makes vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for any other estate, to which mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie being ouer subiect should neuer be vnfit to entertaine it. <hi>Cleopatrats</hi> miserie looked much more defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, because mens memoryes could ioyne her present state, to the state she put vpon her when she would resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Goddesse <hi>Isis</hi>: it is like a face vsed to looke through a ruffe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put in a falling band lookes as if looking through a halter. But this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon curse vpon greatnesse, that it can nothing so well defend it selfe from misfortune, as misfortune from fortunate: to become great of little
<pb facs="tcp:9160:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
indures much better, then to become little of great. I cannot thinke it a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full excuse, to say, the minde stil aimes vpward: no, the minde of vertue is still it selfe, and is it selfe, let fortunes Arithmeticke be either adding, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting: shee can ioyne no more earth to her then the body, and rather would she be rid of that, then receiue more. It is disputable, whether these robes of greatnesse should at all bee allowed, but to be in them alwayes, without question is disallowed. There are some that can see, and not iudge, know these, it is necessary for greatnes to show them somewhat which they may vnderstand. Now for the light changes of attire, me thinkes they goe like a singing catch, some are begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when others are ending, others in the middest when another begins againe. Let another bee absent from this mint, and without the discipline of a Tailour but a few monthes, and at his
<pb facs="tcp:9160:235"/>
next appearance his friends shall not knowe whether hee bee a man, or a Ghoast of times past, or a spirite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Westminster Statue. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-maisters haue not ingrossed all vanitye, though they haue money, for these people haue a chaunge where to bee out of fashion is to be banquerupt, and as the ones billes are protested, so the others discretion. This is not to haue a head, but a hat buttond vp on the side: It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what soule, so a body in fashion, of which though I doe despise it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet I wishe it no other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe then the Painters Shoppe, where a picture of seauen yeares since, lookes more like an Anticke Dauncer, than a man. But thus shall I be, if I speake more of them, for I drawe them, and Time drawes them out of fashion, and they if I laye any more holde on them, drawe me.</p>
                  <p>But now the motions of man, by
<pb facs="tcp:9160:235"/>
reason of his reason called Actions, what an Eclipse doe they suffer with vanityes darke bodye getting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and the clearenesse of reason? what see wee almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? How neerely soeuer resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vertue, which more deepelye examined would not prooue vanity? euen Diuinitie is not free, for Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie killes many actions, which without hipocrisie would be vertues; but I will leaue this office to Diuines, whose sightes can better discouer the inuisible walkings of professours of good-dooing ill. In secular professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I hardly see euen the grauest goe without touching vanity, performing as much for oste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations sake, as for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the obseruation of which hath made me so incredulous, as I beleeue light actions, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do words: he that protests he loues his country, &amp; in some aduenture of his pursse and paines, showes it, I am neuer the more

mooued to extoll him: but when in a breache he defends his countrie, when he calleth the forces of his scattered countrimen shattered by Fortune, and so out of hope, as his action may bee called the dying with his Countrey; I will begin then to trust him: or if like the keeper of a Forte in the olde Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine dissentions, who being besei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and his Castle fired, threwe his owne children into the flame, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to take those giftes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but for his honour, he held that in his brest, which no shocke of fortune should ouerthrowe, nor fire melte, Were there not such men to inriche Histories, how idle a thing were a Historie? for who is not mooued to followe this honorable patterne? his children were not more inflamed with the fire, then the vertuous reader, mee thinkes, should be with his throwing them in the fier: now may we sweare he loued his countrie, and honour, and
<pb facs="tcp:9160:236"/>
from him may distingush betweene the louers of Fame and Vertue: for Fames seruantes loue commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but with all they loue to heare it themselues: the other thinkes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue not of Life. It needes no wonder though their valures differ, that imploy them for fame, from those for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Were I the seruant of Fame, it should be my case, for her rewardes are fainte and leane: the fire nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing valour, comes from no outward thing, but from the sweetnesse of the meditation of vertue: but Fame thinks not on that, but lookes who seeth her, and dooth worse then louers, that drawe their vigour from their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse eyes.</p>
                  <p>Vertue hath Fame, though vertue workes not for fame, which mee thinkes is an excellent testimonie of the diuine goodnesse, when not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie his, and humaine lawes teache it, but euen from the example of our
<pb facs="tcp:9160:237"/>
familiars may be read good and bad. Thus preuailed <hi>Benedetto Alberti</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> for after his death they confessed their errour, and fetched home his bones, buying them with solemne pompe, and honour, whome being aliue they had persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with slaunder and reproache. In matters of pollicie, vanitie beares no lesse swaye, when from the force of rules and institutions, they thinke to maintaine states. Policie conducted by vertue, I thinke the life of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which a common-wealth can no more liue, then a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die without a soule: but policie (as it is commonly taken and vsed) is no more certaine nor profitable, then a Farmers drawing all his Councell from a Kalender.</p>
                  <p>It raines, of which Philosophy will say, the sunnes drawing vp of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture from the earth is the cause: alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the last cause, but the cause of

                  <p>As this, so this pollicie is coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and vncertaine, full of perill, neuer safe.

Not onely dooth heauen detest this course, but euen among men it is vaine: though the strength of a state may be knowne, their vse lyes hidden. Euery daye doth the witte of industrie inlarge it selfe, and deuise vses of things, which without the spirite of Prophecie, or chaunce, may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his rules, and then who seeth him not apt to fall into the worste errours? Thus hath Artillery put the auncient Romaine and Graecian Histories out of fashion in many things: thus hath the experience of their times, and

Doubtlesse the witte of man is too excellent a thing to bee catcht in a snare which hee seeth lye before him, he goeth not alwayes one waye: though lawes can fadome the driftes of vice, yet those of wisedome, this pollicie cannot, for it is vpwarde, euen to heauen is her flight; the other earthly and visible.

which when cast-vpon another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce is not vertue, though like ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

Fortitude, (take her in her vttermost boundes) incircleth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming Passions the bearing the assaults of the world, she goeth euen into the confines of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, for to curbe appetite, mee thinkes, is fortitude: but bind her now to her managing peril, and to the seruing her common wealth, to make her herselfe, there must be in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, reason, profit, and iustice.

                  <p>Now to my comparison of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of those times with this of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity: can his reason be so exact, that knowes not from whence his reason comes (for their wisest did but gesse at the immortality of the soule) as his that doth continually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse with his soule? for so ought Christians. Or shall his profit, that lookes no farther then

the body, bee compared to him that profits both soule, and body? Bud for iustice, what vnderderstanding wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer humane lawes (whose end is but proffit) to diuine iustice, whose end is vertue? who seeth not now (that will see) times past had not the way of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude? for their best were but shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: neither had they that cause, for fortitude at that time was not known. They durst die, but wee know how to vse death: they durst aduenture but we know how to profit by aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing: then it is Idlenes, that hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this opinion, for if we wil do wel, none euer knew better how, neuer had any better cause, for we are certaine of our reward. Of the repinings, &amp; vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of a man reiected by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, I should speake a little more: how contrary it is to right, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for thy body is thy countries, and thy soule ought to follow vertue: dooth thy soule consent to thy bodies
<pb facs="tcp:9160:242"/>
rebellious thoughtes? both body and soule forsake right, and vertue, for thy soule maintaines wrong, &amp; so looseth vertue, thy body doth wrong, and so looseth right. In this, both the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and Romane common wealthes brought forth many more faithull, the repetition of whome, those eyes that haue seene historye, can as redily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as I, whom I will therefore omit, and saue that labour. Onely thus: to vpbraide our country with our good desertes, is to aske reward at the worldes handes, not at vertues: out all, is not all: wee are bound to doe for it: but our best shall be called well, because our vttermost. Not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse much, but to vse it well is the way of felicitie, and then doth our body not hurt our soule, when it is content to imploy his force to blowe the fire, while shee is extracting the quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of things.

proue nothing but wordes, yet they breake not promise with the world, for they say but an Essay, like a Scriuenour trying his Pen before he ingrosseth his worke, nor to speake plainely, are they more to blame then many other that promise more, for the most that I haue yet touched, haue millions of wordes to the bringing forth one reason, and when a reason is gotten, there is such borrowing it one of another, that in a multitude of Bookes, still that conceit, or some issued out of that appeares so be laboured, and worne, as in the ende it is good for nothing but for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe.

for I will choose rather to be an honest man then a good Logitian. There was neuer art yet that layd so fast hold on me, that she might iustly call mee her seruant.

of great matters resting in himselfe. <hi>Socrates</hi> was the wisest man of his time, and his ground for that, was his turning all his acquired knowledge into morality: of whome one said, hee fetched Philosophy from heauen, &amp; placed her in Citties. <hi>Plato</hi> laughes at those commonwealthes men, that intend onely the inlarging, and inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their countreyes, and in the meane time they suffer the inioyers of their labours to be vicious, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: euen so of these thirsters after knowledge, for hath he all that men possibly may haue, and then inclose it in the chest of a dishonest brest, it but corruptes him, and makes the poyson of his viciousnes more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>

wilfulnesse of my naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Thus I see all things, and take example as well by a vicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall fellowe, as by one vpon the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and desire his part no more that is able, and doth nourish excesse, then I do the others, and if I would beleeue <hi>Plato,</hi> he holdes this state the better, for the one is now surfetting, the other taking Phisicke. I haue heard of the effects of great reading, ioyned to an vnderstanding able to digest, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it, of high acting spirits, whose am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions haue beene fed by Fortune and power: these make a great noise in the eares of men, and like a swaggerer seeme to drowne more humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: but equally examined, the giftes of morallity are more excellent, and vertuous.

more noblye then in winning all his victories: for those rightly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned take away maruaile, and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for they were for his owne sake: but here, compassion, regard of others, and temperance, pleade for an eternall applause; this was moralitie, and the inwarde discourse of an honest minde, this was no bloodshed, nor blowes, but the preseruation of his friends: here blood spotted not his name, but puritie so imbellished it, that no eye louing vertue can see this peece with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due praising it.

There are none that I scratche with my pen that doe not fatherly counsaile me to the way of vertue. I like much better to doe well, then to talke well, choosing to be beloued rather then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, aspiring to no more height then the comfort of a good conscience, and doing good to some, harme to none. If my Essayes speake thus, they speake as I would haue them, for I thinke not of making morality full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodery, cutworkes, but to clothe her in trueth, and plainenesse: nor if they straye doe I seeke to amende them

for I professe not method, neither will I chaine my selfe to the head of my chapter.

To all men belongs vertue, for he cannot deale iustly with himselfe without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for affection choosing grosely and partially, will statue the minde to feede the senses, and perhaps some of them to surfet others.

for vertue is honesty: in a worde to be, he must be vertuous, for her contrary is but corruption, which killes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, but is not to be seene seperated from her conquest.

of vertue: for to intend the raising of the body, &amp; to put the minde to drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie for his sake, is full of perill and folly, as we say in English, It is to set the Cart before the horse. They are the disease of the body these thoughts, and no more to be beleeued or followed, then the thoughts of a man in a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning feuer.

I remember <hi>Terence</hi> makes a Father commend his sonne, that all those things were esteemed of him equally, and not too much, which he reioyced in, and he had good cause, for they are things of too light a colour to bee worne by grauitie, they spend much time, a thing not of the least co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for either himselfe, or his country still needs it, it lightens the minde, &amp; filles it with thoughts of pleasure and gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it is the entrance of corruption, for who resists riches, is often taken by a meaner thing fitting his pleasure.</p>

                     <hi>Aegipt,</hi> left temperance, &amp; fell to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, which if you will not graunt this the cause of: yet can it not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied for a motiue more attractiue then the occasion was worthy of.

But we must goe no farther in this then the auoyding, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great power in himself none can do, it being naturally in men, violently to run from one extreame to another. Let not this shunning pleasure destroy affability grauity is not boud to frowne and bite his lip: this becomes singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the destroyer of the loue of others: neither so strictly is the life to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as shall make men flie your imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Good is to be done in a common wealth, not onely by Iustice, but by perswasion: to meete the humours of men sometimes, gaines men: and the putting of authoritie, &amp; vsing familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preuailes as much, as the bloodiest sentence of Iustice, whose seuerity ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Of flattery the bane of vertue, and the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated disease killing greatnesse, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one can speake, though few avoide, The good <hi>Augustus</hi> that mannaged principallitie as fairely as it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man vnasisted by diuinitie, was taken heere, but the safest that might be, I cannot finde that suffered it to lay hold of his wisedome, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but it catch'd him by the eyes, for he loued well that other eyes should confesse a weakenesse to his, &amp; not be able to behold them long <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debat si quis sibi acrius contuenti quasi ad sulgorem solis vultum submistures.</hi> The extremitie of this seldome comes but from meane estates, whom if they bar from such altberty of speaking as may giue oppertunitie to adulation, they
<pb facs="tcp:9160:280"/>
may preuent this daunger: If it come from such as wee holde friends, their life and honestye examined, will tell what they meane. <hi>Anthony</hi> whome I late mentioned, was deceiued by such as would tell him of his faults, but so little of them mixed with so many praises, as their reproofes seemed but like sharpe fauce to make him deuoure their commendations more hungerly. But this was a cunning trick, and those lesse cunning are hardly auoyded, since they meete so right with the generall inclination of man, selfe-loue, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they speake no more then wee thinke. The last and best remedy that I know, is that which was giuen me by the worthiest friend I haue, by way of aduise: when commended, examine vnpartially your owne deserts, where if you finde not what is laide to your charge, note that toung for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of flattery. I cannot thinke of a better remedy, only I must say, it is not
<pb facs="tcp:9160:281"/>
to be done without vertue, for all the examinations of vice are partiall &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. For friends there is no safety but in honest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for others will betray vs, if not by our selues, yet with himselfe, for becoming once his friend, wisdom, nor forecast, nor the discrying danger ought keepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perishing with him. I holde it no lesse vnsafe to choose one onely for greatnes, for we make choise of them but for our owne sakes, which they are apt enough to find, &amp; as apt to make vse of vs to their owne profit: we may fall with these, but our rising is in their power: thus the friends of <hi>Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> when <hi>Tiberius</hi> had discryed him, paide deerly for their nearenesse.

not least of importance is the carriage of your rewards and punishments: this is the thing that giueth lords good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants or bad: I like well to let them see all their faults, hardly let all be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable though not punished with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.

we owe him much that giues vs his youth: and surely there is no greater inhumanity, then to make vse of the fresh time of a man, and turne him out in the colde, and winter of his age. This I finde generally to be the force of vertue, that all her proceedings fall out most safely: for ingratitude a lim of her contrarye, leaues destitute them that are knowne so barren: if the earth should bee so to the paines of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, we should starue: If riuers, so to their father the ocean, his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to the thirstie earth would make her poore: but nature hath made her creatures more louing, and assisting to one another, therfore is the vngratefull man to be termed a monster.

This is plainely sprung from a fainte harted cowardise, that is the head of this pudle, and from that head come these three, Flatterie, dissimulation, and lying. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith that the flattered haue the disease of ouerliking or else they could neuer bee surprised; &amp; I thinke so to, for an exact, and stricte Iudge of himselfe smells the straight.

They are creatures that will not spend a drop of loue vpon any but themselues, they are creatures that haue no other god but pleasure, &amp; haue sold their soules for clothes, &amp; meate, and countinance, not natures children, but dame Needs and base desires. The subiect of this venom, that hath eyes, and yet seeth not, is in a worse state, for besides that he is a looser by time, by whom discreation in spight of his hart is a gainer; (for wisedome is more precious then youth) hee looseth the vse of himselfe, for he can not goe without his trumpeter, a counterfeit fame.</p>

                  <p>There is a selfe flatterrer, a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of others in hope of gaine, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers by exchange; then, flattery for Princes, for the vulgar, for rich men. The most subiect to selfe flatterie, are schollers before they arfledge; for there is no such cherisher of the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as are letters, this proceedes from a little wit and no iudgement. They are like beggars that a smal sum makes in opinion infinitly rich; but time reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers them from the most part, for either

Dissimulation is more tollerable; in some courses necessarie, as if a man be fallen vpon a wife that he cannot loue, yet he must vse her well, and if he cannot performe the expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, yet at least to come as neare as he can. Other times it may come very neare honestie to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a mans intentions, as in cases of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, where it giues a pause, and that pause makes roome for consideration, that in the heate of bloud is euer deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed audience; and if it neuer come to

This dissimulation is a very pretty worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not so base minded as flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he cals not night, day: nor badde, good: but is a skilfull manager of time and beares himselfe as cunningly, and as warmly as the sunne when he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the wind in maister <hi>Esops</hi> moral.
