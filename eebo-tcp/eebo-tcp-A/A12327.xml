            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We may not presume to enter into Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and give sentence of election, or reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon any.

            <p>
               <hi>Thou art not a God that loveth wickednesse, thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test all them that worke vanitie.</hi> Yet he saith else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. <hi>Thou ô Lord savest both man and beast, how excellent is thy mercy O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which appeareth, in that he maketh his Sunne to shine, and his raine to fall upon just, and unjust. And as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>hee would have all to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth</hi>

and allure us to their superstitious and idoll services.</p>
            <p>So farre forth we must hate them, though they be never so neere, and deare unto us: As our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. verse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, brother and sister, wife and children, hee can not be my Disciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, hee that casts not off all affections, and desires, which draw him from God to the world, from Christ to Antichrist.</p>
            <p>So then it is no impiety to hate our carnall and naturall friends, when they become our ghostly enemies, hindering Gods glory and our salvation.</p>
            <p>Neither must wee hate them secretly, hold our tongues, and let them alone. As the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi> saith, <hi>Ephraim is turned after Idols, Let him alone</hi>; that is, trouble not your selves with him, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible, in a desperate case; Let him alone, let him perish in his sinnes: But wee must endeavour to amend our <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> hoping to reclaime them from their Idols, after which of late they have hastily turned.</p>
            <p>But if they prove stubborne, and stifnecked, then must wee cry aloud, and proclaime their folly: we must discover their blindnesse, and nakednesse to the world; we must persecute them with fire and sword; fire of z<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Those vanities,</hi> saith a learned interpreter, <hi>are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions, superstitious Ceremonies, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine and overthrow both the Law and the Gospell</hi>; after which Ceremonies, <hi>Orientales,</hi> our East-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers runne mad in a manner.</p>

            <p>Many are tolerable, a few necessary?</p>
            <p>Most are ridiculous, and some abhominable.</p>
            <p>Indeed in the beginning, when the law was first published, it pleased almighty God to traine vp the people of <hi>Israell,</hi> vnder a multitude of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ordinary Glosse saith well. <hi>Externi ritus &amp; ceremoniae Legis, quia fuerunt vmbra Christi tum venturi, &amp; mysteriorum, ideo adveniente veritate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelica, illicita facta sunt, &amp; evanuerunt: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall rites and Ceremonies of the Law, because they were shadowes of Christ to come, and of his mysteries; therefore the truth of the Gospell being once come, they are made vnlawfull, and have vanished out of sight.</hi>

               <hi>Origen</hi> writeth thus in his Treatise on <hi>Matthew, veniente Principe Sacerdotum, the Prince of Priests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the Priest in figure ceased.

            <p>But the Fathers many times call it an <hi>Altar.</hi> It is true, for the mystery of iniquity began betime to worke by small beginnings lurking in words.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Yet the Fathers worshipped not their altars: <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>

            <p>For <hi>Tertullian,</hi> saith <hi>Chemnitius, was the authour, omnium fere Ceremoniarum Papisticarum, in a manner of all Popish Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon arose an opinion that <hi>Montanus</hi> the her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As if the holy Ghost were annexed to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

included in Ceremonies, collated by Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>Whereupon saith <hi>Bugenhagius</hi> a learned <hi>German, The Church of Rome condemned</hi> Montanus <hi>for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke, and yet neverthelesse retained his heresies.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Which,</hi> saith he, <hi>hereby is manifest, in that the books which defend his heresies are preserved, but the workes of those Fathers which confuted them are lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montanus</hi> therefore was the first Altar worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and they that now imitate him in ducking to Altars are little better then hereticall <hi>Montanists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But give me leave I pray you to aske this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why bow you not the knee to the font also, it being <hi>Lavacrum regenerationis, the laver of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as honorable, and a more necessary Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For without Baptisme none can bee saved, as some teach; but many that are baptized dye, before they come to the yeares of discretion, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they may be fit to receive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet we see none make leggs to the Font.</p>
            <p>Why doe they not? Christ is as much present there and as really, and the Font is an Altar as well as the Table, and so it was termed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church by <hi>Prudentius,</hi> who lived 1300. yeares agoe.</p>
            <p>Who speaking of a combate betweene Chastity and Lust, after Chastity had killed Lust.</p>

her Sword, wherewith she slew her enemies, to the Catholick Church, and hangs it up, Fontis ad Aram, at the Altar of the Font.</hi> Loe here the Font also is called an Altar.</p>
            <p>Therefore honour ye the Font as well as the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with one and the same worship of bowing the knee to it, or else you are Hereticks, affording more holinesse and more dignity to one Altar, and to one Sacrament, then to the other.</p>
            <p>For either your worship is religious, or civill; if it be civill, ye are absurd idiots in honouring stocks and stones, more then any poore man who is the image of God; for who will lowt too low to a begger as to sweep the ground with his beard, if it be not very short.</p>
            <p>If it be religious, you are more absurd in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the memory of Christs body and blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Trinity: Seeing you are baptised in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, and not in the Name of Christ alone.</p>
            <p>The Lords Table therefore and the Font they are Altars both alike, as an apple and an egg are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions both alike; that is neither of them properly and truly, though they have a kind of resemblance: and being both alike, and of equall worthinesse, why are they so farre put asunder, the whole length of the Church, one at the head, the other at the foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Why are they not set in the body of the Church or quire, being the fittest place to receive the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test assemblies and most Communicants.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58:10"/>Why is the Altar lifted up to the top of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary or Chappell, or the Font not admitted so much as to the bottome?

            <p>
               <hi>Ecclesia</hi> is the <hi>Church</hi> where a congregation of people useth to assemble, to heare the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which in Latine is <hi>Concio,</hi> and it signifieth not onely the Sermon, but <hi>caetum,</hi> the multitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And the Preacher is called <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionator,</hi> derived from the same words.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I conclude that where no congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation useth to meete to heare Sermons, that place is no Church; and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

longitudines; the excessive height, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lengths of Temples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why so? because he misliked worldly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the spirituall service of God, who dwells not in Temples made with hands.</p>
            <p>Also, because hee would not have the Minister and people sundred, nor scattered abroad in spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous roomes, but joyned together as neer as might bee. Who standing in the midst, <hi>vulgi stante corona,</hi> the people all about him, round in a ring, he may better be heard, and they edified.</p>
            <p>For all things in the Church, ought to bee done to edification, saith <hi>Paule,</hi> which then is best, when the Minister abides with the people, or they draw neere to him: Hee may not runne away in a <hi>Cope,</hi> as farre as he can get him from the congregation.</p>
            <p>But what a tricke is this which our newfangled Ceremony-mongers have taken up of late, to goe in a <hi>Cope</hi> to the Altar, to say two or three prayers after the Sermon? why use they this ceremony, not mentioned in the Communion booke or Canons?</p>
            <p>Why suffer they not the Preacher to dismisse the congregation with the blessing of Gods peace as was wont to be done, and our last Bishop esteemed to be best?</p>

            <p>Why doe they these things contrary to law, and never done in our Church before since the Masse was banished?</p>
            <p>Is it because they are enamoured with <hi>Copes?</hi> do they dote upon <hi>Copes</hi>?</p>
            <p>Or are Psalmes and Chapters read in the body of the Church not for good Gospel, nor so worthy to be coped?</p>

            <p>Lastly, why forbid they singing of Psalmes in such a tune, as all the people may sing with them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58:12"/>
and praise God together, before and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as by authority is allowed, and heretofore hath been practised both here and in all reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>How dare they in stead of Psalmes, appoint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems, (little better then prophane Ballads some of them) I say, so many Anthems to be sung, which none of the people understand, nor all the singers themselves, which the Preface to the Communion booke, and the Queenes Injunctions, will have cut off, because the people is not edified by them?</p>
            <p>It is for spite they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I blame not the singers, most of which mislike these prophane innouations, though they be forced to follow them?</p>
            <p>Their guides are in fault, blinde guides, members of our Church, rotten members I doubt, of higher degree; to whom all men and women are rank puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and schismatiks, to be thrust out and expeld, if they refuse to dance after their fantasticall pipe in every idle ceremony.</p>
            <p>These crye with the <hi>Iewes, Templum Domini, Templum Domini: The Church of God, the service of God</hi>; when indeed their whole service is little else then superstitious vanitie.</p>

            <p>And still he aspireth and climeth higher, never thinking himselfe sufficiently rewarded for his great learning, and service of God, in sitting at Church three times a day, to heare men Pipe, and chaunt, and chaunt himselfe where he listeth.</p>
            <p>A base imployment, prohibited by Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> himselfe; who speaking <hi>de cantu Ecclesiastico,</hi> hath these words.</p>

            <p>And when we take orders of the Bishops, charge is given to reade, and preach Gods word, not to sing: any lewd Lay-man can doe that, without laying on of a Bishops hands, without consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I was not sent to baptise</hi> (much lesse to sing in a quire) <hi>but to preach.</hi> And <hi>woe to me,</hi> saith he, <hi>if I preach not the Gospell:</hi> he saith not, woe to me, if I observe not the canonicall houres of devotion in singing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:58:13"/>This makes me call to remembrance, a strange speech little better then blasphemy, uttered lately by a young man, in the presence of his Lord, and many learned men.</p>

            <p>And what meant he by a good service? his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was manifest; where goodly Babylinish robes were worne, imbroydered with images.</p>
            <p>Where he might beare a delicate noise of singers, with Shakebuts, and Cornets, and Organs, and if it were possible, all kinde of Musicke, used at the dedication of <hi>Nabuchodonosors</hi> golden Image.</p>
            <p>To such a dainty service of heavenly Harmony, the singular devotion, and hot zeale of this holy man, would carry him over hills and dales, through fire and water, rather forty miles, then two miles to a Sermon.</p>
