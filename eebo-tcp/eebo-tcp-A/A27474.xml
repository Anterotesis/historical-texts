         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SIcily</hi> enjoyed great Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Reign of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froy;</hi>
that Prince having
all the Qualities which obtain the
Admiration of the People. He
had render'd himſelf formidable
both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and tho'
he had no other Enemies than
thoſe his Valour had occaſioned,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43299:6"/>
he had already given ſeveral Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels;
and it is certain, that he
conquered as often as he fought.
Queen <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> his Wife, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> was
likewiſe an accompliſh'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
having all the Virtues that
can be wiſh'd for in a Great
Queen; and the King, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her with an extraordinary
Affection, would have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to deſire, if Heaven
had not deprived him of ſeveral
Princes whom the Queen had
brought into the World. This
misfortune of their Family, made
a great part of their Lives very
afflicting, Daughters not being
capable of Succeeding in the
Crown, that Kingdom muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
have fallen into the hands
of <hi>Berranger,</hi> King of <hi>Majorca,
Minorca,</hi> and <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> his
Couſin-German, and greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43299:6"/>
Theſe two Kings being
extraordinarily animated againſt
one another, would never have
ſuſpended the Effects of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
if Prince <hi>Ordogne,</hi> Count
of <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> and their Allies,
had not made them agree to a
Truce, which they repreſented to
be neceſſary for the Repoſe of
their People. The King of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
notwithſtanding the Advantages
he had over <hi>Berranger,</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with to conſent to this
Propoſition; for indeed, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Victory does almoſt as much
weary the Conquerour as the
Vanquiſhed; and the King of
<hi>Majorca</hi> being brought into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
through the ill Succeſs of
his Arms, accepted though with
Repugnance, all the Conditions
that the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> impoſed
upon him, hoping, that by the
Length of the Truce, he might
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43299:7"/>
the better put himſelf in a Poſture
of reſiſting the Forces of <hi>Menfroy,</hi>
who had almoſt exhauſted all
thoſe of his Kingdom. Thoſe kind
of Treaties that are made out of
Neceſſity do not put an end to
Quarrels, they only help to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them, and the Moment of
ſeeing them revived, is impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expected. Such were the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of <hi>Berranger,</hi> and which
he endeavoured to inſpire, as much
as poſſible, in young <hi>Amaldee</hi> his
Son, and the young <hi>Camilla,</hi> as
ſoon as they came out of their
Nurſes Arms. The King of <hi>Sicily</hi>
being returned to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> the
place of his uſual Reſidence, found
the Queen his Wife ready to lye
in. This Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſs, who through
the loſs of her Children, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
inſenſible of any Joy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the King with all the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
ſhe was capable of, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43299:7"/>
with a Languiſhing and Deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
that cannot be conceived.
The King made it his Buſineſs to
divert her Grief, putting her in
hopes that Heaven would be more
favourable to them, and that it
would perhaps conſerve the Child
with which ſhe went; but, if by
Misfortune ſhe was delivered of a
Girl, he was reſolved to conceal
her Sex, and to bring her up as
a <hi>Prince Majeur,</hi> a Name conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
in <hi>Sicily,</hi> as the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for to exclude
<hi>Berranger</hi> from hopes of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Crown. The Queen
did willingly agree to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
and ſome days after, ſhe
was brought to Bed of a Princeſs,
who was called <hi>Frederick,</hi> a Name
famous in <hi>Sicily.</hi> The Nurſe, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs,
and the Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
were the only Perſons who
had the Secret of this important
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43299:8"/>
Myſtery. The Queen dyed ſome
time after, whoſe Loſs, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a publick Affliction, the King
being infinitely grieved, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no Conſolation, but what
the ſight of <hi>Frederick</hi> afforded
him; of whom, he took a moſt
particular Care. And indeed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was Prince better bred than
this; his Natural Endowments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poliſhed by a good Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
quickly rendred him the moſt
accompliſhed of all thoſe of his
Age. He was a Prodigy of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but his Wit ſurpaſſed the
Charms of his Perſon, whereof,
he gave early and conſiderable
Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The young Prince of <hi>Naples,</hi>
called <hi>Leon,</hi> who was brought
up with <hi>Frederick,</hi> walking one
day with him, and ſeeing a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fair Ladies, attended by a
Throng of Courtiers, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43299:8"/>
their Walk, with great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
as to thoſe who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them; which Prince <hi>Leon</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of, You muſt confeſs,
ſaid he to <hi>Frederick,</hi> that we are
no great Gallants, ſince we are ſo
ſolitary in the Preſences of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Beauties. You are in the
right, replyed <hi>Frederick;</hi> we
might at leaſt agreeably employ
our Eyes, though our Hearts are
not yet in a State of being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
but it is perhaps, the little
Peril we ſhould thereby run, that
makes us ſo negligent of purſuing
it. The Truth is, dear Couſin,
ſaid <hi>Leon</hi> to him, with an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
altogether charming, I am
very far from running any ſuch
Danger; and hitherto, I find in
my ſelf ſo little Diſpoſition to
Love, that it would require a
great deal of time to prepare me
for the leaſt Sence of it. There
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43299:9"/>
needs no more, replyed <hi>Frederick</hi>
gallantly, than two Eyes, and
perhaps not ſo many Years, to
make you change your Stile. But
you, ſaid the Prince of <hi>Naples</hi>
once again, Do not you find
ſomething ſurprizing in what
they tell us of Love, whom they
deſcribe to us as an Infant, and
however, would perſuade us, that
he is a dreadful Enemy? I know
not what to think of it, ſaid <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
to him, but perhaps we
ſhall find him more formidable
when we are leſs childiſh. It was
thus that thoſe two lovely Princes
entertained themſelves at the Age
of twelve Years. In the mean
while, Endeavours were uſed to
inſpire <hi>Frederick</hi> with as much
Indifference as was neceſſary for
the Perſonage he was to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
and more particularly, they
inſinuated into him, that to reign
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43299:9"/>
peaceably upon his Throne, it
was requiſite he ſhould reign over
his own Heart. The King his
Father had taken Care to inſtruct
him betimes with the Reaſons of
his Diſguiſe; and had made him
promiſe, that during his Life, and
that of <hi>Berranger,</hi> he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
diſcover what he was, for the
depriving his Enemy of the Hopes
of ſucceeding him in <hi>Sicily. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
embraced theſe Sentiments,
and knew no other Paſſion than
that of reigning. At length, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attained to the Age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years, he was inſtructed in
all the Exerciſes that are in uſe
with Men; wherein, he ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that he ſeemed the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
Prince of his Time.
His Stature, though tall for a
Woman, was middle ſeized for a
Man, but ſo full of Sweetneſs, that
it was impoſſible to forbear being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43299:10"/>
charmed with it. His Eyes were
black, ſparkling, and ſweet, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with a Flame, and an enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Languiſhing: in ſhort, all
his Perſon was compoſed after
ſuch a manner, as was capable of
inſpiring the moſt inſenſible with
Affection. Having attained to that
Seaſon wherein Love commits ſo
many Diſorders, he began to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
himſelf more ſtrictly, well
knowing, that if that Paſſion was
ſo much to be avoided by all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it was much more ſo for
him, who would be obliged to
keep very perplexing Meaſures
with thoſe ſhould have rendred
him ſenſible. He ſaw daily a
number of handſome Princes, and
having examined himſelf, he did
not yet find any Motions, which
he could be any ways apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of. Beſides, he imagined that
his Diſguiſe ſheltring him from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43299:10"/>
the Gallantries of Lovers, would
likewiſe ſecure him againſt the
Attempts of Love: but therein
he was miſtaken in his Accounts.
He quickly perceived by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
that his good Meen had
made, that a Paſſion may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
without the help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Several Beauties ſighed for
him in ſecret, and ſome, openly
enough to make themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
inſomuch, that the
Crowd of his Miſtreſſes importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, he imagined, that his
beſt Courſe would be to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Intrigue, by which means,
he would deprive them of their
Hopes, and by Conſequence, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Deſigns they might have
upon his Heart. Beſides, being
perſuaded that Gallantry is very
becoming a young Prince, he was
willing to affect a Paſſion, whoſe
Appearances could be no ways
troubleſome.</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43299:11"/>
                     <hi>Yolanda,</hi> the Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Daughter, ſeemed the moſt
proper for his Deſign, ſhe was
aimable enough to imagine her
ſelf beloved, upon the leaſt Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and young enough not to
diſtinguiſh a real from a feigned
Paſſion. Nor was he deceived
in all theſe Conjectures. <hi>Yolandeck</hi>
loved him in good Earneſt, and
all thoſe who might have been
capable of purſuing any Deſigns
againſt the Liberty of this Prince,
and who had made too much haſt
to preſent him with their Hearts
diſengaged themſelves as ſoon as
they perceived that he payed his
Vows to this Lady. Only <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
the Lord Admiral's ſecond
Wife, whom her Huſband had
never acquainted with the Cheat
that was put upon all the Earth,
was deceived therein as well as
others; and likewiſe, obſerved
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43299:11"/>
more Charms in the Perſon of
<hi>Frederick,</hi> ſince her Daughter-in-Law
had ſeemed to her to have
a Kindneſs for him. She ſaw him
every day; and finding his way
of loving very delicate, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to divert Vows that were
only imaginary. She was beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and had not yet attained to
thirty Years, which is not an Age
to diſcard Lovers: And tho' her
haughty and imperious Carriage
would have diſcouraged all thoſe
whom her Beauty had made her
Conqueſts; ſhe imagined, that
by abating ſomething in Favour
of the Prince, ſhe would make
him the more value what ſhe did
only for his ſake; wherefore, her
Eyes ſpoke, but ſpoke to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
When Love does not make
it ſelf known to a Heart, it is
Death to the Language of the
Eyes: there wanted a Clearer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43299:12"/>
with <hi>Frederick,</hi> who
was free from any amorous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
But, the Admiral's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was not of a Humour, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ſo far; and her Paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſtrained to contain it ſelf
within the too narrow Bounds,
which her Haughtineſs preſcribed,
it manifeſted it ſelf by cold and
deſpiſing Looks, which ſhe had
the Confidence to treat that Prince
with, when he came to pay her
Viſits out of Devoir, that he might
ſee, at the ſame time, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-law,
whom ſhe had ever in
her Eye, ſince the Diſcovery ſhe
had made of her Amour with <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Yolanda</hi> was forbidden to
look upon the Prince of <hi>Sicily</hi> as
a Lover: But, ſhe choſe rather to
deprive her ſelf of ſo dear a Sight,
han to conſider as an other man,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43299:12"/>
the Perſon whom her Heart had
found ſo excelling; and went to
a Houſe her Father had, ſome
Leagues from <hi>Meſſina,</hi> where ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
her ſelf from the Perſecution
of her Mother-in-Law, ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that by a little Abſence,
ſhe ſhould the more inflame the
Paſſion of her Lover.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Prince
of <hi>Sicily</hi> ſeeing how eaſie it was
for him to engage Hearts, he now
grew willing to ſpare them out of
Pitty. He had no other Intrigue
during the time of <hi>Yolanda</hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
having too little Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with Love to amuſe himſelf
any longer with ſuch kind of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
Hunting was his greateſt
Divertiſement, wherein, Prince
<hi>Leon</hi> was his conſtant Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As they were one day return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from running a Stag, they
ſaw a Veſſel ſtrangely battered by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43299:13"/>
the Winds and Waves, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forced it ſeveral times againſt
the Rocks, notwithſtanding the
skill of the Pilots, it was going
infallibly to ſuffer Shipwrack;
whereupon, they ſent their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who with Boats took up
ſome Perſons from the Wracks of
this unfortunate Ship; and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
having informed himſelf
concerning them, with an unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Curioſity, he was told, that
they were apparently Perſons
of Quality, which their Air did
ſufficiently beſpeak them. <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
by I know not what Inſtinct,
being moved and concerned at
their Misfortune, beſeeched the
King his Father to ſend for them
to Court. Immediately, they were
provided with all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for all they had been able to
do, was only to ſave their Lives,
and their Baggage was loſt with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43299:13"/>
the reſt of their Train. <hi>Leon</hi> came
to the Palace a little before they
arrived there, and having found
out <hi>Frederick,</hi> they were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Pleaſure they had had
in Hunting, when they ſaw two
perſons come in equally well made,
who drew their Eyes, and thoſe
of all the Court, being a man of
a very high Appearance, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a very beautiful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who, notwithſtanding the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Grief that their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
had cauſed in them, failed
not to give Birth to far greater
Dangers than that they had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſcaped. <hi>Leon</hi> was dazzled,
and ſtruck with the Beauty of ſo
charming a Perſon; and looking
upon <hi>Frederick,</hi> he obſerved in
his Eyes the ſame Trouble with
which he was agitated; he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
to have found at the ſame
time, a Miſtreſs and a Rival; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43299:14"/>
that Jealouſie and Love
did together make their entrance
into his Heart. We may ſay,
that the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> found
at the ſame moment, what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her both tender and uneaſie,
ſhe ſaw a man ſo well made, that
he might in ſome manner juſtifie
the ſurprize of her Senſes; He
had the Nobleſt and fineſt ſhape
that ever was, and above all, he had
a Majeſtick Air, which the Princeſs
entertain'd a deſign of vanquiſhing;
but coming to caſt her Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Fair One who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, ſhe could not forbear
letting looſe a Sigh. It was the
firſt ſhe had ſtarted, that was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
between Spight and Love.
This Lady had almoſt all the
Features of him we have ſpoken
of, but her white Hair, and her
languiſhing Countenance, did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at firſt the Company's taking
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43299:14"/>
notice of the Reſemblance that
was between them. How did
that paſſionate Air, inſpired in all
probability by him who began
to pleaſe the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
appear to her an ill <hi>Omen,</hi> and
how reſtleſs began ſhe to be from
that time! On the other ſide,
the Princeſs of <hi>Majorca,</hi> for it
was ſhe and her Brother, who
had newly eſcaped drowning,
was ſenſible at the ſight of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
of a certain tender motion
which ſhe could not defend her
ſelf from. In ſhort, thoſe three
Hearts which were taken in that
ſame moment, ſeldom met in the
ſequel. <hi>Menfroy</hi> received them
with all imaginable Civility. But
they did not think convenient to
make themſelves known, before
they were well acquainted with
the Humours of thoſe Perſons who
treated them ſo obligingly; they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43299:15"/>
contented themſelves with giving
to underſtand, that they were of
conſiderable Extraction, but that
they were conſtrained by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Reaſons to conceal ſtill, for
ſome time, their Names and their
Fortune. They imagined, that
they two only of all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
being ſaved, they could not
eaſily be diſcovered, and that
their Ship having been ſunk, the
<hi>Sicilians</hi> had not had the leiſure
to take notice of the Colours.
They found it no hard task to
gain Credit in all they ſaid of
their Extraction, their Carriage
and their Air did ſufficiently ſhew
it: People only ſuſpected there
might be ſome Gallantry between
Perſons whoſe Union was only
occaſioned by their Birth. But it
is time to give an account how
they were conducted into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of <hi>Sicily.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43299:15"/>
Prince <hi>Ardalin</hi> Count of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,</hi>
being paſſionately in love
with the Daughter of <hi>Berranger,</hi>
whom he had ſeen at <hi>Majorca,</hi>
where he had reſided ſome time.
He procured her conſent to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Wife: the Princeſs <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
having a great Eſteem for
him, and being ingaged in no
Paſſion, received his Vows with
great Civility; which <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s
Paſſion made him take for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more delicate. Being at
length obliged to return to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,</hi>
he made her promiſe to be
mindful of the Sentiments he had
for her; and in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
his Ambaſſadour demanded
her in Marriage of the King her
Father, who finding the Match
advantageous, did willingly give
his conſent. The Ceremonies
that are uſual being performed,
they embarked, and Prince <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43299:16"/>
being deſirous to conduct his
Siſter into <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s Dominions,
embarqued in the ſame Veſſel that
was newly caſt away upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Sicily. Ardalin</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
with great Impatience, ſo
dearly beloved a Bride, while that
the <hi>Caprice</hi> of Fortune and of Love
poſſeſſed her elſewhere. <hi>Camilla</hi>
was at firſt ſight charmed with
the Beauty and good Meen of
<hi>Frederick,</hi> and thought it would
be Injuſtice to refuſe him, what
ſhe called Eſteem. The Hatred
of their Family, which ſhe had
from her Birth, ought to hinder
her from entertaining any thing
too intereſſing; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſhe abandoned her ſelf to
Motions, which ſhe imagined
were in no wiſe to be feared:
and beſides, being defended by
her natural Coldneſs, which had
hindred her from making any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43299:16"/>
Returns to <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s Paſſion,
than what meer Good Will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded;
ſhe could not be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it would make any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Progreſs: but, Time made her
know, that the Eſteem ſhe had
for <hi>Frederick,</hi> was too particular
for to be only meer Eſteem; and
comparing the Sentiments ſhe had
for him, whom ſhe durſt not ſo
much as wiſh for her Lover, with
thoſe ſhe had for the Prince who
was to be her Huſband, ſhe found
therein ſo great a Difference, that
it amazed her. How! ſaid ſhe,
ſhall the unfortunate <hi>Camilla</hi> leave
her Heart in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> while that
ſhe goes languiſhing and deſolate
to ſpend her Days at <hi>Barcelonna;</hi>
that muſt not be. Let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at leaſt, to defer ſo fatal a
Marriage; let us implore the
Friendſhip of a Brother, without
diſcovering to him, however,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43299:17"/>
what ought to be concealed from
us our ſelves. Whereupon, ſhe
aroſe to go to his Apartment, when
Prince <hi>Leon</hi> came into her's, with
Deſign to prepoſſeſs her in his
Favour, by preventing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Rival in his Declaration,
whom he fancyed to have ever
eluded, by beſieging her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
He found her ſo thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and ſo dejected, that he had
not the Power to ſpeak to her;
and theſe two unhappy Lovers,
remained in a Silence, that would
have melted with Pity all thoſe
who ſhould have obſerved them;
yet whereof they themſelves did
hardly take notice.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Amaldee</hi> diverted them
from it by his Arrival. He came
to confer with his Siſter about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e
means of facilitating their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Leon</hi> being hindred by his
Preſence, from purſuing his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43299:17"/>
deferred the Declaration
thereof, expecting a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Juncture.</p>
                  <p>But the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> being
alarmed and confuſed, to find I
know not what new Motions in
her Heart, which ſhe could in no
wiſe approve of, did all that was
poſſible, to render them ſecret.
That young Princeſs being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to feign what ſhe had not
yet been ſenſible of, found it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to conceal this real Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
All the Court did quickly
obſerve this Change of her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
which was imputed, with
great Probability, to <hi>Yolanda</hi>'s
Abſence; who, upon the Rumour
of ſo tender an Effect, was willing
to put an end to their mutual
languiſhing, by reſtoring to him
her Sight, and enjoying his: the
Courſe ſhe was, however, to ſteer
was pretty nice in the Conjuncture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43299:18"/>
of things. The Admiral's Lady,
whom <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Sadneſs did put
very much out of Humor, was
more to be feared than ever; but
a Miſtreſs does little value the
Diſpleaſure of a Mother in Law.
Beſides, a Friend ſhe had at Court,
who had given her Notice of the
Condition the Prince was reduced
to, propoſed to her a ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
between them, which it
was eaſie for her to procure:
whereupon, ſhe returning to
Court, did heap up Troubles on
the miſerable <hi>Frederick,</hi> who had
too many Misfortunes of his own,
for to be in a Condition to pity
thoſe of others. The Princeſs of
<hi>Sicily</hi> did eaſily perceive, that
notwithſtanding the Complaiſance
of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he had a terrible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
for all the Nation, and
which this Princeſs did not fail to
apply to her ſelf in particular,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43299:18"/>
through the ſingular Intereſt ſhe
took therein: though ſhe looked
upon <hi>Camilla</hi> as her Rival, ſhe
failed not to pay her Viſits very
often, that ſhe might ſee there her
Lover, who notwithſtauding his
Indifference, appeared to her very
lovely. She came once thither
juſt as Prince <hi>Leon,</hi> in Deſpair of
having found <hi>Camilla</hi> ſo ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to hear him, was riſing for
to be gone. <hi>Camilla</hi> changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
at the ſight of <hi>Frederick,</hi>
who bluſhed at the ſight of <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
and <hi>Leon,</hi> out-raged to ſee all
this Diſorder, reſolved to ſtay
there ſtill, that he might obſerve
Motions that put him upon the
Rack. <hi>Amaldee</hi> alone had ſo ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
an Air, that the Princeſs of
<hi>Sicily</hi> thought him the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of all men; and after a light
Coverſation, her Heart full of
Sighs, which ſhe found difficult
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43299:19"/>
to ſtifle, and her Eyes moiſt with
Tears, which ſhe could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
contain, ſhe went away, not
being able to ſupport the ſad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
ſhe made upon <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s
Happineſs. But, the Princeſs <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
had other Sentiments of this
ſo precipitated Departure; and,
having well obſerved the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Frederick</hi> in the Preſence
of her Brother, ſhe imagined, and
applauded her ſelf in ſecret, for
being the Cauſe of it. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
being left alone with his Siſter,
for <hi>Leon</hi> went away a Moment
after <hi>Frederick,</hi> propoſed to her
the continuing of their Voyage,
and told her, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
too long in an Enemies
Country, that it was requiſite they
ſhould be gone with the ſooneſt,
and that too towards <hi>Barcelonna,</hi>
where Prince <hi>Ardalin</hi> impatiently
expected them. <hi>Camilla</hi> trembled
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43299:19"/>
at this Diſcourſe, and putting all
in practiſe for the deferring ſtill,
for ſome Time, that terrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
ſhe made him conſent,
though with great Repugnance,
to all ſhe had a Mind.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, he reſolved
to diſpatch, privately, ſome one
to the King his Father, for to
give him notice of all that had
happened ſince their Departure;
and going out ſomething diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with his Siſter's Change of
Humor, he went to walk alone
in the Palace Gardens.</p>
                  <p>Immediately, he heard ſome
confuſed Voices; and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomething nearer, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
that of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and
that of <hi>Leon,</hi> who were <hi>parleying</hi>
ſomething ſharply. I congratulate,
ſaid the Prince of <hi>Naples,</hi> your
having made a Conqueſt, without
being at the Trouble of the leaſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43299:20"/>
Advance; your Vows are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before they are declared;
and there is no pretending to any
other than the Quality of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Lover, if a Man had a
mind to engage in <hi>Sicily. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
had too many Affairs in his
Mind to think of undeceiving
him; inſomuch, that he replyed
with ſome Sharpneſs, As you did
not conſult me about the Choice
of your Engagement, I do not
think my ſelf obliged to give you
an Account of the Progreſs I ſhall
make in mine; but believe me,
let us continue Friends, a ſtrange
Lady ſhould not diſunite us; you
ought not to underſtand me all
together, but you ſhall know the
reſt, when it is fitting for me to
tell it you. Then he quitted him
for to go into a gloomy. Alley,
where, letting a Looſe to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Humor, he remained
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43299:20"/>
in a certain Scituation, wherein,
the Soul, as it were, being prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon by it's Lanquour, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
almoſt inſenſible, wherein
we fly, if I may ſo ſay, from our
ſelves, to give our ſelves up to
the beloved Object, the Crowd
of Thoughts, hindring us from
being able to diſtinguiſh any one,
and by having too much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
on, we reſolve on nothing.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the Prince
of <hi>Majorca</hi> imagining that the two
Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were his Siſters Lovers,
he went to inform her of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thinking, that ſuch Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
do ever further an amorous
Paſſion inſtead of preventing it.
Siſter, ſaid he, gallantly to her,
You ought to be upon your Guard,
the Princes of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
have felt the Power of your
Eyes; if I am not deceived, their
Amour will put you to ſome
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43299:21"/>
Trouble. Brother, ſaid <hi>Camilla</hi>
to him, with a little Bluſh, if my
Eyes could revenge us of all the
Deſolation that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> have
committed in our Territories, why
are not you willing I ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them againſt the Prince of
<hi>Sicily?</hi> Ah! Siſter, ſaid <hi>Amaldee</hi>
to her, How zealous are you to
take up a Quarrel, whoſe Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
ought not to be your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in all Probability,
How weakly would you defend
your Heart againſt an Enemy,
whom your Eyes are willing to
attach? I confeſs, replyed the
Princeſs, hurryed away by her
Paſſion, <hi>Frederick</hi> appears lovely
to me, and if he was ſenſible—
Ah! it is too much interrupted,
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> let us get out of the
Hands and Dominions of a Prince,
whoſe Merit is fatal to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Princeſs, who is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43299:21"/>
elſewhere. It is no longer
time to think of that, ſaid ſhe to
him, all in Tears, I am no longer
Miſtriſs of my Heart, and all the
Favour I demand of you, is, to
prevent my becoming Princeſs of
<hi>Barcelonna.</hi> Ah! Siſter, ſaid he
to her, your Reaſon is aſleep, when
you ought to think of defending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
your ſelf; it is yet time enough,
the firſt Motions are eaſieſt to
vanquiſh, Abſence may ſecure your
Reſiſtance, content your ſelf with
the Delight of ſeeing the Power
of your Charms, and do not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them againſt your ſelf. This
was the Counſel of a Prince,
whoſe Experience was but ſmall
in Love. For, we cannot ſtop
there, we are willing to enjoy the
Fruit of a Conqueſt, and to what
Purpoſe is being beloved, if we
have not a Deſign to love? <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
was well acquainted with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43299:22"/>
theſe Maxims, ſhe was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of her Tenderneſs, and only
aimed at being beloved, that ſhe
might not love in vain. How
tender and moving an <hi>Idea</hi> did
ſhe repreſent to her ſelf of the
Sweets of a reciprocal Love! and
notwithſtanding the little Repoſe
that theſe agreeable Thoughts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
her, how beautiful did ſhe
appear the next Day to the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Leon!</hi> This Prince not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to comprehend of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>'s
Diſcourſe, came to inform
himſelf of his Miſtreſs, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Occaſion he had failed
of the Day before. <hi>Camilla</hi> had
too tender Thoughts to keep up
that haughty Air, which makes
the boldeſt Lover tremble: there
appeared ſo much Sweetneſs in
her fair Eyes, that the Prince ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that it was a fit Occaſion
to declare himſelf: he wavered
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43299:22"/>
more than once to ſpeak through
the inſeparable Reſpect of a great
paſſion; and through the Addreſs
of <hi>Camilla,</hi> who knowing his
Thoughts, diverted the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them with all the Liberty
of a contented Mind. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to him to go a walking,
which he durſt not refuſe; and
Prince <hi>Amaldee,</hi> at his Siſters De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
kept them Company. They
came to a place where was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>Eccho,</hi> and <hi>Amaldee</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with his Siſter, to ſing a
Tune ſhe had made ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
whereto, the Words were
as follow.</p>
                  <l>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmov'd, I ſaw a thouſand Charms each Day:</l>
                  <l>But when a Heart like ſome young tender Deer,</l>
                  <l>Careleſs and wanton, here and there does play,</l>
                  <l>That it's in Danger, one has Cauſe to fear.</l>
                  <l>So ſoon as Love it's Innocence perceives,</l>
                  <l>He ſtreight employs all his enticing Art;</l>
                  <l>Each Inſtant him ſome new Advantage leaves,</l>
                  <l>And at the laſt, it gives him all the Heart.</l>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:43299:23"/>
When ſhe had done ſinging,
ſhe heard another Perſon likewiſe
exerciſing his Voice, which was
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who was entertaining
his Melancholy; and without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard <hi>Camilla,</hi> was ſinging
theſe words at ſome diſtance.</p>
                  <l>When that a Heart under fierce
Flames does faint,</l>
                  <l>T'affect being gay and brisk, and
moſt at eaſe,</l>
                  <l>Is a ſevere, a hard, a ſad Conſtraint;</l>
                  <l>But when with ſtrict eſt Bonds, Love
does it ſeize,</l>
                  <l>It's Tyranny is likewiſe to reſtrain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>By ſoft Complaints to eaſe it's cruel
Pain.</l>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camilla</hi> imagined, that ſhe had
ſo great a Share in what he ſung,
as obliged her to make an Anſwer;
ſo that very ſeaſonably remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
ſome Verſes that Prince <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43299:23"/>
had formerly learnt her, and
which ſuting admirably well with
the Subject, ſhe ſung them as they
were couched, in theſe Terms.</p>
                  <l>Though that a Heart is ſeen all on
a Fire,</l>
                  <l>And that it's ſecret Martyrdom is
ſure,</l>
                  <l>There ſtill remains to perfect the
Deſire,</l>
                  <l>The ſweet Delight, it to be beg'd
to Cure;</l>
                  <l>Which, when deferred, who can,
alas, endure!</l>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaldee</hi> did but too well know
the Vivacity of this ſo juſt Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which his Siſter made, in
Anſwer to <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Verſes;
and Prince <hi>Leon</hi> imagined, that
ſhe had made them at that very
Inſtant; <hi>Frederick</hi> alone, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
nothing of this Myſtery;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43299:24"/>
he was ſo poſſeſſed with his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs,
that nothing but the
Cauſe was capable of diverting it.
They approached him by little
and little, and the Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca</hi>
having ſome Indulgence for
his Siſter, whom he ſaw was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to love by her Star, was
willing to render her an Office
that he would have done himſelf,
if he had known what had paſſed
in the Heart of <hi>Frederick;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he dexterouſly drew
aſide <hi>Leon,</hi> though with terrible
Violences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camilla</hi> had immediately an
agreeable Tranſport to find her
ſelf alone with the Prince of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi>
but he made but ill Returns,
and ſhe maintained much better
the Character of a Miſtreſs, than
he of a Gallant. His Eyes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> and purſued him by
languiſhing Looks, which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43299:24"/>
to draw the Prince of
<hi>Majorca</hi> to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Leon</hi> was ever
caſting his Eyes towards <hi>Camilla,</hi>
who took little Notice of his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Actions: neither knew ſhe
what to think of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
and was upon the Point
of preventing what he ought to
have ſaid to her, and encourage
by her Kindneſs, that Lover whom
ſhe could only accuſe of too much
Circumſpection. Her Haughtineſs,
whereof Women have little when
they are in Love, would not have
been ſufficient to have made her
keep Meaſures; ſhe would have
ſpoken, if Prince <hi>Leon</hi> had not
had too much Tenderneſs for to
ſuffer hers to take it's Courſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become knowing in a ſhort
Time, he was eaſily inclined to
think that Love had a great ſhare
in their mute Converſation; and
believing that he had but too long
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43299:25"/>
permitted his Rival to enjoy what
he imagined to merit, as much as
he, his Return was ſomething
precipitated. This Incivility did
not at all amaze <hi>Amaldee,</hi> but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
did ſufficiently let him
know her Diſpleaſure, to hinder
him another Time from ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Interruptions, if Lovers
can be ever more circumſpect.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Frederick</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
at his being ſo happily freed
from ſo perplexed an Encounter,
yet he fell immediately into an
other of no leſs Intricacy. <hi>Yolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
as we have already ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concealed in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> gave
him notice that ſame Evening of
her Arrival, conjuring him to
meet her in an Arbour, which her
Friend had judged proper for the
Aſſignation. <hi>Frederick</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to go thither, and knowing
the Afflictions of an ill-rewarded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43299:25"/>
Affection, he was not willing to
be the Occaſion of ſuffering them.
Well, Prince, ſaid <hi>Yolanda</hi> to
him, at his coming, are not you
full of Acknowledgment for the
Sentiments I have ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of you, and of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
your Abſence has given me.
<hi>Frederick</hi> by deceiving her agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
being willing to give a
Looſe to his own Paſſion, made
Anſwer, Yes, my dear <hi>Yolanda,</hi>
I have been tormented ſince your
Abſence, by all the Cruelties of
Love; and I never knew what
Grief was, till after I had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Delight of ſeeing you.
He was going to continue, when
he heard at a little diſtance the
moſt lamentable ſhriek that can
be. <hi>Camilla,</hi> whom her ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
had conducted juſt to the
Place of the Rendevouz, which
was not far from her Apartment,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43299:26"/>
had heard the Princeſs's Voice,
and diſcovered a Rival, at a time
when ſhe was ſo tenderly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the ſole <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
ſhe was not able to ſupport
this Reverſe, and fell into a ſwoon
juſt at the place from whence the
Voice came: <hi>Frederick</hi> ran thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Yolanda</hi> withdrew, not
being in a condition to give help
to others, that might have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
her own Reputation, ſhe
only gave notice to her Friend
of what had paſſed, who came
thither in all haſte, tho however
too late. <hi>Berranger</hi>'s Daughter
had received, without knowing
it, that aſſiſtance from the moſt
cruel of her Perſecutors; he took
Water from a Fountain that was
hard by, and having ſprinkled
ſome of it upon her Face, he
made her eaſily come to her ſelf.
Perhaps that the Delight which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43299:26"/>
her heart, tho in deſpair, felt at
the approaches of the Perſon who
had rendred her ſenſible, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
very much towards the
making her recover the Uſe of
her Senſes; ſhe opened her Eyes,
and ſeeing her ſelf in the hands
of a Perſon who cauſed all her
trouble, Vexation ſeized her ſoul,
and following her firſt motion,
ſhe withdrew ſomething rudely,
and got to her Apartment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
turning towards him, who
had newly rendred her that good
Office, Where Love is outraged,
it often takes every thing for Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts.
In ſhort, the Princeſs, of
<hi>Sicily</hi> being left alone, with her
Mind full of its own Diſquiets,
ſhe made but a Moments reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon all theſe capricious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
which ſhe alſo did with
relation, that to her the like might
happen, What a Night did <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43299:27"/>
paſs! all the torments of
Jealouſie preſented themſelves to
her Imagination; and tho her
Choller had no Object to fix it
ſelf upon, ſhe entertained a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Deſigns, againſt whomſoever
it was that uſurped from her that
Heart which ſhe had thought her
ſelf in poſſeſſion of; then repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a ſudden, ſhe felt all thoſe
touching Motions that a generous
and an afflicted Soul can be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, How? ſaid ſhe, is my
Affection leſs violent for being
concealed? and ought it to be
ill rewarded for being produced
ſomething later than that, which
my Ungrateful is ſo fond of?
Mad that I am, added ſhe, Shall
I diſturb the Peace of two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
whom Heaven had united
before I dream'd of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd?
No, let us leave them to
enjoy all thoſe Delights which I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43299:27"/>
had vainly figured to my ſelf,
and let us not one moment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them through the compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Miſeries that I have drawn
upon my ſelf by having been too
credulous. All theſe doleful
thoughts kept her company as
long as the Night continued;
Day appeared before that her
Mind could find a moment of
Repoſe. <hi>Amaldee</hi> came, as he
often did, to ſee her in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and he having been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
cauſe of her Tears, at the
ſight of him ſhe could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
redoubling them. Ah! why
have you ſeduced me by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Appearance of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by the Prince of <hi>Sicily?</hi>
Why, by making me apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of his Tenderneſs, ſhould
you render it ſo dangerous to me?
Ah! continued ſhe, ſeeing he
made no Anſwer, Why did you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43299:28"/>
not keep that Silence that would
have ſpared me ſo many Tears?
Why did you pronounce that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Word by it's enchanting Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
—Heaven is my Witneſs,
interrupted <hi>Amaldee,</hi> that my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was to hinder you from
loving by—Alas! interrupted <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla,</hi>
haſtily, was that the way
to hinder me from loving, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me that I was beloved? Why
did you not rather tell me, as
was true, that he languiſhes for
another? It would have made me
ſigh; but I ſhould at leaſt have
avoided the mortal Troubles that
devour me. She thereupon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him all that ſhe had hear'd,
exagerating the thing as much as
her Paſſion could inſpire her, and
endeavouring to exhale her Grief
in Reproaches, ſhe was not able
to make an End. When Perſons
are ſomething recovered from their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43299:28"/>
firſt Tranſports, they aim at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eloquent, that they may at
leaſt make others ſhare with them
in their Misfortunes. But <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
judging that ſhe wanted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
left it her in ſome kind,
by leaving her Chamber, for ſhe
remained as motion-leſs after his
departure, and found her ſelf in
that condition wherein we have
already repreſented the Princeſs
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who by lying under
the heavieſt Oppreſſions, enjoyed
ſome kind of Tranquillity, and
ſome time after ſhe fell very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
ill.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, Prince <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin</hi>
having got ſome intelligence
of his Bride's being caſt away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he came
thither <hi>incognito</hi> to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the truth. The Shipwrack
of his Miſtris had ſo dejected and
penetrated him with ſo lively a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43299:29"/>
grief, that he was not to be
known. The firſt Object that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it ſelf to his Eyes was <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
who was thinking of the
means to free his Siſter out of
the Abyſs of Deſpair wherein he
ſaw her plunged. The Prince of
<hi>Majorca</hi> was at firſt ſurprized to
ſee <hi>Ardalin</hi> in the Territories of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and was hardly able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
from it, by reaſon of the
change that Affliction had wrought
in his Countenance, inſomuch
that he only anſwered with a
ſigh, when <hi>Ardalin</hi> made enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
after <hi>Camilla.</hi> This ſigh coſt
the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna</hi> many
more. He no longer doubted, but
that his Princeſs had been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the Waves, and
being pierced to the quick by ſo
fatal a Thought; Speak, ſaid he,
Prince, ſpeak, and no longer
conceal from me a loſs which I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43299:29"/>
ought not to ſurvive. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
knowing that an Infidelity is the
moſt afflicting thing that can be
told a Lover, was in no haſte to
undeceive him; but being at
length preſſed to make Anſwer,
ſhe lives, ſaid he to him, but ask
me nothing more concerning her,
and would to Heaven you may
never be informed of the reſt.
Theſe Words, though the latter
part of them were capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
terrible Suſpicions, failed
not to calm the Soul of <hi>Ardalin;</hi>
and not penetrating the Motive
of that Sadneſs, he ſuſpended his
own, upon learning that he ſhould
again ſee <hi>Camilla;</hi> and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from the Fright he had
been in for her Life, all the reſt
ſeemed ſweet and eaſie. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
acquainted him in few Words,
with all that had happened to
them, except what he ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43299:30"/>
to have known. He gave him
notice not to diſcover them, and
as for himſelf, having but a ſmall
Train, he would hardly be known
for the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna.</hi> They
came at length, to the Palace
where the whole Diſcourſe was
of <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Sickneſs: That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
after having been brought
out of a Lethargy, had made ſuch
powerful Efforts to cure her
Heart, that her Body had fallen
under the weight of them. She
was taken with ſo violent a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that from the Beginning, they
were apprehenſive of the Iſſue:
However, <hi>Ardalin</hi> went with
<hi>Amaldee</hi> to <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Apartment.
How great was the Aſtoniſhment
of the Princeſs, at that unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sight! The Remorſe of having
neglected a Huſband who left all
to come and ſeek her, the Shame
of having betrayed him for a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43299:30"/>
Perſon, who triumphed, perhaps,
in her Sufferings, and may be
boaſted of them to her Rival, put
her into a ſtrange Confuſion. As
<hi>Amaldee</hi> would have prepared her
for <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s Arrival, whom ſhe
had but too well known, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
him; and addreſſing
her Speech to the Count of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi>
From whence come you,
Prince, ſaid ſhe to him, and what
makes you take ſuch Care of a
Wretch, whom Heaven has but too
much abandoned? Ah! Madam,
ſaid that Prince to her, it is too
juſt to let ſo extraordinary a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
languiſh any longer, you may
hope all manner of Happineſs from
it's Juſtice, and thereupon, <hi>Leon</hi>
entred the Room, who came to
inform himſelf of the Princeſſes
Health: his Preſence, which at
other times ſhe thought a Trouble,
was pleaſing in this Occaſion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43299:31"/>
ſince it interrupted a Converſation
that made her very uneaſie. She
gave her Brother to underſtand
by a Sign, that ſhe ſhould take it
for a Favour to be left alone;
which Prince <hi>Leon</hi> comprehending,
he went firſt away, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any other Reflection than what
his Miſtriſſes Sickneſs in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſed,
which poſſeſſed all his Thoughts.
<hi>Amaldee</hi> dragg'd likewiſe away
the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> who
without knowing all his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
had however enough to
put an end to his Days. <hi>Leon</hi>
was no leſs to be pityed than <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin;
Camilla,</hi> during the time
her Fever laſted, could hardly
ſuffer that he ſhould come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf of the Condition ſhe
was in, that ſhe might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to receive any Viſits, nor
to ſee him whom ſhe had but too
much ſeen for her Repoſe; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43299:31"/>
that <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Abſence
being as dangerous a Misfortune
as all thoſe ſhe already lay under,
it brought her almoſt to the laſt
Gaſp. The Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> was
likewiſe languiſhing, by Reaſon
of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Affliction, in whom
ſhe could not ſuffer that Sadneſs
for any other than her ſelf. In
ſhort, there was nothing but
Lamentation in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and one
would have ſaid, that Love reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himſelf on the Princeſſes Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe:
But <hi>Camilla</hi> was yet much
more to be pityed, the frequent
fainting Fits that her too much
oppreſſed Heart did bring her in,
made her imagine, that ſhe ſhould
quickly find a favourable Death.</p>
                  <p>One day, after coming out of
a cold Sweat, which ſhe believed
the Fore-runner of her End, ſhe
ſent for her Brother, and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and having made them ſit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43299:32"/>
on her Bed-ſide, Prince, ſaid ſhe,
looking upon <hi>Ardalin,</hi> it is no
longer time to diſguiſe any thing,
I will ſpare you the Regret that
you would have for the Loſs of
me, by defacing my ſelf out of
your Memory, too happy! if the
Confeſſion of my Weakneſſes do
not render it odious to you. I am
no longer that ſevere <hi>Camilla</hi> who
made a Scruple of proceeding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Eſteem for a Prince,
who was to have been her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
I have felt the moſt lively
Sentiments of Love, if I may ſo
ſay, for an other than your ſelf,
but Care has been taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
you on my Ingratitude, by
having my Affection deſpiſed.
Farewel, ſaid ſhe to him, forget
me if you can, and pardon me
my Errors. I pardon you them,
Divine Princeſs, ſaid <hi>Ardalin,</hi> I
know the Fatality of the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43299:32"/>
which forces us to love, but
I cannot pardon my ſelf for not
having known how to gain your
Affection; my Heart is without
doubt, irritated, to find that you
refuſe it that Tenderneſs which
you are capable of; but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my ſelf, and I alone ought
to expiate the Crime of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been able to pleaſe you. At
this ſad Thought he fainted away,
and loſt with all his Senſes, that
of the Infidelity of his Miſtriſs;
but they brought him to himſelf
by the help of Remedies, which
made him enjoy ſtill, for ſome
Moments, all the Malignity of his
Fate, The Alarums he had had
for <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Life, whom he had
believed to have been ſwallowed
up by the Waves, and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of her Change, penetrated
him with ſo lively a Grief, that it
is no Wonder, if he fell under the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43299:33"/>
weight of it in that ſo fatal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Violence of the
Motions of his Soul was ſo great,
that the Wound he had received
did re-open in that Inſtant: he
did not perceive that his Spirits
diſſipated; and indeed, he was
wounded in a more ſenſible part.
Ah! Princeſs, ſaid he to her, I am
ſenſible, that your Indifference
does abridge a Life that I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to you, and which has not
been ſo happy as to pleaſe you:
I dye; and may it pleaſe the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of Love to content it ſelf with
my Life, and not extend it's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon the Days of ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
a Princeſs. It is ſufficient,
that I ſacrifice mine to it, which
was wholly yours; but let at leaſt,
my laſt Sigh draw ſome from you,
at leaſt, let them be out of Pity,
and do not refuſe them to a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
who ready to expire, out of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43299:33"/>
Tenderneſs, demands of you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe: after he had ſpoken
theſe Words, a mortal Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurpriſed him; his Eyes fixed
upon <hi>Camilla,</hi> ſhewed ſtill, by
their dying Looks, all the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
imaginable, and cauſed a
Torrent of Tears to guſh out
from thoſe of that deſolate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<hi>Amaldee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> endeavoured to
ſuccour <hi>Ardalin,</hi> and to recal his
Spirits which had entirely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him. The Rumour of all
that paſſed was quickly ſpread
about; one of the Princeſſes
Maids could not forbear blaming
<hi>Frederick</hi> openly; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
came thither as well as others,
and mixing his particular Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
with thoſe of the publick,
he was willing to try, if he could
at the ſame Time change the Face
of things. <hi>Camilla</hi> ſeeing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of ſo many Miſeries, was not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43299:34"/>
able to ſupport the Sight of him,
and turned her ſelf on the other
ſide. <hi>Frederick</hi> obſerving that
Action, came and caſt himſelf at
her Feet, and following his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Propenſity, made her remark
ſo much Paſſion in his Eyes, that
<hi>Camilla,</hi> notwithſtanding her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
did quickly perceive it.
What would you have, Prince,
ſaid ſhe to him with a low Voice?
Ah! Madam, how late is it to
declare my ſelf, ſaid the tender
<hi>Frederick</hi> to her; I love, but alas!
I could never have reſolved to
have let you know it till this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
Ah! Prince, ſaid ſhe to
him, do not conſtrain your ſelf;
the too certain Knowledge I have
of the Sentiments you have for an
other, has brought me into this
Condition; but I loſe it with my
Life. Ah! Madam, cryed <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
I atteſt Heaven, that I have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43299:34"/>
no Sentiments prejudicial to what
I owe you, and you will one day
ſee that I am only unhappy. Theſe
Words, which ſo eaſily inſinuated
themſelves into her Soul, made her
ſigh; and thinking of what ſhe
owed the Prince of <hi>Barcelonna,</hi>
withdraw, ſaid ſhe to him, with
ſome Difficulty, withdraw, and
leave me to die leſs criminal, if
I cannot die altogether inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, <hi>Ardalin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come again to himſelf, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a new Vigour from the Sight
of the Prince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whom he
then knew for his Rival, he uſed
all his Efforts to ſpeak, but not
being able to do ſo, he melted
the Hearts of all thoſe who ſaw
him. His Gaſpings re-doubling,
the Company perceived that he
was ready to breath his laſt; and
having made them comprehend by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43299:35"/>
moſt moving Demonſtrations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
that he had a Deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Princeſs, they brought
him to her Bed-ſide: whereupon,
his Forces returned to him when
he was upon the Point of loſing
them for ever; and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi> live,
ſaid he to them, happy Lovers, ſo
beautiful a Princeſs could only be
born for ſo accompliſhed a Prince.
I am not at all aſhamed to yield
to a Rival, who excells me by ſo
many Advantages, and whom I
can only ſurpaſs by my Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
At theſe Words, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
his Mouth upon <hi>Camilla</hi>'s
Hands, he ſeemed inſeparable
from that afflicted Perſon, and
his Soul being detained by that
Pleaſure, had all the Difficulty
imaginable to fly away. Thus
Love terminated the Days of a
Prince, who by the Greatneſs of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43299:35"/>
his Paſſion ought to have been
reſerved for a better Deſtiny: So
ſad a Spectacle put all the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
into a Conſternation, and
their gloomy Silence was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by the lamentable Cries
of <hi>Camilla;</hi> they cauſed his Corps
to be removed, who occaſioned
all this Sadneſs: he ſeemed ſtill
animated by his Love and his
greedy Looks, which appeared
not altogether extinguiſhed, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if they could never be ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with ſeeing what he had ſo
much loved.</p>
                  <p>During all this Confuſion, they
had forgot to diſſemble; <hi>Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s
Attendants Train diſcovered
him by their Regrets for the
Prince of <hi>Barcelonna;</hi> and <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
and <hi>Camilla</hi> were likewiſe
known to be the Children of
King <hi>Berranger,</hi> though they did
not expect to be diſcovered. They
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43299:36"/>
could not have choſen a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Moment; for, Peoples
Minds were altogether diſpoſed
to Pity, there was no Room for
Hatred: and the King continued
to them the ſame Kindneſs he had
already afforded them, as he only
conſidered them by themſelves;
he did not change the Sentiments
he had of them, though they had
changed their Names as to him.
But, the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> was
over-joyed to hear that <hi>Amaldee</hi>
and <hi>Camilla</hi> were only Brother
and Siſter, and filling her Soul
with the ſoft Motions which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the place of the cruel
Suſpicions that had agitated her,
her Tenderneſs was thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
augmented. If ſhe found
in him the Son of <hi>Menfroy</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
a Prince for whom ſhe was
forced to that ſo ſingular Diſguiſe,
in ſhort, one who ought never to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43299:36"/>
wear the Crown of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſhe
found in Recompence, a Prince
full of Charms, a Prince who
might be engaged in her Favour;
ſhe no longer found a Rival; and
that Obſtacle being removed, did
ſufficiently make amends for all
that might be contrary to her:
Thus being in Repoſe, as to her
Lover, ſhe was no longer diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted
about obtaining him for
her Husband. <hi>Ardalin</hi>'s Body
was ſent back to <hi>Barcelonna,</hi> with
all the Magnificence that became
him and <hi>Menfroy:</hi> And a Poet
made his Epitaph; which is as
follows.</p>
                  <l>Within this Tomb Fidelity is laid,</l>
                  <l>With the kind Lover who Nature's
Debt hath paid;</l>
                  <l>Henceforth, like him few Lovers
will be ſeen,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:43299:37"/>
And, in my mind, Heaven has too
cruel been,</l>
                  <l>Who dy'd for Love, deſerv'd here
to have ſtai'd.</l>
                  <p>Nothing could recover <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi>
and though Remedies had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
her Fever, yet her Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was as bad as all Diſeaſes.
<hi>Leon</hi> having been Witneſs of all
that had paſſed between <hi>Camilla</hi>
and <hi>Frederick,</hi> all the aſſurances
he receiv'd from this Prince were
not capable of ſatisfying him. He
could in no wiſe comprehend
the important Myſtery he was to
expect the iſſue of. Beſides, this
Princeſs was in love with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which was ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of all Repoſe. <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
whoſe Heart was free from any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
was continually repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in his memory the Events
that had newly happened. All
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43299:37"/>
his mind was full of the ſhade of
<hi>Ardalin,</hi> and all his Actions
ſhew'd him very Melancholy. As
he often did walk all alone, the
Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> did the ſame
through another motive, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they often met, but
never joyned company; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's
Paſſion rendring her fearful,
made her avoid the Perſon whom
her Heart ſought with too much
eagerneſs, and he either took no
notice of it, or was not very
earneſt to ask her the reaſon.
However, one day, as <hi>Frederick</hi>
was paſſing by him, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to ſee him; Lovers are
very ſalvage, ſaid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him
laughing, and I think my ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happy in having my heart of
a more obdurate temper than
yours; after what I know of
Love, I would not for any thing
make the Experience of it, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43299:38"/>
will neglect, as much as poſſible,
thoſe Beauties who excite ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
an application; and ſince we
ought to ſacrifice all our thoughts
to what we love, I am reſolved
never to love any thing. The
Princeſs, who was ſtrangely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with this Diſcourſe, made
him however an anſwer with
ſomething a ſcornful tone; Well,
keep to that indifference you find
ſo very charming. She had not
the power to ſay any thing more,
but went away very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.
And <hi>Amaldee</hi> ſeeing <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
depart after that manner,
was ſomething diſſatisfied; and,
not believing he had offended
him, he made Reflection upon all
his reſerved and unhandſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
and found in his way of
living with him, ſomething very
particular, which he could only
take for the Effect of ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43299:38"/>
Antipathy. He admired how
a Perſon could love the Siſter,
whoſe Brother he ſo much hated,
but reſolved, however, to ſerve
him both in his Hatred and
his Amour. He wrote to the
King his Father, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to melt him by the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
that had been done them, he
propoſed to him a Match between
<hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſaying,
that it ſeemed as if Heaven had
already aſſembled their Hearts for
the uniting their Families for ever,
and adding, that <hi>Menfroy</hi> would
not oppoſe it; that the Kindneſs
he had for his Son, would make
him paſs over all manner of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts;
that this King was of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Nature; and that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he would make the leaſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
towards an Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a Peace would quickly be
concluded. This Letter had not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43299:39"/>
all the Succeſs it ought to have
had, as will be made appear in
the Sequel.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Amaldee</hi> not
being capable of hating <hi>Frederick,</hi>
avoided him however, for fear
his Preſence ſhould prove trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.
Some Days after the
Converſation that had ſeparated
them, they met in ſuch another
Conjuncture; it was nice, <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
ſtept back, and <hi>Frederick</hi>
ſighed to ſee that <hi>Amaldee</hi> retired
firſt; a Sigh is not to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
<hi>I hate you;</hi> however, that
Sigh made the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi>
think ſo: But, <hi>Frederick</hi> in his
Turn, could not comprehend the
Cauſe why he ſhould ſo ſhun his
Company; thus they were both
deceived by very contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
If <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Indifference
made him take for Hatred what
was nothing leſs, the Tenderneſs
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43299:39"/>
of the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
believed what ſhe apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
made her likewiſe take for
Contempt, what was very far from
it; for, though ſhe did not appear
under the Figure of a Lover, that
did not hinder her from being ſo;
and if Neglect ought not to have
directly offended her Paſſion, yet
ſhe failed not to be wounded by
the Effects, which the Intention
did not ſufficiently juſtifie with
her. Alas! ſaid that Princeſs,
Why does he not find himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to love me, though his Reaſon
does oppoſe it? I find, I love him
without the Conſent of mine; but
he is far from being under ſuch
Circumſtances; Why has not he
more penetrating Eyes, and why
cannot he diſtinguiſh the Heart
of a Miſtriſs under the Figure of
a Lover? The languiſhing of my
Eyes, ought, methinks, to have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43299:40"/>
unravelled to him this Miſtery, but
his were not willing to ſee it, or
if they did, they have deſpiſed
the Diſcovery. The Figure of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
is it ſo contemptible, that
it has not yet been capable of
making a Friend of <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
ſince the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> dares
not make him her Lover? And
not daring to entertain any hopes
for her ſelf, muſt ſhe needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to wiſh ſome Reſpects for
<hi>Frederick,</hi> whom <hi>Amaldee</hi> takes
ſo much care to avoid. As Love
is addicted to making Verſes, and
that Poetry entertains and charms
our Amorous Thoughts, ſhe fell
to making an Elegy, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
many other Diſorders.
The Princeſs of <hi>Majorca</hi> began to
leave her Chamber, and <hi>Frederick,</hi>
who through the Conformity of
their Deſtiny, and the reſemblance
ſhe had with <hi>Amaldee,</hi> afforded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43299:40"/>
her a great deal of Complaiſance,
accompanied her the firſt day ſhe
went abroad, after a very melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Converſation. <hi>Camilla,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Prince carry himſelf with
ſo much kindneſs, began to forget
the loſs of <hi>Ardalin,</hi> inſomuch that
having thought ſome moments, ſhe
asked him for his Table-book,
wherein ſhe wrote theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Verſes, ſhe had newly made.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>In vain one lately dead my Heart
did claim,</l>
                     <l>And yet another with Love it now
has fill'd,</l>
                     <l>But when with him for whom our
Breaſt does flame,</l>
                     <l>We ſtraight forget whom Cruelty has
kill'd.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This was ſomething to inſult
the Memory of <hi>Ardalin,</hi> but the
leaſt reaſonable Sentiments are the
moſt meritorious in Love; <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:43299:41"/>
anſwered them at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
by the four following,
whoſe Equivocation failed not
to be interpreted by <hi>Camilla</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he deſigned.</p>
                  <l>You ſigh, alas! but reging is my
ſmart,</l>
                  <l>My Soul being charm'd, has more

                  <l>You have the Features of what
wounds my Heart,</l>
                  <l>But what is that to One, like me,
inſpir'd?</l>
                  <p>The Princeſs ſmiled at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and ſeem'd very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
but <hi>Frederick</hi> taking out
his Table-book, drew out with
it, and let fall a Paper, which
was preſently taken up by the
curious <hi>Camilla,</hi> without <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s
knowledge: She ſtay'd ſtill
ſome moments with him, which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43299:41"/>
ſeem'd but too long to her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience;
inſomuch that having
taken a handſome pretext to leave
him, ſhe went to her Chamber
to read the Paper ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up. You may judge of her
Thoughts at the peruſal of this
Elegy.</p>

                  <p>Spight ſeized her Soul at the
reading of this; and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who was juſt come
in to entertain her with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
kind things, as the moſt
treacherous of all men; her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
produced, in that Inſtant, a
quite contrary Effect from what
the former had done; it reſtored
her all her Spirits through the
Ardour of Revenge. However,
ſhe was in a very great Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Beauty, who had
deprived her of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Heart,
did put her to a terrible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43299:44"/>
and thinking to hate <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
ſhe did not perceive that
ſhe hated all the Ladies of the
Court, for fear of not hating her,
who put her to that Torment.
There was not one that did not
give her a ſecret Pain; ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and feared at the ſame time to
find what ſhe ſought; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Elegy to all the Ladies,
confeſs, ſaid ſhe to them, after a
rallying manner, confeſs that you
are very happy in having inſpired
ſuch delicate Sentiments in ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
a Prince as <hi>Frederick:</hi> Then
thinking to read in their Eyes
what they had in their Souls, ſhe
examined them with the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
Attention in the World. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
read the Elegy, without
finding themſelves concerned
therein; they had all been ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to receive <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Flames,
that not one of them could make
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43299:44"/>
the Application to her ſelf of the
Complaints it contained. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
began to breath again, and
recovered by Degrees from the
Apprehenſions ſhe had had. When
the Lord High Admiral's Wife, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Elegy with ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
began firſt to ſmile, then
a Bluſh, which came into her Face,
giving <hi>Camilla</hi> to underſtand, that
ſhe ought to fix her Jealouſie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her; Madam, ſaid ſhe to her,
your diſguſting Haughtineſs for
any other Lover, gives you a
Prince wearied with Sighs; but
have a Care, if I am not deceived,
your Ladiſhip will not long main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Character; for, I have
obſerved in your firſt Motions,
ſomething ſo far from Cruelty,
that if the Sequel be anſwerable
to this Beginning, I am very much
afraid, that that Severity, which
you have had during <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43299:45"/>
Indifference, will end with it:
However, follow my Counſel,
continue your Severity, if you are
deſirous that a Paſſion ſhould laſt
which it has produced. You are
in the right, ſaid the Admiral's
Lady to her, riſing to be gone:
The Princeſs was ſtung to the
Quick, both at the Anſwer, and
her uncivil Departure. They all
retired thereupon, every one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
after their own manner,
upon the capricious Choice of
<hi>Frederick. Yolanda</hi> was quickly
informed hereof, by the means of
her Friend; and, by the order
ſhe had to return to Court, her
Mother-in-Law having made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the Elegy, found
that it admirably well ſuted with
her Circumſtances. The little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
ſhe had had for a Prince her
Lover, could only paſs with her
for Contempts; ſo much Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43299:45"/>
on his part, could only be
for a Woman, who had too much
out-raged him to love her without
Shame; and what confirmed this,
was the Name of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> which
the Princeſs durſt not write at
length; which being very like
her own, (ſhe being called <hi>Amedee)</hi>
did fully confirm her in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Any other than one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
would never have unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
that trembling and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Character; but, what does
not Love do when it goes about
it? Inſomuch, that being aſſured
of that Heart which <hi>Yolanda</hi> had
vainly imagined that ſhe poſſeſſed,
ſhe was very willing to have her
for a Witneſs of her Happineſs.
The Vexation of a Rival is a great
Satisfaction to a Lover, who tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
with great Delight, over
one ſhe had had any Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of. What a Diſappointment
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43299:46"/>
to <hi>Yolanda,</hi> to return to Court
for the Infidelity of a Prince, when
her too great Facility had drove
her from thence; but ſhe muſt
obey, which ſhe the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did, that ſhe might clear a Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
that could hardly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Mind. She thought her
Mother-in-Law very unfit to uſurp
a Heart which <hi>Camilla</hi> had not
been able to make a Conqueſt of;
for, her Friend had heard one ſay,
that <hi>Frederick</hi> had aſſured, that
<hi>Camilla</hi> was not the Perſon whom
he moſt paſſionately loved; but,
that there was another, for whom
he ſhould ſigh as long as he lived.
<hi>Yolanda</hi> had ſome Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Conſtancy of the Prince
herein, being deceived by the
Relation that theſe Words had,
with the good Opinion ſhe had
of her ſelf touching <hi>Frederick.</hi> In
ſhort, being returned to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43299:46"/>
ſhe found her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
of that ſevere and ſalvage
Air, which Women quickly lay
aſide, when they have a Lover
who pleaſes them; ſhe took upon
her the Air gallant, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelf in ſecret, with having
loſt by her little Underſtanding in
Love, thoſe Moments which ſhe
might have ſpent with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
had ſhe known <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
Inclination; ſhe had a Mind to
recall them, and was contriving
how to embolden him whom ſhe
had rendred fearful by her too
great Severity, and thought good
to open the way her ſelf to his
Purſuit. Knowing that he often
walked all alone, ſhe deſigned
to meet him in his Paſſage, which
ſhe accordingly performed, the
ſame Day. <hi>Frederick</hi> had ſtol'n
from the Crowd, and leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of his Hands, let ſome
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43299:47"/>
Tears tricle down his Cheeks,
which the amorous <hi>Sicilian</hi>
thought worthy of her Pity; ſhe
approached him ſoftly, and told
him, bluſhing, alas! Prince, is
there no way to put an end to
Sufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which afflict all the
Court; Joy dares no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
there, ſince you have baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it from your ſelf: All our
Ladies are penetrated with the
Languiſhing which oppreſſes
their Prince. That Languiſhing,
anſwered he ſomething indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
ought not in any wiſe
to concern all the Ladies you
reproach me with, ſince the only
Perſon whom it ought to move
with Pity,—Proceed Prince,
ſaid ſhe to him, ſeeing that he
ſtopped there; I very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that ſome too ſevere
fair one does make you, fearful
of ill Succeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a Paſſion that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43299:47"/>
muſt needs, however, be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
But, Why do not you
ſpeak? There is not a Beauty
how haughty ſoever ſhe may be,
but would willingly ſhare with
you in all the Sentiments you
entertain of her. But, <hi>Frederick</hi>
made her no Reply, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
returned ſeveral Times to the
Charge, ſeeing ſhe made no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
and <hi>Frederick</hi> irritating
her by his too great Reſervedneſs,
ſhe quitted him with ſome kind
of Diſpleaſure.</p>

                  <p>IN the mean time, the Truce
was upon the point of being
at an end, <hi>Berranger</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
very ill the Propoſitions of
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> and the Commendations
he had given of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to return home with
all ſpeed, to ſhow if the <hi>Prince</hi>
of <hi>Majorca</hi> ought to ſpeak like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43299:50"/>
the Son of the King of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
This Prince, well fore-ſeeing after
what manner he ſhould be treated
by his Father, would not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be diſobedient, and beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Menfroy</hi> to give him the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to leave his Dominions, which
was granted him, with the ſame
facility that he was ſuffered to
come into them. They embraced
very affectionately, being charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with one another's Virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
From thence <hi>Amaldee</hi> went to <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>'s
Apartment, being to take
his leave of him; tho he had ſent
to inquire, if his Viſit would not
prove importunate, and that he
was prepared to receive it, yet
he was however diſordered at his
arrival. Be pleaſed to give me
leave, ſaid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you Thanks for all Your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
which I have very well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
notwithſtanding what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43299:50"/>
a Sentiment of Hatred may inſpire
you with againſt a Prince, whom
his misfortune has borne your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
At theſe words the Princeſs
was extremely troubled; ſhe
would have ſtifled ſome ſighs, but
that ſhe found impoſſible, and
her Confuſion was thereby ſo
much the more augmented. <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
not knowing what to think of
this, asked her the cauſe of her
Diſorder; this put her quite out
of Countenance, and though the
Habit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe wore did ſecure her
from the ſuſpicions that might
have been had of the truth, it
was ſufficient to be culpable in
her ſelf, to believe ſhe appeared
ſo to others. For though ſhe had
ſome thoughts of unboſoming her
ſelf, that Deſign did not continue
long, and her Severity did hinder
her from putting it in execution.
Leave me, Prince, ſaid ſhe ſadly to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43299:51"/>
him, and, if poſſible, give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to what you ſee. This was
certainly a great Miſtery to him,
and he went and related to his
Siſter all that had paſſed between
them. She thought ſhe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
it better than he did,
and imagined that it might be the
Remorſe of having betrayed the
Siſter, whoſe Brother treated him
with that Civility, and that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
without doubt would follow
it. This was ſufficient to overturn
all that had been projected againſt
him, and thereupon ſhe wrote him
a Letter, that might do more than
re-aſſure him. The Princeſs of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
received it, after having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
terrible Conflicts, having
accuſed her ſelf of weakneſs in
not having known how to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Prince of the averſion
ſhe was in no wiſe capable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
of him, for this was what
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43299:51"/>
ſhe moſt apprehended he would
believe. It is impoſſible for a
Perſon in Love to leave the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beloved in a Belief of being ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
She had judged very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her firſt Motion, that he would
know nothing more; and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
at all Adventures, to remove
the Impreſſion of what might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
him againſt her, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to what he might perhaps
one day know of the Courſe of
her Inclinations. Remaining fix'd
in this Deſign, ſhe enjoyed ſome
Repoſe, and read the Letter that
was brought her from <hi>Camilla,</hi>
which was conceived in theſe
Terms.</p>

                        <p>IT is very difficult for People to
keep up their Reſentments, when
they have once loſt their Hearts;
and ſince you have made a Conqueſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43299:52"/>
of mine, can it have any Motions
to your Diſadvantage? I am how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
very much aſhamed that I
have not been able to reſiſt either
your feigned Paſſion, or your real
Neglect. I ought, at leaſt, to have
given them the ſame Deſtiny; But,
alas! it lay not in my Power. I
ſhould find it much more eaſie, to
be inſenſible to your Ingratitude than
to all that ſpeaks in your Favour,
notwithſtanding I have found ſuch
ill Returns. Love me, or love me
not; you may do either, without
making me change my Sentiments:
But, will you miſuſe this Power?
And will you leave a Princeſs to
love alone, when you would find it
very delightful to love reciprocally?
But, I muſt explain my ſelf further
with you; to which Purpoſe, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you would meet me in the great
Alley that leads to the <hi>Oval.</hi>

                     <hi>Camilla</hi> did not expect that her
Letter ſhould have proved ſo

conducts the Pen; and ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
oppoſe the rapidity with
which it paints what the Heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
and dictates. <hi>Frederick</hi> was
making ſome Reflections upon
this Letter, when another was
brought him, and the Perſon who
delivered it vaniſhed at the
ſame inſtant, without expecting
any Anſwer; but it came from
the Admiral's Lady, and he found

Lovers are earneſt to make

that you do. A Paſſion is ever lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,

by a faint and gloomy fear, which
you perhaps take for Reſpect. But
you are therein deceived, Reſpect is
leſs ſalvage, He ſpeaks, and then he
is reſerved, but ſtill he has ſpoken:
he begins what finiſhes of it ſelf, and
how great a pleaſure is it for him
that loves, to have it thought ſo!
and for her who is beloved to think
it likewiſe, and to divine the reſt
of what has been told her by halfs!
If You love only me, You will eaſily
believe that it is only I who write to
You. However, for the greater ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

the Tenderneſs which poſſeſſed

                     <hi>Frederick</hi> did very much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that this Letter came from
<hi>Yolanda;</hi> he imagined that Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conducted him to the unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of ſo many Adventures; he
fancyed that theſe three Miſtriſſes
meeting at the ſame Randezvouz,
would free him by an Appearance
of Treachery, from all the real Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
they had plyed him
with: Inſomuch, that deſcending
into the Alley, he had hardly the
Leiſure to walk there a Moment,
before he ſaw them all three a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
He thought it ſtrange to
ſee them together: but the thing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43299:54"/>
happened in this manner; <hi>Yolanda</hi>
having placed her ſelf at a Window
which looked out upon the way
that was to be taken to go to the
Alley, waited therefor <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
Arrival; and having ſeen him paſs,
and immediately after him, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who walking with trembling
Steps, took the ſame way; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to prevent her enjoying a
Converſation with <hi>Frederick,</hi>
which ſhe had been too long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
it to leave it to others:
ſhe run thither with ſuch an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs,
that it was taken notice
of by her Mother-in-Law, who
had too great an Intereſt in her
Conduct not to follow her. Where
are you going, ſaid ſhe to her?
I ſee a certain Emotion in your
Countenance, that would make
me ſuſpect that ſome amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
had brought you hither, if
I knew not that after the Princes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43299:55"/>
ſo freſh Infidelity, you could not
be capable of a new Engagement.
And I, Madam, anſwered ſhe, with
a malicious Smile, I ſhould believe
that you ſuſpected me through ſome
intereſſed Motion, if I ſaw not the
Princeſs, whom you have more
Reaſon to fear than me. At that
Word, all Reply ceaſed, and they
walked inſenſibly after <hi>Camilla,</hi>
whom they overtook before ſhe
had entred the Alley; inſomuch
that being all three animated with
the ſame Spirit of Jealouſie, they
returned into an other, and never
parted till they had ſeen the Prince,
who, weary with waiting for them,
was gone, after he had ſeen them
take another way, and thought
his Intrigues at an end, without
himſelf being any ways concerned.
He fancyed, that their haughty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
had hindred them from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
either's Rival the leaſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43299:55"/>
of ſuſpecting their Deſign
or that the Severity of <hi>Amedee</hi>
whoſe Paſſion he had not yet taken
notice of, had reſtrained them; in
ſhort, not knowing to whom he
was indebted for his good Luck,
he reſolved to take Advantage of
it, and never to be with them alone,
but even to avoid the Companies
of all Women, that he might not
be troubled with any more of
their amorous Importunities: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he was miſtaken in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
as thoſe three Miſtreſſes
had been in thinking to deceive
each other. As each of them had
pretended not to have ſeen the
Prince, they all imagined in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that the Randezvouz had
been only for them; and all of
them applauding <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and their Addreſs in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they thought thereof,
ſo that there paſſed a very gallant
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43299:56"/>
Converſation between them, and
they parted with great Civilities.
<hi>Camilla</hi> was the moſt penſive, as
indeed ſhe had the moſt Reaſon
to be ſo; and that Occaſion being
loſt, was hardly to be recovered.
Her Brother was to depart the
next day, ſhe muſt either go with
him, or expoſe her ſelf to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Rage, or to the Slights of
her Lover, which was leſs eaſie
for her to ſupport. But, Love
ſtill wrought in her Favour; for,
the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> as we have
ſaid, who was willing to repair all
the Incivilities ſhe had done to
him whom ſhe ſo tenderly loved,
went to take her Leave of him;
but ſhe eaſily perceived, by the
Trouble ſhe was in at her firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into his Preſence, that it
would be difficult for her to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Deſigns ſhe had laid in
his Abſence. The firſt Civilities
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43299:56"/>
being over, which ſhe acquitted
herſelf of, with Gallantry enough,
ſhe was to proceed to ſomething
of more Concern, which perhaps
ſhe would have but very ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
ſhe already trembled, the
Fear of ſaying too much or too
little detained her for ſome time in
Silence, which was only ended by
the coming in of <hi>Camilla,</hi> which
both rejoyced and diſpleaſed her,
ſeeing that deferred, which ſhe
would willingly have ſaid, and
which ſhe ſo much apprehended to
ſay. <hi>Camilla</hi> had the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and perhaps they would not
have ſpoken, if <hi>Amaldee</hi> had not
opened the Converſation. Prince,
ſaid he to <hi>Frederick, You ſee a
Princeſs allarm'd at the Vſage ſhe
ſhall receive from an irritated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Ah!</hi> ſaid <hi>Camilla</hi> interrupting
him, <hi>I have but too well merited his
Diſpleaſure not to undergo the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43299:57"/>
of it with Reſignation. The
King is very unhappy,</hi> ſaid <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
to her, <hi>to ſee himſelf refuſed,
even in the Azyls that he is deſirous
to afford you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know how much I
am indebted to the King,</hi> ſaid ſhe
to him; <hi>but, the Prince of</hi> Sicily
<hi>would do too great a penance, ſhould
he ſee inceſſantly the Object of his
Hatred. Ah, Madam!</hi> interrupted
<hi>Frederick, What a Monſter would
the Prince of</hi> Sicily <hi>be! Ah!</hi> ſaid
<hi>Camilla,</hi> interrupting him again,
<hi>it was no ſmall Effect of Hatred,
that of pretending to love me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the
depriving me of a Happineſs, whoſe
leaſt</hi> Idea <hi>was ſufficient to ſurpriſe
me: See,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>ſhewing
him the Elegy, What a Delicacy for
a Prince, whoſe Flames are kindled
by Severities, and how does Love
over-turn the Order of all our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations!
It is this ſame Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
is to this point ſo tender and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive!</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43299:57"/>
In what Confuſion was
<hi>Frederick!</hi> His Paſſion was ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
painted in thoſe Verſes, the
Character of them was ſo tender,
that <hi>Amaldee</hi> was very much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
he was ſome time without
having the Power to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of a thing too true, but at length
made uſe of the Ambiguity for his
Plea in that Occaſion. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid
he, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Camilla,
I vow to you, once again, that all
that I love is here. Say no more,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<hi>Camilla,</hi> not doubting
but that it was of her, he ſpoke,
<hi>How ſweet do I find theſe Obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!
After having imagined to have
had ſo clear a Proſpect of my Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
leave me in my Error, if
you cannot draw me out of it, but at
the Expence of that Affection which I
ſo paſſionately purſue.</hi> After which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſhe quickly agreed to ſtay in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
fearing, with juſt Reaſon, the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43299:58"/>
Diſpleaſure of <hi>Berranger,</hi> who had
learn'd, with Indignation, the
Kindneſs ſhe had for the Prince
of <hi>Sicily;</hi> but, this was not enough,
<hi>Frederick</hi> had yet ſaid nothing in
his own Behalf, ſo that ſaluting
<hi>Amaldee,</hi> he looked upon him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tenderly, <hi>And you, Prince,</hi> ſaid
he to him, <hi>Will you ſtill believe that
I hate you? I know not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
to him likewiſe very tenderly,
<hi>All that I can ſay is that my Regret
is extream to leave you in a time
you are willing I ſhould believe you
do not.</hi> They were not able to ſay
any thing more, their Tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down reciprocally; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, the Prince of <hi>Majorca<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
felt that, I know not what, which
<hi>Frederick</hi> found ſtrange he had not
yet been ſenſible of. The Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he was to take his publick
Leave of the King, all the Court
was aſſembled, and <hi>Menfroy</hi> did
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43299:58"/>
ſhew the great Eſteem he had for
the Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> by all the
Careſſes he made him, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him once again; after which,
<hi>Amaldee</hi> made up to embrace <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
who retired ſome Paces;
but the King taking notice of that
Action, made him a Sign not to
diſcover himſelf, but to embrace
the Prince: whereupon, a great
Bluſh mounted into his Face, and
the Prince, when a reſpectuous
Sentiment did already reſtrain, did
advance without trembling; and if
notice had been taken of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
it would have been without
doubt ſurprizing. After this, <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
returned immediately unto the
King his Fathers Dominions, with
all the Violence of a Man, who
finds himſelf drawn elſewhere
without knowing what it was that
did ſo. He ſaw the King, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Expectations, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43299:59"/>
him like a diſobedient Son,
and who fell into a ſtrange Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt <hi>Camilla,</hi> accuſing her
of Treaſon, and vowing that he
would go and drag her from the
Arms of the triumphing <hi>Frederick.</hi>
Alas! How little did he merit that
Title, and under what Affliction
did he lie, through the Abſence of
<hi>Amaldee.</hi> This laſt Misfortune ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him inſupportable; he fell
ſick of a lingring Fever, which
ſheltred him from the Purſuits of
<hi>Yolanda</hi> and the Admirals Lady,
who could not agreed together:
Theſe two Rivals being almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in Company, envyed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Joy and Affliction. In ſhort,
being always at Enmity, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Yolanda</hi> went for her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
and that of her Mother-in-law
to remain at a Relations Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from whence ſhe ſent daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the Health of the Prince,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43299:59"/>
whom <hi>Camilla</hi> alone had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of viſiting. She came to
ſee him with the King, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that her Affection would ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later degenerate into Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and endeavoured already to
give Occaſion for the contracting
it between them. The Princeſs his
Daughter contributed thereto on
her part, and being deſirous to
expell Love from her own Heart,
ſhe no longer uſed any Terms that
are proper to it; and ſaid nothing
that might give Occaſion to any
ſuch Motions. The words of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
were the only ones in their
Mouths; and <hi>Camilla</hi> not caring,
tho Love appeared to her under
a borrowed Name, provided it was
ſtill the ſame in the Soul of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
did ſuffer it with great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
The Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi>
was at length cured of her Fever,
but ſhe was ſtill in a languiſhing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43299:60"/>
Condition; ſhe had obſerved ſo
melting a Sadneſs in <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s
Countenance at their parting, that
it re-doubled her own. But tho
that tender Trouble had afforded
her ſome Joy, yet it laſted not long,
and that Inſtant of Happineſs went
away ſo faſt, that it only helped
to render that Princeſs more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the Truce
being at an end, and <hi>Berranger</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a long time been preparing
a conſiderable Fleet, (his Son was
hardly returned) when for to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him for the Obſtacles he had
raiſed in his Deſigns, he ordered
him to take the Command and
Conduct of it. This was a cruel
Circumſtance, for him to bear
Arms againſt a King, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
had filled him with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and againſt a Prince, who
had inſenſibly diſarmed him of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43299:60"/>
certain natural Haughtineſs, which
was his only Defect. His budding
Paſſion, which he did not call by
that Name, did extreamly weaken
in him that which his Father would
have inſpired him with for that
War. Moreover, he found it ſo
unjuſt, that he proceeded to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Extremities, before he could
be brought to it: however, he at
Length yeilded, it being to no
purpoſe for him to oppoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of his Father, who for his
Obſtinacy inflicted the Puniſhment
on him, of going to lay waſt a
Countrey he had ſo much kindneſs
for, which indeed he looked upon
as ſo ſevere, that he could as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have been dragged to his
Grave. He could not forbear tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King, who recommended
to him the doing his Duty, <hi>If I
do it, you have Reaſon to fear the
Succeſs of your Enterpriſe.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43299:61"/>
Words making the King appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that he might favour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> he gave a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Charge to one of the Officers,
to have an Eye upon his Conduct,
and to give him an Account of all
his Actions, and told him, that
his Fortune ſhould anſwer for the
Diſobedience of his Son. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Amaldee</hi> embarqued for to
return to <hi>Sicily.</hi> He wiſhed that
a happy Ship-wrack would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
him from a Voyage ſo fatal
to his Repoſe and his Glory. He
had only the Name of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Chief, and it was that Name
that made him appear culpable
in the Eyes of the <hi>Sicilians.
Menfroy</hi> did very much ſuſpect
the Violence that was done him,
but <hi>Frederick</hi> was more difficult
to be perſuaded in that Caſe;
he thought it ſomething ſo ſevere,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43299:61"/>
to ſee him in Arms to attach him,
and which he would have done,
tho it had been only in his own
Defence againſt him, that he could
not find any Reaſon for his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Beſides, the Vexation
he had to ſee that apparently
he had never had him in his
Memory, while that he afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him all his Thoughts, did
very much contribute to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him entertain Reaſons of
Complaint in all he could have
done. Thus that Prince did not
appear, though he was effectually
innocent: No Body had heard
from him ſince his Departure from
<hi>Sicily,</hi> by the Care that <hi>Berranger</hi>
had taken to prevent it. This
very much ſurpriſed <hi>Camilla,</hi>
who knew not what to think
of it. <hi>Frederick</hi> had often let
her know, how much he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
with this Procedure; but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43299:62"/>
in ſuch paſſionate Terms, that ſhe
frequently reproached him with
having more Kindneſs for her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than for her. <hi>Since we are
retrenched to the Names of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to him one day, <hi>give
me that which you have for</hi> Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,
<hi>Why ſhould you make ſo diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
a Difference for me?
How ſatisfied ſhould I be, if I could
draw upon my ſelf a little of that
Diſpleaſure, which methinks is ſo
obliging: Do not You make Tryal
of that,</hi> ſaid he to her, ſomething
fainting. <hi>Alas!</hi> anſwered ſhe with
an extream Sadneſs, <hi>It is more for
my Intereſt than for Yours, which I
ought not to neglect, You love me ſo
little, though I love You, that ſhould
my Affection in the leaſt grow faint,
Yours would vaniſh in an inſtant.
But, I muſt confeſs, that it would be
in vain for me to endeavour to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
it; and I am ſenſible, that it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43299:62"/>
would be as impoſſible for me to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
your Diſpleaſure, as you to grant
me it. Ah!</hi> Frederick, <hi>either You
do no longer, or You never did love
me, my Paſſion is ever augmenting
and yours decreaſing.</hi> And indeed,
it is a great Diminiſhing in Love,
not to encreaſe. Beſides, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Majorca,</hi> in the beginning
of her Tenderneſs, had ſo often
wavered between the fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Rival, and the hopes of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
none, that thoſe tumultuous.
Sentiments did blind her as to thoſe
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and hindred her,
in ſome manner, from perceiving
their Faintneſs. But, when ſhe had
her mind free from any Jealouſie,
ſhe began to obſerve them with
more Exactneſs; and finding
them ſo little conformable to her
own, ſhe fell into a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more cruel than all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Griefs ſhe had lain under.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43299:63"/>
                     <hi>How!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I loſe</hi> Frederick,
<hi>and no body deprives me of him, I
loſe him by himſelf, and it is he
who refuſes to love me, tho he is
not in love with any other Women!
How happy was I, when I had no
reaſons of Complaint but againſt my
Rivals, I might accuſe my Star of
Misfortunes, I might accuſe their
Charms of forcing him to love, but
nothing ingages him; he prefers his
indifference before all the ſoftneſs I
might inſpire him with; he ſlights
me, and I can only blame him for
all the hard uſage. I receive from
him.</hi> But the diſeaſe was without
remedy, and inſupportable, they
all began to ſham one another in
<hi>Scicily,</hi> and <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s abſence
cauſed a Conſternation in the mind
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> which was ſhared
by all thoſe who had any concern
for him. He was ſo out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
that no Body durſt ſpeak
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43299:63"/>
to him: If he went out of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
it was to hide himſelf
in ſome lonely place where he was
inacceſſible. His Miſtreſſes would
ſeveral times have followed him to
his Retreats, but were ſtill hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by one another; they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
incommoded themſelves, and
through the conformity of their
Sentiments, they almoſt ever jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſame Deſigns: Thus was
he freed by all together, from each
of them in particular, and he found
himſelf leſs importuned by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
than if he had had but one.
However, tho they all perſued him
with an equal Paſſion, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Lady was the moſt happy to
find him alone; He ſhunned her
the leaſt, becauſe he did not know
that ſhe was his unknown Votary,
whom he wiſhed might be ſo to
him for ever; though he had ſeen
her often with <hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Yolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:43299:64"/>
in places where they came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his account, he had not taken
notice of it; he had ever looked
upon her to be too averſe to Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
for to entertain any ſuch
ſuſpicion, and imagined, when he
perceived a return of kindneſs in
her for him, after all the incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he had committed, that her
Husband had made her a Confident
of what he was. This thought
ſeemed to him ſo probable, that
he reſolved to make her his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.
It was requiſite he ſhould
have one: When we are happy,
we contain all our joy within us,
and can be without imparting it to
any Body; but when we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
we muſt neceſſarily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
one part of our grief by
confiding it in a Friend. He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Admirals Lady as a
very good Woman, imagined that
ſhe would willingly embrace all his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43299:64"/>
Sentiments; and as they had reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
the deſign of meeting, it
was not long before they did ſo.
One day <hi>Frederick</hi> went into an
Alley, where he found the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
Lady, they walked together
for a while, and after the firſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
which laſted but too long
in both their opinions, <hi>Frederick</hi>
began firſt a particular Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>I
have extreamly ſought an occaſion to
find you alone, and you have not
ſeemed to ſhun it; I give you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thanks for all your favours. I
have of late perceived a change in
your Carriage, which makes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you know ſomething of my
Secret.</hi> The <hi>Admiral</hi>'s Lady was
very much ſurpriſed at the change
of his reſpectful behaviour, and did
not take it well that ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with having ſo much
kindneſs, which ſhe had never
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43299:65"/>
dreamt ſhe was liable to. Her face
ſhewed her to be extreamly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and ſhe told him with ſome
kind of Anger, <hi>Methinks that you
ought not to abuſe what pity has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
me to do:</hi> And the diſorder
ſhe was in hindring her from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,
<hi>Frederick</hi> not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her diſpleaſure, told her, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I did not think that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
which ſhews the eſteem I have
for you, could have given you any
offence; but ſince it diſpleaſes you,
I ſhall ſay nothing more.</hi> The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Lady being mortally afraid
he ſhould hold his peace, told him
languiſhing; <hi>Speak, Prince, I will
lay aſide ſomething of my ſeverity,
ſince indeed I know but already too
much not to hear the reſt favourably.</hi>
The Princeſs was more and more
perplexed, and could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the meaning of that <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
and that <hi>favour</hi> which were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43299:65"/>
valued at that rate, and thinking
that ſhe herſelf was obliging in that
ſhe had choſen her to the prejudice
of any other, to honour her with
her Confidence, ſhe thought her
very fantaſtical. However the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhe had for One whom
ſhe might open her heart to, made
her paſs over all, and ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to tell her a thing which would
have produced terrible Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in that Conjuncture. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Lady would have proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Miſtery which muſt have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her with ſpight, and all the
meaſures that the King had taken
ſhould have been broken, if his
good fortune had not made him
ſend one of his Attendants to ſeek
out <hi>Frederick,</hi> to give him notice
that <hi>Berranger</hi>'s Fleet was coming
with full Sails under <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
The perſon who was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this Commiſſion, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43299:66"/>
it ſomething rudely. What a
ſurpriſe was this to the poor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs!
What conflicts did ſhe not
undergo! The ſlaughter and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
which ſhe repreſented to her
ſelf, might well have daunted a
young perſon; but nothing terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
her ſo much as the danger
whereto <hi>Amaldee</hi> was going to be
expoſed: She was no longer mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his ſlights, her greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
was to loſe him by his
death; and all Sentiments being
confounded in that, <hi>I muſt be gone,</hi>
ſaid ſhe ſadly, turning towards the
Admiral's Lady, <hi>tho I have not yet,
Madam, unboſomed to You my
thoughts. I know enough, Prince,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to him, ſhedding ſome tears
which <hi>Frederick</hi> found very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and for which he thanked her
by a ſign of his Head, which ſhe
found more obliging than all he
could have ſaid. Whereupon he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43299:66"/>
went away to the King, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him in his Cabinet. He
had a mind to be alone with his
Daughter, whom he ſaw very much
alarum'd, which did not at all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
him, and interpreting her
timidity like a good Father, he
was long in ſuſpence if he ſhould
ſuffer her to be expoſed to the
dangers of a Sea-fight. It was
however requiſite to continue a
Fiction that paſſed for a Truth,
and was ſo important to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of his People; Thus he found
no reaſon that could diſpenſe his
Daughter from paſſing for his Son
in the War, ſince ſhe had ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
under that name at Court:
Wherefore he deſired her with tears
in his eyes to preſerve her ſelf, and
to be more mindful of what ſhe
was, than of what ſhe ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
<hi>Why do not You incourage
me better,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, being
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43299:67"/>
charmed with the kindneſs he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, <hi>it will be but too eaſie for
me to appear what I am, and I
ought at leaſt to ſeem</hi> Frederick <hi>in ſo
great an Occaſion, though I belie that
name in my own Soul. Ah! my
dear Daughter, be careful only of the
Princeſs of</hi> Sicily; Frederick <hi>will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be well enough preſerved.</hi> They
parted, being both full of all the
Events which they foreſaw. But
<hi>Camilla</hi> having had notice of all
that paſſed, was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
Her Brother and her Lover
were going to engage, and ſhe
ſaw afflictions falling upon her,
what ſide ſoever Fortune ſhould
favour. She went to <hi>Menfroy,</hi> and
asked him pardon for the Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of her Brother: That good
King was altogether diſpoſed to
excuſe him; they eaſily believed,
knowing him as they did, that he
muſt be under a great Conſtraint,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43299:67"/>
and rather pitied than blamed
him. All things were made ready,
and <hi>Menfroy</hi>'s Fleet being equal,
or indeed rather ſtronger than that
of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he reſolved to go out
and prevent his Enemies Attack:
Beſides confiding in the juſtice
of his Arms, and in the good luck
which had never abandoned him,
he ſent a Herald to the Prince of
<hi>Majorca,</hi> for the chooſing a day
fitting to decide their quarrel.
<hi>Menfroy</hi> choſe rather to hazard an
Engagement by Sea, than to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
his People by a long War,
which would have interrupted
their Commerce, inſomuch that
the day was appointed for the
Battel. <hi>Camilla</hi> had not of a
long time ſeen <hi>Frederick</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
there had paſſed ſome
kind of Coldneſs between them,
which eaſily happens when Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not reciprocal. As all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43299:68"/>
their Diſcourſe was now come to
be of indifferent things, ſhe took
an occaſion to ask him what he
thought of her Brother, and if his
procedure did not inſpire him
with a great averſion for all their
Family; for ſhe durſt no longer
tell him, that ſhe apprehended it
as to her own particular: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
ſaid he to her with a very
tender Air, <hi>You would eaſily know
my thoughts, if you knew me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better:</hi> This was ſufficient to
engage her to an Explication,
which ſhe had ſo much deſired.
It is eaſie to judge that they then
were reconciled; Quarrels ſeldom
laſt long when there is a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on both ſides to put an end
to them, and when we once come
to clear Suſpicions, we often end
by Juſtifications. Thus <hi>Frederick,</hi>
before he departed made his Peace
with all his Miſtreſſes. <hi>Yolanda</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:43299:68"/>
alone had not an opportunity of
ſpeaking with him; but ſhe
thought of him the more, and
fancied that he thought no leſs
of her; and indeed, never did
Miſtreſs ſo much rely upon the
Faith of her Inclination. It gave
her ſo great a tranquility as to
<hi>Frederick,</hi> that an Infidelity on
his part would never have ſeemed
probable to her. Hereupon he
went on Board his Ship, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncertain what he was to do;
and <hi>Menfroy</hi> having embraced him
with a tenderneſs that ſeemed a
fore-knowledge of ſome Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
they ſeparated, the King
leaving him the Command of one
of the Squadrons of his Fleet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of the Admiral,
and he himſelf Commanding in
Chief over the whole, boar up in
all diligence againſt <hi>Amaldee:</hi>
When this Prince, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43299:69"/>
him in good order, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him, he ſent at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
one of his moſt conſiderable
Officers in a Pinnace, for to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
to him the <hi>great</hi> regret he
had to appear in that Equipage,
and to ſhow ſo much ingratitude
in appearance, tho he was only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in effect. <hi>Menfroy</hi> ſent him
a generous Anſwer, That he was
not at all ſurpriſed that he obeyed
the Orders of his Father, and that
the Actions could not be Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
when the Intention is Innocent.
Thereupon he ſent him back; and
thoſe two Princes thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but of doing their duty.
The Engagement was very bloody
on both ſides; the principal Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Fleet put a
great part of that of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diſorder, who coming to rally
and ſecond them with the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
which he commanded in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43299:69"/>
He found <hi>Menfroy</hi> in the
Head of them, and was willing to
ſhun him; and the King of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
being unwilling to attack him
out of the ſame motive, turned his
Fury upon the reſt of the Enemies
Fleet, the greateſt part whereof
he took and ſunk; and after five
or ſix hours Engagement, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at longth a great Victory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame Fate that had always
attended him; but it coſt him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dear, ſince that <hi>Frederick</hi> and
the Admiral were not to be found
amongſt the Conquerors, inſomuch
that it was very much doubted,
whether <hi>Berranger</hi> or <hi>Menfroy</hi> had
received the greateſt loſs. The
thing happened in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaldee,</hi> as we have ſaid, being
deſirous to ſpare <hi>Menfroy,</hi> knew
not that in falling upon another
Squadron of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Fleet, he
attacked <hi>Frederick.</hi> The Admiral
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43299:70"/>
did his duty with great vigour;
but as they were bearing up ſo
near one another, as to diſcern
Objects, <hi>Frederick</hi> perceived the
Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> whoſe ſadneſs
ſeemed to attone for all the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he had given him; that ſight
put him into ſuch a trouble, that
he no longer knew what he did:
He was ſo little able to defend
himſelf againſt him, that he no
longer thought of defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt others: And <hi>Amaldee</hi>
fell likewiſe into ſo great a diſorder
that he ſeemed to Communicate it
to the reſt of his Fleet. But to
what an Extremity were they not
both reduced, when that the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi>
being animated by the death
of the Admiral, who had been
newly killed with an Arrow, they
grappled <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Ship, before
that thoſe two Princes had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated
what they were to do,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43299:70"/>
their Souldiers attacked one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Fury that did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
repair the weakneſs of their
Princes; and <hi>Frederick</hi> ſeeing
himſelf Maſter of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
by the Death of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
after having been in ſuſpence
ſome Moments about the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was to take, on a ſudden
repenting his Effeminacy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not knowing how to come
to any determination, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I know not what rage, which
forced him to enter with his
Sword drawn into <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Ship:
He remained in that Confuſion,
that <hi>Amaldee</hi> had time to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
himſelf from his firſt Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and preſenting him with his
Sword, <hi>Generous Prince,</hi> ſaid he
to him, <hi>Stab this perfidious heart,
that has not dared to follow it's
own Motions, and which could
not hinder me from doing an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43299:71"/>
unworthy of the eſteem I have
for you. Frederick</hi> was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with what he had done,
and with what he had ſeen the
Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> do, that giving
back he made a falſe ſtep, and had
like to have fallen into the Sea,
but <hi>Amaldee</hi> ſaved him, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
all other Cares, his whole
Thoughts were then full of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who intereſſed him under a
borrowed Name. He had taken
him by the hand, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſome Moments in that
Poſture, enjoying a certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
notwithſtanding all their
Agitations, which hindred them
from thinking even of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they were in. Then <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
diſingaging himſelf from
his Hands, told him faintly, <hi>Do
not ſuſpend the Effects of my Duty,
ſuffer me at leaſt to go to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of my Men. Alas!</hi> replyed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43299:71"/>
                     <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him, with an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
Grief, ſeeing that he was
going away, <hi>What Courſe muſt I
take to do my Devoir, and why do
we ſo obſtinately purſue War, when
our Hearts are in Peace? Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
was ſomething vexed that
he had given Occaſion to the
ſpeaking theſe laſt Words; and
for which, ſome of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſuffered, that the Prince of
<hi>Sicily</hi> might at leaſt revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on them, for the Paſſion their
Prince had inſpired him with;
inſomuch, that he fell upon them
with an extraordinary Fury, and
making his way through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Swords, the Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca</hi>
was in terrible Alarums for
his Life. He endeavoured to put
an end to the Fight; his Party had
the Advantage in that place,
where the better part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
was got together. The ſmall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43299:72"/>
Forces that followed <hi>Frederick,</hi>
were over-pow'red by Numbers;
the reſt periſhed, and were ſunk
with <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Ships, who was
left alone, and abandoned in that
Extremity. He looked tenderly
upon <hi>Amaldee,</hi> and without deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what he demanded of him,
he inſpired him at that Inſtant
with a deſire of making him his
Priſoner, and with a deſign of
ſetting him at Liberty. At firſt,
they were not able to ſpeak a
Word to one another; but at
length, <hi>Amaldee</hi> broke Silence,
either as he was the boldeſt, or
that his Thoughts were at more
Liberty: It is certain, that when
that Love does not appear under
it's proper Figure, he does not
commit ſuch great Diſorders, he
is hardly any otherwiſe formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than through the Fear we have
of him; and tho he was in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43299:72"/>
Heart of <hi>Amaldee</hi> as well as in that
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> yet he made a much
leſs Buſtle in the one than in the
other; <hi>Amaldee</hi> had received him
without knowing who he was,
and he only gave him ſome ſmall
Diſquiets, which he is not able to
diſpence any Body from; but
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who endeavoured to
oppoſe his Progreſſes, was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
both with the Shame of
having given him Entrance, and
the Deſign of baniſhing him from
his Heart. The Diſeaſe is never
ſo extream as when we go about
to be cured; and it is in thoſe
Conflicts that we are to be pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Ah! Prince,</hi> cryed <hi>Amaldee,
Why muſt I needs loſe you by ſetting
you free; for, if the Friendſhip I
have for you makes me deſirous to
detain you, the Acknowledgment
that I owe the King of</hi> Sicily <hi>and
your ſelf, demands of me your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43299:73"/>
Render it me then all
entire,</hi> ſaid <hi>Frederick</hi> to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurryed away by his Paſſion.
<hi>You conſent then to our Separation,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him; <hi>and do you
willingly,</hi> replyed <hi>Frederick? In
ſhort,</hi> continued he, <hi>You will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to go. Amaldee</hi> was ſo
charmed with receiving ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Teſtimonies of Friendſhip, and
<hi>Frederick</hi> ſo confuſed with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him them, that they
once more were ſurpriſed with
Silence; but then at length, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>'s
Timidity made him
break it in his Turn, and the
fear of being expoſed to the
receiving a thouſand Marks of
Eſteem from the Prince, which
though pleaſing, were ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to him, that they made him
reſolve to deſire the Prince to let
him go. <hi>I perceive then you hate
me ſtill,</hi> ſaid <hi>Amaldee</hi> to him,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43299:73"/>
but he made him no Anſwer;
and fearing that he had but too
well perſuaded him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he went in great Haſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ship that was deſtined to
carry him home. <hi>Amaldee</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
with great Grief, that he
ſhould be conducted to <hi>Meſſina,</hi>
but he was but very ill obeyed;
the Perſon whom <hi>Berranger</hi> had
commiſſioned to have an Eye
over his Sons Conduct, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſecretly, for the carrying <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
to <hi>Majorca,</hi> after having
feigned, for the contenting the
Prince, that he had appointed
them to ſteer to <hi>Sicily;</hi> it was
eaſie to put this Order in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Night coming on, did
both facilitate this Deceit, and
the Retreat of the Prince of
<hi>Majorca,</hi> who did but too ſoon
perceive the Defeat of his Fleet,
he re-aſſembled the Remains as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43299:74"/>
well as was poſſible for him, and
eſcaped happily from the Purſuit
of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> whom Night did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
both of <hi>Frederick</hi> and the
reſt of the Victory. After that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
thought himſelf out of his
Reach, being troubled with ſo
many Events, he ſhut himſelf up
in his Cabin, while that his Fleet
made away with full Sails from
<hi>Sicily,</hi> whither his Heart tended
however. His Return was yet
more ſad than his Voyage had
been, and <hi>Frederick</hi> who was no
leſs agitated than himſelf, ſuffered
them to carry him whither they
had a Mind; but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Trick that was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, he gave a doleful Skreek,
and likewiſe fell into a Paſſion
againſt thoſe who uſed him ſo
treacherouſly; but there was no
Remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:43299:74"/>
He perhaps found likewiſe a
kind of Conſolation in thinking
that he ſhould again ſee <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
without having contributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
He was very glad that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
had done for him what he
never durſt have done for himſelf,
and though he ſeemed to be in
a rage, without doubt he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no great Violence. They had
neither of them the leiſure to be
weary during their Voyage, their
Thoughts took them ſo up, that
they made them imagine it very
ſhort. They arrived at the ſame
time at <hi>Majorca,</hi> and Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
not knowing that <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
was ſo near him, went to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the King and Queen, who
made him a very unkind Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they were very much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſee that Deſtiny continued
obſtinately bent upon their ruin,
they knew nothing of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43299:75"/>
being taken, and the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was equal between them
and <hi>Amaldee,</hi> when it was told
a moment after, they then were
full of Acknowledgment to the
Prince, their Son; the Perſon
who had managed the Buſineſs,
had a great Reſpect for his Prince,
and ſeeing that he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to diſpleaſe him out of
obedience to the King, he was
willing to repair his Fault, by
giving him the honour of all.
In private he made him his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
for that deceit, and after
having told him the Reaſons
which obliged him to it, he
found him diſpoſed to pardon
him, thus all the World was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
The King had never been
ſenſible of any Joy equal to that
of having the Son of <hi>Menfroy</hi> in
his hands, He deſired to ſee him;
and that Prince having paid his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43299:75"/>
Reſpects to him, with a very
good Grace, and having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
him with a great deal of
Wit, he was ſomething ſecretly
vexed, that his Merit was but
too anſwerable to his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but the Queen had far other
Sentiments, ſhe reliſhed a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleaſure in having him for
her Priſoner, when ſhe found him
ſo well made, and obtained from
the King her Husband, that the
City ſhould be all his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hoping to make him loſe
the Liberty ſhe gave him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Frederick</hi> on the morrow had
ſome ſuſpicions, and in a few
dayes after, ſhe imparted to him
her Thoughts. Years had not yet
extinguiſhed her Beauty, ſhe was
addicted to Gallantry, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that ſhe might well merit
Vows, without exacting them,
ſhe was forced ſometimes how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43299:76"/>
to make Advances; Her
Rank hindred her at leaſt from
knowing the Lovers whom ſhe
cauſed to languiſh, and did ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
importune her, upon <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s
account, who entertained
her with a thouſand agreeable
things, for he had recovered all
his Gayety, and he lived in ſo
perfect an intelligence with <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
that his Felicity hindred
him from thinking that under the
Name of a Friend, ſhe was a
Lover, and that her haughtineſs
was but ill managed; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Women never think of
that, when they are ſatisfi'd with
their Lovers, and the deſign of
being ſevere, does ſeldom ariſe
during the pleaſure of a happy
Engagement. His was in a fair
way to become ſo, <hi>Amaldee</hi> did
inſenſibly ſhew him as much
tenderneſs as if he had known
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43299:76"/>
him better; he might believe that
it was ſympathy which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Inclination; and as he
was entertaining him with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
kind things, being prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereto by motions which he
could not penetrate. Word was
brought that the Queen deſir'd to
ſpeak with the Prince of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
At firſt their Converſation was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diverting, the Queen had a
great deal of Wit, and <hi>Frederick</hi>
had no leſs; at length they made
Love the Theme of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<hi>For my part, ſaid</hi> Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<hi>I believe that the Perfection
of Love conſiſts in its continuance,
and that We may judge of its force,
when it can reſiſt Time; and I,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Queen, <hi>ſhould believe on
the contrary, that Conſtancy does
rather proceed from the weakneſs
of a Lover, than from the power
of Love. There are ſome,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43299:77"/>
                     <hi>who have not the courage to
change, who make a Habit of their
Paſſion, which becomes calm and
ſtill, does ſomething approach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
and has no longer any
more than the Name of Love, the
Pleaſure is greateſt in having new
Sentiments. This is the reaſon
that moſt commonly Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
are only delightful in
the beginnings. You,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>ought to lay by that ſo regular
Fidelity, your Perſon is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an Air that may pretend
to more than one Conqueſt; it is
only for thoſe who have but a ſmall
ſhare of what can pleaſe, to keep
to their firſt Paſſion, though they
are ſo happy as to be therein ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
they ought never to hazard
themſelves in a ſecond: but there
are People of ſo great Merit as to
entertain more extended Deſigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:43299:77"/>
                     <hi>Frederick</hi> received very Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the application ſhe was pleaſed
to make him of thoſe obliging
words, but the Queens diſcourſe
having a particular Aim, whereto
he only Anſwered in general
Terms; <hi>Could you make uſe of thoſe
Maxims,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him looking
upon him fixedly, <hi>examine your
ſelf and in time you ſhall know more.</hi>
Hereupon ſhe withdrew into his
Cloſet, without expecting her
anſwer, perhaps for fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
one, that would not be
very conformable to what ſhe too
ardently deſired not to be under
apprehenſions, and perhaps like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to conceal her Bluſhes; for
how much accuſtomed ſoever a
Woman is to intrigues, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Bluſhes at her loving firſt,
be it out of ſhame or ſpite. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
remained very much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and foreſeeing that the Queens
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43299:78"/>
Paſſion would give him ſome
trouble, he was a while in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
if he ſhould give a hint of
it to the Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by that means they would
have come to a more entire expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The Conjuncture was
favourably, but they were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to other events, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this buſineſs was deferred
by an interreſſed Perſon. <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
was expecting <hi>Amaldee</hi> who
uſed to Walk with him every
Evening, and had hardly made
four ſteps, than that he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by a young Cavalier, who
made himſelf known to be the
Admirals Widdow. His ſurpriſe
was great, <hi>How, Madam,</hi> ſaid he
to her, <hi>my Eyes deceive me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt: No,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him,
<hi>Your Eyes do not deceive you, and
beſides, if your heart did tell you
that it was me, you may very well
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43299:78"/>
rely on its Teſtimony: but by what
good Fortune,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>do I
ſee you again? Can you doubt of
that,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>let it be
only in conſideration of you, if you
could do the ſame thing for me?
Frederick</hi> was ſo amazed, that by
having only offered to make her
his Confident, it had obliged her
come ſo far; and was no leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at the Compliments ſhe
made him, joyned to that ſtrange
diſguiſe, that they were going to
fall into a new perplexity, if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldie</hi>
had not diverted them
from it. But it is time to make
known by what Adventure ſhe
came to <hi>Majorca;</hi> it is certain
that when a Woman, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trends
to more than ordinary
Virtue and Severity, does concern
her ſelf in Gallantry, ſhe does not
do it by halfes, but paſſes from
one extremity to another; and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43299:79"/>
when ſhe reſolves once to ſtray
out of the courſe of Wiſdom, ſhe
ſeldom contains her ſelf from
committing extraordinary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?</p>
                  <p>But for the taking a Proſpect
of things from the time we left
them in <hi>Sicily;</hi> you muſt know,
that after the Fleet was returned
Victorious, although in Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon <hi>Frederick</hi>'s being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
people were divided between
Joy and Grief, every one was
ſenſible of their particular loſſes,
and it was enough that they did
not afflict themſelves with the
Princes impriſonment, ſince they
were aſſured of his being alive,
without that rejoycing at the
gaining a Battle, which <hi>Sicily</hi>
paid ſo dear for; ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons had loſt their Lives
therein and amongſt others, the
Lord High Admiral, as we have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43299:79"/>
ſaid was Killed. His Widdow,
whom he left in right to diſpoſe
of her ſelf, reſolved to make uſe
of it in favour of her Lover: ſhe
had apparently a very ſenſible
Grief for the Death of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and people were not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
at the Reſolution ſhe had
taken to leave the World, but
ſhe had not yet renounced its
Pleaſures, which ſhe ſtill found
was not without Charms: ſhe
was only obliged to go ſeek them
afar off. The Object of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
was now at <hi>Majorca,</hi> and
ſhe reſolved to ſpare no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to find him out. After
that the firſt Ceremonies of
Mourning were over, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to retire into a Convent.
In the mean while <hi>Camilla</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Frederick</hi> to be at <hi>Majorca,</hi>
had a great deſire to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and did not think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43299:80"/>
to ſtay any longer in
the Dominions of an Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Will of her Parents, ſhe
went to the King and told him,
that it was not Juſt, that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranger</hi>'s
Daughter ſhould be well
treated by a Prince, whoſe Son
was in the hands of her Father,
who did not reſtore him that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which he had given <hi>Amaldee.
I ought not,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to ſhare in
his ingratitude, by ſuffering it:
I am ohliged to make it my whole
endeavour to ſet the Prince at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
ſend me back to</hi> Majorca, <hi>if
you can confide in me. Without
doubt the King my Father will at
length be melted with ſo much Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity:
But in Caſe he continues
Obdurate, notwithſtanding all your
Favours, leave me to manage this
buſineſs with Addreſs, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
you that you ſhall ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in a ſhort time, or that I will
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43299:80"/>
come and remit my ſelf into your
hands.</hi> Perhaps ſhe did really
mean all that ſhe had ſpoken:
But <hi>Memfroy</hi> without much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
her intention, told her,
<hi>Madam, provided that your intreſts
may ſtill be preſerved, I ſhall not
be ſorry to be obliged to you for the
Liberty of my Son.</hi> He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
cauſed an offer to be made
<hi>Berranger</hi> to render her upon very
advantagious Conditions, but he
would in no wiſe hearken to it.
Nothing was ſo advantagious to
him, as to have the Prince of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
in his Dominions; inſomuch
that <hi>Memfroy</hi> deſparing of ſeeing
him without renewing a War, the
ſucceſs whereof is ever doubtful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
adventured to ſend back <hi>Camilla,</hi>
and delivering up voluntarily an
Hoſtage that Chance had given
him: He fancied that he ſhould
thereby oblige <hi>Berranger</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43299:81"/>
what Fortune had given
him likewiſe. Inſomuch that all
things being prepared for <hi>Camilla</hi>'s
departure; ſhe was ſent back
with a Noble Convoy, and the
Admirals Widdow taking that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to go to <hi>Majorca,</hi> did
mingle her ſelf in the Crowd of
thoſe who accompanied her. She
Tranſveſted her ſelf into a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
and was ſo well diſguiſed,
that ſhe hardly knew her ſelf.
Several days paſſed without any
ill ſucceſs in her Deſign. <hi>Camilla</hi>
was almoſt ever ſhut up in her
Cabin with one of her Maids, in
whom ſhe moſt Confided, and
without doubt the Admirals Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
would not have been Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
if her Love had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
her. The Character of a
Lover is too remarkable not to
be diſtinguiſhed. She bethought
her ſelf of making an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43299:81"/>
with the Princeſſes Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
hoping to know by that
means, in what terms <hi>Frederick</hi>
ſtood with <hi>Camilla,</hi> though the
Admirals Widdow did believe her
ſelf beloved: There needs ſo little
to wound a Paſſion, that incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
has ever been the ſhare of
thoſe who are in Love. Thus
ſhe did all ſhe could to have a
clear Information; ſhe thought,
that the beſt courſe would be for
her to win the Heart of that
Maid, for the diſcovering of her
Miſtreſſes Secrets; and as nothing
renders People ſo dextrous as
Love, ſhe acted the Lover ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
that this Confident took
delight in believing that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
her with ſome tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The habit of hearing ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Diſcourſe, had prepared her
Heart to entertain thoſe ſoft and
tender Vows; and the ſentiments
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43299:82"/>
of the Princeſs, had ſeemed to
her to be ſo ſweet, that ſhe could
not forbear following them. The
Admirals Widdow made a very
pretty Gentleman, and ſeemed
very deſerving the Ladys Favours.
Thus a great progreſs was made
in the Heart of that Maid, when
unluckily ſhe had a deſire to ſpeak
of her Galant. It is impoſſible
for People to forbear ſtarting in
all their Diſcourſe, ſomething of
the Object their Soul is full of,
and we ſometimes meet with ſuch
Perſons, who had rather ſpeak ill
of their Victorys, than be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to ſay nothing at all of
them. She was ever hearing
<hi>Camilla</hi> commending hers, and it
is no ſmall conſtraint to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hearing, when we have ſo
many things to ſay. She could
not forbear breaking ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
a ſilence, which ſhe did ſo
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43299:82"/>
dextrouſly, that ſhe both found
the means to pleaſe her Miſtriſs,
and ſatisfie her ſelf at the ſame
time. The Admirals Widdow
had often talked to her of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
and the Maid made uſe of
that pretext to ſpeak in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of her Galant, <hi>Madam,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>I know a</hi> Sicilian
<hi>here on Board, who has a moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Affection for his Prince, and
I dare aſſure you, that he is the
moſt zealous of his Subjects. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>
was too tender not to be
Charmed with the affection that
people had for <hi>Frederick,</hi> we
think our ſelves indebted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the kind ſentiments they
have for what we love, and ſhe
was willing that the pretended
<hi>Sicilian</hi> ſhould know, how kindly
ſhe took his good will. Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
was upon the wing to call
him, but at firſt he made ſome
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43299:83"/>
reſiſtance, yet being obliged to
obey, he diſguiſed his voice ſo
well, that he was not known, till
ſpeaking of <hi>Frederick,</hi> a bluſh
ſurpriſed him, and it was eaſily
perceived that he ſtudyed what
he had to ſay: his diſcourſe had
no relation, the one part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
his Motions appeared in
their Naturals, and his true tone
of Voice returned on him. The
Admirals Widdow was too ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
upon this Subject, for to be
able to conceal any thing from
Jealouſy. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe to
her, <hi>I thought you very buſy in
Works of Piety, but the Habit of
a man which you have put on, does
not perſuade me that you have had
any ſuch Motive.</hi> The Admirals
Widdow made her a very ſmart
Anſwer, for there is no keeping
of rank amongſt Rivals, and the
Conformity of Sentiments does
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43299:83"/>
in ſome manner equal perſons;
their Converſation was very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
during ſome time, but at length
they were appeaſed being there
was no Remedy, and agreed; hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deceive one another, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Confeſſion before their
Faces of the Prince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
that the Miſtriſs, who was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſhould enjoy that happineſs
without the others envying it
her; Whereupon they concluded
together, that the beſt way would
be to ſurpriſe him, that he might
not have the leaſure to Correct
his words, but explain himſelf
in good earneſt, but they reſolved
both in particular to prepoſſeſs
him in their favour. Rivals ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
keep their Words, and Love
removes all manner of Scruples.
The Admirals Widdow found him
out firſt as has been already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
but ſhe made no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43299:84"/>
of her diligence, for though
ſhe was not hindred by <hi>Camilla</hi>
ſhe was ſo by her Brother who
came to tell him ſome News;
The Admirals Widdow withdrew
not being willing to be ſeen in
that poſture which was ſo little
Conformable to Modeſty, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then by him who had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
that extravagance, and who
ought to be the more obliged to
her for that ſhe had ſurmounted
all manner of Conſiderations for
the love of him. But as we have
not all theſe Conſiderations for
others, we are careful to keep up
the reputation of all our virtue
with them, and willing to have
them think us ſtill the ſame. In
ſhort the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Frederick</hi> with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of his Siſter, who had met
with unkind reception from the
King, and one much worſe from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43299:84"/>
the Queen, Who ſuſpecting the
occaſion of her return, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
her to ſtirr out of her
Apartment. After which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to him a piece of News,
which put him in deſpair, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Comprehending the reaſon
thereof. The King had ſent for
the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> the Queens
Neece, under Pretext of keeping
her Company, but indeed for
the concluding a Match between
her and <hi>Amaldee.</hi> This Prince
had ever ſhown a very great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
for any ſuch ingagement,
but it was hoped that the Charms
of that Princeſs would by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
vanquiſh that indifference,
the King gave him notice that
very evening of this deſign, that
he might contribute thereto, and
told him that he would grant
him ſome time for the producing
between them what makes a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43299:85"/>
happy Union: <hi>Frederick</hi> was no
leſs troubled at this News than
<hi>Amaldee.</hi> They remained both
of them mute, and looked upon
one another without ſaying a
word, the King and Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame place with all
their Train: the Queen found
<hi>Frederick</hi> in a very great trouble,
which ſhe did not doubt, but
that <hi>Camilla</hi> had given occaſion
to, and that thought putting
her into deſpair, ſhe gave the
King to underſtand that it was
requiſite he ſhould be upon his
Guard, that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> under
the pretext of having brought
<hi>Camilla,</hi> might facilitate to <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
the means of evading, and
Conducting him into his own
Teritories; Theſe reaſons were
thought very probable by the
King, and diffidence ſuting with
his natural humor, <hi>Frederick</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:43299:85"/>
was guarded more ſtrictly, which
diſgrace he ſupported with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
patience, and indeed he
had other misfortunes which lay
much heavier upon him. He
perceived that his ill Fortune had
only made a truce with him for
a moment, to the end, that he
might be the more ſenſible of all
the afflictions that its return was
preparing for him. The Queens
paſſion, that of <hi>Camilla,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all that which <hi>Amaldee</hi>
was in a way of being engaged
in, made her find a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
in all the others, it
was however a kind of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for him, that he had all
theſe misfortunes together, if he
had had them ſeparately, they
would have been more afflicting,
but when the mind has ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
views, it fiexs upon none,
and it has of its ſufferings on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43299:86"/>
a confuſed Notion which is
not ſo violent, and indeed he
was only dejected. But the
Queen was more agitated, the
thoughts of having cauſed the
leaſt trouble in what ſhe loved,
made her inceſſantly contriving
the means of puting him out
of pain. She only waited for a
favourable occaſion to ſpeak
thereof to the King, whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
was difficult to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but ſhe ordered her buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſo as to find it. She could
no longer forbear ſeeing <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
her Jealouſy was mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by time, and ſhe knew no other
trouble than abſence, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
ſhe was to endeavour
the removing, whereupon ſhe
remonſtrated to <hi>Berranger</hi> that
it was glorious to leave <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
upon his word, that he
would oblige him, by Treating
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43299:86"/>
him honourably to make the
like returnes, that he ought not
to render himſelf odious to his
people, by an action oppoſite to
Royal Virtues, and that in ſhort,
the beſt courſe would be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to them, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the trouble he lay under in
being detained from his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by rendring his abode
with them as agreeable as could
be. The King did comply with
theſe Inſtances, having nothing
more to fear from the <hi>Sicilians</hi>
when he had ſent back with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to tell <hi>Menfroy,</hi> that if Chance
had put <hi>Frederick</hi> into his hands,
as it had done <hi>Camilla</hi> into his,
he would have delivered him
after the ſame manner, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
purchaſed him with the
bloud of ſo great a number of
his Subjects, and by the loſs of
a Battaile, it was fitting he ſhould
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43299:87"/>
ſtill keep what he had ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquired. The King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
perceived that he muſt ſtill
riſcue ſome more of his men for
the recovery of his Son, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
anew for War, but <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
ſeeing himſelf freed from
that great number of Guards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his dejection, he
enquired after <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he was
told that that Prince was gone to
meet the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> with
a conſiderable part of the Court.
How fatal was this News! He
was not able to view his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in that diſtant Proſpect,
though it makes it appear leſs
great, he ſaw it approaching, and
was in no leſs perplexity how, to
come off from a Viſit that the
Queen exacted from him; and
yet, however he was obliged to
make it, but he went to her with
ſo great a ſadneſs, that the Queen
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43299:87"/>
asked him with ſurprize, from
whence that profound Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
proceeded, <hi>You ought to lay
it now aſide,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>ſince
your misfortunes are now blown
over. Ah! Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her,
<hi>I am no ſooner got out of one Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
than that I fall into another,
I am ſo accuſtomed to that long train
of misfortunes, that I will alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom
my ſelf to bear them with an
equal Countenance: I have made a
habit of my Troubles, which will
cauſe me at leaſt to receive indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
all that is ſtill prepared
for me: And will you view your
good fortune alſo with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to him. <hi>It is
beyond all appearance,</hi> replyed he,
<hi>that though it ſhould be offered me,
I ſhould never believe it real, and
ſhould refuſe it for that reaſon.</hi>
Camilla's <hi>Confinement puts you into
this ill humor,</hi> ſaid the Queen to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43299:88"/>
him, outraged with Spite, <hi>but you
would do well to diſingage your ſelf
a little on that ſide, from whence
you are not to expect any great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;

                     <hi>FRederick</hi> no other Proſpect
now, than the Marriage of
<hi>Amaldee;</hi> he Walked Penſive all
alone, and tho impatient of his
return, yet it was not long enough
deferred in his Opinion. He could
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43299:90"/>
not ſee but too ſoon the Princeſs
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhe ſeemed to him ſo
Beautiful, and <hi>Amaldee</hi> ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant,
tho he only did what
meer Civility required, that he
perceived his grief was capable of
increaſing. The King received
her according to her Quality, and
the views he had for her, did
merit. Yet the Queen did not
ſee her that day, and gave out
that ſhe was Indiſpoſed. But the
Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> viewed <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
with great application, and
hardly took any notice of all the
honours that were done her. She
could have wiſhed that he had
been the Prince of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and
tho' that <hi>Amaldee</hi> was admirably
well made, ſhe was not deſtined
to have thoſe Sentiments for him,
which ſhe began to have for <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</hi>
They had conceived a
great eſteem for one another, but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43299:90"/>
nothing more, and never two
hearts were at that diſtance, when
they were to have been united.
they met, it is true, at the ſame
point in what concerned <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
but that was not the way to
join them. On the Morrow they
were each of them full of ſuch
Capricious Sentiments, that it
ſeemed as if Love had changed
place for the better exerciſing his
vengeance, but this Princeſs did
ſtill bear the ſource, and all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were mean in compariſon
of hers. She had a ſenſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
of them, through the
Jealouſie ſhe had of <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
which ſhe had hitherto been unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with; and that ſo violent
paſſion in all others, was only
doleful in her, and by conſequence
much more oppreſſing. It is a
great caſe when we can complain
of a Perſon with Juſtice: And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43299:91"/>
thoſe terrible Motions, which
makes us believe that we hate
him who loves a Rival, are
more ſupportable than thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
languiſhing, which only tends
to the accuſing our ſelves of all
our Sufferings. Ah! how feeble
is that Accuſation, and how Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
at the ſame time? <hi>Why
did I not make my ſelf known,</hi> ſaid
ſhe, <hi>before he made his Addreſſes
to another, it is now too late to ſhow
him the Princeſs of</hi> Sicily, <hi>after
he has ſeen the Princeſs of</hi> Mantua,
<hi>and that he has already received the
impreſſion of her Charms? Why did
I not take the opportunity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his heart, during his happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference:
I complained of this,
alas! but I ſtill deferred the procuring
being beloved. I ſee my ſelf now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
Why did he not keep to
that indifference which he would not
quit for me? I never had any other
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43299:91"/>
than the trouble of not being belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but that ſeeing him Love an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a thouſand times more Cruel.</hi>
She was not able to go abroad
that day, and pretended a ſickneſs
which ſhe had only in her mind.
The Queen was very well again,
when there was an occaſion to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who though he had
offended her by his faint Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
ſhe found the means of
juſtifying him. He had ſome
reaſon on his ſide; the unjuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure
of the thing wherein he
might think that ſhe had ſome
ſhare, by reaſon of <hi>Camilla,</hi> was
very capable of putting him out
of humor: but tho all ſhould
have been againſt him, ſhe found
in her heart what ſpoke in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
It is very natural to believe
Innocent, what is ſo much our
Intereſt to have ſo. In ſhort ſhe
diſpoſed her ſelf to make him a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43299:92"/>
Viſit, after having received one
from the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
whom ſhe gave to underſtand,
that ſhe was obliged to have great
regards for that Forreign Prince;
and tho ſhe could not approve in
her ſelf of all the managements
ſhe had for him, ſhe endeavoured
to make them be approved of by
others. The Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi>
asked her ſeveral Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Frederick,</hi> telling her that
ſhe had not taken notice of ſuch a
Perſon, and obliged her to carry
her with her; tho ſhe had no
great deſire to do ſo. This young
Princeſs had had a certain diſquiet
all the Night, which had hindred
her from ſleeping, and which had
put her into a condition of keeping
her bed if ſhe had not been to ſee
the Queen: ſhe flattered her ſelf that
<hi>Frederick</hi>'s Sickneſs might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
approaching hers. She fancied
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43299:92"/>
that he had viewed her very earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly,
and that he frequently ſighed,
while he was in her Preſence, and
the deſire of ſeeing him do ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
filled her Imagination with
a Delight, which vaniſhed at her
coming into his Chamber: they
found him in ſo lamentable a
Condition, his Eyes being all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with Tears, which he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thought of Wiping away, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their Preſence. It
was eaſie for them to Judg, that
they had neither of them any
ſhare in that great grief. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of a Paſſion are not ſo
violent, and the Princeſs of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>
was with reaſon apprehenſive,
that the Perſon whom ſhe was ſo
deſirous to render ſenſible, was
but too much ſo already. The
Queen on her ſide having no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to applaud her ſelf for that
profound affliction, it made her
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43299:93"/>
conceive a furious ſpight; the
Converſation was faint on all
ſides, and the Viſit ſhort. As
they were going away, <hi>Amaldee</hi>
came likewiſe to make <hi>Frederick</hi>
a Viſit, who could not forbear
giving him an unkind Reception,
and though he would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give him any offence, yet he
did, for the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined
ſhe robbed her of that
heart, when they did not give it
her, tho ſhe had ſo well merited
it. She could not be ſatisfied with
him, who gave it to another.
<hi>Does the Princeſs of</hi> Mantua <hi>ſend
you hither,</hi> ſaid Frederick <hi>to him,</hi>
after ſomething a ſlighting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<hi>Amaldee</hi> without making
him any anſwer upon that, asked
him only what he thought of her,
and if ſhe was not very beautiful,
<hi>I did not take ſo much notice of
her,</hi> anſwered he in the ſame tone.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43299:93"/>
                     <hi>I am much afraid,</hi> ſaid <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
now ſomething diſpleaſed, <hi>that
you have ſeen her but too much for
your repoſe and for mine; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of not ſpeaking of her, ſeems
to me a fear of augmenting that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
by commending a Princeſs
who has inſpired me with it. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
was ſo diſordered, and in
ſuch diſpair, to ſee him ſo infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that he had not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to give him an Anſwer, and
<hi>Amaldee</hi> was more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the ſuſpicion he had of
his being faln in Love with his
Miſtreſs: this troubled him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing the reaſon of his own
Thoughts. He perceived that he
ſhould not be much concerned,
tho ſhe ſhould Love <hi>Frederick,</hi>
but he could not endure that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
ſhould love her. <hi>I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>and Jealouſie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs
my mind, I ought only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his Loving her, for fear ſhe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43299:94"/>
ſhould likewiſe Love him: but</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he a moment after, <hi>I am
ſenſible, that I apprehend all on the
ſide of</hi> Frederick, <hi>even without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Princeſs. I am Mad,</hi>
added he in ſhort, <hi>I am in Love,
ſince I am Jealous, and I can only be
ſo of the Princeſs of</hi> Mantua.
However, he could not conclude
this in good earneſt, and he was
ſuſpended between his Reaſon and
his Sentiments, which he could
not accord, but had very terrible
Allarms. <hi>Frederick</hi> not being
able to ſuffer his Rival to make all
the Progreſs ſhe had a mind to,
while he ſhould amuſe himſelf in
complaints, he left his Chamber on
the morrow, and appeared ſo ſad,
but ſo lovely, that the Princeſs
of <hi>Mantua</hi> commended him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily,
and gave Preſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Truth to the Queen,
whom experience rendred know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Womens thoughts of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:43299:94"/>
ſhe found two Rivals, and
was not her ſelf Beloved. This
was ſufficient to prompt her to
terrible extremities; ſhe was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
Imperious: however, as
Love works great changes in the
minds of thoſe it poſſeſſes, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of her Paſſion made her
undertake what ſhe would never
have done without its aid. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
happening to lean upon a
Window, where he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
Penſive; ſhe approached
him under the pretext of looking
into the Gardens; <hi>You are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>of the kind
thoughts ſome Perſons entertain of
you: You ought to have perceived
that I Love you: you Love</hi> Camilla,
<hi>and I will give her to you: but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
let this extraordinary effect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
you to ſome acknowledgment.</hi>
She did not wait for his Anſwer;
and a great Bluſh covering her
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43299:95"/>
Face, ſhe went from thence to go
find out the King, of whom ſhe
demanded <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Pardon, and
told him that his Severity ought
to be ſatisfied, and that it was now
time to take her again into his
Favour. The King could hardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
be prevailed with to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
but after a thouſand Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes,
for which he had no reaſon
to be much obliged to her, ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
what ſhe demanded, upon
condition however, that his
Daughter ſhould not appear in
his Preſence. From thence ſhe
went to <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Apartment,
whom ſhe found under ſo great a
ſadneſs, as would have melted
with pity, any other than a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
The abſence of <hi>Frederick,</hi>
whoſe Company was enjoyed by
the Admirals Widdow, and all his
other Miſtriſſes, was ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
as ſhe had been ignorant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43299:95"/>
of till that time, and which ſhe
had the leiſure to feel in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
She received the Queens
Viſit with no ſmall aſtoniſhment:
but her ſurpriſe was cruelly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
when ſhe entertained her
with the following Diſcourſe, <hi>Go
thank the Prince of</hi> Sicily <hi>for your
Pardon, it is to him that you are
indebted for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſets you free, by
playing you an Infidelity with the
Princeſs of</hi> Mantua, <hi>Camilla</hi> was
not willing to purchaſe her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at that rate; and the Queen
went away without ſaying any
thing more. As by breeding a
quarrel between her and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
ſhe deprived her of the fruit
of the ſervice, which ſhe ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſigned her, ſhe was in hopes
that all would turn to her own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<hi>Camilla</hi> would rather
have choſen to have continued in
doubt of what paſſed between
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43299:96"/>
                     <hi>Frederick</hi> and the Admirals Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
than to have the certainty
of his being become a Votary to
the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua:</hi> a new
Rival revives all our griefs; they
augment every time we fall under
them anew, becauſe we add the
freſh troubles to thoſe we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Penetrated with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
different thoughts, ſhe only
followed that which ſpight inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her with, which was never
to ſpeak to <hi>Frederick.</hi> And indeed
ſhe had ſo much addreſs to avoid
the occaſions of doing ſo, that
tho he ſhould have ſought them
more than he did, he would never
have found an opportunity. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
and the Queen, did ſo well juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all that had been ſaid, that
there was no place for any doubt.
The Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> was very
glad to deprive the Perſon of a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43299:96"/>
Heart, who had deprived her of
hers, and by that means take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for all the torments <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
had put her to, which ſhe did
with ſucceſs. As they one day
met, ſaid that Prince very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to him, <hi>Well, you are in Love
with my Miſtreſs, muſt I yield her
to you? Do not yield her to me,</hi>
ſaid he ſcornfully, <hi>we muſt diſpute
for her Heart by Services; and
notwithſtanding the affection I have
for her, muſt ſhe neceſſarily be yours?
The affection which you have for her!</hi>
anſwered Amaldee, <hi>Ah! this I
find inſupportable! How, ſhall I then
be betrayed by my beſt Friend!
We muſt quarrel if you Love the
Princeſs of</hi> Mantua. <hi>Let us quarrel</hi>
ſaid the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> outraged
to ſee motions in him which ſhe
did not think herſelf the cauſe of,
for Love had never produced ſo
many Caprices without making
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43299:97"/>
himſelf known, as he did in the
Soul of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> they ſpoke no
more to one another that day, and
the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> ſpending with
her Rivals all the hours ſhe would
have ſpent with her Lover, did
recompence herſelf for what ſhe
might loſe, becauſe he was alſo a
loſer, and ſhe imployed her time
in putting obſtacles to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes
which his Paſſion might
make, if ſhe could not hinder
him from being in love, too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in having ſo uſeful an occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
This made a diverſion to
her ſentiments, which Idleneſs
would have rendred more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
The Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> was
Charmed to ſee ſo happy a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
in her deſign, which at firſt
ſhe did not think capable of being
executed; ſhe no longer made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the difficulty ſhe
had foreſeen therein, ſince it was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43299:97"/>
now removed. When we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the preſent, we are
not inclinable to take views of
unacceptable remembrances, or
when we do make ſome reflections
upon them; our paſſed ſufferings
do only help to make us find more
pleaſures by the oppoſition of the
preſent delightful entertainments.
The Queen was in a fury to ſee
that a change had been wrought
according to her Maxims, and that
it was not ſo in her favour, ſhe
would have found it leſs cruel to
have ſeen that <hi>Frederick</hi> had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to love <hi>Camilla,</hi> than to ſee
that he began to be in love with
the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> he might
well have ſigh'd for her daughter,
without giving her offence, he knew
not then that ſhe was beautiful,
but after having both known her
to be ſo, and had received Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of her Affection, to ſacrifice
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43299:98"/>
her to another could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a horrible Contempt. It is
particularly the preference which
outrages. <hi>Camilla</hi> for her part had
no other Courſe to take than that
of complaining with her Brother,
and he of complaining with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
thus they augmented their
griefs by mingling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Admirals Widdow who
made a ſtrict inquiry after all
that concernd <hi>Frederick,</hi> was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the very leaſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of her misfortune? ſhe became
a friend of the Princeſs of <hi>Majorca,</hi>
ſince they had nothing more to
fear of one another, and ſince they
equally did dread a Rival. They
likewiſe concerted together the
means of doing her an Injury. The
Admirals Widdow could not
reſolve to loſe the fruit of her
Voyage, ſhe would at leaſt ſpeak
with the ungrateful <hi>Frederick,</hi> but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43299:98"/>
ſhe could not meet with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity;
He kept the Princeſs
of <hi>Mantua</hi> Company the moſt he
could, and was more frequently
with the Queen than he was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have been, who endevouring
not to make any noiſe, made uſe
of the ſame Artifices he had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in regard of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> and
ſtole from him moments which
he had deſigned for the Princeſs of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> thus was he tortured on
all ſides. By theſe means the
Queen did ſhare in his aſſiduities,
or rather payed them to him, or
at leaſt extorted them from him
much againſt his will. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
for her was onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
nothing could move
him to have any, but only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of her Rank; Thus
his deviſes having not the ſame
Motive which made him act for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43299:99"/>
the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> they had a
notable difference. <hi>Frederick</hi> had
four Miſtriſſes at the ſame time,
he was the Lover of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
and the Rival of his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and he particularly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
thoſe two laſt Characters
to the heighth. As <hi>Amaldee</hi>
would have ſeen without trouble,
the Paſſion of his Miſtriſs, if his
Friend had not repaid it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
flames. He neglected
very much to complain of her, he
frequently entertained her only
with indifferent things: but one
day obſerving the uneaſineſs of
<hi>Frederick,</hi> who was Walking with
the Queen, and who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to approach him, to hear what
he ſaid to the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
he reſolved in his turn to put him
upon the Rack for ſome moments,
and raiſing his Voice, <hi>Ah!</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid he to her, <hi>have we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43299:99"/>
that is more delightful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
our ſelves with, it ſeems as
if we were afraid that</hi> Frederick
<hi>ſhould over-hear us:</hi> as he did
indeed. She made him Anſwer
in a kind of ſlighting manner,
<hi>The more indifferent the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, the more it ought to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
What a rigour!</hi> cryed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee,</hi>
in a trouble that was not
feigned, ſince he judged that her
indifference for him, only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the affection that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
had for her. <hi>Is it,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, <hi>by ſuch indifferent things
that the Prince of</hi> Sicily <hi>has found
the way to pleaſe you, and has he ſo
little accuſtomed you to amorous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
that you cannot bear
with them. Frederick</hi> was too
knowing in motions, not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that thoſe of <hi>Amaldee</hi> had a
very tender Principle, without
diving into the cauſe of that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43299:100"/>
ſince he who felt it
could not dive into it himſelf;
this inſpired him with all the rage
which the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi>
ought to have conceived, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Queen took notice
of it, and was no leſs concerned
than he. And thoſe four Lovers,
two of whom had only a good
Title to that Appellation, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
themſelves very injudicially,
for want of knowing the truth of
their own Sentiments. <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
who was drawn to <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
did by little and little draw the
Queen to him likewiſe, who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
this violence to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhe was willing to
divert him, and turned ſuddenly
into an oppoſite Alley. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of the Princeſs of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca,</hi>
and of the Princeſs of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi>
did inſenſibly come again to
be flat and faint, when they were
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43299:100"/>
no longer animated by <hi>Frederick</hi>'s
preſence, ſhe was not very eager
to juſtify her ſelf of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and he fell into a certain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
humour which hindred
him from proceeding any further
upon that point. On the other
ſide, <hi>Frederick</hi> and the Queen were
in an inconceivable diſorder, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
was in deſpair that he was
no longer witneſs of a Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he imagined to have
proceeded much further; and the
Queen was in deſpair to ſee that
he was ſo; But tho they hardly
interchanged a word, yet it was
a good while before they parted.
The Queen detained <hi>Frederick</hi> as
long as Civility would permit her,
and he at length withdrew, ſo
outraged with what he had heard,
that he reſolved according to
the Cuſtome of thoſe who are in
love, to hear henceforward all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43299:101"/>
that he might wiſh never to know,
he never parted from <hi>Amaldee,</hi>
who innocently gave him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
occaſions of Jealouſy, he
could not endure that <hi>Frederick</hi>
ſhould ſpeak to the Princeſs of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> he interrupted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
as ſoon as he ſaw them
together, the Prince of <hi>Sicily</hi> did
as much on his part, thus they
vexed one another by a hundred
little tricks, and irritated their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
tenderneſs by the marks
they gave thereof to the Princeſs
of <hi>Mantua;</hi> their redoubled ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
importuned her, two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
proved troubleſome to hers,
it was neceſſary that ſhe ſhould
rid herſelf of the one or other, and
without doubt the lot would have
faln upon that of <hi>Amaldee,</hi> but
as it was not ſhe who had given
birth to it, her power did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſo far, and it was in vain
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43299:101"/>
that ſhe undertooke the curing
him of it. As he one day accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his cuſtome had interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their converſation, ſhe ſell to
diſcourſe upon the point of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Lovers; for my part, ſaid
ſhe, <hi>I beleive that the aſſiduities of
a Lover of that Character, do as
much diminiſh the eſteeme that a
Miſtriſſe has for him, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs
of a more circumſpect Lover
do augment it, it is a firſt ſight that
gives birth to an inclination, when
it is happy, thoſe which follow do
only ſerve to confirme what it had
already done, but when it produces
nothing, all the other only help to
irritate our durity, by the obſtacles
we are willing to raiſe. It ſeems as if
he would take our heart by main
force. It is born free and when
it does not give it ſelf, nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
us of it: that is very true
replyed the Prince of Majorca, when
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43299:102"/>
we do not pleaſe at firſt it is in
vaine that we endeavour to do ſo
afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in an unwelcome votary, as it is
charming in a Lover who pleaſes but
when we cannot be ſucceſſeful in
Love, we are willing to be ſo at leaſt
in jealouſy, and it is ſufficient if we
can but hinder a Rival from taking
advantage of our diſgrace, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he has a greater ſhare in our
aſſiduities than a miſtreſſe to whom
we no longer owes them from the time
that ſhe permits them in an other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Frederick <hi>without knowing who
found ſo much ſweetneſs in theſe
words that eying</hi> Amaldee <hi>after a
very obliging manner. A dexterous
Lover ſaid he to him, ought not to
be ſcandalized at a procedure, which
ſhowes the value which is put upon
his merit and it is much for him
to have procured the eſteeme of his
Rival.</hi> The Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:43299:102"/>
looked upon him at that word
with aſtoniſhment and without
comprehending why he tooke
<hi>Amaldees</hi> part to the prejudice
of his own, even in a point appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ſo contrary to his intereſts,
we may ſay that he inſpired her
with jealouſy at that moment,
with more juſtice than ſhe did
him and ſhe went diſpleaſed away
upon ſome pretext, and ſeeing
<hi>Frederick</hi> the next day in the
Queens Chamber who was then
taken up with ſome affaires, ſhe
endeavoured to approach him and
told him I know not I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
why you have <hi>more reguards
for a friend, who ought no longer
to be ſo, than I have for a Lover,
whom I ought to manage by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
reaſons, what would you have
me do,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>he treats me
very Civily he has been my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour—Ah</hi>
ſaid the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43299:103"/>
interrupting him, <hi>do men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think themſelves obliged for
any thing to a Rival? you do
well deſerve that after your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
I ſhould make him kind
returns for the deſigns he has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, however I am willing to
give you another, ſince you want
one to ſhew you the devoir of a
Lover, treat him as I treat him,
this is no great requeſt; But,
Madam,</hi> replyed he to her, <hi>ſhould
I be ungrateful to that Prince
whoſe ſentiments are ſo generous?
But,</hi> replyed ſhe again, <hi>I never
ſaw any like yours, and I believe
that you love your Rival better
than your Miſtreſs;</hi> They could
not ſpeak a word more, for the
Queen returning with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
interrupted them. In the
mean while <hi>Amaldee</hi> and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
continued to treat one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a thouſand Civilities,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43299:103"/>
and always in the preſence of the
Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> they were
ever in her Company, it was to
no purpoſe that ſhe forbid <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
to be ſo obliging to his
Rival, he was Commanded by
ſomething more powerful; they
fell often out and was as often
reconciled, for the opinion that
ſhe was only jealous of a Rival,
made her Condemn all her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as ridiculous, but our true
Lovers could not be long in good
intelligence amongſt ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
It came into <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s
head to proceed to an explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all theſe ſtrange inclinations
he was ſenſible of. He Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
his deſign to <hi>Frederick,</hi>
and told him that it was requiſite
that they ſhould put an end to
their differences, by examining
all their moſt particular thoughts
with the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43299:104"/>
that he who was found to love
her beſt, ſhould be left to purſue
his Amour all alone without any
obſtacle from the other. <hi>Frederick</hi>
had found the time of their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
ſo ſweet and ſo ſhort, that
he was willing to continue it,
and endeavoured to oppoſe <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>'s
Curioſity, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to new explications between
them. <hi>Frederick</hi> reproached him,
that he violently loved the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
ſince that he was ſo deſirous
to be ſure of her ſentiments even
to the riſque of not being the
happy Lover, <hi>Amaldee</hi> likewiſe
reproached him with injuſtice in
thinking himſelf beloved, and
yet to ſuffer him to continue
his addreſſes to no purpoſe. <hi>It
is too much,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>to

Charriot,</hi> theſe terrible
words had like to have killed
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43299:104"/>
the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard her ſelf talked to with
ſo much haughtineſs. <hi>Amaldee</hi>
himſelf was ſurpriſed at what he
had ſaid, and tho he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them but what was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
yet as it were againſt his
Will, he was ſo ſorry for what he
had ſaid, that he was thinking to
have asked him pardon, for not
having offered him his Miſtriſs,
and that he had treated him like
a vulgar Rival: Then Repenting
on a ſuddain without any excuſe,
he reſolved to perſue his firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and taking <hi>Frederick</hi> along,
who was not capable to reſiſt
him, nor ſpeak one word, they
entred together into the Princeſs
of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Apartment, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her alone, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to
her, <hi>it is time that I ceaſe being
miſerable, or that I be ſo for ever;
ſpeak Madam, muſt I conſent to the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43299:105"/>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of your hearts, ſpeak</hi> Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
ſaid ſhe to him, ſhedding ſome
Tears, <hi>do you Love the Princeſs ſo
much, as not to be able to ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trouble the Marriage we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
too?</hi> At theſe cruel Words,
<hi>Frederick</hi> was not able to ſupport
all his grief, but fainted away;
yet People being called into his
help, he came to himſelf at length,
but would not ſpeak to the Prince
of <hi>Majorca.</hi> This adventure was
known by the Queen, whoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
did dayly augment, and who
having in vain eſſayed to get <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
wholly to her ſelf, reſolved to
ſend him quite away. She thought
it would be better to deprive herſelf
of his ſight, than to ſee him the
Lover of another. Inſomuch that
ſhe went to the King; <hi>We always
deferred,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring</hi>
Frederick <hi>to</hi> Memfroy,
<hi>through reaſons of Policy which we
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43299:105"/>
thought good, but ſeeing at preſent
that his Amours tend to our diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
I think it much better to
deliver him into his Fathers hands,
by reaſon of ſo many troubles, that
may attend his longer ſtay here.
Berranger</hi> made ſome difficulty to
yield to this Propoſition, but ſhe
knew ſo well how to repreſent ſo
lively all the Misfortunes which
accompanied them, during all
the time they had made War
againſt <hi>Menfroy,</hi> that he was at
length of her Opinion. However,
as ſoon as ſhe found ſo little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
in her Deſigns, ſhe began
to tremble for the Execution;
the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s abſence
preſented it ſelf to her heart with
ſo lively a grief, that ſhe began
to Combat her own Reaſons, and
to find that it was a good Surety
of the King of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s Clemency,
to have his Son in their Power,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43299:106"/>
being very ſenſible that ſhe ſhould
chooſe to ſee him ſigh for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
rather than not to ſee him,
and finding that as long as he was
in their Dominions, ſhe ſhould
have a kind of Right over him;
the ſhaddow of the leaſt Power is
always accounted ſomething by a
Miſtriſs. She gave <hi>Berranger</hi> to
underſtand that it was in ſome
manner to be Maſter of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to
have the next Heir thereof in his
hands, but as the intereſt of her
Paſſion was not to be neglected,
ſhe thought fit to hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of that which he had for
the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> by preſſing
the King to conclude the Match
between her and <hi>Amaldee;</hi> ſhe
had always deferred the ſpeaking
thereof, for fear of ſhewing her
ſelf too much concerned in the
thing. It is very difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
indifferent when we are not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43299:106"/>
ſo; but that occaſion was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
ſhe had ſpoken of ſending
him back, and ſhe avoided ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him in that adventure. The
King had not been in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of his Paſſion for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhe lived with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
after ſuch a manner as was
not capable of giving any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to indifferent People. Thus
the King was altogether diſpoſed
to haſten things, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it was convenient to conſult
both Parties, The Queen took
upon her to ſpeak to the Princeſs,
and having ſent for her into her
Cloſet, after having made her a
hundred Caraſſes; <hi>The Alliance
which we are going to make,</hi> ſaid
ſhe to her, <hi>obliges me to Treat you
like my Daughter. All is ready
for the Marriage,</hi> Amaldee <hi>is at
length recovered from his indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Loves you even to the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43299:107"/>
being jealous of the inconſtant Prince
of</hi> Sicily, <hi>who without doubt has
pretended ſome affection for you, for
there is not a Beauty who is exempt
from his Gallantrys. He was in
Love with</hi> Camilla <hi>while ſhe was in</hi>
Sicily. <hi>He would likewiſe have
paid me ſome of his Amorous Vows,</hi>
ſaid ſhe laughing, <hi>I believe you
have ſhared in his Addreſſes, and
at preſent I have diſcovered a new
intrigue.</hi> That Princeſs was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with ſpight, when ſhe learnt
that <hi>Frederick</hi>'s heart was not as
new as hers, ſhe had been ignorant
of all that had paſſed between
<hi>Camilla</hi> and him, and ſhe was ſo
very nice in things of that nature,
that the very Sentiments he had
had beforeknowing her, rendred
her Jealous; ſhe would willingly
have Monopolized all the
thoughts which he was capable
of, as ſhe was ready to afford him
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43299:107"/>
all hers. She found no difference
between having the ſame addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
paid to others, that had been
made to her, and between thoſe
that had been made to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any had been paid to her,
ſince as to her they were equally
loſt. And what an exceſs of
grief was it to her, to ſee that they
had been ſhared in the little time
ſhe had received them? She as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Queen trembling, with
whom it was that <hi>Frederick</hi> had a
new engagement. <hi>You are curious,</hi>
ſaid the Queen to her with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
gayity; <hi>It is</hi> anſwered ſhe
very ſadly, <hi>a Curioſity that I ſhould
have for any other as well as for</hi>
Frederick, <hi>but I ſhould not be ſorry
to know his intregues.</hi> The Queen
feigning to be of her Opinion, and
of not obſerving her diſorder, told
her, <hi>The truth is, that there is a
great deal of Pleaſure in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43299:108"/>
what people would fain conceal
from us; for my part I intereſs
my ſelf in an affair from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I know it, and it affords
me almoſt as much delight as it
does thoſe who have therein the
Principal Part. This will be to us
a merry entertainment,</hi> added ſhe,
<hi>and I will give you the means of
Convicting him of Inconſtancy.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſeeing <hi>Frederick</hi> come into
her Chamber, <hi>We muſt call him to
us,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>We ſhall ſee what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
he will make to our Attachs.</hi>
But the Princeſs was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to ſupport the ſight of him,
ſhe went away under the pretext
of being newly ſeized with a pain
in the head, and the Queen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plouding
in her ſelf the ſucceſs of
her Malice, was willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it; and having cauſed <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
to ſit down, <hi>I have at length
obtained for you,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43299:108"/>
                     <hi>the pleaſure of returning into</hi> Sicily.
<hi>That word made him turn pale,</hi>
and the Queen continuing ſaid,
<hi>The King has always had the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of rendring you Maſter of your
Conduct, ſince he was hurryed to
ſome exceſſes upon</hi> Camilla'<hi>s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but the Marriage of</hi> Amaldee
<hi>has ever poſſeſſed him ſince that
time, and hindered him hitherto
from ſpeaking to you thereof. As
it is at preſent concluded, and the
Ceremonies are to be performed
within a few days: you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have a mind to ſhare in the
Divertiſements that will be upon
that occaſion: but if you are not
that way inclined, you may depart
when you think convenient, if the
pleaſures that are preparing for
that Feaſt are indifferent to you,
and if you do not think us deſerving
the ſatisfaction of enjoying your
Company for ſome days longer:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43299:109"/>
But you give me no Anſwer,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
ſhe, <hi>Is not this Match to your
mind? Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her
with great violence, <hi>The only
thought of parting from you, is ſo
afflicting, that it hindered me from
underſtanding what you ſaid: but
when is this Marriage to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated?
It would have been
already Conſummated, had it not
been for</hi> Amaldee's <hi>backwardneſs,</hi>
ſaid the Queen, thinking to be
very Malitious, <hi>for the Princeſs of</hi>
Mantua <hi>does ardently deſire it.
Frederick</hi> recovered ſome Joy at
that Word, and Proteſted ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to the Queen, that he was
not in Love with the Princeſs of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and entertained her with
ſo many obliging things, that ſhe
remained more ſatisfied than ſhe
promiſed her ſelf, and <hi>Frederick</hi>
was in hopes of making the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
conſent, that by ſacrificing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43299:109"/>
the Queen effectually to her, he
might have the Liberty of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have ceaſed his Addreſſes.
The intelligence, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, might authorize that
Thought: But all theſe Projects
were out of Seaſon, thanks to the
Queens Artifice, all his meaſures
were broken by the Jealouſie,
which ſhe had dextrouſly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
into the Soul of her Rival.
This Princeſs would no longer
look upon him, and it was in vain
that <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Eyes ſought to
tell her, how deſirous he was of
a particular Converſation with
her; they could not meet
with hers, but having approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
her Ear at a time, that no
Body took notice of that action,
<hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>endeavours
are uſed to make me abandon you,
but I ſee a change in your Carriage
which if you continue much longer
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43299:110"/>
will proceed perhaps to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
me to the Prince of</hi> Majorca.
She turned away her head ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
without making him any
anſwer, and preſenting her hand
to <hi>Amaldee,</hi> he was obliged to
lead her to her Apartment. But
the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> did
not take notice after what
obliging manner ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it him, his mind was filled
with a thouſand vexatious things
upon her account. The King
having ſent to ſeek him, had
commanded him abſolutely to
Marry her within eight days,
which was the longeſt time that
his reſiſtance could obtain. He
ſlighted her very much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
from that Evening to treat
her as ſhe had done him, thus
they all three paſſed that night
very uneaſily. The Princeſs of
<hi>Mantua</hi> had been ſo ſurpriſed at
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43299:110"/>
                     <hi>Frederick</hi>'s perfidity, that ſhe did
not think at firſt of <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faithful to her, her mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fixed upon her misfortune,
did not afford her any agreeable
views; It is very difficult in a
moment that a ſtrong paſſion
finds itſelf betray'd for a Woman
to think of giving birth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thought came only into
her head when <hi>Frederick</hi> would
have been as intimate with her as
before the diſcovery: ſhe then on a
ſuddain reſolved to revenge her
ſelf, ſhe fancied that the Prince
of <hi>Sicily</hi> was proud, and that he
would be loath to be deprived of
his Conqueſt; When a Woman
loſes one, the deſign comes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to make another, but it is
only to make her ſelf the more
valued by her former Lover, that
ſhe endeavours to procure a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who is not much obliged
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43299:111"/>
by the paces that are made in
his favour, ſince they all relate
to the affection which firſt of all
prevailed. <hi>Amaldee</hi> as we have
already ſaid, did not examine all
this, he had ſo little inclination
for the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua;</hi> that
he took no notice of her Actions,
<hi>Frederick</hi>'s being out of humor
was capable of making him ſo,
he could not get an opportunity
to ſpeak to him ſince the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that had happened at the
Princeſſes, by reaſon <hi>Frederick</hi>
took great care to ſhun him, he
likewiſe repented his having preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a Declaration wherein he took
ſo little intereſt, and he found
himſelf more troubled at his being
fallen out with his Rival, than he
was pleaſed that he ſtood in good
termes with his Miſtriſs, inſomuch
that his mind being full of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
he wrote to him this Letter.</p>

                        <p>I have a thouſand things to

you are as careful to avoid me, as
I am to ſeek you; In ſhort I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in all your Actions as ſingular
an air of Contempt, as the eſteem
I have for you is particular, was
ever Rival ſeen to do as you do?
When Rivals Converſe together, it is
ſtill with ſome bitterneſs, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they Converſe; but I find
your ſilence more deſpairing than
all you could ſay to vex me. They
have ſome Animoſity in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Concurrence, but they abate
in the reſt, yet you never abate
any thing in yours, nor of that
ſlighting and deſpiteful Carriage,
which I cannot Comprehend. I am
obliged to impute this proceedure
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43299:112"/>
to that antipathy, which you only ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
for a while, that the revival re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
thereof might be the more
afflicting to me now. Why did you
quit it, ſince you did not lay it
aſide for ever, and that you do
not now abandon it for a moment?
Ah! how cruel does your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
prove to me, ſince it was not
ſincere. It is a refinement of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
which you alone are capable of,
however, I have in no wiſe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, Was ever Rival ſeen to
do as I do, you are beloved, you
hate me, my paſſion only ſerves to
render your Victory more illuſtrious,
I am miſerable, endeavours are
uſed to render me happy, and I
oppoſe them for fear of diſpleaſing
you, this is a refinement of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which in my turn there is
only I who am capable of. Alas,
ſince our ſentiments are ſo reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
by their force, why have
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43299:112"/>
they ſuch different Motives: Let
us lay aſide that fatal equality
ſince it produces ſuch contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
diminiſh ſomething of the
durity of your proceedure, and I
conſent to augment the Civility of
mine, or rather let us always
meet in the ſame ardour, and

Conduct.</p>

                  <p>After that he had finiſhed this
Letter, he read it over twenty
times, and did not find that it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
expreſſed all that he had a
mind to ſay; he fancyed that the
terms of friendſhip were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and he could not reaſonably
make uſe of thoſe which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more ſutable. He felt great
agitations all the night, which
ſeemed to him much longer than
uſual, and he was very impatient
that <hi>Frederick</hi> ſhould receive his

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43299:113"/>
that <hi>Frederick</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, or that it would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

it however, and it had all
the effect that could be expected.
It ſurpriſed him agreably, he only

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43299:113"/>
Since you make ſo juſt a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between my Conduct, and
that of an ordinary Rival, if you
examined it ſomething farther,
you would not prefer the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Rivals, before the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a Friend, who can neither
ſay nor do any thing to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage

be leſs concurrence between us,
if you did not love the Princeſs

would be ſomething more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if you had been better acquainted
with the Prince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> you
would not demand of me to abate
for one moment, any thing of what
you divide ſo well of concurrence,
perhaps you would wiſh the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of it, with as much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
as you now have to complain
thereof, you recall that pretended
antipathy, which I have but too

well undeceived you of, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
however I never repented, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
you had had a Miſtreſs. How
pleaſing ought all my unkindneſſes
to have been to you, ſince they
were not ſincere! but is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
refinements of hatred? Alas!
thoſe people hate not much, who
refine in ſo doing; but in ſhort,
why do you refine upon hatred,
when you have a paſſion? this
cruel ſhare I cannot endure; hate
me as a true Rival, if you love
me as a true Lover, have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard

to ſerve for a Triumph to yours.
If your Sentiments were the like

                     <hi>Frederick</hi> had leſs impatience to

that a Meſſenger coming in from

might put an end to all the reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions

Women are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ſeemed to have, of becoming

there was now no more obſtacles

the ſlights that are put upon

all thoſe that can be done to the

accuſed <hi>Frederick</hi> with Juſtice of

for the making him believe at

ſent him back his Letter, with

the ſatisfying her vanity. And

<hi>though I do not ſeem a Lover, muſt
I needs be Treated like the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Miſtreſs, and muſt I be
Sacrificed to my Rivals. His laſt
ſtroke compleats all the other, I
have nothing more to hope, ſince I
am uſed, as if I were the Princeſs
of</hi> Sicily, <hi>I muſt likewiſe do us ſhe
ſhould, and reproach that Perſon with
baſeneſs, whom alas! I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of Perfidy, ſeeing he never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me:</hi> Thereupon ſhe ran to
ſeek out <hi>Amaldee,</hi> whom ſhe found
in the Palace Gardens, and calling
him all the names that rage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires,
<hi>Art thou ſatisfied with all
theſe names,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>And
art thou not better pleaſed with
them, than with my ſilence?</hi> He was
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43299:116"/>
ſo afflicted, that he was not able
to give her one word in anſwer,
and leaning againſt a Tree, he
looked upon her tenderly, and
ſhedding a torrent of Tears, he
at length drew the like from the
lovely eyes of that irritated Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to fall
upon a graſs-plat, over againſt
him, they made a mute converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
more melting than all they
could have ſaid, but ſhe retired as
ſoon as <hi>Amaldee</hi> would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and went into a gloomy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
where ſhe met with <hi>Camilla,</hi>
and the Admirals Widdow who
were in purſuit of her; who
joined together, to ask the; reaſon
of the Treachery that <hi>Frederick</hi>
had done them; they had for a
long time tormented themſleves
they could no longer forbear vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their fury, and were deſirount
of having the cruel delight ofs
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43299:117"/>
putting him ſome moments upon
the rack, who had made them
ſpend ſo many hours in torture;
they come thither together, for
we are only deſirous of being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
when we have ſomething
that is agreeable to ſay; Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they encouraged mutually one
another, and pretended to put
him into the greater confuſion, by
convicting him both together of
the Treacherous Tricks, he had
ſerved each of them in particular;
they made him a Hundred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
which he could not
make any anſwer to, he knew
himſelf ſo well by their motions,
that he was terrified, that he
newly came from doing the ſame
thing, they would never have
done talking, they found ſtill
ſomething to ſay, and people are
inexhauſtible, when they are to
give a looſe to their Paſſion, the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43299:117"/>
violence of their paſſing into their
diſcourſes, cauſed them to make
ſo much noiſe, as that they were
heard by <hi>Amaldee,</hi> who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
that his dear <hi>Frederick</hi>
was engaged in ſome peril, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn by the ſighs he gave,
he anſwered him by others, and
run to the place where there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
an adventure almoſt like to
that he had newly been engaged
in. He firſt ſaw a Cavalier who
diſappeared, and perceiving his
Siſter all bathed in tears, <hi>Cruel
Friend,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>ſee the
ſufferings you bring upon us; Cruel
Friend, your ſelf,</hi> replyed the
Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> ſadly, <hi>Why
do you Sacrifice me to the Princeſs
of</hi> Mantua? <hi>I Sacrifice you,</hi> ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
to her, <hi>I who treat her dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with ſo much Contempt upon your
account? See,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him,
ſhewing him the Letter, <hi>what you
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43299:118"/>
gave her, and which ſhe reſtored to
me. Amaldee</hi> proteſting that he
knew not what it was, did very
earneſtly beg of her to give him
that Letter; <hi>Frederick</hi> could not
reſiſt the deſire he had of ſeeing
him read it; And <hi>Amaldee</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a ſtop at the end, how ſaid
he to him, you do not love the
Princeſs more than you do me?
<hi>How!</hi> replyed <hi>Frederick, and do
not you love her, would to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that I were in a Condition to
love her,</hi> Cryed they both at a
time. <hi>But in good earneſt do not you
love her,</hi> ſaid <hi>Frederick</hi> to the
Prince of <hi>Majorca? No,</hi> Replyed
he coldly, <hi>and if I was ſorry that
you loved her, it is apparently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I do not find her aimable, but
if you do not Love her, why are you
in fear that I do? you muſt needs
have ſome concealed intereſt; I have
one without doubt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Frederick,</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:43299:118"/>
but ſtill, <hi>do not you Love her,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
he again, <hi>let me be ſure of
your indifference for her before I
confeſs any thing: I anſwer you I
do not, ask her,</hi> ſaid the Prince of
<hi>Majorca. Frederick</hi> could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
hold out againſt ſuch flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appearances; and the preſence
of <hi>Camilla</hi> could not put a ſtop to
what ſo favourable a Moment fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him with, <hi>I have been in
Love,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>from the moment
that I ſaw you, and I ſhould ſtill
have had all my indifference, if
you had never arrived in</hi> Sicily.
<hi>Camilla</hi> being charmed with this
diſcourſe, did ſecretly make him
reparation for all ſhe had ſaid and
thought againſt him, but <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
ſtopping, found himſelf in a
fair way, and bluſhing at what
Love had made him do, he would
perhaps, notwithſtanding all his
reflections, have ſaid ſomething
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43299:119"/>
more, if the King had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him, he was amazed at
his taking him aſide to diſcourſe
him, but the buſineſs paſſed in this
manner:</p>
                  <p>The Queen whom a too long
abſence from <hi>Frederick</hi> rendred
uneaſie, had ſent to ſeek for him,
her imagination being full of him,
figured him always with another,
it was neceſſary for her to ſee him
for the calming all her Suſpicions,
ſhe was told that he was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee</hi>
and <hi>Camilla,</hi> which was
ſufficient to allarm her. The King
being preſent when this Word was
brought, ſhe bluſhed at the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion
of the Perſon ſhe had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
which <hi>Berranger</hi> taking
notice of, he looked upon it as a
very ill augure. What ſhe added
afterwards with ſome kind of
tranſport, made him the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive.
<hi>Camilla,</hi> ſaid ſhe to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43299:119"/>
him, <hi>renews her Perſuits, and it is
very convenient to have a Watching
Eye over her. Your Virtue is very
Auſtere, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her
with ſome diſdain, <hi>I perceive that
you are not willing to allow your
Daughter a Lover: but as for</hi> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,
<hi>I ſhall take order about him,
and he may poſſibly be on his way to</hi>
Sicily <hi>by to Morrow, for preventing
the conſequences of an Amour, at
which your ſeverity is ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd.</hi>
Thereupon he went down
into the Palace Garden, thinking
upon the Diſcovery he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made; he met there with <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi>
and breaking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
that had ſo much pleaſed
him, he entertained him with one
that was very afflicting. <hi>Prince,</hi>
ſaid he to him, <hi>you may poſſibly be
ſurpriſed, that I have deferred ſo
long the telling you that you are
Free: but now hence forward, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43299:120"/>
ſhall detain you, all things
ſhall be ready for your going on
Board, and that to Morrow, if
no Body ſtay you here, I pretend to
render Civility for Civility to the
King of</hi> Sicily <hi>by reſtoring him his
Son.</hi> And indeed <hi>Berranger</hi> had
found his Glory to revive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
upon the Queens being in
diſorder, and accuſing himſelf of
having not too well managed it:
He managed at the ſame time his
own repoſe. He paid great Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to <hi>Frederick,</hi> who only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him with a profound bow,
he had not the power to thank
him for a thing which puts him
into deſpair, and for the reſtoring
him to a Liberty, which he found
would be inſupportable. How
ſenſible was the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s
grief to depart in a time when her
Preſence might ſupport the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that <hi>Amaldee</hi> would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43299:120"/>
have entertained of her. To
depart without making her ſelf
known, or to make her ſelf known
when ſhe was to depart, were ſuch
tumultuous reflections, that ſome
time was requiſite for her to come
to a determination, the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no leſs to be pitied than ſhe.
The <hi>Idea</hi> of never ſeeing what we
Love, is the moſt cruel thing that
imagination can repreſent; it was
requiſite that ſhe ſhould ſee him at
leaſt once more. Yet the King
beſieged continually, and the thing
was almoſt impoſſible. In this
preſſing need ſhe was conſtrained
to run ſome riſque. She Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the diſcretion of one of her
Maids of Honor, whoſe Chamber
ſhe thought moſt convenient for
the interview, being there was a
way to it by a back pair of Stairs.
This Woman took care to conduct
<hi>Frederick</hi> thither, who was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43299:121"/>
to imploy his Credit with the
Queen, being ignorant of the ſhare
ſhe had in that adventure. The
King having ſet ſpies to watch
him that Evening; he failed not
to have notice given him of the
way he had taken. The Queen
finding her ſelf indiſpoſed, had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her ſelf upon a Bed of repoſe,
where all bathed in Tears, ſhe ſaw
<hi>Frederick</hi> at her knees, being as
full of grief as her ſelf, he conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her tenderly to imploy her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
for the deferring a departure,
which would be ſo fatal to him:
they were in that poſture when
they heard the Chamber door
thundred open, and ſaw the King
with his Sword in his hand: he
made a full paſs at <hi>Frederick,</hi> who
happened to be firſt in his reach:
the Queen made her eſcape by the
back pair of Stairs, he ran to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
her, but not finding her, he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43299:121"/>
met with <hi>Amaldee</hi> and <hi>Camilla,</hi>
whom we ſent to the place where
all this diſorder paſſed, finding
that his vengeance would be the
more compleat, if all the World
knew it, and that he added to it
the trouble of all ſuch Perſons as
took part in <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Princeſs
of <hi>Mantua</hi> was likewiſe informed
of this accident, by the rumors
that were ſpread of through all
the Palace. Her tenderneſs was
now revived, and ſhe no longer
found him culpable, ſince he had
now expiated his Crime by his
Bloud that was ſhed. Inſomuch
that ſhe ran thither as well as the
reſt; their ſhrieks were heard on
all ſides in that Chamber, and it
was a very lamentable ſpectacle to
ſee <hi>Frederick</hi> weltring in his own
bloud. The Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi>
and <hi>Camilla</hi> embraced one another
in ſhedding a torrent of Tears.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43299:122"/>
Theſe two Rivals were no longer
Enemies, and their common miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
left them no other Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than for the lamenting
what they Loved. It being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to undreſs <hi>Frederick,</hi> they
withdrew, and his wound was
ſearched. But how dangerous a
one did <hi>Amaldee</hi> receive? when
he ſaw an admirable Boſom,
tinctured in ſeveral parts with
bloud, yet heightned its natural
Whiteneſs. This cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
Love making himſelf
known to him in that cruel Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he made him feel it with
all its Violence. The Princeſs of
<hi>Sicily</hi> was Fainted away, ſhe was
thought to be dead, ſhe no longer
breathed. But <hi>Amaldee</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, heard her ſtill Sigh; he
having cauſed that heart to move
again, which he had ſo much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
ſhe opened feebly her Eyes,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43299:122"/>
and caſt a piercing look upon the
amorous <hi>Amaldee,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſhut them again. <hi>Ah! Lovely
Eyes,</hi> cried he, <hi>are you cloſed for
ever,</hi> He imagined ſhe had given
her laſt Sigh, he did the Actions
of a Mad-man, and being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
capable of governing himſelf,
he ſuffered thoſe Perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him, whom the Queen had
ſent to give help to <hi>Frederick,</hi> to
the Apartment of thoſe afflicted
Beauties, he did not acquaint
them with ſo ſurpriſing an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he little thought of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, or of telling them a
piece of News which would
only have ſerved to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
his own deſpair, they
were all in a gloomy ſilence,
which being cauſed by a violent
grief, did lively expreſs it, there
remained in thoſe Princeſſes a ray
of hopes which tormented them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43299:123"/>
more than the entire aſſurance of
their misfortune could have done.
We ſuffer our ſelves to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with rage, when the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is without Remedy, and
there is at leaſt but that Motion
which hurries the Soul away with
that Violence, and which leaves
it not the leiſure to be ſenſible of
all its torments: but when we
are divided between ſmall hopes
and a great deal of fear, we feel a
thouſand Conflicts, which as it
were tore us, and cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but by the loſs of the one or
other. They quickly loſt them
both, to make way for ſomething
that was much more afflicting.
Word was brought that <hi>Frederick</hi>
had been diſcovered to be the
Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> then all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they had ſo improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertained, diſſipating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on a ſudden, they fell into
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43299:123"/>
a kind of Lithurgy, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of which they found all their
Allarms to be ſoft and pleaſing.
In the mean while the Princeſs of
<hi>Sicily</hi>'s wound being ſearched,
was found not to be Mortal,
which News being carried to the
King, he received it as the cure of
all his ills. The Queen no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
gave him any embraces, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hindred him from joyning
the Crown of <hi>Sicily</hi> to his own,
and finding his Honour ſecure, and
his ambition ſatisfied, he learnt
with great ſatisfaction, a thing
that was neceſſary both for his
own repoſe, and that of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He ſought out the Queen to
ask her pardon for his rage, and
was willing to believe, that it
was only to the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
that the Aſſignation had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſince it was but effectually
her. The Queen was ſo confuſed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43299:124"/>
with ſo many changes, that ſhe
knew not what anſwer to make,
ſhe was in fear that it was a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
that the King would put
upon her, and could perhaps have
wiſhed it. Nothing was ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to her, as to learn ſhe
had no longer a Lover, and what
was more that ſhe had not had
one. It was in vain that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to render her a Witneſs
of that Truth, ſhe excuſed her ſelf,
telling him after a ſpightful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which her Virtue too well
juſtified, inſpired her with, that
ſhe was even afraid, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
Sex would not ſecure her
from his Suſpitions, ſince her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
had not been able to do ſo.
Neither would the Princeſs of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>
nor <hi>Camilla,</hi> now ſee under the
proper Figure, the Perſon they had
found ſo pleaſing under one that
was borrowed. They hated the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43299:124"/>
Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> from the time
that ſhe was no longer <hi>Frederick,</hi>
but ſhe did not remain abandoned:
the Prince of <hi>Majorca</hi> gave her all
his thoughts which did ſufficiently
comfort her for thoſe ſhe loſt elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
What a delight was it to
her to ſee her ſelf beloved! this
was a Novelty, ſhe had never ſeen
a Lover at her feet; it is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to ſee one there: but it is the
higheſt Felicity when it is one the
Woman Loves. <hi>Ah!</hi> cryed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldee,</hi>
all tranſported, <hi>Why did
you wait ſo long to triumph over a
heart that ought to be wholly yours,
from the time it was capable of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
I have felt, it is true, ſome
tender longings towards you, but I
loſt the Pleaſure by not knowing the
motions of my heart, nor the merit
of the Object who inſpired me with
them.</hi> A thouſand ſighs with which
he repaired the time he had been
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43299:125"/>
without knowing the uſe of them,
and a thouſand diſquiets he was in
for her Life, did make her ſufficient
ſatisfaction for thoſe ſhe had
thought to no purpoſe. She had not
Courage to make him languiſh
longer without telling him what
he had inſpired her with. As he
was one day Comparing before
her the ſentiments he had had
for <hi>Frederick,</hi> and thoſe he had
for the Princeſs of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſhe was
willing likewiſe to give him a
proſpect of her own, they took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in examining all their moſt
ſecret Motions, and lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
the Moſt happily in the
world, when that the two Kings
conſented to Conſummate their
felicity, and to make Peace by
uniting their two familyes, the
Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> could not
oppoſe it, ſhe had loved <hi>Frederick</hi>
at a time ſhe was to have been
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43299:125"/>
                     <hi>Amaldee</hi>'s Wife, which was
ſufficient to hinder her from being
able to reproach him with the
preference he made of the Princeſs
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> beſides that Princeſs had
tryumphed over her heart under
the figure of a Rival, for to ſee her
tryumph with another under
that of a Miſtreſs; Inſomuch
that the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two days after the wound
was given without giving the
Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> one viſit, ſhe told
the King that having a deſigne to
quit the world, ſhe thanked him
for all the favours he had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon her, and that ſhe ſhould
be full of an eternal acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was very glad to ſee her
take leave of her ſelf, the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to what he projected, being
thereby removed, thus they were
all well ſatisfied at <hi>Majorca.</hi>

                     <hi>Camilla</hi> recovered her Lover and
a Match was Concluded between
her and Prince <hi>Leon,</hi> he had ever
Conſerved for her a Character of ſo
handſome Paſſion, that he could not
fail of being recompenſed at the end,
he had voluntarily deprived him ſel
of the ſatisfaction of giving her marks
of his tenderneſs which diſpleaſes when
a Lover is not acceptable, and he gave
her a full view of it, when that the
Princeſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> had ſent for him by
the permiſſion of <hi>Menfroy,</hi> to whom
<hi>Berranger</hi> writ all that had paſſed,
demanding of him with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the honour of his Allyance. <hi>Leon</hi>

thoſe two things whom no endeavours

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:43299:126"/>
that Love had made uſe of her to
