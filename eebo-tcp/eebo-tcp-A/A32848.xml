         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

King and Subjects, which produced peace and plenty in our

fomenters of these present Warres, under what pretence
soever, nor remembring ought that may increase Iealousies,

            <opener>
               <salute>You Gentlemen and Citizens,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BOth you and your request are welcome to Vs, and
cannot faile of a kind reception here, where your
former merits, and your present good intentions
are so well knowne. It is naturall in the Patient to
seeke cure of his disease, and to move the Phisitian
to use his best skill, and it is commendable in you
under your sufferings to apply your selves to Vs for ease; and we
hope it is not meere impatience urges you to seeke things impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or unjust: your prayers for Peace are Honourable, so was
<hi>Iacobs</hi> wife for children, yet when she cryed, <hi>give me children or
I dye,</hi> she was to blame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for she sought that of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
had no power to give, and she sought the same with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as <hi>Iacob</hi> ought not to have heard. But we will only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that without all impatience, you seeke of us Peace, so farre
as we can procure it, and not absolutely, for it depends not so much
upon us, as the King, and it is not in us to draw the King to a Peace,
except His Majesty be as inclinable to it, as we are. And we will
conceive also that you seeke not Peace nakedly, except it come
along with Truth, Righteousnesse, and Honour, and of such a Peace
we are as zealous as you can wish us to be; and for other Peace, if
we should wholly submit to the Kings party, without all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for future security, such a submission to that Party would be
no redresse but an increase of your present sufferings. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
in this by the whole Kingdome, and that trust we must not
breake upon the solicitation of any part of the Kingdome: you
are a considerable part of <hi>London,</hi> but you are not whole <hi>London,</hi>
and <hi>London</hi> is a considerable part of this Kingdome, but it is not
the whole Kingdome, and we, according to our trust, <unclear>must</unclear> looke
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95975:4"/>
upon the whole Kingdome: but it may be, that you see more than
the whole Kingdome, and may out of that sight offer some thing to
us for the ease and reliefe of the whole Kingdome; in this we
will not gaine-say you, it is possible that some cleere way &amp; forme
of a just, safe, and honourable Accommodation may be opened, and
discovered to you, which hath not yet been found out by us; if
this be so, we desire you cordially, and in a friendly manner to
communicate your apprehensions, and understandings of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire
to us, and by our sudden and full embracement thereof, you
shall soon find how deere, and precious the face, the very name or
sound of Peace is to us: in the meane time we desire you to rest
assured, that if there be any defect in us, it must needs be in point
of understanding, it cannot be in point of affection. No men living
can be in affection more devoted to safe Peace then we are. And
further, we desire you not to censure us of any defect at all, no,
not so much as in understanding, except you can reveal to us some
better way, then we have hitherto assayed. No Accommodation can
be, but we must leave something to the <hi>King</hi> upon trust, and if the
Accommodation be even, the <hi>King</hi> will not deny some trust to us;
but in this, helpe to advise us how farre we shall trust the <hi>King,</hi> and
how farr we shall trust the <hi>Kings</hi> party; were the <hi>King</hi> utterly
disingaged from all parties, perhaps we would wholly trust the
<hi>King,</hi> and desire no trust at all to be left in us from His Majesty:
but we see in the <hi>Kings</hi> party, some that have a strange power in
His affection, yea a greater power farre than we have, and yet
they are knowne to be deeply inraged Papists, violently ingaged
Delinquents, and if you would wholly put your selves and the
Kingdome into the trust of such a party, we are bound to withstand
it, as much as we can. The <hi>King</hi> protests to hate Popery, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowes
all thoughts of Arbitrary Rule, yet we know all, how farre
He is addicted to Papists, and malignant haters of Parliaments: and
since we cannot submit to the <hi>King,</hi> but we must submit to His
Party, who He preferres before us, what advantage is it to us,
whether He be in heart the selfe same, as His party is, or not? The
truth is, we and the <hi>Kings</hi> party are so diametrically opposite in
Religion and State both, that he cannot protect both, if they are
His friends, we are his enemies; if we are his friends, they are
questionlesse his enemies; if he shield them from our justice, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95975:4"/>
must expose us to their injustice; either they must judge us, or we
them, no middle way can be safe, nor deserve the name of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation;
it must prove inevitable confusion in the end. Many
yeares we have already strugled together, and they have all the
while found more favour from the Court then we; but now we
are more implacably exasperated by blood, one against the other,
and they will not lay downe Armes before us; nor ought we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; and if both lay downe Armes together, yet little safety
will be to us; for our religion and profession will binde us truly to
performe, but theirs will bind them to betray us; and since they are
greater in the <hi>Kings</hi> favour, and are loose from Oaths, when we
are discountenanced, and our hands are tyed from defence, what
equality of Treaty is there? We will speake now to you, as we
would to the whole body of <hi>England;</hi> if you prefer their cause and
being before ours, speake it out more plainly: if you wish better
to us, and thinke better of us, be wary of such Accommodation,
as may render us upon unequall tearmes into their hands. You
will say we have received other Petitions with more favour, when
they have more concurred with us in their Votes, we confesse and
justifie it: for when the people have encouraged us by Petitions,
answering to our Votes, and have invited us to be more hardy in
searching their wounds, fearing our too much tendernesse in their
owne case, we could not but resent a better disposition and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of cure, then now we take notice of in such contrary Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
as seeme to expresse a distrust of us, though indeed
your professions be cleane contrary. Yet to deale plainly with
you, and all other Petitioners: we love not to be sollicited at
all by the people in any case whatsoever, except when we doe
manifestly faile of our Duty, either out of too much feare, or
too much presumption. Howsoever for the present goe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
home, and if you thinke us worthy of that trust which
you have hitherto reposed in us, leave to us to consider of this
your Petition with all its circumstances, and assure your selves,
we will condescend to the more hazzard, and depart something
the more from our owne due in our demands from His Majesty,
for your sakes. And if you prefer your owne Iudgements before
ours, proceed to advertise us lovingly and fairely, wherein we
may doe you more good, or how we may draw nearer to a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95975:5"/>
Accommodation, and impart more particularly your open
sence thereof. Howsoever we desire you to addresse your selves
to His Majesty, in the same manner as you have done to us, unlesse
you condemne us as more indisposed to peace then His Majesty is;
and let your request be, that in this valuation of His Party, and
His Parliament, He would be equally pleased to condescend,
and depart from His former rigor of Tearmes, as you expect from
us, or else we must pronounce you in this unequall. And for the
summe of all, let your desired Accommodation be such, as shall
maintaine us to be the <hi>Kings</hi> legall Parliament, and a legall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to be the <hi>Kings</hi> highest Court of Iudicature, and the
highest Iudicature of the <hi>King</hi> fittest to determine all publike dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
and best disposed to mercy, as well <unclear>justice</unclear>; and policy,
as well as Law: and without more adoe your wished Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to the late Answer to their

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE perceive, those Arts which first caused, are
the fittest means to continue this common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If the People (of honest affections generally,
but weak reason, and so easily abused, and made to
advance private ends with a publique consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,)
yet at last faithfully instructed by the sense
of miseries, begin to grow wiser, the great contrivers of these sad
divisions, evidently discerne, the Kingdom is in danger to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to happinesse, unlesse their long exercised malice, can still
prevaile under specious pretences, to keep up that unfortunate
misunderstanding between King and Subject.</p>
            <p>No sooner had we, being the most considerable persons in the
Citty (after too long patience, and a most just apprehension of
pressures howrely growing upon us, so that of late, every new
Vote hath been looked upon as a new affliction,) taken such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to our selves, as humbly to expresse our unwillingnesse to be
longer active in our own unhappinesse, and to sue unto you for
remedy, being desirous to receive those great blessings of Peace
and Plenty, and true Religion established by Law, from no other
hand: but presently under-agents are imployed to continue (if it
be possible) the distractions of this Kingdom, and stifle our honest
intentions in the womb. Alderman <hi>Penington</hi> seizes upon our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
and commits one to Prison, (because it seems he was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
affected to the quiet of his Country, then was convenient for
his ends,) notwithstanding not any thing in the matter of it, was
against any known law, and the manner of it had been so often
countenanced by both your Houses. Out of these considerations,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95975:6"/>
we the Citizens animated by innocency, and a necessary care to
prevent our otherwise unavoidable destruction, with sober cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and honest stoutnesse recover our Petition.</p>
            <p>Next the Lecturers undertake the work, and turne all the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>militia</hi> into weapons of the flesh, exhorting us to fight against
the King in the feare of God, and under the mask of Religion
preaching down peace and holinesle. Yet these virulent decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
prevaile not with us, who were more conscionably instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
then to believe, we cannot expresse our love to God, unlesse
we maintain enmity with men; and who by sad experience have
found the bitter fruits of their so much cryed-up reformation;
wherein the sonnes of peace are become the loudest Trumpets of
Warre.</p>
            <p>This policy being now worn out, and the journey-men-Rebells
at a stand, it concernes the maisters to take the ruine of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
into their own managery. An answer is cast out,
which seems to carry in it the authority of the House, but presents
really the subtilty of those, who have hitherto craftily abused the
Peoples affections into those miserable distempers. Their words
are softer then oyle, but poyson of Aspes is under their lips; for the
designe of it is by a seeming meek complyance with us, who from
our soules desire and sue for peace, to send us away, contented to
ingage our selves in a most unnaturall Warre. It is full of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and such eloquence, as is described in <hi>Catiline,</hi> (the fire-brand
of his Country) which was first to disturbe a state, unable to
compose and settle it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We and our request is said to be Welcome.</hi> Certainly both ought
to be so really, and deserve to be entertained with the greatest
thanks and alacrity by all honest men, as aiming at the publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and common good of the Kingdome. What ever Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
faine of the Celestiall bodies, 'tis to be feared, many inferior
<unclear>Orbes</unclear> in a State have particular contrary motions to that of the
whole. If a kind <unclear>reception</unclear> were truly meant, what can be the
cause, we should meet with such opposition, such difficulties in
the accesse? It requires no deep understanding to look through the
matter: it costs nothing to give good words, and you manage this
affaire very prudently, if instead of a grant, you can satisfy us with
a complement. But your Petitioners are wiser, then to desist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95975:6"/>
empty Courtship, when our suit is of so high concernment, as
the Kingdoms preservation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is commendable in us, to come as patients to their Phisition.</hi>]
What doe they deserve then, who hinder us from seeking a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for our distempers? He who forces sicknesse upon us, may
thereby hasten his own death. <hi>We must not out of impatience seek
things impossible, or unjust.</hi>] Our request is neither vaine, nor
wicked; it desires both what can, and what ought to be done. It is
very easily effected: if you withdraw the fuell, a fire is soon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished;
so if you, I doe not say, correct, but even not foment ill
humors, the Wound will heale of it selfe. The Subject is in so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
a way of recovery, doe but apply the Great Charter, and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right, and he is restored to Health and Strength; that is,
take not our estates from us by force, and without our Consent, and
we aske not Peace, ingage the Kingdom in Warre if you can.
We expect not Physick from you, only prescribe us a good dyet,
that is, let us live by certain and known rules, and we shall not
want letting blood. If Peace be to be compassed by these means,
the desire of it cannot be unjust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Prayers for Peace are Honourable, so was</hi> Iacob's <hi>wife for
Children, yet when she cried, give me Children, or I dye, she was to
blame, for she sought that of</hi> Iacob, <hi>which</hi> Iacob <hi>had not power to
give.</hi>] There is great difference between <hi>Rachells</hi> impatience, and
our humble request, addrest to you as the fittest means under God
to convay unto us the fruits (not of the womb, but) of good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Peace and Plenty. That we live, it is the bounty of
God, that we are destroyed, may be the fault of men. We desire
no more, then what good Patriots may, and ought to performe,
that you would be pleased, not to neglect those means, which most
probably will conduce to the Kingdoms preservation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And she sought the same with such violence, as</hi> Iacob <hi>ought not to
have heard.</hi>] There was not any thing in our addresses, which
could make this observation pertinent. But the doctrine is so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
we could wish, you had declared it sooner, as being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to take notice, the contrary position was once taught, and
made the rule of former actions; <hi>That some things must be done to
satisfy the People.</hi> We cannot be ignorant of the many tumults,
dismissed with thanks, though they (as <hi>Iacob</hi> with God) did even
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95975:7"/>
wrestle with you for blessings. This cleare opening your selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
violent Petitioners, will satisfy the world in the innocency
of those Members, who absented themselves from the House out
of this consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peace depends not so much on us, as the King, and it is not in us to
draw the King to a peace:</hi>] We humbly desire you not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your duty; and we have had frequent testimonies of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
peaceable inclinations. His withdrawing His forces from
our City, after great advantages, clearely demonstrates, He came
up to London with an army, not so much to fight, as to appeare in
such a condition, as you might without losse of Honour consent to
a peace. We must remember with what cheerfulnesse He entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Messengers of peace at <hi>Colebrook,</hi> how gratious a Reply
He returned to the Message, without any mention of former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses,
and such indignities, as private men could hardly have
digested. After this, though provoked with new injuries, and
most unreasonable imputations of breach of Faith, and delight in
bloud; as if He were only sensible of our misery, He seeks to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Treaty by a message from <hi>Reading,</hi> ending with the same
gratious close as that from <hi>Colebrook.</hi> This as yet hath not been
thought worthy any answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We will conceive also that you seek not Peace nakedly, except it
come along with truth, righteousnesse and Honour.</hi> With truth;] we
readily embrace this limitation, as being perswaded the breach of
peace in the Church, by Sectaries unpunished, we wish, we
could not say countenanced and encouraged, hath begot and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht
Warre in the State. Therefore to deale plainly, if you mean
by truth the Protestant Religion established by Law, (to which
you know His Majesty conformes in constant practice even beyond
the strictnesse of most Subjects,) let the Penalties by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appointed be indispensably exacted from all offendors: If you
mean some of your own private opinions, speak them out clearely,
and <unclear>I</unclear> doubt not but the Kingdom will entertaine peace, without
that which you call truth. <hi>With righteousnesse, with Honour.</hi>] It
is very obvious, how Peace and Righteousnesse may kisse each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but how without forfeiture of this, any can take up Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Soveraigne, (to whom they have sworn allegiance)
we cannot comprehend. It is no diminution of your honour to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95975:7"/>
provide for the Kings, (as you are obliged by oath) and to yeeld
Him all those rights, with which the Law hath invested Him. These
are no hard conditions: If you like them, you will have no reason
to prolong our miseries by civill dissentions; if they displease, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it roundly, and we are confident, we shall have no long
warre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we should wholly submit to the Kings party, without all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of future security.</hi>] You are required to submit to the King,
not to any of your fellow Subjects. There cannot be greater secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
then the Lawes of the Land, (and such only your Ancestors
claimed) the benefit of which you shall enjoy, and by which only
you are to be tryed. If you challenge security of any higher nature,
and think not your selves safe, till you have all the power in your
selves, we make no doubt all well-affected People will cleerely
discerne, this is nothing else, but under the name of free Subjects,
to take upon you the Power of Kings. We humbly desire you to
informe us plainly, what provisions you will have made for your
safety, and to open your selves in this point, whether there can be
any possible security in Monarchy. Vnder this forme much must
of necessity be committed to the trust of one. If therefore you
will not entertain peace, as being unsafe to you, because there is a
possibility this one may faile in performance of trust, you clearly
tell us, this Kingdome shall not be quiet, till you have changed this
ancient, and well founded Monarchy into a popular State, and till
the supream disposall of all is placed in you. By this the people
will understand at last what it is they fight for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are intrusted in this by the whole Kingdome.</hi>] This must be
meant of the House of Commons, and by the same Logicke that the
King is denyed His Rights, the Lords may loose theirs, and this
might breed an under-civill Warre betweene Your two Houses.
The trust committed to you by the people, who are the third estate,
cannot give any power, to entrench upon the other two, or either
of them. The performance of this trust is to be regulated according
to the Lawes, so that if You doe any thing against Law, you are <unclear>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable</unclear>
for such actions, and the people is no way concerned in
it, as having no legall authority in such a case. It is not possible, the
People should give unto you, what they had not in themselves,
a Priviledge to breake the Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95975:8"/>
               <hi>You are but a part of</hi> London, <hi>and</hi> London <hi>but a part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>]
It is very true; so the Porters were but a part, the women
were but a part, and the beggers were but a part, all which had the
happinesse to thinke as you did, and so deserved thankes for it. We
challenge no greater Priviledge then was allowed to them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
our desires; to approve or disallow belongs unto you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the greatest reason shall direct. Yet thus much we shall
take the boldnesse to say, though you chance to affect warre, you
must give us leave, to love and pray for peace, and not to engage
our Estates or Persons, (for such right in this case the Law gives us)
if we conceive it an unreasonable warre; for we shall be unwilling
to contribute a part, only that we may bring the whole in danger.
And it may be necessary to tell you, we are much the best part of
<hi>London,</hi> and <hi>London</hi> much the most considerable part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and we have great reason to presume, that the most to be
valued in other parts also, will second our desire, though you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may have different apprehensions of their affections. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the causes of liking and disliking warre, are not the same in
you, and the rest of the Kingdome. You sit in the midst of us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
with safety, whereas others are exposed to the hazard.
Their Hay, their Corne, their Household-stuffe, their flocks of
Sheep, and heards of Cattell, and Horses are subject to the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which makes them disrellish those distractions. It is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile,
if the active men amongst you find in warre a more pleasing
<unclear>tast</unclear>, since they have put themselves into good preferment by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
commands, and the Kingdomes misery, is become their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
So while their trade flourishes, they have no deep sense of
the universall decay of ours in severall callings. We doe not much
wonder, if men that stand upon the shore, delight in tempests, as
often as the wrack is to be shared amongst them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it may be that you see more then the whole Kingdome.</hi>] This
is a pretty kind of Rhetoricke, to endeavour to baffle our reason,
by pressing on our modesty. We compare not with others, (though
we might tell you, in some things we that are standers by, might
perhaps see more clearly, then you, who are playing your game:)
whether in this cause our understanding be weaker or not, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
not us to determine; since this we know, we are bound to
practise, according as that informes us in our duty, and that God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95975:8"/>
(however some undervalue the spilling of Christian blood) will
call us to a severe accompt; and most miserable is he, who shall be
found guilty of shedding the blood of his brethren unjustly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You shall soone find, how deare and precious the face, the very
name or sound of Peace is to us.</hi>] Many dayes are not passed over
since the name would not be entertained with patience. You know
who said, <hi>I like not dawbing;</hi> and that other expression, <hi>I hate the
name of Accommodation.</hi> Certainly it was lesse cunningly carryed.
But it seemes, it was beleeved the people was irrecoverably mad,
and that they would never be weary of misery; or at least, that
they were so much in your power, that he which should dare to
mention Peace, should suffer the injuries of warre. This part would
have beene better acted then: It would have given much more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
if you had embraced the name of Peace with all cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and broken of the thing by perplexed disputes, and sending
unreasonable propositions. Now it will be a worke of greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
to over-rule our understandings, since we have evident
grounds to suspect your affections. We heartily wish, we may prove
false Prophets, but we cannot command our feares (which worke
naturally, and make judgement of the future by what is past,) from
presaging, you will keep up the warre still, but in a more plausible
way; and under a seeming desire of Peace (having perceived the
disadvantage of your open error,) use unfit meanes to effect it, by
proposing unreasonable conditions, so hoping to avoyd the envy,
and yet preserve to your selves the benefits of these divisions.</p>
            <p>The sense of the following discourse is this, <hi>No Accommodation
can be, because something must be left to the King upon trust, and
something to you.</hi>] It will be very easie to assigne the bounds of
these severall trusts. It is done to our hand; for His Majesty requires
no new trust to himselfe, nor will He deny an old trust to you; the
Lawes and Customes of this Land determine both. <hi>But He must not
be trusted, because he is not utterly disingaged from all parties.</hi> Here
is a plaine Declaration, what the issue is likely to be. As long as
the King hath any power left, so long you will suspect his Faith,
and the people must be miserable, so long as you please to be <unclear>feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</unclear>.
Certainly, the meanest understanding can quickly apprehend
this to be a most seditious principle, and all true lovers of their
Country, will looke upon it as the seed-plot of Rebellion to all ages.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95975:9"/>
For all men cannot be prefer'd, and pretences will never be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a King's engagement to a party, as often as ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who thinke they have equall deserts, find they have not equall
preferment. Such men commonly, when they cannot attaine to
great offices, in the discharge whereof, they promise to the people
some extraordinary good, they out of indignation, manifest their
abilities in hurting the State. You object to the King, <hi>He hath a
party.</hi> Alas! this is His unhappinesse, and your fault. He desires and
ought to have the whole. But if you will obstinately persist in this
lay-Schisme, and admit of no condition of Reconciliation, except
He will remove those servants, which in His afflictions He hath
found honest and faithfull to Him, and preferre you in their places,
He hath small encouragement to bestow such favours, (not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by you) and cannot satisfie His conscience in such an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall
of their tryed Loyaltie.</p>
            <p>The next is a stale calumny against Papists and Delinquents.
Though reason be not lesse concluding, because old and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
yet slanders loose their credit by time, because most men
can confute them by experience. His Majesty hath fully satisfied
the world in this point; and the most considering part even of the
people, having long time in vaine expected proofes, are now
growne more stayd in their beleef, then to be led away by a bare
confidence, and boldnesse of defaming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee and the Kings party are so diametrically opposite in Religion
and State, that He cannot protect both.</hi>] The same justice may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
both, if you will returne from whence you are swerved, and
submit to the common rule of Law, which ought to be the measure
of our actions. We most earnestly beseech you, (that we may not
perish, while we are detained in generalls,) you would be pleased
to tell us, what Religion you would have. If the publike forme of
worship, established already, and sealed with the bloud of many
Martyrs herein can be no ground of difference; they professe and
practise it, and will become suitors to you, that you will severely
punish all persons whatsoever that transgresse against it: If you
meane some other Religion, (as you doe, if there be any reall disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
amongst us) let us know what it is, perhaps the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
will renounce their old faith, and like your Creed better.
However, let not the people be blindly ingaged to fight against
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95975:9"/>
their King in defence of their owne, and His Religion, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that, which He and they approve off, and only you dissent
from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If they are His friends, we are His enemies; if we are His friends,
they are questionlesse His enemies.</hi>] It becomes not us to decide,
who are His friends, who His enemies, nor to publish our thoughts,
which may perhaps be guided by that common notion, to fight for,
or against; to endeavour to preserve, or destroy. Friendship and
<unclear>enmity</unclear> here are not to be taken for affections, but for a civill vertue
<unclear>orvice</unclear>, and to be understood in a law notion. They only are to be
esteemed His friends, who are obedient to Lawes; &amp; transgressors,
His enemies. So that a King is enemy to none, as not punishing out
of hatred, but justice. That <hi>some men have found more favour then
others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (we may guesse at the cause of your discontents, by this
frequent complaint) can be no just ground to disturbe a State. The
Kingdome will never be free from Rebellion, if Subjects may be
allowed to give law to the Princes courtesies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Either they must judge us, or we them, no middle way can be safe.</hi>]
The tryall of this Land is well known, which is <hi>per judicium parium,</hi>
by verdict of Pears, it being a way of proceeding equally indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to all; where none have cause to feare wrested explications, or
obscure consequences, verdicts being brought in, in capitall causes,
according to evident and knowne law. We make no question all

(and yet this seemes to be the maine ground of distance.) For
certainly our Lawes have provided for the tryall of it, and the House
of Commons never heretofore challenging a power of judicature,
and the Lords not using to censure any in this nature under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

            <p>
               <hi>They will not lay downe Armes before us, nor ought wee before
them.</hi>] Cleare satisfaction hath beene offered you by His Majesty
in this point, that the Armes should be returned to those hands, in
which they are by law intrusted. The King is invested with the
sole power of trayning, arraying, and mustering, it being most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to reason, as well as grounded on law, that he which is bound

Interest) for their future innocency by oath, they swearing, never

satisfied in conscience, they swore unlawfully, as binding themselves
not to advance the good cause, and for this consideration, as also it

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95975:11"/>
innocence, the authority of the doer. If we, or any part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
shall conceave you faile of duty to your Soveraigne, you have
by this granted us full liberty to sollicite you when we think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We desire you to addresse your selves to His</hi> Majesty, <hi>in the same
manner as you have done to us, unlesse you condemne us, as more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
to peace then his</hi> Majesty is.] We have had frequent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of His <hi>Majesties</hi> peaceable inclinations, in His many Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
continually by you rejected, and we have observed how
long and how much he hath suffered formerly, that He might have
prevented (if malice could have been wearied) this unnaturall
Warre. We thought a Petition to Him for Peace not so seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because He out of His detestation of the effusion of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
blood, had Himselfe (in His Message from <hi>Nottingham)</hi> even
sued to you for it. We extremely wonder, We should now be
put upon this course, for which formerly you have punished o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
It was then a crime to think of making any addresses to His
Majesty, and the authors have suffered for it, before it was known
what they meant to have desired.</p>
            <p>Concerning the matter of the Petition you would frame for us,
(that art hath formerly done good service, and must not now be
forgotten) <hi>that He would depart from his former rigor of termes,</hi> we
must freely acknowledge, we have not yet met with any harsh
proposalls from His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and we believe, if any such were,
they would have been named, you not using to dissemble any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
nor to be over nice in respect to His Regall dignity.
What ever conditions have come to our hands, seem as reasonable
in sense, as mild in language. Notwithstanding he hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
tempted to use harsher expressions, by that freedom you
have taken of accusing him, in such words, as we should count it
incivility to use towards our equalls. Too oft they were so below
the respect due to a King, that they were unfit to be given to a
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Inbriefe, that you may not flatter your selves with an opinion,
we shall easily be put off with generalities, which signity nothing,
we shall take some paines in this businesse, which so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
us, and with our utmost care, and all due respects, descend
to particular Propositions, such as we according to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
shall conceave reasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95975:11"/>
And that we may (as much as in us lies) remove all those rubbs
out of the way to an happy accommodation, which some with
designe and study purposely cast in; we shall for the present make
one Proposition, which carries in it much equality, and (if we
mistake not) will take off all exceptions, which seem to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and happinesse in this agreement: That is, that as His
<hi>
                  <unclear>Majesty</unclear>
               </hi> doth readily consent to all the rights, which belong to
both Houses; so you would with as much forwardnesse, grant what
ever rights belong unto him: and that time may not be wasted in
doubtfull disputes, while the Kingdome lies at stake, that you
would make the Reigne of Queen ELIZABETH (acknowledged
by all to be happy and glorious) the measure by which to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them. This we conceive a more equall way, then for two of
the Estates (especially when the major part by fear of tumults and
Armies is absent) to judge by no rule but their own votes of the
Rights of the third: to whom if it may be allowed to be sole arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Iudges both of Iustice and Policy, both of what is due to you,
and fit for you, both from King and Subjects, the accommodation
that is left can only be this; that, so you may have all that your
selves desire, you are contented to endure peace, and such an one
indeed you had hard hearts, if you would not accept.</p>
            <p>If this appeare more reasonable, we shall not need to trouble our
selves with those involved conditions by you prescribed, the
meaning whereof we doubt in some, the truth in others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you are the Kings Legall Parliament.</hi> That the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are distinct parts of the Parliament, we acknowledge, and the
King never denied it. That you have not the power of the whole
in right (though it hath been executed upon us in fact) you your
selves must confesse, unlesse you will say, that you can make an Act
of Parliament without the King. Wherein we desire you to declare
your sense plainly. If you shall not pretend to this, we request
the Subject may not suffer under illegall names, that is, that an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of either or both houses, may not have the vertue or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
since you will not justify the name of Law in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you are the Kings highest court of Iudicature.</hi>] We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the House of Commons, and much more the Committee,
hath power of accusing only, not of judging; This belongs to the
House of Lords (an appeale being made from an inferior Court,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95975:12"/>
and writs of error being legally exhibited) who are presumed to
passe sentence according to the known Law, and not according to
reason of State, Because this would place an arbitrary power in
them, and enable them to overthrow (the birth-right and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of every English man) our Lawes by Policy. Since there
cannot be imagined a more absolute power, and government ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to bare will, then to determine the same action right or
wrong, as they shall please to call it necessary or convenient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you are <unclear>fittest</unclear> to determine all publique disputes.</hi>] If it be
understood in relation to Lawes, the only allowed rules of decision,
it is granted without any inconveniences. If you will maintain it
in the largest sense, which the words may seem to beare, we are
confident, the people will abhorre the Doctrine; for by this rule
you must maint<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, it is in your power to depose not a King only,
but Monarchy it selfe, if this chance to be the subject of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you are best disposed to mercy, as well as justice.</hi>] We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to expresse these words in plain English, and to tell us
clearely, whether you doe challenge to your selves a right of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
whom you please (which yet hath been acknowledged
this <unclear>very</unclear> Parliament a prerogative only belonging to the King.)
But if this be the meaning, we shall lesse wonder, that persons
highly corrupt, and most known offendors in publique offices, have
been protected from your Iustice, by the Prerogative of your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and that Policy should so farre over-rule Law, that it should be
delivered, for sound State Doctrine, that <hi>former faults ought not
to be <unclear>lookt</unclear> upon, if the party accused hath done good service for the
present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this free opening our apprehensions find a gratious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and (as is by us infinitely desired) prosperous successe, we
shall render you our most humble and hearty thankes; if our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
endeavours shall be necessary, we will not be wanting to our
own and the Kingdoms preservation.</p>
