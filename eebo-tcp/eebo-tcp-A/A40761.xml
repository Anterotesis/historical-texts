            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A few Lines given forth, and a true Teſtimony of the way which is Chriſt, whom the Saints enjoyes who have believed in the light, and followed it into the Regeneration, which they come to know through the preaching of the Goſpel, which hath been received in the Power of God in theſe latter dayes, and hath been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Demonſtration of the Spirit.</head>
            <p>IN love to all who have deſires in them to know the truth as it is in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that they may forſake their fallen wiſdome, which for many yeares they have had in poſſeſſion, yet by it cannot come to know the Lord, nor his way, but are in the dark, though the light of the glorious Goſpel hath long ſhined among them, and the day of the Lord hath appeared, which is it that gives the knowledge of God, and his way; even the Grace of God which hath appeared unto all men.</p>
            <p>Now all people, both Profeſſors and prophane is to mind the fear of the Lord, for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom; and by this wiſdom which is learnt in the fear of the Lord, by it you come to know the power of God in the light, and as you believe in it, you believe in that which is able to the utmoſt to ſave all that comes unto it, ſo as you wait and feel the power dwell with it, that you may witneſſe its workings in you, to the deſtroying of the power of ſin; For while it is ruling in you, you are led captive by the divell, and all who comes not to confeſſe, and own the light, which is the power of God in them, cannot be freed from it, but as any comes to the light, which diſcovers ſin; that is it which gives power over ſin, and dwelling in the light, you dwell in that which never conſented unto ſin, the true and faithfull witneſſe of God, which bears witneſſe in every particular againſt evill; ſo loving this, and obeying this, to forſake ſin as it diſcovers it, ſo you will come to have power and dominion over ſin, through the power of God, and as you love the light, and dwell in it, you will know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take the kingdom in you, which is able to caſt out the devill, and deſtroy all his works; but who comes not to the light, comes not to Chriſt, and are in the reprobate ſtate, without God in the world, alienated from the Common-wealth of Iſrael. But who comes to the light, and believes in it, to be guided by it, receiving it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt the Mediatour of the New Covenant, unto all that are ſanctified, in whom the Lord is reconciling the world unto himſelf by the blood of the Lamb which is ſhed for many; ſo all people muſt come to that which ſhewes them the evill of their way, and turn from it unto that which diſcovers it unto you, which is Chriſt the light in every one of you, for that which makes manifeſt is light, and the light is Chriſt. I am the light of the world, ſaith Chriſt, which lightneth every one that cometh into the world, which whoſoever receiveth, they receive the wiſdom and power of God; Him whom God hath given for ſalvation unto the ends of the earth, whoſe name is called the word of God, Chriſt the light, his Name is called the Word of God, ſo that is it which all people is to believe in, the light, and in it to walk as children of the light, putting off the deeds of darkneſſe, and to follow the light in all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe, having a converſation void of offence towards God, and towards men; ſo all people coming to believe in the light, and following it, they come to that which ſaves the ſoul, and receives him who is Gods ſalvation; and every particular which comes to the Light, comes to Chriſt the ſeed of God, who is heir of the kingdome which hath no end but endures for ever; and who are obedient to the light, it gives power over ſin, and that is it in all, which never conſented unto ſin, but is a ſwift witneſſe againſt all ſin, when it is but conceived in the heart, before it be acted; it ſheweth the creature that it is evill: ſo who believes in that which makes manifeſt, and forſakes the ſin, ſhall find mercy. Therefore all people which lives in ſin, fulfilling the deſires of your evill hearts; Repent and fear the Lord, and come to the light, which will cleanſe and purifie your hearts, and turn you from the evill of your ways, and keep to that which checks and reproves you, it will bring all your ſins before you which you have acted, and them you do now act, and it will bring condemnation and judgement upon you for them, and this is Chriſt the light, the condemnation of the world, the light with which every one is enlightened that cometh into the world, which would ſhew every one the way he is in; For ſaith Chriſt, I am the light of the world, and lightneth every one that cometh into the world; ſo every one being enlightned with the true light, with Chriſt, who is the way, the truth, and the life; every one hath the light, believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light; that which makes manifeſt is light, which light is Chriſt the Son of God, which reveales the Father, for none knoweth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him, whom to know is life eternall; and this life is the life of the Son of God, whom God hath given for ſalvation, that whoſoever believeth in him might not periſh, but have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; And bleſſed are all who have believed, and received it in the love of it, and abide in it, thoſe are ſaved by it, and ſuch have the bleſſing of the Lord with them, they have the ſeed, which ſeed is Chriſt the heir of ſalvation, who ſaveth his people from their ſin, and leadeth them from under the powers of darkneſſe of this world into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light, and to a kingdome which hath no end; And Chriſt the light he becomes their guide and leader, and in all truth they are led, and great is their peace, and ſuch cannot go into ſin, who are guided by the light, for that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſents unto ſin; but who ſo commits ſin, is not with the light guided into it: For ſin is of the devill, and he is the Father of it. For they which follow the light, comes to be born of God an incorruptible ſeed, and he that is born of God ſinneth not, becauſe the ſeed abideth in him, which ſeed is Chriſt, whom Satan hath no part in; ſo all people which knows not the way to the one true way which leads to life, which is a ſtraight and narrow way, they muſt come to the light, and take up the daily Croſſe; for he that will be Chriſts Diſciple, muſt take up his Croſſe and follow him the light; Chriſt he is the way, the truth, and the life; and the Goſpel hath been preached unto nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and people, the ſound hath gone forth, but who hath believed the report, unto ſuch is the Arme of the Lord revealed.</p>
