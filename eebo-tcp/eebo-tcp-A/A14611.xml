            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day he had a faire ambling mare, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he might haue had 5. li. often times: The w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mare of her selfe came in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stable, &amp; prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly was in a great sweat, &amp; did hold her tongue out of her head, &amp; shooke &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge sort, &amp; prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly died, the w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was fleed, a neighbors dog came &amp; fed of it, and thereof presently died.</p>
            <p>Also she saith, not aboue 14. daies past, the said Ioan Robinson came vnto this examinate, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested to borrow a Heyer, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she had vowed not to lend the same: And saith, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in 3. daies after, shee had one of her best beasts drowned in a ditche where there was but a litle water.</p>
            <p>Ales Walter saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> well nere 4 yeeres past, the said Ioan came vnto her, &amp; requested to bie a pig of her: wherto she saith she woulde lende her
<pb facs="tcp:1960:50"/>
one, but sell her any she would not: whereto the said Ioan said y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she would haue none except she did bye it, &amp; so they parted. And prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sowe would not let her pigs sucke, but did bite &amp; flye at them, as though shee had bin madde, when they had sucked aboue 7. dayes very well: &amp; shee saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she sold of the pigs, the which Ioan Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binson hearing, came vnto her, and requested to bie one of them, which she had for 3. d. and telled her that her sowe did the like, &amp; bad her giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> milke as it came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cowe and they woulde drinke, which shee approued, and they dranke.</p>
            <p>This examinate saith, that two yeeres since, she going to the house of Ioan Robinson, found her and her husband sitting by the fire, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after she had talked, Ioan Robinson required to bye two pigs of her sowe that then was to pige: whereto shee said shee woulde see first what shee should haue her self, and would not then promise her any. And the same night her Some piged two piges in the cote where shee lay, and for the more safetie of them, she tooke a broome faggot and laid it close ouerwharte the dore, because the pigs should not come out, &amp; saith the same night all the farey of pigs being ten, came out ouer the broome sheafe, and stoode one before an other in a tract place lieke horses in a teem, beinge al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad to the number of nine, &amp; the tenth was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the pond side being about a rod fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cote.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1960:51"/>Allen Ducke saith, that about fiue or sixe yeeres past the saide Ioan came vnto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate, and requested to bye a Cheese of his wife, but shee made her answere, that shee coulde sell none, yet neuerthelesse shee was very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue one, the whiche shee sayeth, shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed her, and that shee went away in a great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And this examinate sayeth, that the next day he went with his Cart &amp; foure horses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to fetch a lode of corne, &amp; that his wife &amp; two of her children rid in the Cart. And saith, that as he went towardes the fielde he watered his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at a ware called the Uicarage ware, whiche horses when they had drunke, he could not gette them out of the water, but was faine to wade to the forhorse head, it beeing about a yarde deepe, and to take him by the head and to lead him out. This examinate saith, that the said Ioan came vnto this examinates wife at two seuerall times to bie two pigges, whereof hee saith she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, &amp; presently after he had two pigs that died. And saith, that he assuredly thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the saide pigs died of some witchcraft which she the saide Ioan vsed, and the like for the staying of his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses being in the water.</p>
            <p>Iohn Brasyer saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> about two yeres since the said Ioan Robinson came vnto this examinates house, and requested to bie a sowpigge to weane, the which was a moneth old, wherevnto he told
<pb facs="tcp:1960:51"/>
her he ment to weane it him selfe, and that hee woulde not let her haue it, the which being a fat and a well liking pigge aboue all the rest, the next day died.</p>
            <p>Also this examinate saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sithence Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas last past, this examinates wife went vnto the sayde Ioan Robinson, to pay her money shee ought vnto her for wares which shee had beeing due vpon scores: And for that she his wife would not pay her her owne reckoning, shee fell out with his wife: And presenely after he had a cow that was drowned in a ditche not a foote deepe with water: Al which he supposeth was done by some witchcraft by the said Ioan.</p>
