            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thy Patience be not too much discouraged, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture on the little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale of my poore thoughts. I euer rather admired then profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Poetry, the necessitie of my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to which a higher direction
<pb facs="tcp:12097:33"/>
then mine owne choyse hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mee, forbidding the one, and that delight, which beyond ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent receiued in all sorts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hath beene presented to me in this, occasioning the other: yet haue I, as my leasure gaue me leaue, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my selfe in this idlenesse that reliefe, which in other varietie most doe thinke they may iustly vse. I know some whose credit hath chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged respect exceeding strong in preiudice against the composing and reading such trifles, yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of diuers in this kinde, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb facs="tcp:12097:33"/>
by others, whom I haue no warrant to distrust, makes my small experience thinke, that some Muses, like Silke-wormes, spinne a fine threed for necessary vse, as many like Spiders curious webs for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable admiration. His censure who affirmed the reading of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis du Gaule</hi> as dangerous to youth, as of <hi>Macciauel</hi> pernitious to old men, was, as the Author, truly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; yet I presume it extends not to all which without proclaiming ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to wisdome and iudgement, seeme rais'd or fashioned by imagination.
<pb facs="tcp:12097:34"/>
There is, who hath vndertaken to illustrate by places of the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> all the points of the Art of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I will adde (which is as much as <hi>Achilles</hi> his Father desired <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> should teach his Sonne) hee is rude that cannot discerne, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding austere that scornes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue therein, worthy behauiour and carriage both in priuate and common businesse: And one as vnderstanding in the Pollicie of Letters and Peace, as <hi>La Noue</hi> was experienced in the Discipline of Armes, and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled State, by exquisite vnfolding of
<pb facs="tcp:12097:34"/>
some fabulous Stories, makes it plaine, that the Cesternes of these times, deriue the fulnes of their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by no other conueyance then such narrations, from the purer springs of all antiquitie. To whom he had yeelded his assent; who, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his faithfull labours in teaching to beleeue, I know had care he might not be disprou'd, and farther graceth Poetry, with the choise appellation of <hi>the Soules vvoing-Suite</hi>; in which diuers (their excellencie carrying them higher) haue shewed their thoughts not vnfit for solemne, yea
<pb facs="tcp:12097:35"/>
Sabaoth deuotions. And truely, they who will be pleas'd to credit our owne tongue, and age, may finde our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and later Poets, capable of that commendation, which was giuen the antienst among the Greekes: That if their writings were preserued, no part of Learning should wholy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. <hi>Spencer,</hi> hauing as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered Morall, and Heroicall matter for vse and action, as <hi>Du Bartas</hi> (now ours) Naturall and Diuine, for study and meditation. I would not diminish the worthy reputation of other Volumnes; for mine owne
<pb facs="tcp:12097:35"/>
part, it being knowne to some, I haue spent time in them, I should be loth to be thought ignorant of that, which I am perswaded all that know doe well allow. But as the plaine way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth most, the neerest many, so I am sure there are some, who, had they beene shewed that which was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, would haue prooued successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when they haue returned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding empty from Systems and Commentaries.</p>
            <p>What I haue attempted in this subiect, was long since excellently performed by <hi>Dionysius</hi> in Greeke,
<pb facs="tcp:12097:36"/>
and diuers in Latin, whose example hath giuen me some incouragement, but no more direction then <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> to Syr <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> shewing the Straights might be past, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing how. Some places may seem obscure, but I intend it to those who vnderstand, or desire to know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Argument: I haue not touched all, because I would be short, and haue vsed shortnes, as vnwilling to sweat, and make a labour of my sport, as any fastidious lookers on are quickly apt to distast satietie. As it is, <hi>Reader,</hi> I indifferently leaue it
<pb facs="tcp:12097:36"/>
to thy discretion: what esteeme thou wilt be pleased to put on it, is in thy power, how I may valew thy esteeme remaines in mine.</p>
