         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is not in my <hi>Thoughts,</hi> to relate unto your ſelves, what ſome of you <hi>ſuffered,</hi> and what ſome of you did: what difficulties and perplexities you wreſtled withall, within, and without, the walls of your enemies, (The Birds in the cage, and the feild, having ſmall cauſe of mutuall emulation) for that which remaines of theſe things, is only a <hi>Returnall</hi> of <hi>praiſe</hi> to him, by whom, all your works are wrought.</p>

                  <p>1. A Prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet upon Sigionoth.</p>
                  <p>2. O Lord, I have heard thy ſpeech, and was afraid: O Lord, revive thy worke in the midſt of the yeers, in the midſt of the yeers make known; in wrath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mercy.</p>
                  <p>3. God came from Teman, and the holy One from mount Paran, Selab. His glory covered the Heavens, and the earth was full of his praiſe.</p>
                  <p>4. And his brightneſſe was as the light: he had horns comming out of his hand, and there was the hiding of his power.</p>
                  <p>5. Before him went the peſtilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>
                  <p>6. He ſtood and meaſured the earth: he beheld, and drove aſunder the nations, &amp; the everlaſting mountains were ſcattered, the perpetuall hills did bow: his wayes are everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>7. I ſaw the tents of Cuſhan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
                  <p>8. Was the Lord diſpleaſed againſt the Rivers? was thine anger againſt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? was thy wrath againſt the Sea, that thou didſt ride upon thine horſes, and thy charets of ſalvation?</p>
                  <p>9. Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didſt cleave the earth with Rivers.</p>

He that brings Gods Meſſage of <hi>threats</hi> unto his people, muſt returne his peoples meſſage of <hi>intreaties,</hi> unto him. Some thinke they have fairly diſcharged their duty, when they have revealed the Will of God to man: without labouring to reveale the condition and deſires of men unto God. He that is more frequent in the Pulpit to his people, then he is in his cloſet for his people, is but a ſorry watchman. <hi>Moſes</hi> did not ſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 31. neither did <hi>Samuel</hi> ſo, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. neither was it the guize of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his days, Cap. 14 17. If the beginning of the prophecie be, (as it is) <hi>The burden of Habakkuk,</hi> the cloſe will be (as it is) <hi>The Prayer of Habakkuk.</hi> Where there is a <hi>burden</hi> upon the People, there muſt be <hi>Prayer</hi> for the people.

which the Prophet puts far from him: <hi>Jerem. 17. 16. I have not deſired the wofull day, (O Lord) thou knoweſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Prayer, is upon <hi>Sigionoth:</hi> that is, 1. it is tuned to a <note place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> Song: 2. ſuch a Song. For the firſt, that it is a Song, penned in meeter, and how done ſo, (1) to take the deeper impreſſion, (2) to be the better reteined in memory, (3) to worke the more upon Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, (4) to receive the ingredients of poeticall loftineſſe for adorning the Majeſty of God, with (5) the uſe of Songs in the old Church, (6) and for the preſent, (7) their times and ſeaſons, as among the people of God, ſo all Nations of old; of all, or any of theſe, being beſides my preſent purpoſe, I ſhall not treat. Of the ſecond, that it is upon <hi>Sigionoth,</hi> a little may be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The Word is once in another place (and no more) uſed in the title of a Song: and that is Pſalme 7 <hi>Siggaion</hi> of <hi>David:</hi> and it is variouſly rendred. It ſeemes to be taken from the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravit,</hi> to erre, or wander variouſly. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 20. the word is uſed for delight, to ſtray with delight. <hi>In her love</hi>

               <hi>thou ſhalt erre with delight,</hi> we have tranſlated it, <hi>be raviſhed,</hi> noting Affections out of order. The word then holds out a delightfull wandring, and variety: and this litterally, becauſe thoſe two Songs <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. are not tyed to any one certain kind of meeter, but have various verſes for the more delight: which, though it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them alone, yet in them the Holy Ghoſt, would have it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially noted:</p>
            <p>But now ſurely the kernell of this ſhell, is ſweeter then ſo. Is not this written alſo for their inſtruction, who have no skill in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Songs? The true reaſon of their meeter, is loſt to the moſt learned. Are not then Gods variable diſpenſations towards his, held out under theſe variable Tunes, not all fitted to one ſtring: not all alike pleaſant and eaſy? Are not the ſeverall tunes, of mercy and judgement in theſe ſongs? is not here Affliction and deliverance, deſertion and recovery, darkeneſſe and light, in this variouſly? doubtleſſe it is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God often cals his people unto Songs upon Sigionoth:</hi>

They ſhall not have all hony, nor all gall: all judgement, leſt they be broken, nor all mercy leſt they be proud. <hi>Thou anſweredſt them O Lord our God, thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them, though thou

tookeſt vengeance of their inventions, Pſal.</hi> 99: 8. Here is a Song <hi>upon Sigionoth.</hi> They are heard in their prayers and forgiven, there is the ſweeteſt of mercies: vengeance is taken of their inventions, there's a Tune of judgement. <hi>By terrible things in righteouſneſſe wilt thou anſwer us O God of our ſalvation, Pſal.</hi> 65. 5. is a Song of the ſame Tune. To be anſwered in righteouſneſſe, what ſweeter mercy in the World? nothing more refreſhes the panting ſoule, then an Anſwer of its deſires: but to have this anſwer by terrible things! that ſtring ſtrikes a humbling, a mournfull note. <hi>Iſrael</hi> heares of deliverance by <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Duplicantur lateres quando venit Moſes.</note> and at the ſame time have their bondage doubled by <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> There's a Song upon Sigionoth. Is it not ſo in our days? pretious mercies, and dreadfull judgements, joyntly powred out upon the Land! We are cloathed by our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like <hi>Ioſeph</hi> by his, in a party coloured coate: here a piece of <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 3.</note> unexpected deliverance, and there a piece of deſerved correction: at the ſame houre, we may rejoyce at the conqueſt of our enemies, and mourne at the loſſe of our harveſt. Victories for his own names ſake, and ſhowres for our ſins ſake, both from the ſame hand, at the ſame time. The cry of every ſoule, is like the cry of the multitude of old and young at the laying the foundation of the ſecond Temple: <hi>Many ſhouted aloud for joy, and many wept with a loud voyce, ſo that it was a mixt noyſe and the ſeverall noyſes could not be diſtinguiſhed. Ezra.</hi> 3. 12, 13. A mixed cry is in our ſpirits, and we know not which is loudeſt in the day of our viſitation.

To fill <note n="e" place="margin">Namque bonos non blanda inflant, non aſpera frangunt, ſed fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei invictae gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia vera ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Proſy: Epig: in ſent: Auguſt.</note> all our ſayles towards himſelfe at once: to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> all our Affections. I have heard that a full winde behind the Ship, drives her not ſo faſt forward, as aſide wind, that ſeemes almoſt as much againſt her as with her: and the reaſon they ſay is, becauſe a full wind, fills but ſome of her ſayles, which keepe it from the reſt, that they are empty: when a ſide wind fills all her ſayles, and ſets herſpeedily forward. Which way ever we go in this World, our Affections are our ſayles: and according as they are ſpread and filled, ſo we paſſe on, ſwifter or ſlower, whither we are ſteering. Now if the Lord ſhould give us a full wind, and continuall gale of mercies, it would fill but ſome of our ſayles, ſome of our Affections, Joy, Delight and the like: but when he comes with a ſide wind, a diſpenſation that ſeemes almoſt as much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115350:7"/>
againſt us, as for us, then he fils all our ſayles, takes up all our Affections, making his works, wide, and broad enough, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 67. Hoſ. 5. 15. Heb. 12. 10, 11. 1 Pet. 1. 6.</note> them every one, then are we carried freely and fully, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the haven where we would be. A Song upon <hi>Sigionoth,</hi> leaves not one ſtring of our Affections unturned. It is a Song that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every line of our hearts, to be framed by the grace and ſpirit of God. Therein, hope, feare, reverence with humility and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance have a ſhare, as well as Joy, Delight, and Love, with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Enterchangeable diſpenſations, take up all our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all our graces: for they are gracious Affections, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and ſeaſoned with grace, of which we ſpeak. The ſtirring of naturall Affections as meerly ſuch, is but the moving of a dunghill to draw out a ſtinking ſteame, a thing the Lord neither aymeth at, nor delighteth in: their Joys, are his provocation, and <hi>hee laugheth in the day of their calamity, when their feare commeth,</hi> Prov. 1. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to keep them in continuall <note n="f" place="margin">In caelo non in terramercedem promiſit red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendam: quid alibi poſcisquod alibi debitur? Ambroſ. Offic. lib. 1. cap. 16.</note> dependance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> He hath promiſed his own dayly bread, not goods laid up for many years. Many children have bin undone by their Parents giving them too large a ſtock to trade for themſelves: it has made them ſpend-thrifts, careleſſe, and wanton. Should the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt his people with a continued ſtock of mercy, perhaps they would be <hi>full and deny him, and ſay who is the Lord?</hi> Prov. 30. 9. <hi>Ieſurun</hi> did ſo: Deut. 32. 14, 15. <hi>Ephraim was filled according to her paſture and forgot the Lord.</hi> Hoſ. 13. 6.</p>
            <p>Neither on the other ſide will he be always chiding: his anger ſhall not burne for ever very ſore. <hi>It is our infirmity</hi> (at the leaſt) <hi>if we ſay, God hath forgotten to be gracious, and ſhut up his tender mercies in diſpleaſure:</hi> Pſal. 77. 9. But laying one thing againſt another, he keepes the heart of his, in an even ballance, in a continuall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon himſelfe: that they may neither be wanton through mercy, nor diſcouraged by too much oppreſſion. Our tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is therefore, neither always feeding, nor alwayes correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the light ſhall not be cleare nor darke: but it ſhall be one day which ſhall bee knowne to the Lord: not day nor night, but it ſhall come to paſſe that at evening time it ſhall be light:</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 6, 7. ſeeking out Gods diſpenſations towards his, ending in Joy and Light in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening.</p>

Labour to have your hearts right tuned for ſongs on <hi>Sigionoth</hi> ſweetly to anſwer all Gods diſpenſations in their choice variety. That inſtrument will make no muſick, that hath but ſome ſtrings <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> in tune. If when God ſtrikes with mercy upon the ſtring of joy and gladneſſe, we Anſwer pleaſantly, but when he touches upon that of <note n="g" place="margin">Cum vexamur ac premimur tum maxime gratias agimus indulgentiſſimo patri, quod cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptelam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram non pati tur long ius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere: hinc intelligimus noseſſe Deo curae. <hi>Lactan.</hi>
               </note> ſorrow and humiliation, we ſuit it not, we are broken Inſtruments that make no melody unto God. We muſt know how to receive good and evil at his hand. <hi>He hath made every thing beautifull in its time,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 11. every thing in that whole vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety which his wiſdome hath produceed. A well tuned heart muſt have all its ſtrings, all its Affections, ready to anſwer every touch of Gods finger: to improve Judgements and mercies both at the ſame time. <hi>Sweet harmony ariſeth out of ſome diſcords.</hi> When a ſoul is in a frame to rejoyce with thankfull Obedience for Mercy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to be humbled with ſoul-ſearching amending Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for Judgements inflicted at the ſame time, then it ſings a ſong on <hi>Sigionoth,</hi> then it is fit for the dayes wherein we live. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both Mercies and Judgements ayme at the ſame end, and ſhould be received with the ſame equall temper of mind. A flint is broken between a hammer and a pillow: an Offender is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled between a priſon and a pardon: a hard heart may be mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a proud ſpirit humbled between thoſe two. In ſuch a ſeaſon the ſeverall Rivolets of our Affections flow naturally in the ſame ſtream. When hath a gracious ſoul the ſoundeſt joyes, but when it hath the deepeſt ſorrows! <hi>habent &amp; gaudia vulnus.</hi> When hath it the humbleſt meltings but when it hath the moſt raviſhing Joyes! Our Afflictions, which are naturally at the wideſt diſtance, may all ſwim in the ſame ſpirituall channel-Rivolets riſing from ſeverall heads, are carried in one ſtream to the Ocean. As a mixture of ſeveral colours make a beautifull complexion for the body, ſo a mixture of divers Affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods various diſpenſations, gives a comely frame unto the ſoul. Labour then to Anſwer every call, every ſpeaking provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in its right kind, according to the intention thereof: and the Lord reveal his mind unto us that ſo we may do. Hauing paſſed the Title, let us look a little on thoſe parts of the <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> prayer it ſelf that follow.</p>

            <p>Firſt, the frame of the Prophets ſpirit in his addreſſe to God:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115350:8"/>
               <hi>O Jehovah I have heard thy ſpeech and was afraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, his Requeſt in this his condition, <hi>O Lord revive thy work in the middeſt of the years, in the middeſt of the years make known, in wrath remember mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt you have (1) particularly his frame, he was Afraid or trembled; which he wonderfully ſets out <hi>ver. 16. when I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voyce: rottenneſse entered into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The cauſe of this fear and trembling: He heard the ſpeech of God. If you will ask what ſpeech or report this was, that made the Prophet himſelf ſo exceedingly quake and tremble! I anſwer it is particularly <hi>that</hi> which you have <hi>Chap. 1. ver.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. conteining a dreadfull denunciation of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt the people of Iſrael, to be executed by the proud cruel inſulting Caldeans. This voice, this report of God makes the Prophet tremble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An appearance of God in anger and threats againſt a people, ſhould</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>make his choiceſt ſecret ones amongſt them to fear, to quake, and tremble.</hi> Trembling of mans heart, muſt anſwer the ſhaking of Gods hand. At the delivery of the Law with all its attending threats, ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the ſight, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, (though a Mediatour then) did exceedingly fear and quake: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 21. God will be Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all his goings. If men will not bow before him, he will break them. They who fear not his Threatnings, ſhall feel his Inflictings. If his word be eſteemed light, his hand will be found heavy. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. In point of deſerving, who canſay I have purged my heart, I am <note place="margin">Iob 14. 4. Ch. 15. 15. 16. Prov. 16. 2. Chap. 20. 9.</note> clean from ſin! none ought to be fearleſſe, unleſſe they be ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Gods people are ſo farre from being alwayes clear of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Nationall Judgements, that ſometimes <note n="h" place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 15. 2 Chron. 32. 25</note> Judgements have come upon Nations for the ſins of ſome of Gods people amongſt them: as the plague in the dayes of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In point of <note n="i" place="margin">Omnes ſeculi plagae, nobis in admonitionem, vobis in caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem à Deo veniunt. <hi>Tertul. Apol. cap.</hi> 42</note> ſuffering who knows but they may have a deep ſhare! The Prophets book is written <hi>within,</hi> as well as <hi>without,</hi> with lamentation, mourning and woe. <hi>Ezek. 2. ult.</hi> If the Lion roars, who can but fear? <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 8. Fear to the rooting out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity not the ſhaking of faith. Fear to the pulling down of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall preſidence, not Chriſtian confidence. Fear to draw out our ouls in prayer, not to ſwallow them up in deſpair. Fear, to break
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115350:9"/>
the arme of fleſh, but not to weaken the ſtaffe of the promiſe. Fear, that we may draw nigh to God, with reverence, not to run from him with diffidence: in a word, to overthrow faithleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and to increaſe gracious ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the Prophets requeſt: and in this there are theſe two things,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The thing he deſireth:</hi> The reviving Gods work, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring mercy.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>The ſeaſon he deſireth it in,</hi> in the midſt of the yeares.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, that which in the beginning of the verſe, he calls <hi>Gods work,</hi> in the cloſe of it, he termeth <hi>mercy:</hi> and the <hi>reviving</hi> of his work, is interpreted to be a <hi>remembring</hi> mercy. Theſe two expreſſions then are <hi>paralell.</hi> The reviving of Gods work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, is a re-acting of mercy: a bringing forth the fruits therof, and that in the midſt of the execution of wrath, as a man in the midſt of another, remembring a buſineſſe of more importance, inſtantly turneth away, and applyeth himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts of mercy are Gods proper work towards his people, which he will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>certainly awake, and keep alive in the ſaddeſt times.</hi> Mercy you ſee is <hi>his</hi> work, his proper work, as he calleth <hi>Judgement his ſtrange Act: Iſaiah 28. 21. He retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in mercy:</hi> Micah 7. 18. This is his proper work; though it ſeem to ſleep, he will Awake it, though it ſeem to die, he will revive it. <hi>Can a woman forget her child, that ſhe ſhould not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the ſonne of her wombe? yea they may forget, yet will I not forget thee: behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands, thy walls are continually before me,</hi> Iſaiah 49. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the ſeaſon of this work, he prayes that it may be accompliſhed, <hi>in the middeſt of the yeares:</hi> upon which you may ſee what weight he layes by his repetition of it in the ſame <hi>verſe.</hi> It is ſomething doubtfull what may be the peculiar ſenſe of theſe words: whether the midſt of the yeares, do not denote the whole time of the peoples bondage under the Caldeans, (whence <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the inward of years.</note> 
               <hi>Junius</hi> renders the words, <hi>interea temporis,</hi> (noting this maner of expreſſion <hi>(the midſt of the yeares)</hi> for an Hebraiſme) during which ſpace he intercedes for mercy for them. Or whether the <hi>middeſt of the yearrs,</hi> do not denote ſome certain point of times, as the ſeaſon of their return from Captivity, about the middeſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115350:9"/>
of the yeares between their firſt King, and the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> putting a period to their Church and State. Whether of theſe is more probable, is not needfull to inſiſt upon; this is certain, that a certain time is pointed at: which will yield us, <note place="margin">Obſer. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Churches mercies and deliverance, have their appointed ſeaſon:</hi> in the middeſt of the years it ſhall be accompliſhed. As there is a <hi>decree</hi> bringing forth the wickeds deſtruction, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 2. ſo there is a decree goes forth in its appointed ſeaſon for the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, which cannot be gainſayed: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 23. Every viſion is for its appointed ſeaſon and time, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3. then <hi>it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> There is a determination upon the weeks and dayes of the Churches ſufferings and expectations, <hi>Dan. 9: 24. ſeventy weeks are determined upon thy people.</hi> As there is a <hi>three tranſgreſſions and a foure</hi> of Rebells for which God <hi>will not turn away their puniſhment,</hi> Am. 1. 3. ſo a three afflictions and a foure of the people of God, after which he will not ſhut out their ſupplications.</p>
            <p>Hence that confidence of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal. 102. 13, 14. Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon Sion: for (ſaith he) the time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come.</hi> There is a time, yea a ſet time for favour to be ſhewed unto Sion. As a time to break down, ſo a time to build up: an acceptable time, a day of ſalvation. <hi>It came to paſse, at the end of 430 years, even the ſelf ſame day it came to paſse, that all the hoſts of the Lord went out of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 41. As a woman with child goes not beyond her appointed Moneths, but is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be delivered, no more can the fruitfull decree ceaſe from bringing forth the Churches deliverance in the ſeaſon thereof.</p>
            <p>Becauſe there is an appointed period of the Churches humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> and bearing of her iniquities. Iſraell ſhall bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities in the wilderneſſe, but this is exactly limited to the ſpace of 40 years. When their iniquity is pardoned, their warfare is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 2. They ſay ſome men will give poyſon that ſhall work inſenſibly and kill at ſeven years end. The great Phyſician of his Church, knows how to give his ſin-ſick people potions, that ſhall work by degrecs, and at ſuch an Appointed ſeaſon take away all their iniquity. Then they can no longer be detained in trouble. God will not continue his courſe of Phyſick, unto them one day beyond health recovered. <hi>This is all the fruit of their Afflictions; to take away their iniquities,</hi> Iſa 27. 9. and when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115350:10"/>
that is done, who ſhall keep bound what God will looſe? When ſin is taken away from within, Trouble muſt depart from without.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Churches ſorrows are commenſurate unto, and do <note place="margin">Rea. 2.</note> contemporiſe with, the joyes and proſperity of Gods enemies, and hers. Now wicked mens proſperity hath aſſured bounds. The wickedneſſe of the wicked ſhall come to an end. There is a time when the <hi>iniquity of the Amorites comes to the full:</hi> Gen: 15. 16. it comes up to the brim in the appointed day of ſlaughter. When their wickedneſſe hath filled the Ephah, a Talent of Lead is laid upon the mouth thereof, and it is carried away on wings, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. ſwiftly, certainly, irrevocably. If then the Churches troubles, contemporiſe, riſe and fall, with their proſperity, and her deliverance, with their deſtruction! if the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> be the riſe of <hi>Sion;</hi> if they be the buckets, which muſt go down, when the Church comes up; if they be the rod of the Churches chaſtiſement, their Ruine being ſet and appointed, ſo alſo muſt be the Churches Mercies.</p>
            <p>In every diſtreſſe, learn to wait with patience for this appointed time, he that believeth will not make haſt. Though it tarrywait for <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> it, it will ſurely come. He that is infinitely good hath appointed the time, and therefore it is the beſt. He that is infinitely wiſe, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the ſeaſon, and therefore it is moſt ſuitable. He who is infinitely powerfull, hath ſet it down, and therefore it ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Wait for it believing, wait for it praying, wait for it contending. Waiting is not a lazy hope, a ſluggiſh expectation. When <hi>Daniel</hi> knew the time was come, <hi>he prayed the more earneſtly,</hi> Dan. 9. 2, 3. You will ſay perhaps, what need he pray for it when he knew the time was accompliſhed! I anſwer; the more need. Prayer helps the promiſe bring forth. Becauſe a womans time is come, therefore ſhall ſhe have no midwife? nay therefore give her one. He that appointed their return, appointed that it ſhould be a fruit of prayer. Wait <note n="k" place="margin">Bonum Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſubituri eſtis in quo. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonothetes Deus vivus eſt: Chriſtarchos Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, corona ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitatis bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, Epithetes Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſtus. <hi>Tertul. ad Mar.</hi>
               </note> contending alſo, in all wayes wherein you ſhall be called out. And be not diſcouraged, that you know not the direct ſeaſon of deliverance. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening, withold not thy hand, for thou knoweſt not which ſhall proſper, this or that, or whether they ſhall be both alike good;</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 6. But proceed we with the Prophets prayer.</p>

taken from the Majeſty, power, providence, and former works of God, for the ſupporting of his faith, to the obtaining of thoſe good things, and works of mercy, which he was now praying for. We ſhall look on them, as they ly in our way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God came from Teman, the holy one from mount <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>glory covered the heavens, the earth was full of his praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teman</hi> was a City of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> whoſe land the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cen. 36. 15. Jer. 49. 7.

That's Gods coming from <hi>Teman.</hi> See <hi>Num. 21. v.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. When they were deſtroyed by fiery Serpents, he heals them by a type of Chriſt, giving them corporeall, and raiſing them to a faith of ſpirituall ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paran</hi> the next place mentioned, was a mountain in the Land of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> near which <hi>Moſes</hi> repeated the Law, and from thence God <note place="margin">Deut. 1.</note> carried the people immediately to <hi>Canaan:</hi> another eminent act of mercy.</p>
            <p>Unto theſe he addeth the word <hi>Selah:</hi> as it is a ſong a note of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation in ſinging: as it reſpects the matter, not the form, a note of Admiration and ſpeciall Obſervation: <hi>Selah,</hi> conſider them well for they were great works indeed.</p>

               <p>Now by reaſon of theſe Actions, the Prophet affirms that the glory of God covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praiſe. Lofty expreſſions of the advancement of Gods glory, and the fullneſſe of his praiſe amongſt his people of the earth, which attended that mercifull deliverance, and gracious aſſiſtance.

                  <hi>Former mercies with their times and places are to be had in thankfull remembrance unto them who wait for future bleſſings.</hi> Faith is to this end ſeparated by them. <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength O arm of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115350:11"/>
Lord, awake as in the ancient dayes, as in the generations of old: art not thou it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the Dragon? Art not thou it that dried the ſea, the waters of the great deep, that hath made the depths of the ſea a way for the ranſomed to paſse over?</hi> Iſa. 51. 9, 10: The breaking of <hi>Rahab,</hi> that is <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo called here, and <hi>Pſal. 87. 4. Pſal.</hi> 89. 11. for her great ſtrength which the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and the wounding of the dragon, that great and crooked Afflictour <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is remembred, and urged for a motive to a new needed deliverance. ſo <hi>Pſal. 74. 13, 14. Thou brakeſt the heads of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan in pieces, and gaveſt him to be meat to the people in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse.</hi> Leviathan, the ſame Dragon, oppreſſing, perſecuting <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi> thou brakeſt his Heads, his Counſells, Armies, Power, and gaveſt him for meat, that the people for forty yeares together might be fed, ſuſtained and nouriſhed, with that wonderfull mercy. <hi>Out of the eater came forth meat, out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Reciprocation God walketh with his people. Of free grace he beſtoweth mercies and bleſſings on them: by grace works the returns of Remembrance and Thankfullneſſe unto himſelf for them: then ſhowres that down again in new Mercies. The Countries which ſend up no vapours, receive down no ſhowers. Remembrance with thankfullneſſe of former mercies, is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it were, which by Gods goodneſſe, is condenſed into fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing bleſſings. For</p>
               <p>Mercies have their proper end when thankfully remembred. What more powerfull motive to the obteining of new, then to <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> hold out, that the old were not abuſed. We are incouraged to caſt ſeed again into that ground, whoſe laſt crop witneſſeth that it was not altogether barren: that ſad ſpot of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that He rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him, is ſet down as the opening a doore of wrath againſt himſelf, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2. Chron. 32. 25. On the other ſide ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, are a doore of hope for further mercies.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of them ſtrengthens faith, and keeps our hands from hanging down in the time of waiting for bleſſings. <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> When faith is ſupported the promiſe is engaged, and a mercy at any time more then half obteined, <hi>faith is the ſubſtance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver,</hi> now what concluſion makes he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115350:11"/>
of this experience? <hi>in whom we truſt, that he will yet deliver us,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 10. It was a particular mercy, with it's circumſtances, as you may ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 9. which he made the bottome of his dependance. In the favours of men, we cannot do ſo: they may be weary of helping, or be drawne dry, and grow helpeleſſe. Pond's may be exhauſted, but the Ocean never. The infinite fountaines of the Deity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſunk one haires bredth by everlaſtingly-flowing bleſſings. Now circumſtances of Actions, Time, Place, and the like, oft-times take deepe impreſſions: Mercies ſhould be remembred with them. So doth the Apoſtle againe, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 17, 18. He did deliver me from the mouth of the Lyon: (Nero</hi> that Lion-like tyrant) and what then? <hi>he will deliver mee from every evill worke. David</hi> eſteemed it very good <hi>Logick,</hi> to argue from the victory God gave him over the Lyon, and the Beare, to a confidence of victory over <hi>Goliah: 1 Sam.</hi> 17. 37.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this, we are lead unto, <hi>Iſaiah 43. 16, 17, 18. Thus ſaith</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord which maketh a way in the Sea, and a Path in the mighty waters: which bringeth forth the chariot and the horſe, the army and the power, they ſhall lie downe together, they ſhall not riſe, they are extinct, they are quenched as tow: Remember yee not the former things, nor conſider the things of old.</hi> Let former mercies be an Anchor of hope in time of preſent diſtreſſes. Where is the God of <hi>Marſtone-Moore,</hi> and the God of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> is an acceptable expoſtulation in a gloomy day. O what a catalogue of mercies, hath this Nation to plead by in a time of trouble? God came from Naſeby, and the holy one from the Weſt: Selah: his glory covered the Heavens, and the earth was full of his prayſe. He went forth in the North, and in the Eaſt he did not withhold his hand. I hope the poore Towne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note n="n" place="margin">No place in the County ſo threatned.

               </list>
               <p>For the firſt: is it not that brightneſſe which appeared, when the mountaine burnt with fire to the middeſt of Heaven: <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 11. A glorious fire in the middeſt of clouds and thick darkneſſe. The like deſcription you have of Gods preſence, Pſal. 18. 11, 12. <hi>hee made darkeneſſe his ſecret place, and brightneſſe was before him.</hi> As the light, the ſun, the fountaine and cauſe of it: called light <hi>Iob.</hi> 31. 26. Now this glorious appearance holds out the kingly power and Majeſty of God in governing the world, which appeareth but unto few. <hi>The Lord reigneth let the earth rejoyce, clouds and darkeneſſe are round about him a fire goeth before him, his lightnings inlightened the world,</hi> Pſa. 97. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he had hornes comming out of his hand.</hi> So the words moſt properly, though by ſome, otherwiſe rendred. That <note n="o" place="margin">Deut: 33. 17. Pſal. 75. 10. Zech: 1. 18.</note> hornes in Scripture are taken for ſtrength and power needs no proving. The mighty power of God which he made appear to his people, in that glorious repreſentation of his Majeſty on Mount Sinai, is by this phraſe expreſſed. <hi>There his Chariots were ſeene to be twenty thouſands, even many thouſands of Angels, and the Lord among them in that holy place,</hi> Pſal. 68. 19. There they perceived that he had hornes in his hand: An Almighty power to do what he pleaſed. Whence it is added, And there was the hiding of his power. Though the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it was very great and glorious, yet it was but ſmall to the everlaſtingly hidden depths of his omnipotency:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(The moſt glorious appearance of God comes infinitly ſhort of his own eternall Majeſty as he is in himſelfe:</hi> it is but a diſcovery, that there is the hiding of infinite perfection.) Or, there his power appeared to us, which was hidden from the reſt of world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When God is doing great things, he gives glorious manifeſtations of his <note place="margin">Obſer. 8.</note>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:115350:12"/>
excellencies to his ſecret ones.</hi> The appearance on Sinai, goes before his paſſage into Canaan. <hi>Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecrets unto his ſervants the Prophets.</hi> Amos 3. 7. When he is to ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> for the deliverance of his people, he appeares to him in a burning unconſumed buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2. a ſigne manifeſting the preſence of his power, to preſerve his Church unconſumed in the middeſt of burning fiery Afflictions. Vnto this very end, were all the viſions, that are recorded in the Scripture; All of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the things which God was preſently doing. And this he doth:</p>
               <p>That they may thereby be prepared to follow him, and ſerve <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> him in the great works he hath for them to do. Great works are to be done without great incouragements. If God appeares not in light, who can expect he ſhould appeare in operation? He that is called to ſerve providence in high things, without ſome eſpeciall <note place="margin">John 12. 35. Revel: 16. 10.</note> diſcovery of God, works in the darke, and knowes not whither he goes, nor what hee doth. Such a one travailes in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without a directing cloud. Cleare ſhining from God, muſt be at the bottome of deepe labouring with God. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo many in our days, ſet their hands to the plow, and looke back againe? begin to ſerve providence in great things, but cannot finiſh? give over in the heat of the day! They never had any ſuch Revelation of the mind of God upon their ſpirits, ſuch a diſcovery of his excellencies, as might ſerve for a bottome of ſuch undertakings. Men muſt know that if God hath not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them in brightneſſe, and ſhewed them the hornes in his hand, hid from others, though they thinke highly of themſelves, they'l deny God twice and thrice, before the cloſe of the work of this Age. If you have no great diſcoveries, you will wex vaine in great undertakings. Now workings on old bottomes, are like new wine in old bottels, both are ſpoyled and loſt. The day is the time of work, and that becauſe of the light thereof: thoſe who have not light may be ſpared to go to bed.</p>
               <p>That they may be the better enabled to give him glory, when <note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> they ſhall ſee the ſweet Harmony that is between his Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and his Operations. When they can ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>as we have heard, ſo have we ſeene,</hi> Pſal. 48. 8. as he revealeth himſelfe, ſo he worketh. When his power and mercy anſwer his appearance in the buſh, it is a foundation to a prayer, <hi>The good will of him that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115350:13"/>
dwelt in the buſh, bleſſe thee.</hi> When a ſoule ſhall finde God calling him forth to Employments, perhaps great and high, yet every way ſuiting that light and gracious diſcovery which he hath given of himſelfe, one thing Anſwering another, it ſets him in a frame of honouring God aright.</p>
               <p>This might be of rich conſideration could we attend it: for hence <note place="margin">Vſe</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As I ſaid before, is Apoſtaſy from Gods work. He appeares not unto me, how can they go upon his Imployment? Men that have no viſion of God, are in the darke, and know not what to doe. I ſpeak not of viſions beyond the word, Anſwers of prayers, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous applications of providences, with wiſe conſiderations of times and ſeaſons. Some drop off every day, ſome hang by the ey-lids, and know not what to do; The light of God is not ſent forth to lead and guide them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. 3. wonder not at the ſtrange back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings of our days, many acted upon by-ingagements, and for want of light, know not to the laſt what they were adoing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo is the ſuiting of great light, and great worke, in our days. Let new light be derided whileſt men pleaſe, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerve the Will of God in this Generation, who ſees not beyond the line of foregoing ages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this thirdly, may put all thoſe, whom God is pleaſed to imploy in his ſervice, upon a diligent Inquiry into his mind. Can a ſervant do his maſters work, without knowing his pleaſure? we live for the moſt part from hand to mouth, and do what comes next: few are acquainted with the deſignes of God.</p>

Something of the ſame kind is doubtleſſe here held out: he ſent plagues and diſeaſes among them to weaken and conſume them, before his peoples entrance.

               </p>

Doubtleſſe God is pleading with all theſe Kingdomes for their incroaching. They who will not let him be at peace with his, ſhall have little quiet with their own. The Eagle that ſtole a coale from the Altar, fired her neſt. I know how this hath been abuſed to countenance the holding of Babyloniſh wedges. God will preſerve to his people his own allowance, not Romes ſupplyment. This Nation hath yet itching ſingers, and a hankering minde after the inheritance of Gods people: Let them take heed, he hath knocked off their hands an hundred times, and ſent them away with bloudy fingers. O that we were wiſe, that we be not quite conſumed. Of you I hope better things, and ſuch as accompany ſalvation, yet give me leave to cautionate you a little.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to priviledges and liberties of this life. Their liberties and eſtates, are not as other mens: but more exactly meaſured for their good, and ſanctifyed to them in the bloud of Chriſt. If in theſe things God hath called you to the defence and protection of his, he will expect a reall account. You had better give away a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

that belongs to others, then the leaſt of that which God hath made for his Saints. Think not any thing ſmall, which God accounts worthy to beſtow on his. If he hath meted out li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for them, and you give them ſlavery, you will have a ſad reckoning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In point of Ordinances, and Chriſt purchaſed priviledges: <note n="r" place="margin">Nero primus in Chriſtianos ferociit: <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Is it for any of you, O ye ſons of men, to meaſure out Gods childrens por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, long ſince bequeathed them by Chriſt? Let them alone with what is given them.

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Faith looketh backwards and forwards, to what God hath done, and to what he hath promiſed to do: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw the Day of Chriſt, ſo many Ages after, becauſe he found it by faith in the promiſe: <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſaw the terrors of <hi>Cuſhan</hi> and <hi>Midian</hi> ſo many Ages before, becauſe faith found it recorded among the works of God to ſupport it ſelfe in ſeeking the like mercies to be renewed: ſo that this is the ſum of this Verſe.</p>
               <p>O Lord, faith makes it evident, and preſents it before my view, how in former days, when thou waſt doing great things for thy people, thou ſilledſt all thine, and their enemies, with fear, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, trembling and aſtoniſhment.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, that faith gives a preſent, &amp;c. the Apoſtle tels us, that <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> Heb. 11. 1.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of things hoped for:</hi> it looks forward to the promiſes, and ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115350:18"/>
gives the ſubſtance of them in preſent poſſeſſion, ſo confirming our Minds and Hearts, that they may have a ſubſiſtance as it were within us, though not actually made out unto us. 2. <hi>It is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeene:</hi> it extends it ſelfe not only to things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but taking for its Object the whole Word of God, it makes evident, and preſent, things that are paſt alſo. The faith commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>v.</hi> 3. is of things long ſince done, even the <hi>making of the things that are ſeene of the things that do not appeare. Abraham ſaw my day ſaith our Saviour,</hi> Joh. 8. 56. He ſaw it as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the tents of <hi>Cuſhan</hi> in affliction. Faith made it preſent to him: All the Ages between him and his promiſed ſeed were as nothing to his keen-ſighted faith. Hence the Apoſtle puts the mercies of the promiſe, all in one forme and rank as already wrought, though ſome of them were injoyed and ſome of them in this life cannot be. <hi>Rom. 8. 30. whom he hath juſtifyed, them he hath glorifyed:</hi> He hath done it for them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, becauſe he hath made them believe it, and that gives it a preſent ſubſiſtance in their ſpirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for forepaſt works, they are ſtill mentioned by the Saints, as if they had bin done in their days, before their eyes. <hi>Eliſha</hi> calls up to remembrance a former Miracle, to the effecting the Like, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>There be three things, in paſt, or future mercies, which faith makes preſent to the ſoule, giving in the ſubſiſtance of them, 1. their Love, 2. their Conſolation, 3. their Uſe and Benefit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Love</hi> of them: the Love, that was in former works, and the Love that is in promiſed mercies, that faith drawes out, and really makes ours. The Love of every recorded deliverance, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us by faith. It looks into the Good-will, the Free-grace, the Loving-kindneſſe of God, in every work that ever he did for his, and cryes, <hi>yet this is mine:</hi> this is the kernell of that bleſſing, and this is mine: for the ſame Good-will, the ſame kindneſſe he hath towards me alſo. Were the ſame outward actings needfull, I ſhould have them alſo. The Free-love of every mercy is Faiths proper Object. It makes all <hi>Joſhuah's</hi> great victories, preſent to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us. The promiſe that had the Love and Grace in it which run through them all, is given him: <hi>Joſh. 1. 5. I will be with thee, I will not faile thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Now the Apoſtle tells us, that the truth and love of this promiſe is ours, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. Faith may, doth aſſure it ſelfe, that what good-will ſoever, was in all the great mercies which <hi>Joſhuah</hi> received upon that promiſe, is all ours.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115350:19"/>
All the good-will and choyſe Love of, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> is mine and thine, if we are believers. He that hath this preſent, hath all <hi>Joſhuas</hi> victories preſent. The very glory of the Saints in Heaven is ours in the love of it. We enjoy that love, which gave them glory, and will Crowne us alſo in due time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their comforts and refreſhments. <hi>Thou gaveſt Leviathan to be meate to the people in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> Pſal. 14. They fed their ſouls full of the ſweetneſſe of that mercy, The deſtruction of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing tyrant: we <hi>chew the cud</hi> upon the bleſſings of former ages. Who hath not with joy delight and rayſed affections, gone over the old preſervations of the Church in former years? How doe's <hi>David</hi> run them over with admiration, cloſing every ſtop with, <hi>His mercy endureth for ever?</hi> Pſal. 136. And for things to come, as yet in the promiſe only, whether generall to the whole Church, as the calling of the Jews, the comming in of the fulneſſe of the Gentiles, the breaking out of light, beauty and glory upon the Churches and Saints, the confuſion of Nations, not ſubjecting themſelves to the ſtandard of the Goſpell, &amp;c. or in particular, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance of love then preſently enjoyed, neerer Communion with Father and Son, being with Chriſt, freed from miſery and corruption, dwelling with God for ever, how do's Faith act over theſe and the like things in the heart, leaving a ſavour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of their ſweetneſſe continually upon the ſoule? O how ſweet alſo are the things of the World to come unto poor Believers! Chriſt leads the ſoule by faith, not only into the Chambers of preſently-enjoyed loves, but alſo into the foreprepared everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manſions in his Fathers houſe. Thus it gives poore mortall creatures, a ſweet reliſh of eternall joyes: brings Heaven into a Dungeon, glory into a priſon, a crown into a cottage, Chriſt into a ſlaughter-houſe.</p>
               <p>From the nature of Faith: Though it do not make the thing <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> believed to be, (the Act cannot create its own Object,) yet apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, it makes it the Believers. It is the bond of union between the ſoule and the thing promiſed. <hi>He that believes in Chriſt,</hi> by that believing <hi>receives Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. he becomes his. It is a grace uniting its ſubject and object, the perſon believing, and the thing believed. There needs no aſcending into Heaven or deſcending, the word of faith makes all things nigh, even within us. Some <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 6, 7.</note>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:115350:19"/>
glaſſes will preſent things of a great diſtance very neere: Faith looking through the glaſſe of the Goſpell, makes the moſt remote mercies to be not onely in a cloſe diſtance, but in Union. It is the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for, that which they have not in themſelves, it gives them in the full aſſured minds of believers.</p>
               <p>From the Intendment of all mercies: they are for every <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> believer. All things are theirs, <hi>world, life, death, things preſent, things to come,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 22. All promiſes being made to every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and all mercies being the fruit of theſe promiſes, they muſt all belong to every believer. Now if all theſe ſhould be kept from us at that diſtance wherein they fall in their accompliſhment in reſpect of time, what would they availe us? God therefore hath appointed that they ſhall have a reall, though not a naturall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſubſiſtence at all times, to all believers.</p>

Forget not your pearles, ſcatter not away your treaſure, bee rich in a heape of Mercies, Faith will make you ſo. The Love, the comfort, the benefit of all former and future bleſſings are yours, if you know how to uſe them. Oh how have we loſt our mercies in every hedge and ditch! Have none of us skill to lay up the laſt eminent deliverance againſt a rainy day?</p>

Gather up what is already caſt out, and fetch the reſt from heaven. Bring the firſt fruits of Glory into thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. See the Jewes called, the reſidue of Oppoſers ſubdued, the Goſpel exalted, Chriſt enthroned, all thy ſinnes pardoned, Corruption conquered, Glory enjoyed.

The portion God meaſureth out unto his people is in diſtinguiſhing mercies, differencing bleſſings: in ſuch things as the world hath not, giveth not. Now this is that, which envy takes for its proper Object. That others ſhould have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above them, beyond them, this envious men cannot beare.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sea:</hi> that is the Red Sea, which in like manner was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21. which the Prophet alſo admires in the forecited Pſalme: <hi>the Sea ſaw it and fled: what ayledſt thou, O thou Sea that thou fledſt?</hi> what ſtrong mighty impreſſion of power was on thee, that the multitudes of thy waters ſhould be parted, and thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell diſcovered dry to the bottome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thou diddeſt ride upon thy horſes and thy chariots of ſalvation.</hi> This you have againe v. 15. <hi>thou diddeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> walke through the Sea with thine horſes.</hi> Theſe were thoſe Clouds and Windes which the Lord ſent before the <hi>Izraelites,</hi> to the Sea and Jordan, to drive them back. <hi>He maketh the cloudes his chariots, and walketh upon the wings of the wind</hi> Pſal. 104. 3. ſo Pſal. 18. 11. <hi>hee did fly upon the wings of the Wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the manner of men, God is repreſented as a mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, riding before his armies and making way for them. The Power and Majeſty of God, was with, and upon thoſe clouds and winds, which went before his people, to part thoſe mighty waters, that they might paſſe dry: And therefore they are called his ſaving chariots, becauſe by them his people were delivered.</p>
               <p>Or by horſes and chariots here, you may underſtand the Angels, who are the Hoſt of God. <hi>Pſal. 68. 17. The chariots of God are twenty thouſands, even thouſands of Angels,</hi> They have appeared as horſes and chariots of fire, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 17. And their Miniſtry no doubt the Lord uſed in theſe mighty works of drying Rivers, and dividing Seas. Either way, the glorious Power and Majeſty of God, in his delivering inſtruments, is ſet forth.</p>
               <p>Thus the words ſeverally, now joyntly.</p>
               <p>This admiring Interrogation includes a Negation. <hi>Was the Lord kindled againſt the Rivers, was thy face againſt the Rivers, &amp;c.</hi> was it that the deep had offended the moſt high, that by thine Angels,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115350:23"/>
winds and clouds, thou diddeſt ſo diſturbe the flouds in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient courſe, and madeſt naked their hidden channells, untill the hoary deep cryed out for feare, and lifted up his aged hands to the Almighty as it were for pity, <hi>v.</hi> 10? No ſurely, no ſuch thing; All thoſe keep the order by thee unto them appointed; it was all for the ſalvation and deliverance of thy people. God was not angry with <hi>Jordan</hi> when he drove it back, nor with the Sea when he divided it, but all was effected for Iſraels deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The very ſenſeleſſe creatures, are as it were ſenſible of the wrath and</hi>

               <p>God often in the Scripture ſets forth his power and Majeſty, by the trembling of Heaven, and the ſhaking of the earth, the vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mountaines, and the bowing of perpetuall hills, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed humble ſubjection of the moſt eminent parts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Sea ſhall fly as afraid, the Rocks as weake rend and crumble, the Heavens be darkened, <hi>the Mountaines skip like Rams, and the little hills like young ſheep,</hi> Pſal. 114. 4.

purpoſes towards his Own. Obedience in ſenſleſſe Creatures, is naturall, even againſt the courſe of nature in the ſeaſon of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Sun ſtand thou ſtill upon Gibeon, and thou Moone in the valley of Ajalon,</hi> Joſh. 10. 12. <hi>Who art thou, O great Mountaine?

There is a ſtrength in every promiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of God unto his people, that is able to carry the whole frame of Heaven and Earth before it. If they can believe, all things are poſſible to them that believe. When the Decree is to bring forth, the fruit of the promiſe, it will overturne Empires, deſtroy Nations, divide Seas, ruine Armies, open Priſons, break Chaines and Fetters, and beare down all before it. As the winde ſhut up in the Earth, will ſhake the pillars as it were of its mighty body, but it will find or make a paſſage. The leaſt promiſe of deliverance, if the ſeaſon thereof be come, though it were ſhut up under ſtrong and mighty powers, crafty counſells, dungeons and priſons, like the doores and laſting barres of the Earth, the truth and power of God ſhall make them all to tremble, and give birth to his peoples deliverance.</p>
               <p>Have we ſeene nothing of this in our days?

               </list>
               <p>The propoſition holds out two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What God did,</hi> he made his Bow quite naked.</item>

               <p>The aſſertion of this Verſe, is not of ſome particular act, or work, as the former, but a generall head or fountaine of thoſe particular works, which are ennumerated in the following Verſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Bow</hi> is a weapon of War, an inſtrument of death, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcribed to God after the manner of men, holds out, his ſtrength, power, might, and efficacy to do what ever he pleaſeth. And this is ſaid to be <hi>quite naked:</hi> when a man goes about to uſe his Bow, he pulls it out of his Quiver, and ſo makes it naked. The exerciſing of Gods Power, is the <hi>making naked of his Bow.</hi> This he did in all thoſe wonders, wherein he ſtretched out his hand, in bringing his people into the promiſed Land, here pointed at. And it is ſaid that with nakedneſſe it was made naked, becauſe of thoſe very high diſpenſations and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Almighty Power. <hi>This is the making naked of his Bow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">

2. For the <hi>Rule</hi> of this, it is the <hi>Oathes of the Tribes,</hi> or as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">SERM. 2.</note> his <hi>word.</hi> The Oathes of the Tribes, that is the Oaths made to them: the Word he ſtood ingaged to them in. The promiſe God made by Oath unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would give him the Land of Canaan, for an inheritance, even to him, and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 7, 13, 14, 15. is here intimated. This promiſe was often renewed to him and the following Patriarches. Hence it is called <hi>Oathes,</hi> though but the ſame promiſe often renewed: And it had the nature of an Oath, becauſe it was made a Covenant. Now it was all for the benefit of the ſeverall Tribes, in reſpect of actuall poſſeſſion, and was laſtly renewed to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 17. Hence called the Oaths of the Tribes: not which they ſware to the Lord, but which the Lord ſware to them. So afterwards it is called his word. Thy word. This then is the purport of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall propoſition.</p>
               <p>O Lord according as thou promiſedſt, and ingagedſt thy ſelfe by Covenant to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with their poſterity, that thou wouldeſt give them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be theirs for an inheritance, ſo by the diſpenſation of thy mighty power, thou haſt fully accompliſhed it: and this he layeth down for the ſupportment of faith in a time of trouble.</p>
               <p>The words would afford many obſervations, I ſhall inſiſt only on one.</p>
               <p>

This is ſtill the cloſe of all gratious iſſues of providence, God hath done all <hi>according as be promiſed.</hi> Joſh. 22. 4. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 21.

What obſtacles ſoever may lie in the way he hath done it, he will do it. Take one inſtance, particular places are too many to be inſiſted on. It was the purpoſe of his heart, to bring his Elect home to himſelfe, from their forlorne loſt condition. This he engageth himſelfe to do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. aſſuring <hi>Adam</hi> of a recovery from the miſery he was involved in by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> prevalency. This ſurely is no eaſy work. If the Lord will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115350:26"/>
have it done, he muſt lay out all his Attributes in the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the uttermoſt. His wiſdome and power muſt bow their ſhoulders (as it were) in Chriſt unto it: he was the <hi>power of God and the wiſdome of God.</hi> His ingaged Love muſt be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 24.</note> through ſo many ſecret myſterious marvels, as the Angels themſelves deſire to looke into, and ſhall for ever adore. Though <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> the effecting of it, required that which <hi>man</hi> could not do, and <hi>God</hi> could not ſuffer, yet his wiſedome will find out a way, that he ſhall both do it, and ſuffer it, who is both God and Man. To make good his engagement to his elect, he ſpared not his onely Son: and in him were hid, and by him layd out, all the treaſures <note place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note> of wiſdom and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now this is a preſident, of Gods proceeding in all other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements whatſoever. What ever it coſt him, he will ſpare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make them good to the uttermoſt. He is our Rock and his worke is perfect.

               <p>His people ſtand in need of all, that God hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> to them for. Gods promiſes are the juſt meaſure of his peoples wants. Whatever he hath promiſed, that his people do abſolutely want. And whatſoever they want, that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. <hi>Our Wants, and his promiſes are every way commenſurate.</hi> If thou knoweſt not, what thou ſtandeſt in need of, ſearch the Promiſes and ſee. What ever God hath ſaid he will do for thee, that thou haſt abſolute need ſhould be done. Or if thou art not ſo well acquainted with the promiſes, ſearch thine own wants, what thou ſtandeſt abſolutely in need of for thy good, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly God hath promiſed. If then this be the caſe of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they ſhall all be made good. Thinke you, will God let his people want that which they have abſolute neceſſity of? By abſolute neceſſity I meane ſuch as is indiſpenſible, as to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate and occaſions. That may be of neceſſity in one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is not in another: according to the ſeverall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments we are called to. Does God call forth his Saints, <hi>to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and puniſhments upon the people, to bind their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of Iron, to execute upon them the judgement written,</hi> as Pſal. 149. 7, 8, 9? doth he bring them forth to burne the whore, to fight with the <note place="margin">Revel. 17. 14.</note> Beaſt and overcome him, and his followers? it is of indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity, that he give them glorious aſſiſtance in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. They ſhall be aſſiſted, protected, carried on, though it coſt him the making of his Bow quite naked. According to the ſeverall conditions he calls them to, the ſeverall iſſues of Providence, which he will have them ſerve in, ſo want they his Appearance, in them, with them, for them, and it ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Let them be aſſured they are in his way, and then though ſome prove falſe and treacherous, ſome baſe and cowardly, though many combine and Aſſociate themſelves againſt them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115350:27"/>
in many places, in all places, though whole Kingdomes and mighty Armies appeare for their ruine, be they reviled and clamoured, by all round about them, all is one, Help they need, and help they ſhall have, or God will make his Bow quite naked.</p>
               <p>This day is this <hi>Doctrine</hi> fulfilled before us. Gods Bow made quite naked according to his Word. We are leſſe then all the <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> Truth hee hath ſhewed unto us. Though great working and mighty power hath been required, ſuch as he hath not ſhewen in our dayes, nor in the dayes of our Fathers, yet the Lord hath not ſtood at it, for his words ſake, wherein he hath made us put our truſt. I ſpeake of the Generall mercies we have received. The ſurrender of Colcheſter the particular celebrated this day, though marching in the Reare for time, is for the weight in the Van. <hi>A mercy of the firſt magnitude. Eſſex</hi> hath ſeene more power, in a three moneths recovery, then in the protection of ſix years.</p>
               <p>That the mouths of men are ſtopped, and their faces filled with ſhame, who made it their trade to revile and threaten the Saints of God, that the adverſe ſtrength, which hath lien hid theſe ſeven years, ſhould be drawn forth united and broken to pieces; that the people of God, divided, and mutually exaſperated through their abuſe of peace, ſhould by the ſword of a common enemy, and the help of a common friend, have their wrath abated, their counſells united, and their perſons ſet in a hopefull way, of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or forbearance; that God by their owne counſells ſhould ſhut up men collected from ſu dry parts to ruine others, in a City with Gates and Walls for their own ruine; that they ſhould deny peace tendred upon ſuch conditions, becauſe of the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the time, as might have left them power, as well as will for a further miſchiefe; that ſuch ſalvation ſhould go forth in other parts, as that the proceedings here, ſhould not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; that the bitter ſervice which men here underwent, ſhould ever and anon be ſweetned with refreſhing tidings from other places, to keepe up theie ſpirits in wet, watching, cold and loſſe of bloud; All theſe I ſay, and ſundry others, ſuch like things as theſe, are the Lords doing, and marvellous in our eyes.

When God is in none of the thoughts of men by his feare, he is in them all by his providence. The Sun is operative with his heate, where he reacheth not with his light, and hath an influence on pretious Mineralls, in the depths and darke bottomes of Rocks and Mountaines. The all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peircing providence of God, dives into the deepe counſells of the Hearts of the ſons of men, and brings out pretious Gold from thence, where the gratious light of his countenance, ſhines not at all. Men freely adviſe, debate, uſe and improve their own Reaſons, Wiſdome, Intereſts, not once caſting an eye to the Almighty, and yet all this while do his work, more then their own. All the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellings, plottings, of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, all the tranſactions of the <hi>Jewes, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Filate</hi> about the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with other the like inſtances abundantly prove it. Take a few inſtances, wherein God made his Bow quite naked in the counſells of his and our enemies.</p>
               <p>In generall they conſult to take Armes, wherein God had fully appeared againſt them, when in all probability their work would have bin done without. <hi>Had they not fought, by this time they had bin conquerers.</hi> One halfe years peace more, which we deſired on any termes, &amp; they would on no termes beare, in all likely hood had ſet them where they would be. Their work went on, as if they had hired the Kingdome, to ſerve them in catching weather. What with ſome mens folly, others treachery, all our diviſions, had not their own counſells ſet them on fighting, I think we ſhould ſuddainly have choſen them, and theirs, to be umpires of our quarrels. God ſaw when it was time to deale with them. In their undertaking in our own County, I could give ſundry inſtances, how God mixed a perverſe ſpirit of folly and error in all their counſels. A part of the Magiſtracy of the County is ſeized on: therein their intentions towards the reſidue clearly diſcovered, yet not any attempt made to ſecure them, which they might eaſily have accompliſhed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115350:28"/>
they could not but ſuppoſe, that there were ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of publick and active ſpirits left, that would be induſtrious in oppoſition unto them. Was not the Lord in their counſells alſo, when they ſuffered a ſmall inconſiderable party in a little Village within a few miles of them, to grow into ſuch a body as at length they durſt not attempt, when they might have broken their whole indeavour with halfe an hundred of men? Doubtleſſe of innumerable ſuch things as theſe, we may ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>The Princes of Zoan are become fooles, the Princes of Noph are deceived, they have ſeduced the people, even they that are the ſtay of their Tribes, the Lord hath mingled a perverſe ſpirit in the middeſt of them, they have cauſed the people to erre in every worke, as a drunken man ſtaggereth in his vomit.</hi> Iſa. 19. 13, 14. Doubtleſſe the wrath of man ſhall praiſe the Lord, and the remainder of it will he reſtraine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In ordering all events to his own praiſe.</hi> The Timing of the enemies eruptions in ſeverall places, is that which fills all hearts with wonder and all mouths with diſcourſe in theſe dayes. From the firſt to the laſt, they had their ſeaſon. Had they come together, to the Eyes of fleſh, the whole Nation had bin ſwallowed up in that Deluge. In particular, let <hi>Eſſex</hi> take notice of the goodneſſe of God; The high thoughts and threats of men, which made us for divers weeks feare a Maſſacre, were not ſuffered to break out into open hoſtility, untill the very next day after their ſtrength was broken, in the Neighbour Country of <hi>Kent.</hi> As if the Lord ſhould have ſaid, I have had you in a chaine all this while: though you have ſhewed your teeth, you have not devoured: now go out of my chaine, I have a net ready for you. For the Armies comming to our Aſſiſtance, I cannot ſee how we needed them many dayes ſooner, or could have wanted them one day longer. Further theſe homebred eruptions were timely ſeaſoned, to rouſe, the diſcontented Souldiery, and divided Nation, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reſiſt the Scottiſh invaſion. God alſo being magnifyed in this, that in this ſweet diſpoſall of events, unto his glory, the counſells of many of thoſe, in whom we thought we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, run totally croſſe to the appearance of God in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall wee ſay to theſe things, If the Lord be for us, who ſhall be againſt us? All theſe things come forth from the Lord of Hoſts, who is wonderfull in counſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>In controlling mighty actions.</hi> I meane giving ſucceſſe to his people in all their undertakings. The Commander in chief of all the forces in this Kingdome ſince his ſitting down before Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was proffered a paſſe to go beyond the Seas for his ſecurity. Whence is it, that he hath now the necks of his enemies, and hath given any of them their lives at their intreaty? greater Armies then this, have bin buried under leſſer walles; did not the number of the beſieged at firſt, exceed the number of the beſiegers? were not their Advantages great? their skill in war amongſt men of their own perſwaſion, famous and renowned? ſo that the ſitting down before it, was judged an action, meete only for them, who could believe they ſhould ſee the Bow of God, made quite naked. It had bin poſſible doubtleſſe to Reaſons eye, that many of thoſe <hi>fictions,</hi> wherewith a <hi>faction</hi> in the great City fed themſelves of the many Routings, Slaughters, and Deſtructions of the Army, might have bin true. Some of them I ſay, for ſome were as childiſh as Helliſh. In briefe, they Aſſociated themſelves and were broken in peices, they Aſſociated themſelves and were broken in peices. High walls, Towring imaginations, lofty threats all brought down. <hi>So let all thine enemies periſh O Lord, but let them that love him, be as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might,</hi> and let the Land have reſt for many years, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 31.</p>
               <p>This will diſcover unto us the bottome and riſe of all Gods <note place="margin">

He doth not make his Bow quite naked, according to their <note place="margin">Deut: 7. 7, 8.</note> deſervings, but his own Word Not becauſe they of themſelves are better then others, but becauſe he loves them more then others. Were Gods Aſſiſtances, ſuited to our walkings, they would be very uneven: but his good-will is conſtant ſo are our deliverances.</p>
               <p>Be exhorted to Thankfulneſſe, Not <note n="b" place="margin">In beneficio reddendo plus animus quam cenſus operatur, <hi>Ambſ.</hi> offi. li 1. c. 32.</note> Verball but Reall: not <note place="margin">

               <p>The bringing of ſtreames of waters, from the Rock, for the thirſty people in the Wilderneſſe, is that which is here celebrated. Now this the Lord did twiſe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The places</hi> from whence this water marvellouſly iſſued: they were <hi>Rocks, that in all probability, never had ſpring from the Creation of the World:</hi> Further they are obſerved to be Rocks of flint, Pſal. 114. 8. <hi>which turned the Rock into a ſtanding water, the flint into a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of waters,</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 15.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinners muſt be brought to great extremities, to make them deſire the Bloud of Jeſus.</hi> Weary and thirſty, before rock-water come. Thirſt is a continually galling preſſure. When a ſoule gaſpeth like a parched Land, and is as far from ſelf-refreſhement, as a man from drawing waters out of a flint, then ſhall the ſide of Chriſt be opened to him. You that are full of your luſts, drunk with the world, here is not a drop for you. If you never come into the wilderneſſe, you ſhall never have Rock-water,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mercy to a convinced ſinner ſeems of times as remote, as Rivers from a Rock of flint.</hi> The truth is, he never came neer mercy, who thought not himſelf far from it. When the <hi>Izraelites</hi> cryed, we are ready to die for thirſt, then ſtood they on the ground, where Rivers were to runne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirſty ſouls ſhall want no water, though it be fetched for them out of a Rock.</hi> Panters after the blood of Jeſus, ſhall aſſuredly have refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pardon, through the moſt unconquerable difficulties. Though grace and mercy ſeem to be locked up from them, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a flint, whence fire is more naturall then water, yet God will not ſtrik the rock of his juſtice and their flinty hearts together, to make hellſire ſparkle about their eares, but with a rod of mercy on Chriſt, that abundance of water may be drawn out for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The moſt eminent temporall bleſſings, and ſuitable refreſhment, (wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a Rock for them that are ready to periſh) is but an obſcure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of that love of God, and refreſhment of ſouls, which is in the blood of Jeſus.</hi> Carnall things are exceeding ſhort of ſpirituall, temporall things of eternall.</p>

                  <item>1. That God hath done it.</item>
                  <item>2. That he hath promiſed he will yet do it.</item>
                  <item>3. Why he will ſo doe?</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt he hath done it. I might here tire you with preſidents. I could lead you from that Mother deliverance, the womb of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the redemption that is in the bloud of Jeſus, down through many diſpenſations of old, and of late, holding out this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the full. One ſhall ſuffice me, and if ſome of you cannot help your ſelves with another, you are very ſenſeleſſe.</p>
               <p>Look upon <hi>Peters deliverance,</hi> Act. 12. The night before he was to <note place="margin">Preached at the Committee at Rumford.</note> be ſlain, he was kept ſafe in a <hi>priſon.</hi> A <hi>priſon</hi> he had neither wil, nor power to break. He was bound with <hi>two-chaines,</hi> beyond his skill to unlooſe, or force aſunder; kept he was by 16 <hi>Souldiers,</hi> doubtleſſe men of blood and vigilancy; having this to keep them waking, that if <hi>Peter</hi> eſcaped with his Head, they were to loſe theirs. Now that his deliverance was above <hi>ſenſe and reaſon,</hi> himſelfe intimates, <hi>v. 11. he hath delivered me from the expectation of the Jewes.</hi> The wiſe ſubtile <hi>Jewes,</hi> concluded the matter ſo ſecure, that without any doubts or fears, they were in expectation of his execution the next day. That it was alſo beyond the ready reach of much pretious faith, you have an example in thoſe believers, who were gathered together in the houſe of <hi>Mary, v.</hi> 12. calling her mad, who firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115350:31"/>
it, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and being aſtoniſhed when their eyes beheld it, <hi>v.</hi> 16. The whole ſeeming ſo impoſſible to carnall <hi>Herod,</hi> after its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, that he ſlayes the keepers as falſe in their Helliſh truſt. <hi>A juſt recompence for truſty villaines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time would faile me to ſpeak of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Joſeph, Gidron, Noah</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 14. Gen. 39, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; <hi>Job,</hi> all preſidents worthy your conſideration. View them at your leiſure, and you wil have leiſure, if you inend to live by faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath ſaid it.</hi> It is a Truth abounding in promiſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. I ſhall hold out one or two, It will be worth yourwhile to ſearch for others your ſelves. He that digges for a mine, findes many a piece of gold by the way.</p>
               <p>Iſa. 41. 14, 15. <hi>Fear not thou worme Jacob, and yee few men of Iſrael, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will make thee, a new ſharp threſhing inſtrument having teeth, thou ſhalt threſh the Mountaines, and beat them ſmall, and ſhalt make the hills as chaffe, thou ſhalt fan them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make a worm a threſhing inſtrument with teeth, to cauſe that inſtrument to beat Mountaines and hills into chaffe, that chaffe to be blowne away with the wind, that, that worm may rejoyce in God, to advance a ſmall handfull of deſpiſed ones, to the ruine of Mountanous Empires, and Kingdomes, untill they be broken and ſcattered to nothing, is a mercy that comes from beyond the ken of any ordinary eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eze.</hi> 37 3. The Prophet profeſſeth that the deliverance promiſed was beyond his apprehenſion. <hi>Son of man can theſe bones live and I anſwered O Lord God thou knoweſt.</hi> The Lord intimates in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes, that he will provide a means, for hisChurches recovery, when it ſeemeth as remote therefrom, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dry bones ſcattered upon the face of the Earth are from a mighty living Army. This he calls opening their graves, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he would have his people wholly wrapt up in his <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 Reaſ. 1.</note> Not to ſtraighten themſelves, with what their faith can ken in a promiſe: much leſſe to what their reaſon can perceive in appearance. In the application of promiſes to particular trials and extremities, Faith oftentimes is exceedingly diſturbed, either in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of perſons, or things, or ſeaſons. But when it wil wholly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up it ſelfe in <hi>All-ſufficiency,</hi> the fountaine of all promiſes, there is no place for fear or diſputing. Have your ſouls in ſpirituall trials never bin driven from all your outworks, unto this main fort? Hath not all hold of promiſes in time of triall given place to temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115350:31"/>
untill you have fallen down in <hi>All-ſufficiency,</hi> and their found peace? God accounts a flight to the ſtrong Tower of his Name, to be the moſt excellent Valour. This is faiths firſt, proper, and moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Object: To particular promiſes it is drawn out, on particular occaſions: here is or ſhould be its conſtant abode: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſoule will never be prepard to all the Will of God, untill its whole complacency be taken up in this ſufficiency of the Almighty. Here God delights to have the ſoule give up it ſelfe to a contented loſing of all its reaſonings, even in the infinite unſearchableneſſe of his goodnes and power. Therefore will he ſometimes ſend forth ſuch ſtreames of bleſſings, as can flow from no other fountain, that his may know where to lie down in peace. Here he would have us ſecure our ſhallow bottomes in this quiet Sea, this infinit ocean, whither neither wind, nor ſtorme, do once approach. Thoſe bluſtering temptations which rage at the ſhore, when we were halfe at Land, and half at Sea, halfe upon the bottome of our own reaſon, and half upon the Ocean of providence, reach not at all unto this deepe. Oh if we could in all trials, lay our ſelves down in theſe armes of the Almighty, his Al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in power and goodnes, oh how much of the haven ſhould we have in our voyage, how much of home, in our pilgrimage, how much of Heaven in this wretched Earth! Friends throw away your ſtaves, break the arme of fleſh, lie down here quietly in every diſpenſation, and you ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God. I could loſe my ſelfe in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this, wherein I could deſire you would loſe your <hi>ſelves</hi> in every time of trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haſt thou not known? haſt thou not heard that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creatour of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no ſearching of his underſtanding. He giveth power to the faint and to them who have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength. Even the youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall utterly fall. But they that waite upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not be faint.</hi> Iſa. 40. 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
               <p>To convince the unbelieving world it ſelf of his power, providence, <note place="margin">Rea. 2.</note> and love to them that put their truſt in him: that they may be found to cry, verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God who <note place="margin">Pſal 58. 1. 1.</note> ruleth in the earth. When the <hi>Aegyptian Magicians</hi> ſee reall Miracles, beyond all their jugling pretences, they cry out this is <hi>the finger of God,</hi> Exo. 8. 19. profane <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> beholding the deliverance of thoſe three worthies, from the fiery Furnace, he owns them for <hi>the ſervants

If God ſhould never give bleſſings but in ſuch a way, as reaſon might diſcover their dependance on ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſes, men would not ſee his goings, nor acknowledge his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But when he mightily makes bare his Arme, in events beyond their imaginations, they muſt vayle before him.</p>
               <p>Conſider whether the mercy celebrated this day, ought not to be <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> placed in this ſeries of deliverances, brought from beyond the ken of ſenſe and reaſon, from above the reach of much pretious faith. For the latter I leave it to your own experience, to the former let me for the preſent deſire your conſideration of theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By whom you were ſurpriſed and put under reſtrant.</hi> Now theſe were of two ſorts: 1. <hi>The heads and leaders, 2. The tumultuous multitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, ſome of them being dead, and ſome under durance, I ſhall not ſay any thing: <hi>nullum cum victis certamen et aethere caſſis.</hi> I leave the ſtreame from the flint to your own thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the multitude, an enraged, headles, lawles, godles multitude, gathered out of Innes, Taverns, Alehouſes, Stables, Highways, and the like nurſeries of piety and pitty. Such as theſe having gotten their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors</hi> under their power, their <hi>Governors</hi> under their diſpoſall, their <hi>Reſtrainers</hi> under their reſtraint, their <hi>Opreſſors,</hi> as they thought, under their fury, what was it that kept in their fury &amp; their revenge, which upon the like occaſions and advantages, hath almoſt always bin exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted? Seaech your ſtories, you will not find many that ſpeak of ſuch a deliverance. For a few Governors prevailed on, unto durance, by a godleſſe rout, in an inſurrection, and yet to come off in peace and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is ſurely a Work of more then ordinary providence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider the ſeaſon of your ſurpiſall,</hi> when all the Kingdom was in an uproare, and the arme of fleſh almoſt quite withered as to ſupply. The North invaded, the South full of inſurrections, Wales unſubdued, <note n="e" place="margin">Idem huic ur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bi dominandi finis erit, qui parendi ſuerit: Senec. de Ro.</note> The great City, at leaſt ſuffering men to lift up their hands againſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that to the eye of reaſon the iſſue of the whole, was if not loſt,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115350:32"/>
yet exceedingly hazardous: and ſo to the Eye of reaſon your captivity endleſſe. Had they gone on as was probable they would, whether you had this day bin brought out to <hi>execution,</hi> or thruſt into into a <hi>dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean,</hi> or carried up and down as a <hi>Pageant,</hi> I know not, but much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition, I am ſure rationally you could not expect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The end of your ſurprizall.</hi> Amongſt others, this was apparently one, to be a reſerve for their ſafety, who went on, in all ways of Ruine. You were kept to preſerve them in thoſe ways, wherein they periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whether could reaſon reach this or no; that you being in their <hi>power,</hi> kept on purpoſe for their <hi>Reſcue,</hi> if brought to any great ſtraight, with the price of your <hi>Heads,</hi> to redeem their <hi>own,</hi> that they ſhould be brought to greater diſtreſſe, then ever any before in this Kingdom, and you be delivered, without the leſt help to them in their need, It was beyond your <hi>Freinds</hi> reaſon, who could not hope it, it was beyond your <hi>Enemies</hi> reaſon who never feared it, if you <hi>believed</hi> it, you have the comfort of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The refuſall of granting an exchange, for ſuch perſons, as they accounted more conſiderable then your ſelves,</hi> and whoſe enlargement might have advantaged the cauſe they profeſſed to maintaine, exceedingly more then your reſtraint, what doth it but proclame your intended ruine? This was the way of deliverance, which for a long Seaſon, Reaſon chiefly reſted on, the maine pillar of all its building, which when it was cut in two, what could in it be ſeen but deſolation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The ſtraights you were at length reduced to,</hi> betwen your Enemies ſwords and your friends bullets, which intended for your deliverance, without the ſafeguard of providence, might havebin your ruin, peirc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then once, the houſe wherein you were. Surely it was then an eminent work of Faith to ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of God.</p>
               <p>The many paſſages of providence evidently working for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which I have received from ſome of your ſelves, I willingly paſſe over. What I have already ſaid is ſufficient to declare that to Reaſons Eye you were as dead bones upon the Earth. For our parts who were endangered ſpectators, at the beſt, we were but in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets frame, and to any queſtion about your enlargement could Anſwer only, <hi>the Lord alone he knowes.</hi> And now behold the Lord hath choſen you out, to be examples of his loving kindneſſe, in fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy for you, from beyond the ken of Reaſon, yea from above the reach of much pretious Faith. He hath brought water for you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115350:33"/>
out of the flint. Reckon your deliverance under this head of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I hope you will not be unthankfull.</p>
               <p>You that have received ſo great mercy, we that have ſeen it, and all <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> who have heard the Doctrine confirmed, let us learn to live by Faith. Live above all things that are ſeene. Subject them to the croſſe of Chriſt. Meaſure your condition, by your intereſt in Gods All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Do not in diſtreſſe calculate what ſuch, and ſuch things can effect, but what God hath promiſed. Reckon upon that, for it ſhall come to paſſe. If you could get but this one thing, by all your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Dangers, to truſt the Lord, to the utmoſt extent of his promiſes, it would prove a bleſſed captivity. All carnall feares would then be conquered, all ſinfull compliances with wicked men remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp;c. <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Be exhorted to great <note n="f" place="margin">Erunt Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae, Tyranni, fures, adulteri, raptores, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legi proditores, infra iſta om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, ingratus eſt. <hi>Senec.</hi> Benef. l. 1.

In great diſtreſſes, very nature prompts the ſons of men to great promiſes. You have heard the ridiculous ſtory of him, who in a ſtorme at Sea, promiſed to dedicate a Wax-candle to the bleſſed Virgin, as big as the maſt of his Ship, which he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when he came on ſhore to pay with one of 12 in the pound. Let not the Morall of that Fable be found in any of you. Come not ſhort of any of your engagements, no greater diſcovery of an Hypocriticall frame, then to flatter the Lord in trouble, and to decline upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in cold bloud. The Lord of Heaven give you ſtrength to make good all your reſolutions: as private perſons, in all godlineſſe and honeſty, following hard after God in every known way of his; as Magiſtrates, in Juſtice Equity and faithfull ſerving the Kingdome of Chriſt: Eſpecially let them never beg in vaine for help at your hands, who did not beg help in vaine, for you at the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Conſider, if, there be ſo much <note n="g" place="margin">Si Tanti vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum quanti Margaritum? <hi>Tertul.</hi>
                  </note> ſweetneſſe in a temporall deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <note place="margin">Vſe. 4.</note> Oh what excellency is there in that Eternall Redemption, which we have in the Blood of Jeſus? If we rejoice for deing delivered from them, who could have killed the body, what unſpeakeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyſing is there in that mercy whereby we are freed from the wrath to come. Let this poſſeſſe your thoughts, let this fill your ſoules, let this be your haven from all former ſtormes, and here ſtrik I ſayle, in this, to abide with you, and all the ſaints of God for ever.</p>
