            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFATORY ESSAY ON Epigrammatic Poetry.</head>
            <p>'TIS ſtrange that in ſuch an improving Age as ours, when <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> run ſo high, that among all the parts of <hi>polite literature,</hi> and ſo many ſucceſsful Attempts in <hi>pleaſing</hi> and <hi>inſtructive Poetry,</hi> ſo few <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> tho' invited thereto by the Example of that great Maſter in Poetry <hi>Ben. Johnſon,</hi> have ſince his time addicted themſelves to write <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the more ſtrange (if that be true which the Great <hi>Verulam</hi> in his <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi> aſſerts, That <hi>Poetry was ever thought to have ſome participation of Divinity</hi>) ſince in this Age thoſe of the beſt parts are very impatient of hearing <hi>long Sermons,</hi> even now that <hi>Pulpit-Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> is at the nobleſt height it ever was ſince the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> time; and yet they endure not only to
<pb facs="tcp:154233:5"/>
               <hi>write,</hi> but to <hi>read long Poems,</hi> as if <hi>Poetry</hi> were not as expreſſive as <hi>Oratory,</hi> and a great deal might not be ſaid in a few Lines of <hi>Verſe</hi> as well as <hi>Proſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt Ancient <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was wrote in <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks</hi> cut or graven upon <hi>Statues, Columns, Obelisks,</hi> and the like; afterwards when the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative <hi>Tradition</hi> of thoſe <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> was loſt or varied, they wrote or engraved ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in words at length, which were call'd <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams</hi> or <hi>Inſcriptions,</hi> and theſe in <hi>Proſe</hi> or <hi>Verſe</hi> as it happened.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> being contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the beſt <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> or <hi>Epigrams</hi> were for the moſt part in <hi>Verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of theſe were indeed <hi>plain, ſimple,</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> without any affectation of either <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Humour,</hi> ſuch as that of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in <hi>Thucydides.</hi>

<q>Hic ſunt Poetae Pacuvii Marci Oſſa,</q>
was as much as any Man would deſire to know; but that was a Melancholly Subject for a Man to write his own Epitaph, and ſo let it paſs.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt we from hence conclude how little <hi>Wit</hi> was neceſſary to an <hi>Epigram</hi> among the <hi>Ancients,</hi> nor on the other ſide dare I affirm with ſome <hi>Modern Criticks,</hi> that the reaſon why ſo few lay out their Talent in this vein, is, that it is an exceeding <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Undertaking</hi> to make a <hi>good Epigram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if either of theſe two different Propoſitions be true, Viz. <hi>That a little Wit will ſerve,</hi> or, <hi>That 'tis hard to write a good Epigram,</hi> the <hi>Bookſeller</hi> will meet with very few <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> I doubt, to this <hi>well-deſigned Undertaking:</hi> For firſt, if that will do which every body is Maſter of, the more <hi>refined Underſtandings</hi> will not engage themſelves in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> they'll look upon it as a leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves, to go in among the Crowd of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders.</p>
            <p>But this Propoſition is <hi>falſe;</hi> for a <hi>little Wit</hi> will not ſerve in proportion to the bigneſs of the Poem;
<pb facs="tcp:154233:6"/>
there is much <hi>more Wit</hi> required in an Epigram, than in any other Poem proportionably to the number of lines; for tho' <hi>ſimple Epigrams,</hi> whoſe chief <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donnance</hi> or <hi>Deſign</hi> is <hi>Narration,</hi> do not require <hi>much Wit;</hi> yet of the <hi>five ſorts of Epigrams</hi> into which <hi>J. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> divides this kind of Poetry, viz. <hi>Mel, Fel, acetum, Sal, &amp; ſpecies mixta,</hi> i. e. ſweet, bitter, ſharp, ſalt, and the mix'd ſort; not any of the four firſt can conſiſt without <hi>Wit,</hi> or that which is inſtead of it, and ſometimes preferable to it, <hi>humour;</hi> but the <hi>fifth,</hi> viz. the <hi>Compoſite</hi> or <hi>mix'd ſort,</hi> even of thoſe Contemporary with the forementioned <hi>Greek</hi> ones, are not only formed with the <hi>trueſt Judgment,</hi> and <hi>dreſs'd up</hi> in the <hi>richeſt</hi> and <hi>fineſt Language,</hi> but <hi>animated</hi> likewiſe with all the <hi>warmths</hi> of <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>lively Invention:</hi> And as I know no reaſon why the <hi>Collector</hi> or <hi>Compiler</hi> of the <hi>Greek Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> ſhould be ſucceſsful above all that ever ſelected choice Epigrams, and who have had the Fortune to leave out as good as ſome they put in; ſo we ſhould have been more beholding to him, if his Will or Abilities had furniſhed us with double the number out of thoſe admirable Greek Epigrammatiſts. <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Theaetetus</hi> the Poet, <hi>Straton, Theodorus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillius Tarraeus, Athenaeus</hi> the Poet, <hi>Democritus</hi> the Poet, <hi>Archytas</hi> the Poet, <hi>Dorias, Dorus, Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> and many others; beſide <hi>Archimelus,</hi> who had 5000 Buſhels of Wheat ſent him by <hi>Hiero</hi> for one Epigram upon a new built Ship.</p>

is as high a Conſolation as an Heathen could arrive to.</p>
            <p>To be brief, an Epigram gives as ſtrong and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a proof of any Man's Abilities in Poetry, as the longeſt and moſt elaborate piece can do. A Man's <hi>Wit, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Literature,</hi> may be ſeen plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a <hi>few Lines (Protògenis</hi> knew <hi>Apelles</hi>'s hand as well by drawing one line, as if he had painted a whole Figure) and that he writes no more, muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his want of Leiſure, Induſtry or Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154233:8"/>As to the other <hi>Propoſition,</hi> that <hi>'tis hard to write a good Epigram,</hi> 'tis true; but then they who write <hi>many,</hi> may find excuſe; he who writes <hi>ſome good,</hi> may afford to publiſh <hi>ſome indifferent:</hi> If Monſieur <hi>Rapin</hi>'s Judgment may paſs, who ſaith <hi>'tis ſufficient to have made one admirable Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram in a Mans life.</hi> And <hi>Martial,</hi> who wrote the moſt good One's, hath wrote likewiſe the moſt of an other Character of any in the World; I don't mean only the <hi>Laſcivious Ones,</hi> wherein he hath betray'd his want of judgment; for to write wantonly is as great an incontinency of the <hi>Mind,</hi> as to act it is of the Body; but in many of his other <hi>Epigrams,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his <hi>Xenia</hi> or <hi>Apophoreta</hi> eſpecially, I can't for my part taſte one Grain of <hi>Salt,</hi> or any thing that will paſs in this Age for <hi>Wit:</hi> Many of his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams</hi> are guilty likewiſe of <hi>Scurrility,</hi> which is mean always, and degenerous;</p>

            </q>
            <p>But for the many good Ones he hath wrote, he hath nevertheleſs obtain'd the Reputation of having form'd proper Deſigns, carried 'em on clearly, and fully, in numerous and well-choſe Words; concluding for the moſt part with ſomething pointed, which the Vulgar take to be the beſt part of an <hi>Epigram,</hi> and in which the form of it chiefly conſiſts: But if that were true, <hi>Catullus</hi> can ſcarce come into the Number of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatiſts,</hi> tho' the Learned place him <hi>firſt,</hi> who is
<pb facs="tcp:154233:8"/>
not only very unequal to himſelf, as being now ſweet, then harſh; now forced, by and by flowing; ſometimes brisk, and otherwhiles flat; but he very often wants that <hi>poinancy</hi> in the latter end, and rather ſhines throughout the <hi>whole Epigram</hi> than in the <hi>Cloſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His broad <hi>Obſcenity</hi> ſometimes paſſes among the Injudicious for Wit; a Fault of Youth which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not long enough to correct, dying at the Age of Thirty: But his <hi>Latin</hi> is <hi>delicate</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> beyond all contradiction, otherwiſe I doubt not but <hi>Andreas Naugerius,</hi> who, as <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> tells us, every Year on a certain Day dedicated to the <hi>Muſes,</hi> burnt all the Volumes of <hi>Martial</hi> he could get; would have beſtowed ſome Coſt likewiſe on <hi>Catullus,</hi> inſtead of pretending the Ceremony done to his <hi>Manes;</hi> who comes as ſhort of <hi>Martial</hi>'s <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> as <hi>Martial</hi> doth of his <hi>Turn</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions.</hi>

            <p>So that it is not the eaſieſt thing to write well in this ſort of Poetry, in which ſo few have excell'd, and of which we have ſcarce any exact <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi>

            <p>There are indeed in <hi>Martial,</hi> Patterns as inimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Odes of <hi>Horace;</hi> but there is in every one of his Books, ſo much Trumpery mix'd, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader muſt be a proper Judge of Excellency, to know which to account the <hi>Standard,</hi> and which the <hi>Allay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and the <hi>Ingolſtad</hi> Excerptions take in too <hi>many,</hi> the <hi>Eton</hi> too few; and tho' the <hi>late Tranſlator</hi> of <hi>Martial</hi> hath gone a Middle way, yet unleſs we knew who he is, his Authority cannot give any Rules; however, <hi>he</hi> hath render'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Sence in <hi>Engliſh</hi> more commendably than he himſelf did in <hi>Latin,</hi> occaſioning ſuch Criticks as <hi>Jo.
