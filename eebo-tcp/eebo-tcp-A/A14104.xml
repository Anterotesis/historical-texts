            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the manifold ſygnes</hi> and tokens, wherby it hath pleaſed our moſt gratious God, and mercifull Father, in theſe the later times of the worlde, and very ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, to call vs to repentaunce, we may not accoumpt as leaſt this moſt dreadfull &amp; daungerous Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, which vnto the great terrour of all good conſciences befell of late vnto the Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> and as I ſuppoſe to the moſt part of this Realme, vpon wenſday in Eaſter week,<note place="margin">Yea, and out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme to, in ſome Countreys lying Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly.</note> which was the ſixt day of Aprill. <hi>1580.</hi> about ſix of the clocke in the after noone. Wherof, to the entent ſo merueylous a iudgement of the Lords may be known, to ſuch as perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not touched with the ſame, and alſo ſo wonderfull a worke may not want it due effect, where it ſhall be heard: I am reſolued by his power, without whome we are able to doo nothing: and by your patience, to whome perhappes this knowledge may be aueyleable, to ſet downe ſomwhat brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the ſame in wryting.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But before we enter any further into the bare bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matter, it is expedient that I diſcouer vnto you the cauſes, and ſubſtaunce of euerie Earthquake,<note place="margin">Cauſes, and ſubſtance of Earthqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as they be naturally aſſygned.</note> which I muſt be fayne to borrowe from the Prophane wryters, who haue moſt dilligently laboured in the ſearch of naturall cauſes, whervnto doubtleſſe they could not ſo clearly haue atteyned without the finger of God, which hath led men as well into the true contemplation of theſe matters, as of any other knowledge. And therfore following <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as théefe in this behalfe: wée muſt vnderſtand, that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes of an Earthquake are thrée, to wyt, the Sun,
<pb facs="tcp:19402:4"/>
the other ſixe Planets, and a ſpirite or breath included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vowelles of the earth: and the materiall cauſe one, which is an Exhalation, that is to ſay, a certaine ayre, breath, or ſmoake drawne out of the earth, which of nature is hot and drie.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Howe Earthqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</note>3. Thus it is not hard then, to deſcribe the engendring of an Earthquake. For the earth is a drie body of it owne nature, and as dayly experience teacheth, it conteyneth within it great plentie of water. And when it is throughly heated by the beames of the Sunne, and alſo by bodyes of firie ſubſtaunce, whereof it imbraceth many: as Brimſtone, and ſuch like, partly by reſoluing the water into ayre, and partly by receyuing the lyke into the emptie hollowneſſe thereof, it comprehendeth within it great ſlore of ſpirit and windie matter, which being very ſubtill, ſwyft, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wandereth here and there vnder the earth, ſtriking the ſides therof with great force, and moſt times cauſeth the earth to quake and tremble, for that it séeketh iſſue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to depart into it owne place.</p>
            <p n="4">4. At ſomtimes therefore this ſpirit or Exhalation iſſueth wholly foorth together: ſomtime by laboring it conceaueth fire, and breaketh out in flames: otherwhiles, ſome part of it remayneth behinde, and is ſhutte vp againe within the earth, and miniſtreth matter for a new effect. And farther, as the ſearchers of nature haue reported of this kinde of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,<note place="margin">Earthqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly happen at night, or in the morning</note> the Earthquake hapneth (for the moſt part) at a calme ſeaſon, when as none or very ſmall windes blowe, ſpecially in the night, and at the dawning of the day: for that accuſtomably windes vſe to riſe at that time: or if in the day time it happen, then moſte at high noone, the Sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in greateſt force, and driuing downe the Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Moreouer, the places moſt conuenient and likely for Earthquakes, are cauernous and hollowe places, where the
<pb facs="tcp:19402:4"/>
earth is looſe and falſe vnder foote, by reaſon of vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or digging for Metal, Stone, Cole, or ſuch like ſtuff, as vpon <hi>Mendeepe, Newcaſtle,</hi> and ſundry other places within this Realme. Alſo the hollow cliffes by the Sea ſide, where the water ſomtime freatteth holes in the banckes, cauſing great peeces of the earth to fall in: As of late dayes it happened betwéene <hi>Douer,</hi> and <hi>Folſtone,</hi> &amp; moſt gréeuouſly may be ſéene euery day in experience, at the poore Towne of <hi>Whytſtable</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> And agayne, the Countreis that are verye full of great Hilles and mountaines:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wales</hi> acquainted with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quakes.</note> ſo that (perhapps) the vplandiſhe people of <hi>Wales</hi> are better acquainted with ſuch effectes than we are, as it ſtandeth with good reaſon, and I haue heard alſo ſome to report by tryall and knowledge.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It chaunceth alſo many tymes, that by reaſon of repreſſing this Exhaltation, which is the materiall cauſe of the Earthquake, within the earth, there is hearde a noyſe lyke the working of the Sea a farre of, whiche, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, doth not alwaies importe an Earthquake: for that peraduenture the Exhalation is not ſufficient in quantitie, or qualytie to ſhake the earth, but onely it bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, or barketh at the departure: as a Gun being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged giueth the bygger or leſſer crack according to the quantitie or ramminge, more or leſſe of the powder, &amp; yet maketh ſome noyſe when it is diſcharged although the powder were not of ſufficient force to make the péece ſhake, or recoyle.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As touchinge other Accidentes, that are noted ouer and aboue, to accompany and follow Earthquakes:<note place="margin">Eclipſes of the Moone import de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of heat.</note> one is eclipſes, of the Moone, another Exhalatiue impreſſions in the ayre. Whereof the one may importe ſome defectt of heat, and then the colde byndeth vp the poares of the earth, &amp; cauſeth the windes moſt times to blowe fiercely at ſuch ſeaſons: and the other giueth a taſte of the plenty
<pb facs="tcp:19402:5"/>
of hot and drie matter, which by probabilitie is concluded within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, wherof that was ſome part which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both which may miniſter great cauſe thervnto, as is already declared. And it is a thing ſpecially and aboue all thing noted, that a lyttle before, and euen at the tyme of the Earthquake, the Sun is darkened without a cloude, which is long of the ſpirite that breaketh foorth, which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ayre: taketh away the bright beames of the Sun from our ſight, after the manner of a thin myſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The morning is calme and colde before an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake happen, by reaſon of the hot ſpirite or breath which is included within the earth: and alſo after the Sun ſet, the Skie is cleare, for that the matter is ſoone diſpearſed: and often tymes there is ſeene in the Element a long narrowe clowde ſtretched foorth, which is the forerunner of an Earthquake.<note place="margin">Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that they ſawe this Clowd, although it were not generally marked.</note> But to ſpeake of ſome conſequentes that doo followe them for the moſt part, although God haue his ſpeciall worke according to his good prouidence in them, yet are theſe ſuch as the naturall Philoſophers haue obſerued moſt often to enſue, &amp; may not conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be omitted by me in this recitall, for ſpeciall purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Sometimes therfore, after an Earthquake great ſloare of water hath broken foorth of the earth, as béeing driuen out by the Exhalation,<note place="margin">Straunge effectes of Earthqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> in ſo much that the Sea, and other Riuers haue ouerflowed theyr banckes, and procured certaine particular Dilugies or drowninges of Townes and Countreyes. And many times by reaſon of the forcible burſting out of the ſpirite, mightie heapes of Stones haue bene throwne out of the earth, to the great admiration of the beholders. The Sea lykewiſe hath bene ſéene to rage wonderfully, as if it had bene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by verie fowle weather, and Ilands haue bene lyfted vp wheras were neuer any before, and mayne Landes deuided where before was neuer Sea. And moreouer, it
<pb facs="tcp:19402:5"/>

               </note> I néede not ſtand vpon the recitall of ſome that haue bin ſéene of late, which as I am credibly enformed, haue bin many, and oftentimes ſeene by ſundrie. And I my ſelfe alſo, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fifth day of March laſt paſt, being Saterſday, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at nine a clocke at night, in the company of certaine Worſhipfull Gentlemen, beheld a ſtrange, and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halatiue impreſſion in the Aire, whiche in mine opinion was not fired, but very thinne and cleere, for I might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfectly behold the fixed Starres through it. The ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereof was ſtretching endlong from the Eaſt to the Weaſt, ouer the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> or ſomewhat more Southerlie, and the forme therof was as the ſhape of the lath of a Croſſebow without a ſtring, whoſe backe be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded towards the North, and the bellie towardes the South.

            <p n="20">20. Truly, I muſt néedes confeſſe, the ſight therof was rare, and whiche woorthelie drew the eyes of many into admiration of the ſpectacle, and from thence to lift their

And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I was knowne to haue bin ſomtime in place wher lerning is profeſſed, ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtood by demanded mine opinion what it might be, &amp; what alſo ſignifie? vnto whom I anſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in my iudgement, of nature it was an exhalation, &amp; that otherwhiles it foreſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of an Earthquake,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="21">21. Another adiunct token likewiſe, which is the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sunne,<note place="margin">The Sun darkened at the inſtant of the Erth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> without any cloude, or Eclipſe at the inſtant of the Earthquake, was euident to be diſcerned, and is commonly reported by as many as made any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation thereof. And for my parte, I durſt alſo affirme the ſame to be true, although I acknowledge, as before, mine inexperience of the ſtrange accident. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I remember that the Sunne ſhined not as we were walking, which was the time that the Earthquake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And to confer yet farther, indéede the mornings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were cold and nipping, and afterwards at night the Skie was faire and cléere: but whether there appéered in the Elemente any long and narrow Cloude ſtretched foorth in length, eyther before or after, I can not ſay.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Moreouer, I heare as yet of no great and newe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of water by lande or Sea, but it is certainely tolde, of the ſtrange vnquietneſſe and working of the Thames at that time, without enforcement of winde or weather,<note place="margin">

But I heard none co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne of the thickneſſe of their pump or conduit waters, by which meanes <hi>Pherecydes</hi> once foretold of an Earthquake to come. Ne is there any ſpéech of heapes of ſtones lately throwen out of the Earth and diſcouered, nor of the riſing of any newfound Ilands out of the Sea, or freſh waters, as of the two Ilands of <hi>Theron,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> in the time of <hi>Seneca</hi>: and before that of all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as graue Authours do inſinuate: nor yet of the drowning of any Iland or Maine, as it is written of <hi>Atlantis,</hi> in the

Sea <hi>Atlanticum,</hi> whiche Sea afterwarde for a ſpace was turned al into mudde: nor yet of maine lands rent aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as <hi>Europe</hi> was quite torne from <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſauing for a little necke or portion whereby they hang togither.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But for the ſhortneſſe of the continuance of the Earthquake, we are of dutie to yéeld moſt hartie thankes vnto the Maieſtie of our moſt gratious God, who, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the naturall cuſtome that ſome Earthquakes do bring, hath preſerued vs from ſo great dread and danger. The Citie of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ſo wonderfully ſhaken with an Earthquake an whole yéere togither,<note place="margin">The Citie of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an Erthquake.</note> that the Emperour therof, and all his people, were conſtreyned to dwell abroade in the fields vnder tents and pauilions, for feare their houſes &amp; buildings would fall on their heads. But I can not yet heare otherwiſe reported by any, to make me coniecture that our ſhaking continued aboue the ſpace of one minute, which is the <hi>60.</hi> part of an houre.</p>
            <p n="24">24. And yet farther to follow a while mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I am induced to thinke, that this quaking was not at one inſtant in all places wheras it was fealt, but rather came by degrées, and diſtance of time, after the maner of the beating of the pulſe, which the Phiſitions call <hi>Serratilis,</hi> or <hi>Vermicularis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doubtleſſe the reportes ſhew this to be true.</note> For comming from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt parts where it ſéemed to begin, &amp; to rage moſt fiercely, as with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp; ſo procéeding to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Weſt, it was felt at <hi>Rocheſter</hi> &amp; <hi>Graueſend</hi> about v. a clocke, at <hi>London</hi> almoſt at vj. at <hi>Stanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Windſore</hi> almoſt halfe an hour after that, &amp; ſo, by likelyhoode it procéeded farther y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way, perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtretching foorth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrange exhalatiue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, wherof I made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion before, &amp; ſo bended Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly according to the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bellie of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="25">25. But to determine of the thrée ſorts of quakings felt commonly at the trembling of an Earthquake, and to ſay preciſely which of them this ours ſhould be,<note place="margin">Earthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Although this Accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be rare, &amp; I pray God may be rarer, hapning ſcarcely with

vs in an hundred, yea, in a thouſand yéere. But as I may probably geſſe by others relation, ſurely it ſéemed to be the mixt kind, for that it was perceyued to rocke and lift vp both at one inſtant, and yet God be thanked, no houſes nor buildings knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue fallen, which may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better be ſo, for that in this mixt kinde, as the expert in thoſe Sciences write, the one part is a ſtay vnto the other.</p>
            <p n="26">26. And although by our former reaſons it may apeere, that the matter of the Earthquake was but ſmall that cauſed but ſo ſhort a motion, yet am I perſwaded that the ſame was general vnto all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to, &amp; ſo to the whole Iland of Britaine,<note place="margin">This Erth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quake at the leaſt generall to all <hi>Britaine.</hi>

But where in former times and forraigne Lands it pleaſed God to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rage with greater furie, there what gréeuous outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies haue enſued, antient Hiſtories make mention.

            <p n="27">27.
