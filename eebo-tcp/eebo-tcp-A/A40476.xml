         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which never appear'd more viſibly than
in favour of his Majeſtie for theſe ſeveral years paſt.
Firſt by a miraculous revolution of Affaires to make
way for his Acceſſion to the Crown, ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the death of the late King of bleſſed memory:
then by his peaceable and quiet entrance upon his
Government: and laſtly by the ſudden diſſipation of
the late Rebellion contrary to all humane Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Expectation.</p>
            <p>Never was any people, ſince the time of Pontius
Pilate, arrived to that height of unaccountable
Madneſs againſt a Prince who had often ventur'd his
life for their defence and preſervation, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:109522:3"/>
given them any provocation, that like the Jewes
againſt our Saviour, nothing would ſerve their turnes
but <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him: and when they were asked
why, what evill hath he don? They cryed out the more,
Let him be Crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Bill is drawn up, paſſes the Houſe of Commons,
and all ſorts of endeavours us'd to extort the Royal
aſſent &amp; to get it paſſed into a Law, for the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the right Heir, for caſting him out of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and for putting him to death too as a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Common Enemie if he offer'd to return from
his Banishment, and did not patiently ſubmit to the
Iniquity of their ſentence.</p>
            <p>And this Fit of Madneſs after id had bin a little
quieted by a Diſſolution and Change of air, is reviv'd
again by the VOX POPULI or a Cry of importunate
and unmannerly Petitioners from almoſt all parts of
the Nation for another Excludeing Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,

only at the expence of the <hi>Juſtice, Honour</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
of their Soveraigne; till they had renderd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

by a Cloud of Witneſſes and their own Confeſſion of
<pb facs="tcp:109522:3"/>
a Conſpiracy againſt the King, whereof part are
brought to condign Punishment, and the reſt forced
to ſave themſelves by flight from the hands of Juſtice:
that it was now high time for the Government to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of ſome more effectual Remedy than had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
bin us'd to cure the People of their Frenzie,
and to keep them, whether they will or no,
from undoing themſelves, in makeing choice of
ſuch Patriots, as under the pretence of ſecureing
their Religion and Propertie by excludeing the Duke
of York from his Right of ſucceſſion, would have
infaillibly deſtroyed both. In order whereunto
an enquiry is made whether ſuch Corporations as
had shewed themſelves moſt factious and disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Government, had not abuſed the
Royal Bounty, by which they held their Charters,
&amp; are found to have incurr'd a forfieture, &amp; ſo part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by due Courſe of Law, &amp; partlie by voluntarie
reſignations ſuch Elections are regulated, and care
taken, that only perſons of known Loyaltie, &amp; well
affected to the Government both in Church and State
as by Law eſtablished should be capable to ſerve
in Parliament. In the mean time the Fever begins
to abate, and the People to recover their right
ſenſes again. The Duke is ſent for Scotland, and by
the way ſuffers Shipwrack, and by a wonderfull
<pb facs="tcp:109522:4"/>
Providence eſcapes; and now inſtead of <hi>Crucifie him,
Away vvith him,</hi> there is nothing but Hoſannas, &amp;
joyfull Acclamations from all Parts and Quarters
of the Kingdom for his happy Eſcape and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
together with Proteſtations, &amp; offers of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
&amp; Fortunes to live and die in defence of the King
and his Lawfull Succeſſours.</p>
            <p>Thus did God by a ſeries of Miracles both preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
our preſent Soveraign, &amp; prepare his way to the
Throne, by turning the hearts &amp; ſtilling the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the people, that there was not a ſword
drawn, nor the leaſt Oppoſition made to hinder, or
ſo much as queſtion his Rightfull Succeſſion to the
Government upon the Deceaſe of his dear &amp; moſt
entirely beloved Brother. Which whoever duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders,
will be forced to confeſſe, <hi>that it was the hand of
the Lord only that could bring ſuch mighty things to paſſe.
That be ſtone which the Builders refuſed should become the
headſtone in the Corner! this was certainly the Lords
doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</hi>

            <p>The late Rebellion may be ſaid to be ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or dregs of the former fit of Madneſſe, which (by
the Bleſſing of God upon his Majeſties Armes) is ſo
totally extinguishd, that ſo long as it shall pleaſe
God to continue his happy Raign over us, we have no

that loves his King, or has any kindneſſe for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

as the other. <hi>My ſon fear thou the Lord, and the King and
meddle not with them that are given to change; for their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109522:6"/>
shall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the Ruin of
them both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words conſiſt of 2 general parts, 1. Here is
a command or a duty enjoynd. 2. Here is the reaſon
of the command or a punishment annext to the breach
or neglect of it. The command or the duty enjoyn'd
is the duty of ſubjects to their rulers, <hi>which is expreſſed</hi>
2 manner of wayes. 1 Poſitively. <hi>Fear God and the
King,</hi> and then negatively, <hi>meddle not with them that are
given to change.</hi> The former or poſitive part of the duty
ſeemes to relate to God as well as to the King: but
tho God be the object of our fear, and the whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we ow him be comprehended in that word, yet
I have already showed you, and the following words
make it plain, that the duty which ſubbjects ow their
King is principally intended by it, when we are
commanded not to meddle with them that are given
to change, which are to be underſtood in a civil or
political ſenſe, with relation to thoſe who out of a
love of change or novelty, or to gratifie their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Revenge, covetousneſſe, or any other pasſion,
riſe up againſt, or refuſe to obey, or to be ſubject to
their lawfull ſoveraign, which is inconſiſtent with the
fear and duty which they ow him. And the reaſon
(beſides that which has been al ready mentioned) why
we are commanded to fear God, at the ſame time we
are bid to fear, honour and obey the King, and when
this latter is the thing chiefly deſign'd, is to put us in
mind of the inſeperable connexion that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe 2 dutyes, the fear of God, and the fear
or obedience we ow the King: and of the ground or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109522:7"/>
and quality of our obedience to the latter: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the doctrine or obſervation from the plaine ſenſe of
the words may be this.</p>
            <p>That there can be no true fear of God, where there
is not a juſt reverence, and obedience paid to the
King. This is a doctrine ſo plain, and ſo clearly ſet
down in ſcripture, that it might ſeem needleſſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon the proof of it, if the ſecret plots, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
which are dayly formed, and the open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
which we ſee raiſd and carried on againſt the
lives of Princes, and their Government, and all this
under the pretence of Religion, did not make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
at ſome times, and upon ſome occaſions (ſuch
as this is) to put men in mind of ſo important a
truth.</p>
            <p>The fear of God then you muſt know conſiſts in
a ſincere, and univerſal obedience to al his comands: ſo
that he who wilfully<note n="†" place="margin">Ja. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>offends in one point</hi> is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<hi>guilty of all;</hi> and cannot properly be ſaid to
fear God at all, becauſe the fear of God does equally
oblige to the obſervation of one command as well as
of another, and the ſame penalty is annext to one
as to another; and therefore he who does not fear to
offend God in breaking any one of his comandments,
(tho he keeps all the reſt,) cannot be ſuppoſed to
keep the reſt out of any principle of conſcience or the
fear of God, but for ſome other conſideration, and
will make no conſcience to break all the reſt, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shall have the ſame occaſion or temptation
to break them, that he has for the breaking of any
one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109522:7"/>
Now it is notoriouſly known to any one that has read
the ſcripture, that nothing is or can be more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded by God, than the Honour, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and ſubjection which is due to Kings. And all
this is not only comprehended in the fifth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the honour due to parents, but there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other more particular commands about it, to
teach us how we are to regulate our very thoughts,
our words, our actions, and our whole deportment
towards them. We muſt not entertain a dishonourable
thought of our Prince, implyed in the prohibition,
(<hi>a</hi>)<note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 10. 20.</note> 
               <hi>not to curſe the King in our thought.</hi>(<hi>b</hi>)<note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 22. 28.</note> We muſt not
<hi>revile him or ſpeak evill of him.</hi>(<hi>c</hi>)<note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 9.</note> We muſt not lift
up a hand againſt him or reſiſt him,(<hi>d</hi>)<note n="d" place="margin">1. K. 1. 23.</note> We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
our ſelves reverently in his preſence. We muſt
obey his commands, and give him that<note n="‡" place="margin">Ro. 13. 6.</note> tribute, or
cuſtome which belongs to him, which is neceſſary
for the ſupport of his rule and dignity, and which
is but a ſmall recompence for the benefits, we receive
by his Government. And all this is no more than
what is particularly commanded by God in the old
Teſtament, and by our ſaviour and his Apoſtles in the
new, and has bin taught and practiced by holy men,
and by the church of God in all ages: which is all
comprehended under the word <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>honour</hi> which is
ſo often mention'd and commanded with relation to
Kings as their Right and Due, and which cannot be
denyed them without ſacriledge, &amp; diſobedience to God
himſelf?<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 13. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Render therefore to all their Due, Tribute to whom

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:109522:8"/>
But not to inſiſt at preſent any further upon other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the duty which ſubjects ow their King. I
shall only ſpeak a few words concerning reſiſtance, and
the nature or quality of our obedience, the wilfull
miſunderſtanding whereof is the cauſe of all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and of all our diviſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the lawfullneſſe of reſiſtance, (which
ſome of our late Rebels have been ſo far deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God as to aſſert, not only in words, and
with their pens, but with their blood, and their laſt
breath) there need no other arguments be uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it, and for ever to ſtop the mouths of all rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
gainſayers, (if any thing could convince them,)
than the Teſtimonies of David and St. Paul, whoſe
authority I am ſure is indiſputable, and not to be
queſtion'd by any that own the ſcriptures to be the
word of God.<note n="†" place="margin">1 Sa. 26. 9.</note> 
               <hi>VVho can ſtretch forth his haud againſt the
Lords anointed and be guiltleſſe?</hi> was the Amulet or charm
(if I may ſo call it) which the man after God's own
heart, had bin taught by the ſpirit of God, to make
uſe of upon any occaſion or temptation that he had
to revenge himſelf of his greateſt enemie, to curb his
own pasſion, and to reſtrain others from offering the
leaſt violence to their lawfull ſoveraigne. The other
Teſtimonie is of St. Paul. Ro. 13. 5. <hi>VVherefore you muſt
needs be ſubject not only for wrath but conſcience ſake.</hi> In
the former paſſage David laies it down as a principle
of the law of nature acknowledged by all the world,
that it is impoſſible for any man that is a ſubject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
his prince, and be Innocent: <hi>VVho can ſtretch forth
his hand againſt the Lords Annointed and be guiltleſſe?</hi> In
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109522:8"/>
the latter, the Apoſtle aſſerts the neceſſity of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(in oppoſition to reſiſtance, which is forbidden
condemn'd &amp; threatned with damnation Rom. 13. 1. 2.)
upon the ſcore of <hi>conſcience,</hi> that if there were no
other reaſons to oblige men to be ſubject drawn from
hope of reward or fear of punishment, yet they were
bound to be ſo out of <hi>conſcience,</hi> and they might with
as ſafe a conſcience break any of the Comands of God
as reſiſt. Which two teſtimonies againſt the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of reſiſtance will never be anſwerd, or evaded
by thoſe who are ſo audacious and impious as to ſpeak
or write in favour of ſuch as take up armes againſt
their lawfull Prince upon the account of conſcience,
and Religion (as is pretended;) who may as well hope
to reconcile light and darkneſſe; or God and Belial,
as the principles and practices of ſuch Perſons with the
ſcriptures, and the fear of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the nature or quality of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which is due to Kings. We muſt obey them in
all things, except where a ſuperiour command has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
engaged our obedience, to the contrary. The
commands of a ſuperiour are ſtill to be obeyd before
the commands of an Inferiour; and therefore if the
King, who is only God's Vicegerent or deputy shall
command any thing that is contrary to what God
has commanded us before: in all ſuch caſes the Rule of
the Apoſtles is to take place, <hi>that it is better to obey
God than man.</hi> Acts. 4. 19.</p>
            <p>In all other things which are left undetermind by
God, and are not contrary to his will, when they
ar commanded by thoſe who are ſet in authority over
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109522:9"/>
us, our obedience is neceſſary and indiſpenſable.
And therefore to ſecure us from transgreſſing our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God and our ſuperiours, we muſt endeavour to
acquaint our ſelves with the whole will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veald
to us in ſcripture, that ſo we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
it is lawfull for us to obey our ſuperiours, and
wherein we may lawfully refuſe to comply with them.
Where our obedience is lawfull, it is alwaies neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and it is alwaies lawfull where the thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us is not forbidden by God, tho it may happen
to be contrary to our intereſts or Inclinations. We
muſt be ſubject and obedient as well to froward and
ſevere Maſters, as to the good and gentle,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>for this is
thanks worthy if a man for conſcience towards God endure grief,
ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> And from hence I shall take the
liberty to inferre, that where the matter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is of a doubtfull nature, or when we doubt of
the lawfulneſs of it, our obedience is ſtil neceſſary,
becauſe the thing commanded is not for bidden by
God, at leaſt not directly or expresſly forbidden,
for if it were there could be no doubt of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſte
of it; and if it be doubtfull we have as much
reaſon to think it may be lawfull as unlawfull, and
the preſumption of its lawfullneſſe ought to be for the
Magiſtrate, who is ſuppos'd to be better able (as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing
greater helps) to judge of what is agreable to
the will of God: and then beſides all this we have
the Commands of our ſuperiours, and the neceſſity
of our obedience, if the thing we are commanded be
not apparently ſinfull to juſtifie or at leaſt to excuſe
our compliance. As for that objection which I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109522:9"/>
may be brought againſt what hath bin ſaid from
<hi>Ro.</hi> 14. 23. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of eating ſome
ſorts of meats with a doubting conſcience, when
the perſons who did eat of ſuch meats as had bin for
bidden by God doubted whether they were not ſtill
forbidden, and yet would venture to eat of them.
<hi>He that thus doubteth (ſaies the Apoſtle) is damn'd if he eat
becauſe he eateth not of faith, for whatſoever is not of faith
is ſin.</hi> But this objection does not reach the caſe we
are ſpeaking of, becauſe the Apoſtles doubting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was at liberty not to eat of the things whereof he
doubted, and in all caſes of the like nature where
men are at liberty, it is ſafeſt to forbear a doubtfull
action, as for example it is doubtfull whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to practice uſury, and every man is at liberty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will practice it or no, and therefore it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
not to practice it: but obedience to Magiſtrates
is no ſuch arbitrary matter, but is a duty laid upon
the conſcience, and if we are not well aſſured that
the thing commanded is ſinfull, it is certaine we ſin,
if we refuſe to yield obedience to it; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be the caſe of thoſe who refuſe to conform
to the publick worship and ſervice of God, as it is
enjoyn'd by Authority and eſtablish'd in the Church
of England.</p>
            <p>For the further confirmation of what hath bin ſaid
I shall ad one Argument more drawn from the nature
and well beeing of all Government, that if a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
concerning the lawfulneſs of a command from
our ſuperiours be allowed to be of equall weight with
the duty of obedience, then the obedience of ſubjects
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109522:10"/>
will be arbitary, becauſe it is impoſſible to ſee into
mens hearts, and when they have no mind to obey,
it is but pretending a ſcruple of conſcience for their
diſobedience: for if they may lawfully ſcruple, ſo as
to be excus'd from their obedience, then it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the Magiſtrate to punish them for not
obeying; and it will be all one as to the exerciſe of
the Magiſtrates power whether the ſcruple be real or
pretended: and how can any government ſubſiſt which
is thus precarious and made to depend upon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or humour of the people? And therefore the
Principles which draw ſuch conſequences after them
cannot be true or agreable to the will of God; and
by conſequence the contrary which I have aſſerted and
explaind to you muſt be true, becauſe according to the
command of our ſaviour <hi>it renders unto God, the things that
are Gods, and unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſars:</hi> It
gives God all that honour and obedience which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
requires of us, and it tends moſt to promote and
preſerve that Order and Peace, which God has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
and eſtablished in the world.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular, they who ſcruple to
comply with the commands of their Prince, or the
lawes of the Government where they live, without
being convinced by clear and ſufficient reaſons of their
unlawfulneſſe, do plainly ſhow, that they are weary,
and diſſatisfied both with their Prince and with their
Government: and when people come once to be weary
of a thing, they begin to wish they were rid of it,
and would be willing to exchange it for ſomething
which they fancy to be better; and from wiſhes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109522:10"/>
they proceed to words, and muſt be laying open the
faults they diſcover either in the Government it ſelf
or in the Governours, which they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed;
and the next ſtep is to action, to take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into their own hands, and to reform it as
they think fit themſelves; and this cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
without a Rebellion, which the Authours and
Contrivers endevour to palliate with the mask of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
or of a <hi>Godly, thorow Reformation.</hi> And by theſe
footſteps you may be able to trace all the Rebellions
that have bin fomented and carried on among our
ſelves more then among any other people in the world,
from their Infancy and Original to their full Growth;
and who have bin the men in all of them, that have
moſt contributed towards them, and have bin moſt
active in them; and to whom the Character which
is given by the wiſe man to ſome perſons in the Text
does moſt fitly agree, of <hi>ſuch as are given to change,</hi>
which brings me to the negative part of the Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
in the words. <hi>And meddle not with them that
are given to change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To fear God then, and to be given to change,
it ſeemes in the Judgment of Solomon (whatever the
Doctrine of our modern caſuiſts may be) are things of
a quite different, and inconſiſtent nature. He that
fears God is not given to change, and he that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to change does not fear God; which is a farther
confirmation of the Doctrine or obſervation from the
former part of the words, where God and the King
are joyn'd together as partners of the ſame duty, of
the ſame Fear and Reverence which is due to both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109522:11"/>
We muſt fear God, and we muſt fear the King;
we muſt honour God and we muſt honour the King;
and we muſt obey God, and we muſt obey the King;
where this fear, honour, and obedience, which we
are commanded to give to the King, does not interfere
with that fear, honour and obedience which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to God: but to be given to change is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with both, nor does he either fear God or
the King, who lies under that Charge or Imputation.</p>
            <p>If we would therefore fear God and the King as
we ought and as we are comanded to do. We muſt
neither be given to change our ſelves, nor have any
thing to do with thoſe that are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we would fear God and the King, as it is
our duty to do, We our ſelves muſt not be given to
change. To be given to change is to endevour the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
or Reformation of the Government under
which we live, without the leave, and againſt the
will of thoſe that are in Authority, which is a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the higher powers, which I have irrefragablie
proved to you, it is not lawfull for ſubjects to do,
upon any pretence or provocation whatſoever, which
may encline or diſpoſe us to endevour or to attempt
a change.</p>
            <p>Now the uſual Pretences or Provocations which
hurry men into Rebellion againſt their Prince, and
to endevour the change and the ſubverſion of the
Government under which they live may be reckon'd
theſe four eſpecially. Ambition, covetousneſſe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and Religion or Reformation; Againſt all which,
and whatever other pasſion or pretence may excite
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109522:11"/>
or provoake us to caſt off the fear and reverence,
which we ow our Prince, the wiſe man gives us his
advice. <hi>Eccl. 8. 2. 3. 4. I counſell thee to keep the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
and that in regard of the Oath of God. Be not
haſty to go out of his ſight; ſtand not in any evil thing, for
he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>be not
haſty to go out of his ſight,</hi> are generally interpreted to
ſignifie, that we should not ſuffer our pasſion ſo far
to prevail over our reaſon, as to withdraw our ſelves
from the ſervice and obedience of our Prince, as
diſcontented perſons uſe to do, which will both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voak
him againſt us, and lead us by degrees into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Rebellion: ſo that there was never any
man who has thrown off his Allegiance, but it was
by giveing way to ſome one or other of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Provocations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ambition and a deſire of Rule is ſome time
that Pasſion, which ſtirres up men to throw off the
bonds of duty and allegiance to their lawfull ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
that ſo they may get into the Throne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which pasſion is obſerv'd by Cicero to raign
moſt in Perſons of a great ſoul (the Effect for the
moſt part of a noble Extract,) who are commonly the
Heads, and Ringleaders of a Rebellion. <hi>Vt quisque
animi magnitudinè excellit, ita maximè vult Princeps omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
eſſe &amp;c. by how much any man excells others in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mind, ſo much the more he deſires to be above all;</hi>
and then he further obſerves, that his Ambition
quickly degerates into Tyranny, difficile autem eſt ne
cum praeſtare omnibus concupiveris, ſervare aequita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
quae eſt Juſtitiae maximè propria. But it is a very
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109522:12"/>
difficult matter for any man who deſires to be above
others, to obſerve the Rules of Equity and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the Eſſential Property of Juſtice. The
former part of the Obſervation is plain from the
Examples of Abſolon, Adonijah and the unfortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
Authour of the late Rebellion in our own Nation,
who were as Great and as Happy as a Generous and
Indulgent Prince, ſuch a Prince as David was, or as
Charles the ſecond could make them, and might
have lived more Happy than either, if they had bin
but as ſenſible of the Weight and Cares of a Crown,
as they were dazled with the ſplendour of it. Nor
is the latter part of the obſervation leſſe true concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the degeneracy of Ambition into Tyranny and
all manner of Injuſtice, as might be made appear from
innumerable Examples both in our own and other
Nations, when ever God has ſufferd a Rebellion to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
for the ſin; of a People, Tyranny, Cruelty and
Oppreſſion have bin the unavoidable effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of it.</p>

is apt to put men upon deſireing, and attempting a
Change is Revenge. When men think they have not
bin ſufficiently rewarded for their ſervices; or when
they ſee others leſſe deſerving preferr'd before them,
or when they have receiv'd any particular injurie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their own Perſons or in their Relations, they
begin to be uneaſie and diſcontented, and ſtudie all
the wayes imaginable how to be reveng'd, and to
do themſelves Juſtice, and are glad of any Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
either to be the Heads, or at leaſt the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in a Rebellion. When Joab ſaw he was like to
be ſupplanted by Abner and Amaſa, to whom Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
had deſignd to give the Command of his Army,
and whom therefore Joab thought it convenient to
diſpatch out of the way: and when he underſtood
that David upon his death bed, had given Solomon
a charge concerning<note n="‡" place="margin">1 K. 2. 6.</note> him <hi>not to ſuffer his hoar head to
go down to the grave in peace;</hi> upon the death of David
he refuſes to own Solomon for King, but goes over
to Adonijah who pretended a right to the Crown,
and joynes with a Uſurper againſt his lawfull ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.
The Conqueſt of Spain by the Moores owes
it ſelf merely to a Tranſport of this Pasſion; Count
Julian General of the Spanish Forces under Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
King of Spain, being ſent with the Army under
his Command to fight againſt the Moors, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109522:13"/>
haveing heard that the Chaſtity of his wife had bin vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in his Abſence, he was ſo incenſ'd at it, that
he preſently goes over to the Enemie, brings them
to invade his own Country, who make an abſolute
Conqueſt, after the flaughter of many thouſands on
both ſides together with the King and all the nobility,
and they keep it for above 700 years in their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Such an influence has Revenge when it is let looſe
over mens minds, that they reſolve to leave nothing
unattempted, tho it coſt the utter ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their country to accomplish it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another exciteing cauſe which is apt to ſtirre
men up to reſiſt and to take up armes againſt their
lawfull ſoveraigne, is<note n="*" place="margin">Per illa tempora quicunque Remp agita vêre honeſtis nominibus alii ſicuti ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Populi defende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, pars, quo ſenatus auctoritas maxuma fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, bonum publicum ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulantes &amp;c Saluſt.

What ever the ſecret and Impulſive cauſes of all civil
Commotions have bin, Whether Ambition, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousneſſe
or Revenge, the open and the moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pretenſe, which the Authours and Abetters of
ſuch Commotions have ever had the confidence pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly

There being no other way to engage ſuch as are
ſimple and well meaning people to be of their party;
while they are ſecure of others who have no ſenſe of
Conſcience or Religion, that they will come in faſt

there are not many examples to be met with in
the Hiſtories of all times and places from the begining
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109522:14"/>
of the world, that have bin begun without it. If
we look back as far as the times of Moſes,<note place="margin">Nu. 16. 3.</note> we

laid againſt the life of that Incomparable
Princeſſe of glorious memory Queen Elizabeth were
all contrived upon the ſcore of Religion. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of blowing up the King and Parliament upon a
fifth of November was a Deſigne of Religion. It was
Religion and the Extirpation of Popery, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church according to the Examples
of the beſt Reformed Churches, that inſpired
the Pen men of the ſolemne League and Covenant
that ſet the three Kingdomes in a flame, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the beſt Prince that ever wore a Crown, and the
beſt eſtablish'd Government in the world. The Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
a few years ago was contrived and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
for the ſake of Religion: and it was the ſame ſpirit
of Religion that actuated the Authours of the late Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Declarations, which were publish'd to juſtifie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109522:14"/>
the two Rebellions, which are ſo very lately extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishd,
and for which we are now met to bleſſe
God, in putting a ſtop to the miſeries that do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

<hi>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Religion (as the Poet well obſerves) could
be the cauſe of ſo much evill.</p>
            <p>Now the advice of the wiſe man in relation to all
theſe cauſes or Impulſives to Rebellion, whether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
or avowed, whether real or pretended, is <hi>that
we should not be haſty to go out of the Kings ſight.</hi> i. e. We
muſt not give way to any of our Paſſions: we muſt
not ſuffer our ſelves to be overcome or tranſported
with any the greateſt Provocation or Temptation to
withdraw our ſelves from the ſervice of our Prince,
to deny him our obedience, to throw off our allegiance
to him, or to riſe in Rebellion againſt him. Let not
the Glories of a Crown, nor the hopes of makeing
thy Fortune, nor the greateſt Injuries and deſire of
Revenge, nor the pretenſe of Religion ever tempt or
provoak thee to be a Rebel. Ambition, Covetousneſs
and Revenge are ſins in their own Nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more exceeding ſinfull, when they are varnishd
over with the ſpecious shew of Religion, and made
the Inſtruments of ſtirring up of a Rebellion becauſe
<hi>ſimulata ſanctitas eſt duplex Iniquitas,</hi> Counterfiet Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion'
or Holyneſſe is complicated iniquity, and<note n="‡" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is as the ſin of VVitchraft:</hi> and if it be not the ſin
againſt the holy ghoſt, it is very near a kin to that
ſin which in all probability comes neareſt it, which
is the ſin of witchcraft, which is a Renunciation of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109522:15"/>
God, and a liſting our ſelves in the ſervice of the
Devil: and therefore Rebellion is fitly compared to
Witchcraft becauſe as Witchcraft is a renunciation of
that duty and ſervice we ow to God, ſo Rebellion
is the ſame in relation to his Vicegerent. They are
both ſins of the firſt magnitude, and very rarely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of or leave a place for Repentance: which is all
that is affirm'd of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,
when it is ſaid, that <hi>it ſhall never be for given neither in
this life, nor in that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As our firſt and chiefeſt care should be not to
give way to any of thoſe paſſions which may be apt to
ſtirre us up to rebell, or to deſire and attempt a change,
ſo that we may preſerve our Loyalty and our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
untainted and free from ſuſpition as well as
guilt: we are adviſd or comanded in the next place,
not to meddle with them that are given to change.
We muſt have nothing to do with thoſe we know to
be of factious and rebellious Principles. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which may be given for this are not of the leaſt
importance, which are theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the very Converſation of ſome perſons
breaths infection, and by keeping them Company,
we shall come at length to have a better opinion of
their Principles, and a worſe opinion of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
than either of them deſerve. The poyſon of
their diſcourſe will inſenſibly inſinuate it ſelf into
our ſouls, and we shall be corrupted, we shall be
undon before we are aware. And therefore the reaſon
which the Wiſe man gives why we should not keep
Company with angry men, is no leſſe true of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109522:15"/>
perſons, and of all other ſinners whatſoever.<note n="†" place="margin">Pr. 22. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Make
no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man
thou shalt not go, leſt thou learn his wayes, and get a ſnare
to thy ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The other reaſon againſt keeping company or
haveing any thing to do with perſons of diſloyal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
may be taken from the ſuſpition and diſrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that is contracted by it. A man is ſaid to be
known by the Company he keeps, and ſuch as his
Company is known to be, ſuch he is ſuppoſed to be
himſelf: and when he is once ſuſpected to be diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
to the Government, it will be no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for him ever after to wipe off the ſuſpition. And
from hence ſome men merely by being reputed to be
diſaffected have come to be really ſo; ſuppoſeing it
one and the ſame thing to be an ill man as to be
thought one. Indeed a good man who is conſcious
of his own Innocence ought to be ſatisfied from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and with the Teſtimony of his own Conſcience
and not to value the Opinion of the World, if he
have given no juſt cauſe for its ill Opinion. But there
are few men in love with Vertue for its own ſake,
or would be vertuous if they thought they should
not be taken notice of: and therefore when once they
come to be ſuſpected, and find how hard, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
it is to regain their former reputation, they
reſolve never to attempt it, and care not if they are
altogether as bad as they are ſuppoſd and repreſented:
beſides all this, the very ſuſpition may ſometimes
be of as ill conſequence to a man as if he was really
guilty: which may ſuffice to let you ſee what great
reaſon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109522:16"/>
every man has who values either his Innocence or
Reputation to avoid the Company of thoſe who are
known to be men of ſeditious and Rebellious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
if they would avoid the guilt or the Imputation
of being given to change, and the ill Conſequences
of it, which brings me to the,</p>
            <p n="2">2. General part of the words, viz the Punishment
threatend to all thoſe, who are given to Change or
who rebell againſt their lawfull Prince, ſet down in
the latter part of the words, <hi>for their Calamity shall riſe
ſuddenly and who knoweth the Ruine of them both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As God is pleasd to expreſſe the Duty he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of us himſelf, and the Duty which ſubjects ow
their Kings, by one and the ſame word, to ſignifie
the great Concern he has for them, and for the peace
and welfare of the world, which depends upon the
preſervation of their perſons, and the Obedience
which is due to them from their ſubjects; ſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſecure their perſons from violence and to keep
their ſubjects in their Obedience, he threatens the
ſame punishment to thoſe who shall violate their
Duty to the King, as to himſelf; <hi>For their Calamity
shall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi>
And the reaſon is, becauſe he who is a Traitour,
and a Rebel to his King is at the ſame time a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and a Rebel to God. This God himſelf tells Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
when the People refuſed any longer to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernd
by him.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 7.</note> 
               <hi>They have not rejected thee (ſaies God)
but they have rejected me that I should not raigne over them

            </p>
            <p>The Damnation here ſpoaken of by St. Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
both the Calamity and Ruine that is threatend
to Rebels in the text, and that more ſevere Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Damnation which is reſerv'd for them in the
other world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Temporal Punishment which is here threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
to Rebels is expreſd after ſuch a manner as to
denote both the Nature, the Certainty and the Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe
of it.</p>
            <p>The Nature of their Punishment is expreſſed 1. by
the Calamitie or miſeries they bring upon them ſelves
and then by their final Ruin and Deſtruction. The
Certainty of their Punishment is ſignified by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication
of the threatning expreſd by Calamity
and Ruine; and the ſuddenneſſe of it as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſet down, <hi>for their Calamity shall riſe ſuddenly and
who knoweth the Ruine of them both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, as all other temporal threatnings in ſcripture,
is to be underſtood as generally and for the moſt part
true.</p>
            <p>Tho God has threatned the wicked with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as well as Eternal miſerie, yet we ſee many times,
<note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 12 1:</note>

               <hi>They are not in trouble as

have no pangs in their death neither, but their ſtrength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109522:17"/>
fare with Rebels, they may for a time proſper
in their Rebellion, and God may ſuffer his People
for the punishment of their ſins and for their Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reformation to groan under a long and
proſperous Uſurpation. But when any thing of this
nature happens, it is beſide the comon method of
Gods Providence, and all ſuch perſons have reaſon
to expect the contrary, and if they do not meet with
their Punishment in this world, they may be ſure it
will light ſo much the heavier upon them in the next.
<note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 92. 7.</note> 
               <hi>VVhen all the wicked ſpring as the Graſſe and when all

            </p>
            <p>But the Rule both of our Judgment and of our
Practice is not to be borrowed from Extraordinary
Occurrences, but from the common and uſual procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of God, and the known declarations of his will
in ſcripture: And according to both theſe wayes of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
the fate of Rebels as to this world may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to be ſuch as it is repreſented to us, both as
to the Nature, the Certainty, and the Suddenneſſe
of their Calamity and Ruine. They are generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to great want and miſery in their life time;
they come to an untimely end, and their Deſtruction
very often befalls them upon a ſudden, as might be
eaſily made appear by innumerable Examples both in
ſacred and prophane ſtory, of which I shall only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

            <p>Corah, Dathan and Abiram (whom I have already

then a new and unheard of ſin, God reſolves to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them after a new &amp; extraordinary manner. The
Earth is made to open her mouth, &amp;<note n="a" place="margin">Nu. 16</note> to ſwallow
them up alive with all that belongd to them. The
next Rebel of any note or conſideration that we read
of was<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 15.</note> Abſolom, who contrary to all the ties

caught up by the hair of the head, where he hung
till he was ſtruck through the heart by Joab; which

drawes all Iſraël after him; but is preſently purſued by
Joab, &amp; loſes his head as the reward of his Treaſon

but Treaſons &amp; Rebellions in the Kingdom of Iſraël,
(which was at firſt founded in a Rebellion) from
the time of its Revolt from the houſe of David till
it was carried away Captive; and of the ſlaughter

and they beſieged Tirzah: and it came to paſſe when
Zimri ſaw that the City was taken, that he went
into the Palace of the Kings houſe, and burnt the

ſome ſuch miſerable fate may be obſerved to have

murderers of our late Bleſſed ſoveraign King Ch. the

that have bin' raiſd in theſe Nations to which
we belong, and of their Leaders? In the ſpace of

in the field breathing out nothing but deſtruction to
their natural and lawful ſoveraign, and to all that
adhered to him, animated with the great numbers
that at firſt came flocking into them, and with the
certain hopes of ſucceſſe and Victory; we have ſeen
them I ſay contrary to their own &amp; the Expectation
of all their Friends, and Confederates both at home
and abroad, totally routed by a ſmall number of the
Kings Forces, a great part of them ſlain upon the
place, and the reſt diſperſt, and left without all
hopes or a poſſibility of makeing an eſcape: Their
Generall himſelf reduced to the utmoſt Extremity
and a want of all things, ſo as to be ready to perish
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109522:18"/>
with hunger, and then taken alive, and brought to
ſuffer death by the hands of a common Executioner.
To whom and to all ſuch perfidious Traitours as
they were, the Prophetical Obſervation of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
may be applied, and wil be verified at one time
or other Pſ. 7. 14. <hi>Behold he travaileth with Iniquity and
hath conceived miſchief, and brought forth falshood; he made
a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made;
his miſchief shall return upon his own head, and his violent

every good man will joyn with the ſame Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in the next verſe, and ſay, <hi>I will praiſe the Lord
according to his Righteousneſſe, and will ſing praiſe to the

to juſtifie the Aſſertion of the wiſe man in the words,
concerning the punishment of Rebels, and &amp; ſuch as
are given to change as to this life; <hi>That their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
shall riſe ſuddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them
both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet this Calamity and Ruin which is threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Rebels in this life is but part of their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and tho one would think might be enough to
terifie any man from ſuch practices, as may render
him lyable to it, yet it is nothing to that other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
punishment which is reſerv'd for them in the
other world, and which without Repentance they
shall not be able to eſcape. There is a poſſibility (as
I have obſerv'd to you) that a Rebellion (by the juſt
permiſſion of God for the ſin's of a People) may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and that the Authors of it may go down to
the Grave in peace: but whether they do or do not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109522:19"/>
eſcape in this life, there will be no hopes or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their eſcapeing in the next; I mean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Repentance, and there is the leſſe hopes of their
Eſcape, becauſe there is ſo little hopes of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Then they will be convinc'd to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Confuſion, that it was no ſuch light or trivial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as it is now generally made) to revile the Gods,
or to ſpeak evill of the Ruler of our People; to curſe
the King in our thought, or to ſtretch forth our
hand againſt the Lords Anointed. And<note n="*" place="margin">Iud. 8. 13</note> if the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

who delight to wash their hands in the blood of

and Confuſion, and to turn the whole world (if it
were in their Power) into one Aceldama or field of
blood? Certainly ſuch men muſt expect to receive
to themſelves a Damnation above that which belongs
to the ordinary rank of ſinners, and proportionable
to the greatneſſe and hainouſneſſe of their Impieties.
Their ſin ſeemes to be of the ſame nature with that

in ſome reſpect may be ſaid to be more criminal, as
being actually attended with a greater train of evills,
and therefore it is but reaſonable they should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the ſame puniſhment, which is,<note n="‡" place="margin">Iud. 6.</note> 
               <hi>to be reſerved
in everlaſting chaines, under Darkneſſe unto the Iudgment of
the great day.</hi> And then they shall receive their final
and irrevocable ſentence, of <hi>Go ye Curſed into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

            <p>Thus you have heard what is the Duty which God
requires of ſubjects towards their King and Soveraign,
and what is the Punishment due to Rebels. We are
commanded to fear and honour the King; we muſt
not revile him nor ſpeak evill of him, we muſt not
curſe him no not in our thought, nor much leſſe lift
up a hand againſt him. We muſt not ſuffer any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or temptation or provocation to transport us
beyond our duty, ſo as to withdraw our Obedience
from him. We muſt neither be given to change our
ſelves, nor have any thing to do with thoſe that are;
both for fear of being infected with their pernicious
principles or at leaſt of being ſuſpected; which may
both do us an injurie, and perhaps involue us in
the real guilt of thoſe principles and practices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at firſt we were only ſuſpected to be guilty. You
have heard likewiſe the Punishment which belongs
to Rebels both as to this life, and to that which is
to come; and tho the former ſeemes to be only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
yet the latter is alwayes ſuppoſed; and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
expreſt by the Apoſtle that they receive to them
ſelves Damnation. Their punishment as to this life
is both certain, and ſudden, their Calamity shall riſe
ſuddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them both?
which by the great Mercy of God, we have ſeen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in the ſuddain and unexpected period that has
bin put to two Rebellions in our own Island; for
which we have great reaſon (as we are commanded
by Authority) to offer up our publick as well as
private Thanksgiveings to our great Soveraign the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109522:20"/>
King of Heaven and Earth, for delivering us from
the Miſeries and Calamities which our ſins had moſt
juſtly deſerved, and which we have bin taught by
ſad Experience to be the conſtant Attendants upon
an unnatural and ſuccesfull Rebellion. Nor muſt our
Thanksgiveing only be verbal, and with our lips,
but we are calld upon to ſet forth the praiſes of our
Great Deliverer with our lives (which is the moſt
acceptable way of praiſing him) by endevouring to
improve this and all other his Mercies to the Glory
of his Great Name, the Honour, Peace, and Benefit
of our Soveraign and his Kingdomes, and as much
as in us lies to the good of all mankind; all which
we shall be the better enabled to do if we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to tranſcribe the Duty in the text according to
its litteral meaning into our hearts and lives, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the true fear of God, to the Loyalty we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
to have for our King: which will afford us
theſe two Inferences by way of Application, with
which I shall conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That without Piety or the Fear of God, our
greateſt Profeſſions of Loyalty, will be but <hi>like a houſe
built by a fool without a faundation upon the ſand; and the
rain deſcended, and the VVinds blew, and beat upon it and
it fell.</hi> So long as it was fair Weather and no Wind
ſtirring it ſeemes the houſe ſtood, but the firſt bluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
ſtorm blew it over; ſo it is with all thoſe that
are disloyal to God, and yet pretend Loyalty to
their King. It is no wonder if they love their King,
when Loyalty is in faſhion and they know it to be
their Intereſt as well as Duty. But when ever the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109522:20"/>
ſcene comes to be alterd, and that the Royal Intereſt
declines, and they are like to be ſufferers by their
Loyalty, they are the moſt likely Perſons to turn
Apoſtates, becauſe their Loyalty had no ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<hi>it was founded upon the ſand.</hi> But where a
mans Loyalty proceeds from the Fear of God and
a ſenſe of Duty, it may fitly be compared to a houſe
built upon a Rock, and the rain deſcended and the flood
came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that
houſe, and it fel not, <hi>for it was founded upon a Rock.</hi>
A truly pious and good man will be Loyal in foul
weather as well as in fair. Let the Sun shine or let it
rain, he is ſtill the ſame. He will love, honour and
ſtick to his Prince as well in Adverſity as Proſperity,
and he will think it as great an honour to ſuffer as ſo
raigne with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Piety and the Fear of God is the only ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
we can give of our Loyalty (it being impoſſible
there can be any firm and unshaken Loyalty without
it;) ſo without Loyalty it is as certain there can be
no true Piety. All the noiſe and fair ſpeeches about
Religion that have bin made by Rebels in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
and Declarations, and all the outward showes
of Godlyneſſe, which they have put on, have bin
nothing but Hypocriſie, and Traps to deceive the
ſimple. There have no men ever known ſo well how
to counterfiet a <hi>Form</hi> of Godlyneſſe; or who have
known ſo little what belong'd to the <hi>Power</hi> of it.

               <hi>VVhile the breath of Religion fills the ſails</hi> (as our late
Royal Martyr ſpeaks in his incomparable book) <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is the Compas by which Factious men ſteer their Courſe in

all ſeditious Commotions.</hi> And as the ſame Eccellent Prince

Reformers;<note n="b" place="margin">Id. c. 20</note> 
               <hi>Iam ſure the right methods of reforming
the Church, cannot conſiſt with that of perturbing the Civil
ſtate: nor can Religion be juſtly advanced by depreſſing Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
which is one of the chiefeſt Ingredients &amp; Ornaments
of true Religion, for next to Fear God is Honour the King.
Nor will any men in Impartial times appear good Chriſtians,
that approve not themſelves good ſubjects.</hi> And therefore
you may take this for a Certain and infallible Rule,
that he who Fears, Honours, and Obeys God, will
Fear, Honour, and Obey his King likewiſe. Which
God grant we may all do, for the honour of Jeſus
Chriſt, to whom with the Father, and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
as for all other mercies, ſo more eſpecially for
that we now celebrate, be aſcribed (as is moſt due)
all Praiſe Majeſtie and Dominion now and for ever.
