            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the first of these, it is certain, most certain, That there is not, nor ever was any Nation under the Cope of Heaven since the first Creation, which acknowledged a Deity, but withall it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a Divine Worship and Service due to this Deity; and that not onely inward in the minde, but outward, in sacred and solemn Rites and Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as being both the kindely effects, and lively characters of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>he in bred Notions and Motions of the Soul: And to this purpose they had not onely Temples, and Altars, and Sacrifices, and forms of Invocation, but Festivall dayes, set dayes, or dayes set apart; as for the publique and Civill affairs, so likewise for the religious Rites and Ceremonies. And this they had partly from the dictate of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which tells us, That every action requires, as a place, so a time suteable thereunto, partly from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which teacheth us, That that which is left at randome, and hath no day prefixed, is seldome performed as it should be on any day; and partly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94801:3"/>
from those broken remainders of the Image of God left in them, and an imitation of the Church of God, though from it, in the main points of his Worship, they had much degenerated.</p>
            <p>It may be well thought, that the first man created immediately by God himself, even in the state of Innocency, had both a certain place and time for the Worship of his Maker; Howsoever sure it is, that before we reade of the fall of man, we reade of a Seventh day, blessed and sanctified by God himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. sanctified, that by man it might be kept holy to his glory; and blessed, that man by keeping of it holy, might receive a blessing from God. When <hi>Enos</hi> was born of <hi>Seth,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> it is said, That men then began to call upon the Name of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. at the last verse: that is (as I take it) to call upon his Name in Publique Assemblies; for which, no doubt but they had a certain place appointed, lest otherwise men might be disappointed in their meetings: And most like it is that it was the same day which <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> observed before them, and the rest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triachs after them, that day in which God himself rested, having fully finished the great work of the worlds Creation. <hi>Etiam ante legem non dubito primis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis patribus doctore Deo, diem hunc solennem, augustum &amp; sacrum fuisse,</hi> saith the learned <hi>Mercerus.</hi> Even before<note place="margin">in Gen. 2. 3.</note> the Law I doubt not but this Day by Gods teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was solemn and sacred to those primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

negative, standing in the midst of the two Tables, to shew that they both depend upon the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; which I conceive to be the reason that in some passages of Scripture the keeping of the Sabbath day is put for the whole body of Gods Worship, and pressed with more earnestnesse both in the following Chapters of the same book, and in the books following of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, than any of the other Precepts; so as till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, and at his coming too, nay, for a while after his death and passion, resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ascention (that the mother Synagogue (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks) might be buried with the greater honour) it was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>My conclusion shall be, That as the tenth part, <hi>ad minimum</hi> is Gods portion for the fruits of the earth, so the seventh part of his proportion for time: and both of them not onely under the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall

manner set apart for the service of God: In the handling whereof wee have two things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered: first the severall names of this day, and then why it is termed the Lords day.</p>
            <p>This day is sometimes called the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Sunday,</hi> sometimes the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Eighth day,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as here in my Text.</p>
            <p>The name of <hi>the Sabboth</hi> (I must confesse) in the ancient <hi>Councels</hi> or <hi>Fathers</hi> wee shall hardly find ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to this day, unlesse withall they adde <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum Christianorum</hi> the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>bboth of Christians; For when they speak of the Sabboth absolutely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition, they alwayes understand the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday the Seventh day, the Sabboth day of the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>wes, which except it bee heedfully observed of those who are conversant in their writings, it may be an occasion of much errour and mistake. Which notwithstanding I make no question, but this day may without any just suspition of Iudaisme be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Sabboth:</hi> and that for these Reasons. First, because our Saviour himselfe (as I conceive) hath so called it: <hi>pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. 24. 20.</note> 
               <hi>on the Sabboth day;</hi> where he speakes of the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hierusilem,</hi> which fell out about forty years after his Ascention, whereas the Sabboth of the Iewes was abrogated by his resurrectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently it cannot well bee understood, but of the Sabboth of Christians, the day here spoken of. My second Reason is, for that <hi>Sabbath</hi> signifying Rest, the word in regard of that signification is appliable to our day, as well as to theirs, it being a day of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94801:6"/>
Rest to us, as well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> to them: True indeed it is that the Sabbath was so called <hi>a day of rest,</hi> in a double respect: First because God him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e upon that day rested from the workes of the Creation; and then because they in imitation of God, and by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God were likewise to rest upon the same day; whereas ours cannot be called a Sabbath in respect of the first, that is Gods rest; but only in respect of the second, that is our rest. My third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, for that our Lords day succeeded in the place of the Sabboth, and was ordained to the same gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall end; as our spirituall exercises are called Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, because they succeed in the place of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, so may our Lords day not unfitly bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Sabbath, because it succeeds in the place of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eir Sabboth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this day here spoken of in my Text is sometimes called <hi>Sunday,</hi> which though it be a name imposed by the Gentiles, who knew not the true God, giving the names of the seven Planets to the seven dayes of the week; yet for distinctions s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ke I see not, but wee Christians may without superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or relation to them call the dayes of the weeke by the same names that they did, as well as we do the Planets; or as God himselfe calls the stars by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

not a freedome of choice left to themselves, what day they would set apart for the publique exercises of Religion, but what was foretold by the Prophets, what was shaddowed before, and under the Law; what they practised, and delivered herein, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Lord: As one of them speaks for<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> all, in another case indeed, yet not improperly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to our present purpose: which being so, they doubtlesse derogate much, both from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Lords-day, and from the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Author thereof, who would make it no better then an humane ordination, or at best an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Constitution, framed according to the pattern of the Apostles; and consequently change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able either by the Civill Magistrate, as some, or by the Church as others: Whereas the Primitive Christians were so constantly resolved of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable fixednesse thereof, that they expected his return, to the generall judgement upon the same<note place="margin">Lact. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As all time, so all dayes which are a part of time are of the Lords making: and as a part of time, so are they equall among themselves, as well in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as Duration; but in regard of the end <hi>to which,</hi> and the use <hi>for which</hi> they are set apart; so are they

The eminency whereof, it shall not be amisse to consider comparatively in relation to other dayes: First to the Jewish Sabbath; and then to other dayes of the week, specially other Holidayes of the Christians.</p>
            <p>For the first of these, as by the Gentiles the Lords day was usually called <hi>Dies Solis,</hi> Sunday; So was the Jewish Sabbath <hi>Dies Saturni,</hi> Saturns-day, or Saturday; and how much the Sun in bignesse exceeds, and excells in brightnesse and influence, the starre by them named <hi>Saturn,</hi> so much doth the Lords-day exceed, and excell the Jewish Sabbath. Their Sabbath was instituted in memory of the Creation; our Lords-day of the Redemption of the world: Now for the Creation of the world, God only spake the word, and it was made; but for the Redemption thereof, the Eternall Word, the Sonne of God himself must become incarnate; and by the space of many yeers, both do, and suffer many things: by means of the Creation, man was intituled to the earthly paradise; by means of the Redemption, to the heavenly: by the Creation he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94801:12"/>
was made a Companion of the Angels; by redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are made in some sort his inferiors, being sent forth to minister for their sakes, that shall be heirs of salvation: In the Creation all the other Creatures have their interest together with man; the work of Redemption is proper to him alone: Again, the Jewish Sabboth was renewed in memory of their deliverance from the bondage of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but our Lords-day ordained to be kept holy, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our deliverance from the bondage of Sin and Satan, who held us under in a farre more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable slavery then that of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Moreover it is by Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> observed, that the Israelites passed<note place="margin">Serm. de temp. 154.</note> safely through the read Sea, not on the Sabboth, but on our Lords-day; and both by him and <hi>Origen,</hi>

Die dominico jejunare nefas ducimus, &amp; de geniculis adorare,</hi> We hold it unlawfull upon the Lords Day, either to fast or to pray kneeling.

               </gap>s Day but I know not how it came to passe, that after ages, by insensible degrees, much degenerating from the simplicity of those primitive times, so infinitely multiplied and magnified their holy dayes beyond all measure and reason, that the Lords Day began to be fleighted, and at last, with many, to be accounted a common holy day, nay, perchance, inferiour to some of the Saints; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that with us it had lost, not onely the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due unto it, but the name, by the Apostles imposed upon it. Which, no doubt, a speciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of that thick cloud of superstition which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards over shadowed the face of the Church; and in appearance, the reducing of this day to its originall honour and name, would prove the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est means to restore the Church again to her origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lustre and beauty, even in those parts where that cloud is not yet dispelled; as in all likelyhood
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94801:14"/>
the preserving of that name and honour with us, would likewise serve to preserve that soundnesse of religion which now by Gods blessing we have long enjoyed under three such Princes, as the world in their severall kindes, and in succession, cannot shew the like. And so I passe to my fourth and last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part, The duties of the Lords Day, which, in a word, is to be <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> that is in Sptrituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> upon this day was. Though he were then banished into the solitary Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> where he had no means to converse with any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, much lesse to communicate with their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in religious duties, yet was he present with them in spirit, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was with the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. 5.</note> though absent in body, much desiring to be present with them, and joyning with them, even in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions. A good lesson for such as cannot have accesse to the publique Congregation, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering they cannot do what they would, yet to do what they may, which is religiously to observe the Lords Day in their private houses or chambers, in the ship or in the prison, if their condition be such as they cannot come to the Lords House. This is it which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> adviseth, discoursing of the<note place="margin">Serm. 251.</note> duties of this day, <hi>veniat cuique possibile est &amp; oret in conventu Ecclesiae pro peccatis suis Deum,</hi> He who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly can come, let him come, and in the Church, let him there pray to God for the pardon of his sinnes; <hi>Qui vero hoc non possit saltem in domo sua oret, &amp; non neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligat Deo solvere votum &amp; reddere pensum servitutis,</hi> but he who cannot come to the Church, let him pray in his house, and let him not neglect the paying of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94801:15"/>
his Vows to God, and the rendering of that service which is exacted.</p>
            <p>Now for such as have free accesse to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, these spirituall exercises are either publike or private; publike, in the Lords House; private, in our own houses with our families, or in our chambers and closets, in our Gardens, or in the Fields. The exercises to be performed, are confession of our faith and our faults, absolution, thanksgiving, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty prayer, reading and expounding the sacred Oracles of God, the private readi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>g of the Scriptures or other godly books, the administration and participation of the holy Sacraments, the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Divine Hymnes, meditation and conference, as well touching those things we have read and heard, as touching the wonderfull works of God in the Creation, and Government of the world: This is to be in the Spirit, specially if these duties<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be practised by us in a Spirituall manner, that is, if we perform them not faintly or formally, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively and devoutly, as knowing that <hi>God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped by us in Spirit and Truth,</hi> with<note place="margin">Io. 4. 24.</note> a perfect heart, and with a willing minde, as the good King <hi>David</hi> taught his Son <hi>Solomon:</hi> Withall<note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 9.</note> we must remember, that works of charity are not to be neglected on this day, they being the marks and effects of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And that we may the better intend these Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all works in a Spirituall manner, we are still to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our mindes that this Day is the Lords Day, and not the devills or ours; and that not a part one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the whole day is his, the devils day we

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94801:16"/>
to the true meaning of the holy Ghost, and of the Apostles thereby directed, that on the sacred Day wherein our own integrity was restored, all do rest and surcease labour; that neither Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nor other, on that day, put their hands to forbidden works; for if the Jews did so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence their Sabboth, which was but a shadow of ours, are not we which inhabite the light and truth of grace, bound to honour that day which the Lord himself hath honoured, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both delivered us from dishonour, and from death? Are not we bound to keep it singular and <hi>inviolable,</hi> well contenting our selves with so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a grant of the rest, and not incroaching upon that one which God hath chosen to his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Were it not wretchlesse neglect of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make that very day common, and to think we may do with it as with the rest.</q>

            <p>Which religious Edict of his, though it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed chiefly bent against bodily labour, yet may it well be extended against such pastimes and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on that Day, as cannot but withdraw us from the keeping of it inviolable. That unlawfull recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations may not be used on that day, no Christian, I think, will deny, since they may not be used on any dayes; so as all the doubt is touching lawfull recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, whereof some also there are, which I think no man will affirm to be lawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Some reformed Churches in other parts may perchance give way to the use of them on the Lords Day, which in them is somewhat the more excusable, because they have none other holy days, though for mine own part I think it better if they had, yet that the very same Pastors of those Churches who admitted or connived at the use of such manlike exercises, as severely cryed down ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate sports on that Day, let one speak for all: If we employ the Sunday, saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> to make<note place="margin">

It is to this purpose worth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that our Saviour, on the very Day of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, which was the first day of the week, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ow the Lords Day, appeared sundry times; in the morning, at noon, and at night, thereby to shew, That not a part onely, but the whole Day was his; And again on the eighth day following, which was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94801:18"/>
likewise the Lords Day, he appeared to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles at night, to instruct them, and confirm their faith, thereby to teach us, that even then it ceaseth not to be the Lords Day. And truely I see not how men can effectually profit by publike hearing, who neglect private conference, and meditation after they have heard: Meditation being the concoction of our Spirituall Food, without which the soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be nourished. They who bought and sold <hi>in atrio Templi,</hi> in the porch, or utmost part of the Temple, thereby prophaned the Temple it self and made it a den of theeves, as our Saviour censures them; and I doubt not but he is as tender of this Day, and every part thereof, as of his House, or rather more tender; his House being consecarted to him by men, but his Day, by Himself, to Himself; and besides, in the Primitive Church he was long without an House, but not without a Day from the very first infancy thereof: which hath made me to wonder, that they who are so zealous for the Lords House, and the Lords Portion, received by the hand of his Ministers, should not likewise be as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the religious observation of his Day, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering that it may give men occasion to suspect, though perchance unjustly, that they pursue their own pomp and profit, in being so hot for the one, and their own ease and pleasure in being so cold for the other. He who stands for the Lords House, and the Lords Portion, because it is the Lords, cannot but stand likewise for the Lords Day, because it is his, his Day, doubtlesse having as strong a relation to him, as either his House or his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94801:19"/>
Portion, if not a stronger: He who layes sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands upon a part of that which is consecrated to the Lord, thereby violates the whole; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife stricken with sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death, because the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>it men to detain from the Lord a part of his Day, let us take heed lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they be the more emboldened to detain part of his Portion, both from him and us.</p>
            <p>The people, God knows, for the most part, are of themselves apt enough to take more liberty than is fit, to take an Ell, where there is but an Inch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them; and having once gotten the rains loose, to run away in a full carreer. And if it be observed, it will appear that more mischiefs have ensued upon publique Games on the Lords Day, than on any other day of the week; nay my self have observed more to have been drowned, who went into the River onely to wash their bodies, on the Lords D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y, than any other day beside. In <hi>Cornwall,</hi> not farre from Saint <hi>Germans,</hi> are in a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, certain stones to be seen, which the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring people call the Hurlers, because they stand in that order and distance each from other, as Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers use to do; and the current tradition among the inhabitants there, is, that certain Hurlers, for the prophanation of the Lords Day in that exercise, were, by Gods Judgement, turned into those stones: which <hi>Camden</hi> calls a pious errour, and so I beleeve it to be: yet withall from thence I observe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94801:19"/>
which even in regard of manlike exercises, was born to that Day, and that in the depth of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, for otherwise such a tradition could not have gotten foot and prevailed among them. Neither do I alleadge this for want of true examples in this kinde, there being many and me norable, which are recorded by others, as well of forraigne parts, as our own Country, in which (to the honour be it spoken of the reformed Religion, and our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, the protectors thereof) our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Judges have restrained themselves, and our ordinary Carryers have, by publique Authority, been restrained from travelling on the Lords Day, (though both carry with them the advantage of the publique good) to the great comfort of such as without all schismaticall humour or peevish affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of singularity, heartily embrace both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine professed, and discipline practised in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and their hope is that other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses yet remaining and tending to the prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Day may in good time likewise be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as in some forraigne reformed Churches they have lately been.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for our instruction and imitation against the prophanation of this Day, as well Generall Councells, and Provinciall Synods have bent their Canons, as Emperors, and Kings, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals their Laws: Such were <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>My Conclusion shall be, That if some bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations on the Lords Day, for the better sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereof, be thought requisite, yet under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, I should conceive them more tolerable in the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First, That they be in their conscience fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the games which they use be not onely lawfull in themselves, but also in regard of the Day; for <hi>whatsoever is not of faith, is sinne;</hi> that which I<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The second limitation is, That our Recreations do not tend to the scandall of others; <hi>If meat make my</hi>

My third limitation is, That these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations tend to the better sanctification of the Lords Day, in the refreshing of mens spirits, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication being by all Divines confessed to be the principall end thereof, which being laid for a
