            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Miſs is a new Name, which the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> of this Age beſtows on <hi>one,</hi> that our <hi>unmannerly</hi> Anceſtors call'd, <hi>Whore</hi> and <hi>Strumpet.</hi> A certain <hi>Help meet</hi> for a Gentleman, inſtead of a Wife; Serving either for preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sin of <hi>Marrying,</hi> or elſe as a little Side <hi>Pillow,</hi> to render the Yoke of <hi>Matrimony</hi> more eaſie. She is an excellent <hi>Conveniency</hi> for thoſe that have more <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> than <hi>Wit,</hi> to ſpend their <hi>Eſtates</hi> upon, and the moſt that can be ſaid in her <hi>Commendation,</hi> Is that ſhe will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring a Man to <hi>Repentance.</hi> Yet you may call her an <hi>honeſt Courtezan,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>Common Incloſ'd;</hi> for though ſhe is an <hi>Out-lier,</hi> yet ſhe ſeems to be confined within the <hi>Pale,</hi> and differs from your ordinary <hi>Proſtitute,</hi> as <hi>Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale</hi> men from <hi>Retailers,</hi> one perhaps has an <hi>hundred</hi> Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and to'ther but <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> and yet <hi>this</hi> gets moſt by her Trade. Indeed ſhe may well <hi>thrive,</hi> ſeeing ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carries her <hi>Stock</hi> about her, and every man is deſirous to deal in her Comodity: For ſhe is a Gallants <hi>Buſineſs,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48516:3"/>

            </p>
            <p>The Royal Preacher calls her a <hi>Strange</hi> Woman, but we uſually term her a <hi>Common</hi> Woman, and have reaſon ſo to do; for ſins that were <hi>ſtrange</hi> in <hi>Solomons</hi> days, are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in ours. She is a Caterpillar that deſtroys many a hopeful Young Gentleman in the Bloſſom, a <hi>Land-Syren,</hi> far more dangerous than they in the Sea: For he that falls into her hands, runs a <hi>three-fold</hi> hazard of Shipwracking <hi>Soul, Body,</hi> and <hi>Eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She talks high of her <hi>Family,</hi> and tells a large ſtory how they were Ruined by the late <hi>Wars.</hi> But the true Hiſtory of her Life, is generally to this Effect: She is only the <hi>Cub</hi> of a <hi>Bumkin,</hi> lickt into a Genteel form by <hi>Town Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Nature gave her a good <hi>Face</hi> and an indifferent ſtock of <hi>Confidence,</hi> which ſhe by prudent management, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into <hi>Impudence:</hi> like a forward <hi>Roſe Bud</hi> ſhe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betimes, and loſt that trifle they call a <hi>Maiden-head</hi> ſo early, that ſhe cannot remember ſhe ever had <hi>any</hi> ſuch thing. She was ſcarce <hi>Thirteen</hi> when her Fathers <hi>Plow man,</hi> and the <hi>Squire</hi> their Landlord (the veryer <hi>Clown</hi> of the <hi>Two</hi>) were Joint Tenants to her <hi>Coppy-hold,</hi> but proving with Child ſhe had the wit to lay it to the <hi>Laſt,</hi> who for his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit diſpatcht her Incognito with a Sum of Money on a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers Pack, to be disburthen'd at <hi>London,</hi> the goodlieſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in <hi>England</hi> to ſhelter a great <hi>Belly:</hi> There the <hi>Bant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> was expoſed to the Tuition of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> in a <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basket,</hi> and the Charitable <hi>Midwife</hi> (who counts <hi>procuring</hi> in a civil way, a neceſſary part of her Office) ſoon brought her acquainted with a <hi>Third Rate Gentlewoman,</hi> who took her a Lodging in a Garret, and allow'd her <hi>ſix ſhillings</hi> a Week. But making a Sally abroad one Night, ſhe pickt up a <hi>Drunken Cully.</hi> and at a Tavern (whilſt he was no leſs <hi>pleaſantly</hi> imployed) pickt his pocket of a <hi>Gold Watch,</hi> and ſome ſtragling <hi>Guinnies,</hi> and left him to Pawn his <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Perriwig</hi> for the Reckoning. After this lucky Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48516:3"/>
ſhe diſcards <hi>Monſieur ſhabby</hi> (her former Cuſtomer) and her <hi>Lofty</hi> Lodging, puts her ſelf in a good <hi>Garb,</hi> gets a <hi>Maid</hi> (forgive me, for I Lye, I mean a <hi>Shee-ſervam</hi>) whom ſhe teaches to call her <hi>Madam,</hi> and <hi>your Honour,</hi> and hires Noble Rooms richly Furniſhed, about <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> there ſhe takes <hi>State</hi> upon her, and <hi>practiſes</hi> every day four hours in the <hi>Glaſs,</hi> how <hi>Greatneſs</hi> will become her. Her firſt <hi>buſineſs</hi> is to make her ſelf be taken <hi>notice</hi> of, to which purpoſe like <hi>Dinah,</hi> ſhe walks the Streets; ſometimes like <hi>Jael,</hi> ſhe ſtands at the Door; and ſometimes like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> ſhe looks out at the Window: But her main <hi>Market-place</hi> is the <hi>Balcony,</hi> which ſhe frequents as conſtantly as any Lady in a <hi>Romance;</hi> and the Language of her Eyes is, <hi>What do you lack Sir,</hi> By which ſhe at laſt attracts a Wealthy <hi>Gallant,</hi> who with a little <hi>Addreſs,</hi> obtains the mighty Honour of her <hi>Acquaintance;</hi> but ſhe ſeems extream nice, reſerv'd and modeſt, proteſts ſhe would not go to a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> for a VVorld, when the whole buſineſs is, ſhe is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid of being <hi>Pawn'd</hi> there. In brief, ſhe <hi>Manages</hi> him ſo diſcreetly, that ſhe <hi>Cheats</hi> him into Love <hi>Inſenſibly,</hi> like a <hi>Taylors Bill,</hi> wherein a man ſees himſelf <hi>Rookt</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably, yet knows not <hi>where</hi> to find fault. Having thus got the <hi>Wood-cock</hi> into the Pit-fall, ſhe reſolves to <hi>Pluck</hi> him: VVhen he importunes her for the <hi>Great kindneſs,</hi> ſhe talks of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and vows ſhe will never <hi>ſtain</hi> her Reputation but for <hi>valuable Conſiderations,</hi> this brings them to <hi>Articles,</hi> he promiſes to allow her a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pounds</hi> a Year, and ſhe Swears a <hi>Thouſand</hi> diſſembling Oaths, how infinitely ſhe loves him, and that ſhe will prove <hi>conſtant,</hi> and true to him alone, and never be <hi>concern'd</hi> with any other man in the VVorld; and the ſilly Fop is ſo fatally bewitcht as to <hi>believe</hi> her; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues a long time in that fools Paradice of <hi>Dotage,</hi> whilſt in the mean time ſhe drives a <hi>Trade</hi> privately, with two or three more.
