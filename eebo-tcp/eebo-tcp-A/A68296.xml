         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue ſent you, deere friend, a little pamphlet, of the education of Children in learning, which is no phantaſticall nor idle toy, but a verie profitable matter, and moſt neceſſarie to be vrged in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and licentious generation. Wherein I confeſſe, that many learned men haue alreadie beſtowed verie exquiſit and commendable labours: yet for that we haue endeuoured not only to fill vp the emptie roome with ſuch members as wanted, and to ſepatate that which ſeemed ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but alſo to new caſt the whole in another mould, and to bring it to another forme, breefe, and eaſie: I ſuppoſe that it will ſeeme altogether a ſtrange and a new Booke. Furthermore, where as the charge of teaching apperteineth but onely to a fewe of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neder ſort, namely, to Scholemayſters, we to make the argument more popular, haue prefixed a neceſſarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation for all other ſort of people, ſetting foorth the dignitie and vtilitie of the matter, with ſuch holie and ancient Hiſtories, with ſuch plaine and ſenſible reaſons, as may teach the vnlearned with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and not be tedious to thoſe that are learned. Agayne, to ſatisfye in ſome part the expectation of the learned, we haue handled the method more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically, and adorned the whole worke with ſome

wittie, Greeke, and Latin ſentences, engliſhing the ſame neuertheles in the Margent for the behoofe of the vnlearned. And as generally both ſorts may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture thinke that the reading of it will be worth the labour, ſo almoſt euery one of each ſort in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, may finde ſomewhat for his purpoſe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is common with heathen men, when they will commend their Nobilitie, to deriue their pedegree from their Gods, giuing vs to vnderſtand thereby, that if there were any excellencie in them, it came not of themſelues, but God was the author thereof. Therefore O moſt noble diſcipline, from whence doeſt thou fetch thy pedegree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What parentage haſt thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who is the author of thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who ſhould it be els but the father of lights, euen<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> the author of euery good and perfect gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He at the beginning created man in perfect righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, &amp; beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him with all ſingular knowledge.

But what are the men vpon whom this gift was firſt beſtowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who hath been a practiſer and furtherer thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely if wee ſearch the Schooles of all ages and all places, we ſhall finde that from time to time they were men of great renowne, great honour and vertue. Therefore, that we may the more orderly view their traces throughout theſe ſchooles, firſt let vs enter into the olde ſchoole of Gods people, which<note place="margin">3. Schooles.</note> we will call the ſchoole of the Hebrewes: ſecondly, let vs ſtep aſide into the ſchoole of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which wee may call the
<pb facs="tcp:9756:6"/>
ſchoole of humanitie: thirdly, we will come néere to our owne ſchoole, comprehending in it the ſchoole of Chriſtianitie.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſchoole therefore, though <hi>Adam</hi> be conteyned,<note place="margin">1 The ſchoole of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</note> who no doubt did his duetie in teaching his children: yet for that we finde no euidence thereof in writing, wee will paſſe by him and come to his ſonne <hi>Seth,</hi> a very godly and learned ſchoolemaiſter, as I may terme him. For beſides that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that in his daies men began to worſhip God, and to<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 26. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> call vpon his name, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> witneſſeth that he was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man, giuen to the ſtudie of wiſedome, and taught the same to his Nephewes, and they agayne to their poſteritie, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was <hi>Enoch</hi> that walked with God, prophecying and teaching the old world, as appeareth by the teſtimonie of <hi>Iude,</hi> and at length was taken vp into heauen aliue. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">Iude. verſ. 14.</note> the ſame <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth, that when they vnderſtoode that the world ſhould bee twice deſtroyed, once with water, and agayne with fire, they engraued their learning in two pillers; the one of bricke, the other of ſtone, that if the bricke piller ſhould be daſht in peeces with the flood, the ſtone piller might remayne; and if the ſtone piller ſhould bee conſumed with the fire, the bricke piller might remayne to teach men this ancient knowledge. Then both before and likewiſe after the flood, <hi>Noe</hi> is chronicled for a famous Doctor of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 19. 20 2. Pet. 2. 5.</note> and godly knowledge, not only by the holy Ghoſt, but alſo by prophane men. For whereas <hi>Socrates</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">Plato in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebo.</note> that learning being the gift of the Gods, was by <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> the repayrer of mankind after the flood fet out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and brought vnto men, in very trueth it muſt bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Noe,</hi> who was the author of this reparation. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> moſt reuerend teacher in this ſchoole was <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom GOD himſelfe teſtifieth, that he taught his children and familie the way of the Lord. Who alſo, is both for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and teaching commended by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> and <hi>Beroſus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. 8.</note> The like is to be vnderſtood of <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie, as <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, Iacob,</hi> and the reſt, which wee will paſſe ouer together with <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> that auncient Prieſt, ſeeing there is no
<pb facs="tcp:9756:6"/>
mention made of their teaching. Thus wee haue in this ſchoole, <hi>Seth, Enoch, Noe,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> foure moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patriarkes of bleſſed memorie, celebrated by name to be Doctors and maiſters, beſides many others vnnamed.</p>
            <p>But what? Some will ſay, touching their bookes wee heare yet nothing, nothing of writing, nothing of reading. No doubt theſe ages were adorned with ſuch heroicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and golden wittes, that they did conceiue and keepe in minde without the helpe of letters a great deale better than the ages following could do: ſo that their letterleſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written doctrine did bring that fruite and commoditie, which ours doth now being written. Howbeit, by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> report, we ſee that they had the vſe of letters euen before the flood, wherewith theſe two pillers were engrauen, as two famous bookes ſet forth to all the world. But behold, the next renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Doctor in this ſchoole commeth forth with his pen and inke, and writeth the lawes and precepts of the liuing God, with diuers hiſtories full of noble examples, conteyning the doctrine of all diuine and humane matters. I meane <hi>Moſes,</hi> who alſo propounded and interpreted this doctrine to a great multitude of people, and by the commaundement of God ordeyned a continuall order of Prieſtes, and promiſed a ſucceſſion of Prophets that ſhould bee teachers and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſame, charging withall, all parents and houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">Deut. 67.</note> to do the like to their children and houſholders, as (we ſee) the Patriarkes before time had done. This Doctor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought vp in the King of <hi>Egypts</hi> Court was euen from<note place="margin">Act. 7. 22.</note> the cradle inſtructed in learning and wiſedome, as alſo by al likelihood was <hi>Aaron</hi> the eloquent Prieſt, his ſonnes and<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 16. &amp; 7. 1.</note> others of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> though not brought vp in the Court, yet inſtructed in learning: for that if they had been vnlette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they could not haue ſerued in that calling, neither had it been to any purpoſe to write theſe lawes vnto them.</p>
            <p>Next was <hi>Ioſua,</hi> an actiue Captaine, and a teacher of the people, who made vnto them many pithie Orations, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to euery man the portion of his inheritance: which
<pb facs="tcp:9756:7"/>
thing alſo required knowledge in the Mathematicall Artes. After him ſuccéeded many Judges and Prophets beautified with learning, as appeareth otherwiſe, and alſo by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Poeticall Song of <hi>Debora</hi> in the time of the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.<note place="margin">Iud. 5.</note> Furthermore we reade, that the holie woman <hi>Anna</hi> hauing dedicated her child <hi>Samuel</hi> to the ſeruice of the Lord,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 24. &amp; 2. 18. &amp; 3. 1</note> ſo ſoone as he was wained, committed him to <hi>Elie</hi> the Judge and Preeſt to be trained vp in learning: wherefore let <hi>Elie</hi> be added to the former maiſters of teaching. Hitherto we haue had worthy examples of Patriarks, Prophets, Préeſts, and Judges, that taught Children priuatly at home, and all ſorts of perſons publikely in the congregation. Now Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers increaſe, and Parents being either otherwiſe buſied, or elſe not ſufficiently for this purpoſe furniſhed, ſend their Children to the common Schoole, which, as we reade, was<note place="margin">1. Sam. 19. 18. 19. 20.</note> firſt inſtituted in <hi>Naioth,</hi> whereof <hi>Samuel</hi> the Lords Judge and Prophet was moderator and Maiſter. Such an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man was the firſt publike Schoolemaiſter in this Schoole, whoſe Schollers then, as the Schollers a long time after him were called the Sonnes of the Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the benefit of their good inſtruction, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Prophet their Maiſter, was eſtéemed at no leſſe price, then the benefit of their begetting and birth which they had of their Parents. Immediatly heerevpon learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flouriſh, by reaſon that there were ſtore of Prophets and Preeſts to teach the ſame. Of the Prophets two were famous Kings, <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> two Diamonds of art and gratious eloquence, which they haue plentifully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the <hi>Pſalmes, Prouerbs, Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and other their workes, but becauſe their hands were occupied with the royall Scepter, they could not alſo be publike Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters to youth: howbeit, they inſtructed not onely their houſholds priuatly, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, that he was taught<note place="margin">Prou. 4. 1. 2. 3.</note> of his Father, but alſo the aſſembly publikely, and therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth himſelfe the <hi>Preacher.</hi> The other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets<note place="margin">Eccle. 12. 9.</note> in thoſe dayes were <hi>Gad, Nathan, Heman, Elcana,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9756:7"/>
               <hi>Ahias,</hi> and <hi>Iedo:</hi> after in the dayes of <hi>Roboam, Abias,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 29. 29. 1. Chro. 15. 5. 2. Chr. 9. 29. &amp; 13. 22. &amp; 15. 1. 1.

               <hi>Elias</hi> was ſubiect to ſuch worldly affections as we are, yet by the ſpirit of God he ſo ſubdued them, that he triumphed ouer them in a glorious Chariot aſcending, like <hi>Enoch,</hi> to heauen aliue: but knowing thereof before, he went from place to place with his ſucceſſor <hi>Eliſeus,</hi> and viſited the<note place="margin">2.

Further, how ſtudious he himſelfe was, we may perceiue, in that the <hi>Sunamit</hi> built a chamber, and furniſhed it with neceſſaries of purpoſe for the Prophet, that he might lodge<note place="margin">2.

From the dayes of this <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> vnto <hi>Malachi,</hi> we haue ſixteene Prophets, verie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb facs="tcp:9756:8"/>
for their paines in teaching all ſorts of people, both yong and old, by their liuely voyce, whileſt they liued, and alſo by their writing continually, ſithence their death, of whome nine, to wit, <hi>Ionas, Oſee, Eſaias, Obadias, Amos, Micheas, Naum, Ioel,</hi> and <hi>Habacuck,</hi> were before the Babylonicall captiuitie: foure, <hi>Ieremias, Zophanias, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> in and about the captiuitie. This cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie laſted ſeauentie yeeres, in the which, as vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe of the eſtates both eccleſtaſticall and ciuill, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie followed the ruine of the Schooles and Colledges: ſo doubtleſſe the Schooles were repaired againe together with the repairing of the policie and Prieſthood. In which renewed eſtate, God ſtirred vp the three other Prophets, <hi>Haggeus, Zacharias</hi> the latter, and <hi>Malachi,</hi> to occupie the Doctors chaire in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregation, and alſo in the Schooles. To theſe adde <hi>Ezra,</hi> beth a Prieſt, and an excellent Doctor of the Lawe, that obteined great fauour for his nation of<note place="margin">Ezra. 7. 1. 2. &amp;c. Nehem. 8. 2. 3.</note>

            <p>And thus the race of the Prophets is come to an ende, which thing brought an end alſo to the goodlieſt beawtie of this Hebrewe Schoole. For the Prieſts and Leuites, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this point, nor in doing their duetie otherwiſe, were ſo diligent, but that they are reprehended by the Prophets many times for their ſlack and corrupt behauiour. Neither were the Schollers euer called the children of the Prieſts, but the children of the Prophets, becauſe the Prophets were their beſt maiſters: and yet in thoſe dayes God ſent ſome other good maiſters that were Prieſts and learned men, as <hi>Ioachim</hi> the Prieſt, who, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, wrote the hiſtories of <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Heſter:</hi> and the ſeauentie learned Doctors, whome <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt ſent to <hi>Ptolome Philadelphus</hi>

King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to tranſlate the Hebrewe Bible into the Greeke tongue, by which meanes the word of God came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings Librarie at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſo was ſet open to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. With theſe may <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſome of <hi>Syrach</hi> be ſorted, and his grandfather likewiſe, men of great reading and learning, as their doctrine in the booke called <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus</hi> doth witneſſe.</p>
            <p>All this while, the Judges and Captaines, by whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> were gouerned after their captiuitie, were of the ſtock of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in which order <hi>Ianna Hyrcanus</hi> was the laſt. In whoſe dayes the itch of ambition and couetouſneſſe had ſo infected the Prieſthood, that whereas it ſhould go by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the poſteritie of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Aaron,</hi> now it was, who might buy it for money of the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> which then held them in miſerable ſubiection. <hi>Iaſon</hi> was the firſt that attempted this way to get the Prieſthood; who to ſhoulder out his brother <hi>Onias,</hi> gaue for it to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.

Hereof it came to paſſe, that within fortie yeeres there ſprang vp the ſects of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> of the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> and of the <hi>Saduces;</hi> which corrupted the ſinceritie of Gods word, and broched very deteſtable and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opinions. Notwithſtanding, they had their Sinagogues and Colledges abroad in diuers cities and townes, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And of the <hi>Phariſies</hi> was one <hi>Gamaliel</hi>

But to redreſſe the foreſayd corruption, was ſent the holy man of
<pb facs="tcp:9756:9"/>
God <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> repleniſht with the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> who taught publikely both the congregation, and alſo many Schollers that continually attended vpon him. Let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge therefore this man to be a viſiter and a reformer of the Colledges, and alſo the laſt Doctor in this Schoole of the Hebrewes. So now for the dignitie of Schooling in this firſt Schoole we haue verie worthie examples of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, firſt the Patriarks that taught their houſholds, then the Prophets and Prieſts that taught not only their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds priuatly, but alſo the congregation of the people, and companies of Schollers publikly: and for amplifying the honor and eſtimation of theſe offices, it pleaſed God that ſometimes Kings and Princes ſhould partly ſerue the turne therein.</p>
            <p>But héere ſome will obiect, that all this teaching was for<note place="margin">2. The Schoole of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>

Yea, though all men can not be learned Doctors, yet learning is neceſſarie for all ſorts and all degrées of men, whether they be high or lowe, rich or poore, rulers or ſubiects, eccleſiaſticall or ciuill.

Do ye marueile how this came to paſſe? Surely for that in old time, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> recordeth, men taught either their kinſfolke, as children, nephewes and brethren, or their deere friends: which without conſtraint of promiſe were ſufficiently bound by naturall affection and the bands of friendſhip, with all the dueties of thankfulneſſe to recompence their teacher.

            <p>For in the former Schooles God was acknowledged to be the author of diſcipline and learning, but man was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and meſſenger, by whoſe ſeruice God did put it in practiſe: but this latter Schoole was not onely inſtituted by the authoritie of our gratious God, but alſo the firſt Doctor therein was his only déere Sonne our Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore of him is called the Schoole of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. He, as the Prophets had done before, taught pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely both the people in the congregation, and alſo was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes furniſhing of his Diſciples and Schollers with ſtore of treaſure, that out of the ſame afterwards they might be able, like good houſholders, to bring foorth vnto their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<note place="margin">Math. 13. 52.</note> things both new and old.

Theſe Schollers at length being Doctors, to wit, Apoſtles, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Prophets, and Miniſters, walked in the ſteps of Chriſt their maiſter, and of the old Prophets their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, not only teaching the multitude in the congregation, but alſo making their Schollers learned, and fit for ſome function in preaching the Goſpell.

            <p>For as the Schoole of humanitie was heere planted when it was yet tender and young, ſo was the Schoole of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, inſomuch that our Countreyman <hi>Gyldas</hi> writeth, that the Goſpell was receiued heere euen from the comming of Chriſt, in the dayes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> by the preaching of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> (as others declare) whome <hi>Phillip</hi> the Apoſtle ſent hither out of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Then in the time of the valiant King <hi>Arthur,</hi> the exerciſe and ſtudie of learning was diligently applied in <hi>Southwales.</hi> The like is recorded to be done an hundred and twenty yeares after in the dayes of <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſtangles,</hi> who ſet vp Schooles of the Gréeke and Latin toong. And <hi>Egbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares after followed the ſame ſteps of his predeceſſors. King <hi>Ethelſtane</hi> was not only a founder of Schooles for learning, but alſo a profound learned Aſtronomer himſelfe. Yet of all our auncient Kings, none may be preferred, no nor compared to that moſt vertuous King <hi>Alfred,</hi> either for knowledge in the Artes and all good letters, or for loue and diligence to aduance the ſame. For beſides that he tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diuers bookes into the vulgar toong, and wrote many new of his owne, he alſo inſtructed all his Children, Sonnes, and Daughters, in the liberall Artes, and did ſhut the dore of climing to any dignitie in the Court againſt ſuch as wanted the furniture of learning. Furthermore, he procured with great charges learned men, ſome to be his Counſellers, as the godly Diuine <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> afterwards martired by his Schollers at <hi>Malmesburie,</hi> ſome to teach the Schooles and Colledges, whereof he ordeined diuers in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Therefore now we haue the bleſſed founder of that famous
<pb facs="tcp:9756:16"/>
Uniuerſitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> founded aboue ſeauen hundred yeres agone, whether before or after the founding of the Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of <hi>Cambridge</hi> it is not materiall, but in either of them at this day are ſixteene goodly Colledges: and moreouer in <hi>Oxford</hi> eight Haules builded by Kings, Queens, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Biſhops, and other good men, and enriched with lands, reuenewes, ſtipends, as alſo eſtabliſhed and fortified with lawes, ample priuiledges, and immunities for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and commoditie of Students and learned men. Theſe are two bright fountaines of learning, whoſe whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtreames runne plentifully abroade, watering not only this Realme, but alſo forraine Countries, to the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Church of God. Alſo by the like good Authors, after the ſame manner, and for the ſame cauſe, were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many other houſes of learning, Colledges, and free Schooles, as partly we ſee in this Towne, and more amply may knowe and ſee in the Cities, Townes and Uillages throughout the Realme, which I will ſurceaſe to purſue any farther in perticular for that it would be an endleſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Now then we haue verie haſtely in reſpect of ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious a matter, trauailed through theſe three Schooles of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> wherein traching the dignitie of learning and Schooling, whether ye conſider the ſetters foorth and ſupporters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or the teachers, or elſe the Schollers, we haue noted out vnto you of all three ſorts, beſides God the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Kings, Princes, wiſe Counſellers, men of great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, vertue, &amp; godlynes, generally in all theſe Schooles, and perticularly alſo we haue obſerued how euery one doth excell in his peculiar prayſe, namely, the Schoole of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> hath the chiefe praiſe of moſt auncient and true godlines: the Schoole of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of framing an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall way and method to attaine learning by: the Schoole of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of manifeſting the true practiſe of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, referring it to the right end.</p>
            <p>Now if by any meanes all theſe ſo honorable and godly perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

Nay, <hi>Socrates</hi> will tell thee, that as a good and a couragious Colt, if he bee broken while he is young, will be tractable and fit to do good ſeruice, but being set runne till he be old, will be fierce and vnprofitable: euen ſo a boy endued with the gifts of nature, if he bee well inſtructed by diſcipline, will proue a good man: but if he bee not inſtructed in his youth with good precepts, will waxe very intollerable.

            <p>And concerning your ſelues in particular, right worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when your godly wiſedome doth conſider how many and how great bleſſings our gracious God hath beſtowed vpon your Towne and the Inhabitants thereof, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by ſea, commodities by land, great wealth, plentie of all neceſſaries, no want of Dainties. Agayne, ſchooling for your youth, the exerciſe of religion, and continual preaching of the Goſpell, the grace to receiue it, and the prayſe of forwardnes therein, euen from the dayes of the laſt King <hi>Henry:</hi> when you do call to minde, I ſay, that our bountifull father hath in all theſe things opened his hand of liberalitie wider to you than to other countries, yea than to many townes of our own countrie; how can you but be feruently moued with heart and will and all the veynes of your bodie, to ſhewe your ſelues thankfull to the giuer of theſe ſo vnſpeakable benefites, both in vſing them according to his holy will and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo in prayſing and magnifying his glorious name for them. Now, to vſe them aright, is not to ſtay in conſuming them priuatly vpon our owne bodies, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them to the profite of the Common wealth, and to the furtherance of our owne ſaluation, that God thereby may be glorified. And foraſmuch as your children that proue ſkilfull Marchants, expert Mariners, and Maiſters in the arte of Nauigation, would in like manner (a great many of them) be diſcreet, and wiſe Councellers, yea, Judges, Juſtices and Rulers in the Common wealth, and (that which moſt is) learned and eloquent Preachers in the Church of Chriſt, if they were brought vp in the diſcipline and ſciences of theſe

For then do Common wealthes flouriſh moſt, and are moſt happie when they are gouerned and ordered by learned and vertuous men, ſayth <hi>Plato.</hi> What, only <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher?

O therefore that this Towne might now bring foorth ſome young impes and buds of learning, whoſe fruite would bee ſweeter than all banquetting diſhes to feede the Common wealth and Church of God, both here and in other places. For what great good would it do, not onely to your ſelues and to this Weſterne part of our countrie, but alſo to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of other Nations, which reſort hither for earthly gayne, when by this meanes they ſhall carie away heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When they ſhall finde, euen in Marchants ſhops, learning more plentiful than wares, ſufficient to refute their errors, and to inſtruct them in the trueth and way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How would the glorie of God heereby ſpreade it ſelfe and ſhine euery where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What a perpetuitie or perpetuall ſtay of the manifold bleſſings of God would this holy and right vſing of them bring vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In what eſtimation therefore ye hold the glorie of God, what account ye make of the ſaluation of your ſoules, of the felicitie of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, at that price muſt ye eſtéeme the planting of learning, and ſo great care muſt you haue of the good education of your children.</p>

            <p>Children therefore are vertuouſly trained vp in good learning, partly by the helpe of the Parents, and partly by the diligence of the teacher. The Parents firſt care is, aſſoone as his child beginneth to ſpeake, to prouide that he vſe none other companie, then ſuch as are both honeſt and ciuill, aſwell in behauiour, as in language. He ſhall therefore ſeclude from his Child barbarous nurſſes, clowniſh playing mates, and all ruſticall perſons: neither ſhall he himſelfe ſpeake in the hearing of his Child either wantonly, or otherwiſe, any rude or barbarous ſpeach, much leſſe ſhall he teach him any leawde or vnhoneſt talke, as many do, or ſuffer him to be in
<pb facs="tcp:9756:20"/>
the companie of vnthriftie and vnhoneſt perſons. For a Child like an emptie new veſſell being voide of all learning, is moſt apt to receiue that which is firſt taught, and that which is firſt taught, ſticketh déepeſt in memorie, whether it be good or bad. Timothy was nouriſhed vp in Godlines by<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 5. &amp; 3. 15.</note> his Mother and Grandmother, godly nurſſes, therefore he followed the doctrine of godlines continually. Againe, as<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 6.</note> Cornelia the mother and nurſſe of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, was an eloquent woman, ſo none in Rome were more eloquent then they. So Hortenſia excéeded other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in eloquence, for that from her infancie ſhe was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to heare her Father Hortenſius, a moſt excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

Nay, the ſmall diuerſitie of ſpeach euen in one and the ſame countrey being admitted at the firſt, will hardly afterwards euer waxe out of vſe. Whereof it commeth to paſſe, that together in one towne, yea, in one houſe, we heare one ſpeake Northernly, another Weſternly, another Kentiſhly, <hi>Adeò a teneris conſueſcere multum eſt.</hi> Finally<note place="margin">An vſe in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and kept hath ſo great force.</note> we ſee, that ſoft Waxe will receiue any print, that young plants may be bowed any way, that the bodies of infants may be faſhioned as ye liſt: but neither the Waxe being hardned, nor the plant being waxt a tree, nor the infant being growne vp, can eaſily change the faſhion which it firſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

And as it muſt be had generally concerning all the companie that the child vſeth at the firſt, ſo eſpecially concerning his firſt Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter.

Thoſe Fathers then do vnaduiſedly, which care not to what Teacher they commit the prime of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo that he be better learned than the Children, although he be not his crafts maiſter, nor haue any iudgement nor dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie in teaching, whereby it happeneth now and then, that the firſt maiſter being miſliked, another is ſought for, then the third, and likewiſe the fourth, and perhaps the fifth, ſixth, or more, which change and diuerſitie of Maiſters muſt néedes be troubleſome to the Scholler, and a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to his learning. Some heere do counſell the Father to ſeeke out a priuat Schoolemaiſter for his child, and we ſee that thoſe which would be moſt exquiſit heerein, do follow their counſell, becauſe a priuate teacher hath leiſure to vſe more diligence, and the learner vnder him is ſafer from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hurt by infection of bad companie: but foraſmuch as the correcting of a fault in one is the commending of vertue in another, the praiſe of vertue in one, is the reproouing of vice in another, and both correction and commendation are profitable examples to all ſorts, we haue greater cauſe to preferre a publike Schoolemaiſter, then others had to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a priuat, eſpecially ſeeing that the more perſons he hath in charge, and the more fruit he ſeeth to come of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the more diligence and better courage will be vſe in perfourming the ſame.

<pb facs="tcp:9756:22"/>
all Parents will require in their children: but yet many giuing their Children the bridle to runne whether they liſt, thinke it ſufficient when they offend, to ſay vnto them, <hi>Your Maiſter ſhall heare of it.</hi> But what Parents are thoſe that will haue their children to ſtand more in awe of their maiſter being abſent, then of themſelues being preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Uerely, the ſcholler that is thus threatned, may ſuppoſe that either his father ſhall want oportunitie to complayne to his maiſter, or els that his minde will chaunge when his anger is cooled, or els that he may altogether forget it, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he himſelfe by ſome colourable excuſe, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his maiſter, who knoweth not certainly all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the matter. And finding it to prooue ſo diuers times, at length will make ſmall account of theſe peeuiſh and inconſtant threates. Wherevpon the father moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conceiueth an ill opinion of the maiſter, imagining that he cauſeth not his ſchollers to obſerue any good order, or that he is too remiſſe and full of lenitie. But inaſmuch as it is the propertie of youth to be moued more with one ſtripe giuen, then with ten promiſed, and to feare more the preſence of a father, than the remembrance of a maiſter, <note n="a" place="margin">With ſharp rebuke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time him chide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the rod let walke.</note> 
               <hi>Corripe nunc verbis duris, nunc vtere virga.</hi> The fathers diſcipline, I ſay, here ioyned with the maiſters, will be a ſingular helpe to the good education of the ſcholler, and at once redreſſe and cure the foreſayd maladie. And thus I conclude the duetie of the father, which is not only to prouide by good companie, good teachers, and good examples of himſelfe, that his child be firſt exerciſed in ſuch things as ſauour of vertue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but alſo to keepe him continually in this good order euen when he is vnder a Schoolemaiſter. But that which is here ſpoken of parents, muſt after a ſort bee extended to euery one that hath the like charge or oportunitie, be he tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, gouernour, ſchoolemaiſter or hoſt, though they cannot, eſpecially the laſt cannot do aſmuch herein as the father may.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the duetie of the Schoolemaiſter, which
<pb facs="tcp:9756:22"/>
is to vſe the beſt way and order both in teaching and alſo in gouerning. Touching the former, all knowledge is taught generally both by precepts of arte, and alſo by practiſe of the ſame precepts. They are practiſed partly by obſeruing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of them in other mens workes, and partly by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſomewhat of our owne; and that firſt-by imitation, and at length without imitation. So that the perfection of the arte is not gotten at the firſt, but <hi>Per numeros veniunt ist a</hi>
               <note place="margin">Theſe things come in but one by one in order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> 
               <hi>graduſque ſuos.</hi> Wherefore firſt the ſcholler ſhall learne the precepts: ſecondly, he ſhall learne to note the examples of the precepts in vnfoulding other mens workes: thirdly, to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the examples in ſome worke of his owne: fourthly and laſtly, to make ſomewhat alone without an example. Now, all theſe kindes of teaching are ſeene in euery ſpeciall ſort of the things taught, be it Grammar, Logike, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, Arithmetike, Geometrie, or any other Arte. The Grammar which handleth diuers languages, as Engliſh, Latine, Greeke, Hebrewe, and ſuch others: needeth not to be wholly taught in our owne language. For by a naturall vſe we learne the inflexion of words together, with the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their accidentall ſignifications: as father, fathers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhod, fatherles, fatherly, fatherlines. So likewiſe by the ſame vſe is learned the framing of words together in ſpeach, as he is a father, they are fathers. But yet by this vſe wee haue not the perefect ſkill neither to make, nor to vnmake a word by his parts and parcels. Which facultie is called <hi>Proſodia,</hi> in pronouncing of letters, ſyllables, and words with the mouth: and <hi>Orthographia</hi> in writing of them with the hand, wherein I place the firſt degree of teaching. Therefore the artificiall precepts in this facultie, are the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and twenty letters, and the table of the ſyllables. Theſe the ſcholler ſhall learne perfectly, namely, to knowe the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by their figures, to ſound them aright by their proper names, and to ioyne them together, the vowels with vowels in diphthongs, &amp; the conſonants with vowels in other ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Next he ſhall proceede to practiſe the ſame in ſpelling
<pb facs="tcp:9756:23"/>
and reading other mens workes, as the Catechiſme and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Wherein let him not learne by rote, ſpelling one ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a worde, and ſhufling vp the reſt without diſtinct ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. As if he had to learne this word <hi>mercifulnes,</hi> ſuffer him not, as ſome would, to go on thus: <hi>m-e-r, mer, c-i-f-u-l-n-e-s, mercifulnes.</hi> But according to the letters and ſyllables, which are as precepts in this behalfe, let him learne it by reaſon thus: <hi>m-e-r, mer: c-i, ci, merci: f-u-l, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, merciful: n-e-s, nes, mercifulnes.</hi> For if he repeate the former ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with euery other added vnto them, he ſhall haue all in perfect memorie when he commeth to the ende: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he may erre or forget. But becauſe in the table of ſyllables commonly there are ſet forth no ſyllables that haue aboue two letters a peece, whereas they may haue three, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, fiue, ſixe, ſeauen, or eight a peece: if he knowe not the force of many letters in a ſyllable, he ſhal firſt learne the force of two alone, whereof one muſt be a vowell, then of the ſame two and the third added to them, and ſo the fourth: as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foreſayd word, the firſt ſyllable is of three letters m, e, r<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he know not what <hi>m-e-r</hi> maketh, aſke him firſt for <hi>m-e,</hi> he will anſwere <hi>me,</hi> as his table teacheth him: then for <hi>m-e-r,</hi> no doubt he will anſwere <hi>mer.</hi> The like is to be done in the two laſt ſyllables <hi>ful</hi> and <hi>nes.</hi> So ſtrength a ſillable of eight let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being too hard for a childe to learne all at once, he may learne letter by letter thus: <hi>r-e, re; t-r-e, tre; s-t-r-e, ſtre; s-t-r-e-n, ſtren; s-t-r-e-n-g-t-h, ſtrength.</hi> The like prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is it, when the maiſter nameth the letters and the ſcholler giueth their ſignification. And this is the readieſt way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the true meaning of the letters and ſyllables, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the pronouncing of euery word into the phantaſie of the childe. For as <hi>Cato</hi> euen in his tender yeeres by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of thoſe things that were taught him, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite wonderfully aboue his fellowes: ſo ſurely one word by reaſon thus exactly learned, will bring more fruit then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie words rawlie paſſed ouer.</p>

            <p>But here the ſcholler ſhall finde one hinderance and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, in that the practiſe both not alwaies agree with the precepts. For whereas he learned in his table <hi>t-i, ti, g-i, gi;</hi> he ſhall ſometime in practiſe ſay <hi>t-i, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i, g-i, ghi.</hi> As in theſe words ſaluation, giuen. And ſo in diuers other ſyllables, the letters haue otherwhiles a variable ſound: otherwhiles no ſound at all. Which difficultie, ſeeing it is not reformed by them that are learned, the childe muſt ouercome by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obſeruation and cuſtome. Yet the Printers might eaſely redreſſe that barbarous kind of printing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for <hi>the,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for that, &amp;c. Where y very abſurdly doth repreſent <hi>th,</hi> and <hi>tha,</hi> when as it farre differeth from the force and faſhion of any of theſe letters. And therefore the childe in learning will eftſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne agaynſt this barbariſme, and ſay: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, <hi>ye:</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, <hi>yt.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like difficulties are as rough ground in the way of the learner: which he cannot ouerſtride, vnleſſe the Maiſter do leade him as it were by the hand, ſupporting him agayne and agayne leaſt he fall: which muſt needes bee tedious to them both for a while. Now, the ſcholler in learning euery word ſhall pronounce him with his true accent: as he may not ſay <hi>maiéſtie</hi> but <hi>máieſtie.</hi> Alſo after that he hath ſpelled his leſſon, he ſhall reade the ſame, obſeruing therein the poynts and diſtinctions of the ſentence.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the like practiſe in making words, firſt by imitation: as the ſcholler hauing learned that <hi>band</hi> is ſpelled with <hi>b-a-n-d,</hi> ſo he ſhall imitate to ſpell <hi>bond</hi> with <hi>b-o-n-d:</hi> as <hi>bold</hi> with <hi>b-o-l-d,</hi> ſo <hi>told</hi> with <hi>t-o-l-d:</hi> as <hi>ſeem</hi> with <hi>ſ-e-e-m,</hi> ſo <hi>ſeen</hi> with <hi>ſ-e-e-n.</hi> Laſtly without imitation: as if ye aſke him how he will ſpell this word or that word. Thus if he bee exerciſed in ſpelling and reading his leſſons, and in ſpelling other words propounded vnto him, ſometime by his teacher, ſometime by his fellowes, when he ſhall haue ended his firſt booke the Catechiſme, he wil be able to paſſe through the Primer commendably without ſpelling; ſome harde
<pb facs="tcp:9756:24"/>
words here and there excepted.</p>
            <p>About the end of this Booke, for the better confirming of all theſe things in memorie by Orthographie, let him learne to write. For Orthographie, which teacheth with what let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters euery ſyllable and word muſt be written, and with what points the ſentence and parts thereof muſt be diſtinguiſhed, is a practiſe of the ſame knowledge, but expreſſed by the hand, as the former is by the toong. Which expreſſing and ſkill of the hand, belongeth properly to the Arte of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and not vnto Grammar, ſo that the beſt Grammarian is not alwayes the faireſt penman. Neuertheleſſe, ſéeing it hath ſingular vſe and commoditie in the exerciſe of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the Maiſter ſhall teach his Schollar to write by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of holding the Pen, of forming the letters in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, of ioyning them aptly togethers: by practiſe, of drawing the Pen vpon the figures of ſhadowed letters, then of writing without ſhadowed letters by imitating a Copie, laſtly, of writing without a Copie. In this exerciſe of writing, the Schollar ſhall ſpend but two or three houres in a day at the moſt, employing the reſt of the time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vntill he be about ſeauen yeares old. At which time, he ſhall procéede to the ſecond degree of Schooling, which conſiſteth in learning the Grammar, and knowledge of other languages, and in this degrée are certaine fourmes, euery one whereof may occupie a yéere.</p>
            <p>The firſt fourme therefore, ſhall begin to learne the Grammar in the Latin toong. As for reading, though the Schollar haue it alreadie, yet for that there is ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéene the reading of Engliſh and Latin, firſt let him reade ouer the rudiments of the Latin toong, and then learne by hart the parts of ſpeach with their properties, as the deri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſorts of Uerbes: whereof he ſhall rehearſe afterwards ſome part ordinarily euery day, illuſtrating the ſame with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of diuers Nounes and Uerbes. And ſo hauing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the concordances of ſpeach, made plaine vnto him by the examples there added, and being about eight yeeres old, let him moue foorth into the ſecond fourme, to practiſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Grammar, in expounding and vnfolding the works of Latin Authors: whereof the eaſieſt ſhall be choſen firſt, the middle ſort next, and the hardeſt laſt. Now, becauſe Children learne firſt to talke familiarly with their fellowes or others, Dialogs are moſt eaſie for their capacitie, as are the Dialogs of <hi>Corderius</hi> and <hi>Caſtalion.</hi> The Maiſter ſhall firſt reade ſenſibly a competent Lecture, then declare the argument and ſcope of the Author, afterward engliſh it either word for word, or phraſe for phraſe, as the propertie of both languages will permit. Laſt of all teach, or cauſe another to teach the diuers ſorts of the words, their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſyntaxes of ſpeach. And about three or foure houres after, the Schollar ſhall be diligently in euery point exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and tryed how he can referre the examples of his Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the rules of Art. This exerciſe of the artificiall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of other mens works, I neede not to ſet foorth by examples, for that it is common and manifeſt, as is alſo the laſt exerciſe of making ſomewhat without imitation: only imitation therefore remaineth to be declared by examples. For the which in this place the Maiſter ſhall propound a like ſentence in Engliſh, which the Schollar ſhall expreſſe by like phraſe in Latin. As if the Schollar haue learned and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this ſhort Lecture, <hi>Pater bonus diligit filium probum, <hi>A good father loueth an honeſt ſonne,</hi>
               </hi> the Maiſter may propound the like ſentence with diuerſitie, firſt of Nombers, then of Genders, thirdly of Perſons, fourthly of Tenſes, fifthly of the forme of the Uerbe, and laſtly of the words. For the variation of nombers, he may vſe this Engliſh, <hi>Good fathers loue honeſt ſonnes,</hi> which peraduenture may be hard for a beginner to make in Latin all at once: but

This kind of exerciſe will both leade him to vnderſtand the congruitie and ſyntaxes of ſpeach, and alſo make him expert in forming of Nounes and Uerbes. And ſo hauing ended his yeare, let him march forward into the third fourme, the which beſides the harder Dialogs, ſhall reade alſo Tullyes Epiſtles collected by Sturmius, learning them in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is ſhewed afore, and noting moreouer the principall phraſes in a note booke.

            <p>Now the Schollar by theſe meanes hauing gotten ſome footing in the Latin toong, ſhall begin to practiſe without an example of imitation, both in ſpeaking, and alſo in writing. His exerciſe of ſpeaking Latin ſhall be firſt in common and eaſie matters, as of his leſſon, of orders in the Schoole, of dinner and ſupper &amp;c. Afterwards in all matters, heed being taken that he be reformed when he vſeth barbarous words, or trippeth in his ſpeach, his exerciſe of writing without imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhall be a tranſlating of the ſame ſentence into another ſpeach, of latin into engliſh, and of engliſh into latin. For the turning of engliſh into latin, ſome would haue the Maiſter to tranſlate into engliſh the ſentence out of ſome place of <hi>Tully</hi> vnknowne to the Schollar, and then giue him the engliſh to tranſlate againe into latin, which being done, to ſhewe him <hi>Tullyes</hi> latin, wherewith he ſhall conferre his owne, and correct it: this counſell is good, and may be vſed when opportunitie and leiſure will ſerue.</p>
            <p>And this is the method and exerciſe of teaching and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fit for the third fourme, which muſt be continued alſo in the other fourmes following, but with ſome augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of length, and hardnes of the ſame, according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the learner. Yea, the ſame bookes of Dialogs and Epiſtles may ſerue for the fourth fourme alſo, ſo that the hardeſt of both ſorts be choſen.</p>

Yea the Kings and Princes following his counſell, what they haue done agaynſt the profeſſors of the trueth, I cannot think without great griefe.

            <p>By the way, the ſcholler muſt in imitation obſerue foure things. Firſt, that if the author whom he imitateth, haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſentences, ſometime he may reteyue the very ſame: as becauſe there enſueth much miſchiefe aſwell of other errors, as of hearkening vnto flatterers, therefore that ſentence <hi>Ex quo naſcuntur, &amp;.c.</hi> is common and may bee applyed to our cauſe. Secondly, that he may leaue out the imitation of ſome ſentences or arguments. As <hi>Tullie</hi> ſetteth forth the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by the authoritie of <hi>African,</hi> and the relation of <hi>Panae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi> whereas only the protaſis or firſt part of our ſimilitude is attributed but to <hi>Cato,</hi> for want of a like ſimilitude gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with like authoritie. Thirdly, he may adde more than his author hath: as here the example of <hi>Cleope</hi> is added to recompence that which wanteth in the ſimilitude. Fourthly, he may in ſome part alter the method, forme of ſyllogtimes, axiomes, arguments, figures, tropes, phraſes and words. All which muſt bee done wiſely and to good purpoſe, according to the circumſtances of the matter.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, touching matter and method, this imitation may bee exerciſed in verſe likewiſe: but the forme of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or ſyllogiſines; the words and phraſes, the verſe will not ſuffer to be imitated, ſaue only in ſome places. As we ſee <hi>Virgil</hi> to haue imitated <hi>Homer</hi> in method: to wit, in beginning with the middeſt of the matter, in reciting of things paſt by occaſion, and in concluding with a notable iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, euen as <hi>Homer</hi> had diſpoſed his <hi>Ilias:</hi> then in generall matter, namely, in ſetting forth <hi>Aeneas</hi> like to <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:9756:29"/>
ſometime like <hi>Achilles:</hi> in particular matter &amp; arguments, as the comming of <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Dido,</hi> like to the comming of <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> to <hi>Alcinous</hi> and <hi>Calypſo, Aeneas</hi> going to hell, like to <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> going to hell, <hi>Aeneas</hi> games of rowing, running, whorlebatting, ſhooting, and ſkirmiſhing on horſebacke at the graue of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> his father, like to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> games of riding, whorlebatting, running, ſword playing, hurling the ſtone, ſhooting and caſting the darte at the Tombe of <hi>Patroclus</hi> his deare friend: the harneſſe of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> made by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> like to the harneſſe of <hi>Achilles</hi> made by him alſo. And in diuers places, but not euery where, he doth imitate <hi>Homers</hi> deſcriptions, ſimilitudes, phraſes and words, as <hi>Manutius,</hi> and other learned men haue both noted and quoted.</p>
            <p>Now, when the Scholler hath been a while exerciſed in this kinde of imitation, ſometime in proſe, ſometime in verſe, let him aſſay otherwhiles, without an example of imitation, what he can do alone by his owne ſkill alreadie gotten by the precepts and the two former ſorts of practiſe.</p>
            <p>After a three yeeres exerciſe in this degree of ſtudie, he may a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tend to the fourth degree, of Arithmetike and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie. And according to the ſame manner, eaſely paſſe through theſe Artes in halfe a yeere, and ſo before the full age of ſixteene yeeres be made fit to wade without a ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, through deeper myſteries of learning, to ſet forth the glorie of God, and to benefite his Countrie. And thus the maiſters duetie of orderly teaching by precepts and by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of them, not only in vnfolding other mens workes, but alſo in making ſomewhat of a mans owne, and that either by imitation of examples, or without imitation wee haue breefly declared.</p>
            <p>His duetie of gouerning, is to preſcribe a good order both for manners and learning, and to cauſe the ſame to bee kept. Theſe good orders therefore ſpoken of in the fathers duetie, aſwell concerning godlineſſe, as of daylie praying, of reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church, of reuerent attentiuenes there, of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the doctrine of Chriſtian religion: as alſo concerning
<pb facs="tcp:9756:30"/>
Chriſtian honeſtie, that is, of obedience to parents and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, reuerence to ſuperiours, courteous manners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, ciuill behauiour in all words and deedes, the maiſter ſhall ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhall appoynt vnto them the time of comming to ſchoole and going thence: how and wherein they ſhall ſpend euery houre there, when they ſhall repeate precepts of Arte, when they ſhall meditate and learne their leſſon, and renter an account thereof to their maiſter, when they ſhall exerciſe themſelues in tranſlating, writing of theames, verſes, and ſuch like ſtudies.</p>
            <p>Theſe and all other good orders that may further vertue &amp; learning, the Maiſter ſhall plainly declare, &amp; ſtraitly enioine vnto his Schollers, cauſing them with all carefulnes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame, by encouraging the good, and reforming the bad: for conſidering that the hope of honour and the feare of puniſhment are <hi>elementa virtutis,</hi> wiſely did <hi>Solon</hi> place the<note place="margin">The principles of vertue.</note> preſeruation of the common wealth, and conſequently of the Schoole in <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
