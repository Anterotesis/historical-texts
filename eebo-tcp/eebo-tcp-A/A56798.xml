         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label>Ob. 1.</label> 
               <hi>The Plaintiff if he had any good Title, Would have ſought for Remedy long ſince, it being above 9 years ſince the Ideot</hi> John Pearle, <hi>his elder Brother, died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <label>Reſ.</label> 1. Sir <hi>John Bridges,</hi> under whom the Defendants Claim, had by his deſerting the King, and complying with the late uſurped Powers, made himſelf ſo powerfull an Intereſt in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and elſewhere, that the Plaintiff had enough to do to preſerve his perſon, having alwayes adhered to the Kings Intereſt, much leſs to conteſt then with ſo powerfull a man, yet hath alwayes made his Claim.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, the Plaintiff <hi>Richard Pearle</hi> hath alwayes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the finding out the Records of the Ideory, which he was ſtill in hopes to do, the Clerk of the Lunatick Office, and ſome of the Defendants, having often confeſſed the having them in their cuſtody; but he believes did and doth conceal them, in hopes of a Compoſition, which hath been often offered to the Plaintiff.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <label>Ob. 2.</label> 
               <hi>Sir</hi> John Bridges <hi>paid a valuable Conſideration for the Eſtate.</hi>
               <hi>Reſ.</hi> 1. He gave but 40 <hi>l. per annum</hi> to the Ideot during his life, who had the ſole Eſtate in him: And what he gave to others, was in his own wrong, and for the furthering his deſign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Eſtate is really worth 420 <hi>l. per annum;</hi> the Grandfather had no other Eſtate, yet was prick'd for Sheriff of the County.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <label>Ob. 3.</label> 
               <hi>The Defendants have gotten a Common Recovery, and though from an Ideot, (yet being one of the Common Aſſurances of the Nation) ought not to be avoided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Reſ.</label> Fines and Recoveries obtained by Deſign, Fraud, Force, Covin, and Deceit, are not reckoned the Common Aſſurances of the Nation, and therefore not favoured by the Common Law. Vide <hi>Fermors</hi> Caſe at large, Co. 3 Rep. ſo. 77. where it is adjudged by ſix Juſtices, Litt. cap. Remitter 151. <hi>quod alias bonum &amp; juſtumeſt, ſi per vim vel fraudem petatur malum &amp; injuſtum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a late Caſe in point between <hi>Leveſton</hi> and <hi>Powel</hi> in both Houſes, where a Fine was damned becauſe it was obtained by Force, Fraud, and Covin.</p>
            <p>This Caſe is accompanied with more Deceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the Caſe cited, or any of the Caſes cited in our Books: For,

                  <item>1. Sir <hi>John</hi> to get the Ideot into his cuſtody, Petitions his Majeſties Attorney in the year 44. for a Commiſſion <hi>de Ideota inquirendo;</hi> and doth not inform him, that the Ideot was and ought to be a Ward; ſo to carry on his deſign, he firſt begins to deceive his Majeſty.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Francis Rinardes, Tho. Tomkins</hi> Eſquires, <hi>&amp; al.</hi> Petition his Majeſties Attorney, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of his Ward, and thereupon obtain a Superſedeas to the ſaid Commiſſion, and a new Commiſſion <hi>de diem clauſit extremum,</hi> for finding the Kings Ward; both which the ſaid Sir <hi>John Bridges</hi> did ſuppreſs in the executing thereof, and by force did take them away, and executed his own Commiſſion, and did find the ſaid <hi>John</hi> an Ideot in due form of Law.</item>
                  <item>3. So by colour of having the cuſtody of the Ideot, did by force take poſſeſſion of his Eſtate, in right of the Ideot as he then pretended; and having gotten the poſſeſſion, he complies with the Parliament, and then falſifies the Truſt committed to him in the preſervation of the Ideot. Vide Stat. Praerogativae Regis. <hi>Ita quod nullatenus per eoſdem fatuos alienentur, nec quod corum haeredes exhaeredentur.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. For having by ſuch Force, Covin, Fraud, and Deceit, gotten the Ideot into his ſole poſſeſsion, procures him to ſuffer a Recovery; and that <hi>by Attorney,</hi> and makes his <hi>Menial Servants</hi> his <hi>Commiſſioners.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So that where Deſign, Force, Fraud, and Covin, are the ſupporters of an Aſſurance, be it Fine, Common Recovery, or otherwiſe, the Law will not call it one of the Common Aſſurances of the Nation. <hi>Vide</hi> the Preamble of the Statute of 4 <hi>Hen. 7.</hi> cap. 24.41.
