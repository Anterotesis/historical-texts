            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat many ſollid and urgent reaſons did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, who among the liberall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines which without controverſie are very profitable to mans life, doe give the firſt place to the noble Art of <hi>Geographie,</hi> they ſhall beſt know and diſcerne, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider both the excellencie, and pleaſure, as alſo the incredible profit of this Art. For, as concerning the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and excellencie thereof, it doth not intreate of meane matters of ſmall moment, as brute <hi>beaſts,</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> pretious <hi>ſtones, mettalls,</hi> and other workes of nature, the handling whereof no reaſonable man will contemne; but it preſenteth to our ſight the whole Globe of the Earth as it were in a Mirrour or Looking-glaſſe, and doth ſhew the beautie and ornaments of the whole Fabricke of the world, and containeth all things in her ample and ſpacious boſome, and like the vaſte Sea, it doth not onely open and lay forth the hidden and remote Iſlands, but alſo all other Countries. To omit the neere affinitie which this noble Science hath with Aſtronomie, which mounting above the earth doth contemplate the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if men as often as they heare ſome relation of this or that Country, of any ſtrange unknowne people, or of any rare and unuſuall Creature, or of the continuall burning of the Mountaine <hi>Aetna,</hi> alſo of divers Iſlands lying here and there in the great Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and alſo of Salvage Nations, ſome whereof goe naked without cloathes, others feede on mans fleſh, and the like matters; or doe reade the wonderfull hiſtories of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, (in which there are many things which doe rather ſeeme fabulous than
<pb facs="tcp:14932:5"/>
true) doe apprehend them with ſuch great admiration, and give ſuch earneſt attention thereunto, out of the deſire which they have to heare ſuch novelties; how much more may the curious Readers delight in this worke, which, as we ſaid before, doth containe and repreſent the whole Globe of the Earth, with all the Countries, Kingdomes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Woods, Mountaines, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, People, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and innumerable Townes thereof, with the Seas flowing about it: all which any one may here view on dry land, without endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his body or goods; and in this travell his friends ſhall not be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous or take care for him in his abſence, or earneſtly deſire his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Beſides, in this peregrination or travell he ſhall want no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that may drive away the tediouſneſſe of the journey; for while he fixeth his eyes on ſeverall Countries and places, he ſhall ſtraight way behold the ſpeciall gifts and peculiar excellencie of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and obſerve a wonderfull variety therein, which are very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the mind, for as the Proverbe ſaith, A good merry companion is as a Coach upon the way.</p>
            <p>But they ſhall chiefely diſcerne the great and manifold benefits of this Art of Geography, who in their eye-travell, and viewing of ſeverall Countryes, ſhall conſider the ſcituation and diſpoſition of Countries; the Cuſtomes, obſervations, lawes, and manners of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and ſhall afterwards traffique, and ſend commodities to ſeverall places, or reſolve to ſtudy the liberall Arts; ſeeing no Poet, nor Hiſtorian can be well read with profit, nor be conveniently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded or declared by any Interpreter or Commentator, without the helpe and knowledge of this moſt Noble Science. I omit here to mention how abſurd and unfit it is, that he who hath no skill nor knowledge in theſe matters, ſhould give his opinion and judgement in the publicke aſſembly or councell of the Common-wealth, when conſultation is held about the diſcovery of ſome unknowne Country, or in time of warre concerning the bounds and confines of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
            <p>But Princes and Noble men ought chiefely to beſtow great paines in ſtuddying this moſt excellent Art, in regard it may be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto them in undertaking journies and voyages when occaſion requireth, as alſo at home for fortifying the Frontiers of their owne Territories, or the directing and conducting of any warlike expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For that irrecoverable dangers have enſued when an army hath beene led through places unknowne both to the ſouldiers and
<pb facs="tcp:14932:6"/>
Captaine, both <hi>Livy</hi> and many other Hiſtoriographers have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtified by cleere and manifeſt examples.</p>
            <p>And moreover, as it is very neceſſary, profitable and pleaſant to know all Countries, Kingdomes, Dominions, and Provinces, with their ſcituation, diſpoſition, and qualities; ſo in like manner the ſeverall Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and memorable waters thereof, ought to be conſidered exactly in theſe times, when voyages are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made, unto knowne and unknowne Countries, ſo that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one will continually reſide at home, and abſtaine from making diſcoveries both by Sea and Land. So that <hi>Polidore Virgils</hi> complaint is now vaine, who in the fifteenth chapter of the third Booke concerning the Invention of Matters, doth condemne mankind of too much raſhneſſe, and madneſſe, in regard he cannot bridle his affections and deſires with reaſon: and though God hath given him the Earth, being a firme and immovable element, abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all things neceſſary and convenient for mans life, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not content therewith, hath made a Scrutiny and ſearch into the ſtarres, the heavens, and the vaſte Seas. To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> ſung formerly, in his firſt Booke, and third <hi>Ode:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>He had a heart of Oake or Braſſe,</l>
                  <l>Who did lanch forth a brittle ſhip, to paſſe</l>
                  <l>At firſt through the rough Seas,</l>
                  <l>And did not feare, when he ſet forth</l>
                  <l>The Affrick wind ſtriving with the North wind, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little after in the ſame place:
<q>
                  <l>No ſort of death he ſure did feare</l>
                  <l>That ſaw the Monſters ſwimming there,</l>
                  <l>And could behold them with drye eyes</l>
                  <l>With the ſwelling Sea and rockes which in it lyes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And afterward he addeth;
<q>
                  <l>In vaine did God divide the land</l>
                  <l>from the unſociable Seas,</l>
                  <l>If impious ſhips can ſayle unto</l>
                  <l>forbidden Ports when they doe pleaſe.</l>
                  <l>But mankind bold ſtill to adventure</l>
                  <l>doth on forbidden miſchiefe enter &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And hereunto <hi>Propertius</hi> in his third Booke doth allude, in that Elegie wherein he be wayleth <hi>Petus</hi> his Shipwracke, where he ſingeth thus:
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14932:6"/>
                  <l>Goe crooked ſhippes, of death the fatall cauſe,</l>
                  <l>Which on himſelfe man with his owne hand drawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>Vnto the earth, wee added have the Seas,</l>
                  <l>That the miſeries of misfortunes may increaſe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little after:
<q>
                  <l>Nature to enſnare the covetous man,</l>
                  <l>Doth let him ſayle upon the Ocean.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe reaſons are not able to diſcourage any one, but rather to quicken their induſtry, greedily to take any occaſion to know, view and diſcover divers Countries both neerehand and remote; partly by undertaking long voyages: and thoſe that cannot conveniently travell, may gather the knowledge of all Countries out of Bookes and exact deſcriptions. And truely that ſtuddy is irreproveable, ſo that it ought rather to be accounted laudible, profitable, pleaſant and neceſſary. For <hi>Strabo</hi> in the firſt Book of his Geography ſaith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that man ought to live on the Sea as well as on the land, and that God made him equally an Inhabitant and Lord thereof Therefore they deſerve great praiſe, who have laboured in this Art, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some doe not begin the Longitude from the Fortunate Iſlands (which are now called the Canaries) but from the Flandrian Iſlands, which are now called the <hi>Azores,</hi> becauſe the needle of the compaſſe doth point there directly toward the North. But the ſuperficies of the Globe contayneth in Longitude 360 degrees.</p>
            <p>The Latitude is the Arch or Segment of any place betweene the Aequinoctiall and Parralell which is drawne through the verticall point of the ſame place, and it is alwayes to the elevation of the Pole.</p>
            <p>Latitude is twofold, either Northerne, or Southerne, and there are reckoned from the Aequinoctiall to either Pole 90 degrees of Latitude.</p>
            <p>We have noted the degrees of Longitude and Latitude on the ſides of all the Tables, and for the moſt part, the degrees of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on the toppe and bottome, and of Longitude on the right and left hand, except when ſome Country is to be deſcribed that is more extended betweene the South and North.</p>
            <p>The ſeverall degrees both of Longitude and Latitude, according to the capacitie of the place, are ſometimes divided into 60, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. parts, which are called minutes, and we have noted the degrees with greater Arithmeticall figures, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes with leſſer for difference ſake.</p>
            <p>If one would finde out the Longitude and Latitude of any place, where the Meridian Parralells are, by taking with a paire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the diſtance thereof from the ſide of the Table, and afterward by applying the compaſſes to the other ſide. If thou takeſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Eaſt ſide, the compaſſes being turned from that ſide to the North ſide, will ſhew the degree and minute of Longitude. If thou haſt the diſtance from the North-ſide, turne thy compaſſes from thence to the Eaſt ſide, and it will ſhew the Latitude. But if the Meridians be not Parralells, the Latitude of a place is found in the ſame manner, but in the Vniverſall Tables where the Parralells are circular, the diſtance of a place being taken from the next ſide, will ſhew the ſame on the Eaſt ſide. But the Longitude is to bee taken with a thred or Ruler, layd upon the place and turned untill it doe point out on the Northerne and Southerne ſide, the ſame minute of the ſame degree, and whereſoever it be, that is the Longitude of the place.</p>

            <p>Take a paire of Compaſſes, and open them untill the <hi>2</hi> feete doe touch the extreame points of the places given, then appy them without any alteration to the ſcale of miles, and the numerall figures noted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will give the diſtance.</p>
            <p>But if the Diſtance of places doth exceede the length of the Scale, then with thy compaſses thou ſhalt take the length of the Scale, and thou ſhalt turne the Compaſſes from one place to another, as farre as the diſtance of places will permit, and then reckon the miles together. But becauſe the length of miles in all Countryes is unknowne, thou ſhalt more certainely take the diſtance of places with thy Compaſſes, and apply the Compaſſes without variation to the degrees of Latitude, which will give the true diſtance, by multiplying them by the Miles of the knowne Country.</p>
            <p>But the Miles doe differ much in divers Countries, and therefore I will here inſert their difference in the chief Countryes.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by the Neceſsitie of Nature, Order doth alwayes require, that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals ſhould bee ſet before Parriculars, and the Whole before the Part, for the better underſtanding of the preſent Matter: I alſo, being bound by this Law, ought to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this firſt Volume of our <hi>Geographie,</hi> an univerſall Type of the Globe of the Earth, and of the foure Parts thereof, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Africk, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> that ſo I may more happily follow my intended matter: and alſo, that in the ſeverall following Tomes hereafter, he that ſhall deſire to have the Delineation of his owne Country, may have a perfect Worke before him, being not deprived of this ſo profitable a ſpeculation. For the contemplation of Generals is pleaſant, and very neceſſary to him, who deſireth to have the leaſt knowledge of the World and naturall things. For if you pleaſe to conſider the manner of the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, what is the cauſe of Summer or Winter, whence is the inequality of the Dayes and Nights, or laſtly, what hath beene the originals, or propagations of things, what hath beene the actions, the atchievements, the mutations, and converſions happening in any place, even from the firſt Creation, you ſhall learne all this no where better, than out of theſe five adjoyning Tables, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all danger, and with honeſt recreation of minde. And even as it is not ſufficient for any one, though hee have a large dwelling-place, to know the ſeverall parts of his houſe, as the Porch, the Wine-cellar, and Butterie, the Kitchin, the Parlour, the Supping-roome, the Bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Cloſet, the Studie, &amp;c. whereby hee may uſe them conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; but alſo it is fit and neceſſary, that hee ſhould know, in what part and ſtreet of the Citie his houſe ſtandeth, and thence hee may ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diſcerne, if any fire or tumult happen in the Citie, how neare or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14932:13"/>
how farre he is from danger: So it is no leſſe neceſſary to know in what part of the world thou dwelleſt, what people are neare thee, and which are farther off, that when warre approacheth, thou mayſt know when to feare, and when to be quiet in minde. Laſtly, though <hi>Coſmographie</hi> be the light of all Eccleſiaſticall and Politicall Hiſtorie, and that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder may learne more from thence, than the Traveller by his long, tedious and chargeable labour, who often changeth his <note n="*" place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Apuleius</hi> painting forth an admirable picture of it calleth it, That which conſiſts in the ſocietie of heaven and earth, and of thoſe things which belong unto their natures. The ſame <hi>Apuleius</hi> more elaborately deſcribes the world thus, or to this purpoſe. The world (ſaith hee) is a garniſhed ordinance of things, the juſt charge and cuſtodie of the Gods, whoſe pole, (for ſo I call the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) beeing ſtrong and immoveable, paſſeth through the earth, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and nouriſher of all living creatures. All the higher parts, as may be ſeene, being encloſed and hidden with the moiſtneſſe of the aire in manner of a covering: Beyond is the houſe of the Gods, called Heaven, which wee ſee is full of divine bodies, as the faire and ſhining lights of the Sunne, Moone, and the other Starres, with which it is carried about by the diurnall and nocturnall motion in ſuch a perpetuall courſe, as ſhall never have an end. Now that the forme thereof is gathered round together like a Globe, the name thereof doth declare, and the conſent of men calling and painting it in manner of a Globe, beſides diverſe arguments that prove the ſame: As becauſe ſuch a figure is moſt capable, moſt ſimple, and doth bend in all parts towards it ſelfe, ſuſtaines it ſelfe, includes and containes it ſelfe, wanting no joyning together, nor having any end or beginning in any of its parts: as alſo becauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you behold it, it hath a circular forme in all its parts, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen in another figure. Therefore it was a ridiculous imagination of them who ſuppoſed that it had not a <note n="a" place="margin">

For ſome are imperfectly mixt, which we call Meteors, as Hayle, Raine, Snow, Thunder, Lightning, Winde; others perfectly mixt, but without life, as Stones, Mettalls, &amp;c. There are others which have a vegetable ſoule, as Plants; and thoſe which have a ſenſible ſoule, as Brute Creatures: Laſtly, there are ſome in the higheſt and laſt degree of compound things, which beſide all theſe have a reaſonable ſoule, as Men. We, leaving thoſe things which belong to Aſtronomers and Philoſophers, will chiefly conſider the Globe of the Earth. The whole Earth being diverſly divided by Seas, Rivers, and Marſhes, doth make altogether an abſolute Globe. <hi>Homer</hi> for no other cauſe calleth it Orbicular.

upon unfirme ground, they ſtrewed it over with coales trodden downe, and on it they laid fleeces of wooll. The length of the Temple was 425. feet, the breadth 220. The Pillars in it were an hundred and ſeaven and twenty, all made by ſeverall Kings, of which 36. were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> was the overſeer of the worke.

The beames were of <hi>Cedar,</hi> the roofes of <hi>Cedar</hi> guilded over, and the walls in like manner: The Sanctuary of the Holy place was diſtinguiſhed from the body of the Temple with a wall, in which were carved gates, with drawing Curtaines enterwoven with many flowers and winding borders: beſides two Cherubins of pure gold, the pavement under foot was beſet with ſtuddes of gold: the gates were twenty Cubits in height, and twelve in compaſſe. There was a brazen veſſell of ſo great a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it was fitly called the Sea; round about which ſtood twelve Calves, three together, and looking ſeverally toward the foure corners of the World. This veſſell did hold three thouſand meaſures contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 72. Sextaries. There were alſo other figures, which it would be too long to rehearſe.

Here are foure eſpeciall Pallaces of Noble men, who doe governe the Common-wealth, which are ſtately and with great coſt built with ſquare carved Marble ſtone. And all the ſtreets being ſtraight, in many places make the forme of a Croſſe, and through every one a pleaſant River runneth in a channell walled on each ſide with ſtone. The forme of the Citie is foure ſquare, lying ſweetly on the ſide of a hill: on the ſteepe aſcent of a Mountaine, a wonderfull faire Tower doth adorne the Citie, whoſe beauty or largeneſſe if you conſider, thoſe which have viewed many Countries, have ſeene few in all <hi>Europe</hi> like unto it. <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Temiſtitan</hi> is a rich and famous Citie in <hi>Nova Hiſpania,</hi> whereof wee will treate hereafter in the deſcription of <hi>Nova Hiſpania</hi>: now we proceed to other things. This part of the World is watered with many famous Rivers,<note place="margin">The Lakes &amp; Rivers.</note> the moſt whereof doe bring downe gold; and it is full of Lakes and Springs In the Lakes and Rivers there are great plenty of fiſh: among which there is one kinde of them of chiefe note, which by the inhabitants of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> are called <hi>Manati.</hi> This Fiſh is ſomewhat like a Trout; he is five and twenty foot long, and twelve foote thicke, in his head and tayle hee reſembles an Oxe; he hath ſmall eyes, a hard and hairy skinne, of a light blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and two feete like an Elephant. The femalls of this kinde of fiſh doe bring forth their young ones, as Cowes doe, and doe let them ſucke at their two dugges.<note place="margin">The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> Here are alſo very many Mountaines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, as <hi>Benſo</hi> witneſſeth, is a fire-vomiting Mountaine, which out of its hollow mouth doth ſend forth ſuch great flakes of fire, that the blazing of it in the night doth caſt forth a light which may bee ſeene above an hundred miles. Some have ſuppoſed that the gold mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within, doth afford continuall matter to the fire. For a certaine <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> when he would make tryall thereof, cauſed a veſſell of gold to bee made with an iron chaine: and afterward going to the Mountaine with foure other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he let downe the veſſell with the chaine into the hole of the hill; and there by the heate of the fire the veſſell with part of the chaine was melted: and having tryed it againe with a bigger chaine, it hapned to melt againe in the ſame manner. Here the Cities generally are ſtately built, the wayes paved, and the houſes very faire and beautifull. It is reported that here was a Kings garden, wherein herbes and trees, with their bodie, boughs, and fruits did ſtand of ſolid gold, and as bigge as thoſe which grow in Orchards. And it is reported that here was a Kings Conclave, in which there were all kindes of living Creatures, made of precious ſtones, partly painted, and partly inlaid, and engraven. That which is reported concerning the two wayes in this Country is worthy of memory, the one whereof lyeth through the rough Mountaines, the other ſtretcheth through the plaine fields, from <hi>Quito</hi> a Citie of <hi>Peru,</hi> to the Citie <hi>Cuſco,</hi> for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14932:25"/>
ſpace of five hundred miles. The beauty of this worke is encreaſed, by many wonderfull heapes of ſtones, which were not brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſtrength of Horſes, or Oxen, (both which the inhabitants wanted) but by the hands of men. The field way is defended on both ſides with walls, and it is five and twenty foote broade, within which little ſtreames doe runne, having their bankes planted with ſhrubby trees, which they call <hi>Molli.</hi> The other being hewed out of ſtones and rockes, paſſeth through the middle of the Mountaines, having the ſame bredth: Moreover the way in the uneven and lower part of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, is fortified with fences, as the nature of the Country requires. Theſe wayes King <hi>Gninacava</hi> (who lived not long ſince) cauſed to to be clenſed, and the ruinous walls to be repaired and adorned, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the worke is more ancient, and there were placed all along by the way ſide Innes both faire, and pleaſant, (they call them <hi>Tambi</hi>) in which all the Kings traine were received.

Nova Zembla</hi> is an Iſland ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated under the 76 Degree. Here the aire is very ſharpe, and the cold moſt vehement and intolerable. It is a wild, woodie, and rugged Country, where neither leaves nor graſſe grow, nor any living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but thoſe which live by fleſh as Foxes, and Beares, whereof there is great ſtore not onely in this Iſland, but in moſt of the Northerne Countries. There are Sea-monſters here whoſe bodies does exceede the bigneſſe of an Oxe, and are commonly called <hi>Walruſchen</hi>: they are headed like a Lyon, their skin hairy, they having foure feete, and two teeth ſticking forth of the upper part of their mouth beeing ſmooth, hard, and white, and are worth as much as Elephants teeth. The <hi>Bayes</hi> here are called <hi>Weggates Bay, Forbiſhers Bay,</hi> and <hi>Daviſes Bay; Weigates Bay</hi> is ſtreitched out towards the Eaſt even to the place called <hi>Crucis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi> toward the <hi>Aerctapelietes</hi> to the place called <hi>Diſsidit Angulus,</hi> a a little enclining to the Eaſt.

The men thereof being ſtrangers to all civilitie,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14932:27"/>
do eate and feed upon the raw fleſh of beaſts and fiſhes. They are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the skins of wild beaſts taken in hunting, and they eate raw hearbes like beaſts. Their Tents are covered with Whales skinnes; the cold being continually very ſharpe in theſe parts. They uſe Dogges which are like unto our Wolves, and having yoked them together, they do make them draw things over the ice. Their weapons are Bowes and Arrowes, and ſlings. There is no wood there, but much Deere. The men do not plough the ground, as beeing content with that it bringeth forth of its own accord: they live by hunting: their drinke is the warme blood of wild beaſts, or elſe ice water: there are no Rivers nor Springs, becauſe the violence of the cold doth ſo ſhut up the Earth, that ſprings of water cannot breake forth. The men are very laborious, ſtrong, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and cunning fowlers: they uſe a certaine kinde of boate made of leather, wherein one man can but ſit, who maketh uſe but of one Oare, his right hand holding his bow wherewith hee ſhoots at the birds. The like hath beene ſeene in <hi>England. Daviſes Bay</hi> alſo was ſo called from <hi>Iohn Davis</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who in the yeare 1585. and the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeares did ſearch along the Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> or rather the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Coaſts of <hi>Greenland</hi> from the 53. Degree to the 75. to finde out a paſſage that way unto <hi>China.</hi> Concerning the foure <hi>Euripideas</hi> in the table thoſe things which you ſee are taken out of the Regiſter booke of <hi>Iames Cnoxen Buſcoducenſis,</hi> who doth report that a certaine <hi>Engliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norite Frier</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> being a Mathematician, did deſcribe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries lying neare unto the <hi>Pole,</hi> and meaſured them with his <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> in this following ſhape, as <hi>Mercator</hi> hath gathered them out of <hi>Iames Cno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeus</hi> Booke. Hee ſaith that theſe foure Seas are carried with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Innermoſt <hi>Gulfe,</hi> that ſhips being once entred can never be driven backe againe with any winde, and that there is never ſo great a winde, as that it can drive about a wind-mill. But theſe things are as true as <hi>Lucians</hi> fables, ſeeing they who have viewed theſe places in which thoſe ſeas are ſaid to be, do finde no ſuch <hi>Euripi,</hi> or ſwift flowing Seas at all, namely the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who have diſcovered the Sea even to the 81. Degree of Latitude. But concerning the habitation of the Northerne people, let us heare <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> in his 37. Exercitation, where he thus ſpeaking concerning a voiage from the Northerne Sea towards <hi>China. There are</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>divers arguments brought by divers men on both ſides, and it is diverſly judged of, whether it be poſsible to ſaile by that Sea. But theſe are ours. They would have us to ſaile from the mouth of the River</hi> Duvina, <hi>all along that Countrie which encompaſſes all</hi> Scythia <hi>even to the Eaſt corner: in which winding courſe wee are to change the Northerne wind for the Weſterne. But thoſe which ſpeake thus, it is certaine they do not know the nature of this Sea, nor of the Windes and Coaſt: For the Weſt and Eaſt windes are ſo rare in this Sea that they are almoſt ſcarce knowne. But ſo many North windes are there here that it ſeemes Nature hath committed the government of theſe parts unto them alone. There are many foards blinde and muddle. In winter, which continueth ten moneths, the ſuperficies or upper part of the Sea, is as hard as any pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In Summer there are continuall miſts, which in the afternoone as faſt as one is expelled another riſes. Beſides, the Ice is very dangerous, the great pieces whereof floting up and downe, are like moving Iſlands running one amongſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> It is certaine that by the late Navigations of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14932:28"/>
yeare 1594. and in the two following yeares, it was hoped, that wee might ſaile out of the Northerne Sea to the Eaſtern parts of the World. But very difficultly, in regard of the Ice, and long winter nights. <hi>William Barentſon</hi> did denie that it was poſſible to ſaile by the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Naſſovia</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> not onely for the Ice, but alſo becauſe hee found by divers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that it was not a Sea but a <hi>Bay,</hi> and eſpecially becauſe hee found there was no Tide nor Ebbe: and yet hee was in great hope that a way might be found out by the moſt Northerne part of <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi> But ſeeing there are every day new voyages made to diſcover the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that way to <hi>China,</hi> experience will teach them at laſt whether it can be done or not. It is manifeſt that our ſhips have ſailed even to the 81. Degree of Northerne Latitude, and yet found the Sea open: but yet afterward at the 76. Degree they have beene hindred with great pieces of ice, and the night comming on, ſo that they could proceed no further. The Sunne left them the 4. of <hi>November</hi> in the yeare 1596, and was ſeene again the 24. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the following yeare, all which time theſe valiant <hi>Argonantes,</hi> for ſo I may call them, hid themſelves in a little ſhed which they built up in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> untill the 14. of <hi>Iune.</hi> For though the voyage of the <note n="r" place="margin">

               <hi>Camden</hi> affirmes, that hee knowes not what to conjecture, unleſſe, ſaith hee, it bee derived from <hi>Hiere</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> word, which with them ſignifies the Weſt, whence <hi>Erin</hi> ſeemes to bee drawne, being as much to ſay as the Weſterne Countrie. This Iſland is ſtretched forth from the South Northward in an ovall forme, not twenty dayes ſayle, as <hi>Philemon</hi> in <hi>Ptolemie</hi> delivers, but onely 400.<note place="margin">The Situation.</note> miles; and is ſcarce 200. miles broad.

Hence <hi>Mela</hi> writeth, that it hath no good Ayre for ripening of ſeedes: yet in the wholſomneſſe and cleerneſſe of the Ayre it doth farre exceede <hi>Brittaine.</hi> Here are never any Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and you ſhall ſcarce heare thunder once in a yeare. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is a fat ſoyle, and hath great plentie of fruits, yet it hath greater plenty of paſturage than fruits, and of graſſe than graine. For here their wheate is very ſmall, ſo that it can hardly bee winnowed or cleanſed with a fanne. What the Spring produceth, the Summer cheriſheth, but it can hardly bee gathered, in regard they have too much raine in Harveſt time; for this Iſland hath windes and raine very often. But (as <hi>Mela</hi> ſaith) it is ſo full of pleaſant ſweete graſſe, that when the Cattell have fed ſome part of the day, if they bee not reſtrained and kept from grazing, they will endanger the burſting of themſelves. Which alſo <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> witneſſeth concerning this Iſland. Hence it proceedes, that there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14932:34"/>
are infinite numbers of Cattell, which are the Inhabitants chiefe riches, and many flocks of Sheepe, which they ſheare twice a yeare. They have excellent Horſes (called <hi>Hobbies</hi>) which are not pac'd like others, but doe amble very gently. No creeping thing nor Serpent liveth here, nor alſo in <hi>Crete</hi>: and Serpents being often brought hither out of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as ſoone as they came neere the Land, and ſmell'd the Ayre, they died. <hi>Beda</hi> witneſſeth, that he hath ſeene ſome, who have beene ſtung with Serpents, that have drunk the leaves of Bookes (brought out of <hi>Ireland</hi>) in a Potion, and ſtraight-way the force of the poyſon was allayde, and the ſwelling of the body went downe againe. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath greater ſtore of Faulcons and Hawkes, than other Countries. And here Eagles are as common as Kites in ſome places. Beſides, here is ſo great a number of Cranes, that you ſhall often ſee a hundred in a company together. In the North part alſo there are abundance of Swannes, but there are few Storkes through the whole Iſland, and thoſe black. There are few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triges and Pheaſants, but no Pies, nor Nightingales. Here is ſuch great ſtore of Bees, that they doe not onely breede in hives, but alſo in hollow trees, and in the cavernes of the earth. <hi>Giraldus</hi> alſo writeth a ſtrange thing concerning a kinde of Birde, commonly called a <hi>Barnacle,</hi> that out of certain pieces of wood, floating up and down in the Sea, there comes out firſt a kinde of Gumme, which afterward growes into a hard ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, within which little Creatures are generated, which firſt have life, and afterward have bils, feathers and wings, with which they doe flye in the Ayre, or ſwim in the water, and in this manner and no other this Creature is generated. This <hi>Giraldus</hi> doth teſtifie, that hee hath ſeene ſome of them halfe formed, which as ſoone as they came to perfection did flie as well as the reſt. There are alſo many birds of a twofold ſhape, (as he witneſſeth) which they call <hi>Aurifriſij,</hi> leſſer than an Eagle, and bigger than a Hawke; whom Nature, to delight her ſelfe, hath framed with one foote armed with tallents ſharpe and open, the other ſmoothe with a plaine webbe. There are other Birdes which they call <hi>Marinetae,</hi> leſſe than a Blackbird, being ſhort like a Starling, yet differing from him by the whiteneſſe of the belly, and the blackneſſe of the back. It is a wonderfull thing which was reported concerning theſe Birdes, for if when they are dead they be kept in a dry place, they will not putrifie or corrupt: and being placed among garments and other things, it will preſerve them from moathes. That which is more worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that, if being dead, they be hanged up in ſome drie place, they will every yeare renew and change their feathers, as if they were alive. <hi>Ireland</hi> contayneth all kindes of wilde beaſts. It hath Harts that are ſo fat, that they can hardly runne, and by how much they are leſſer in body, by ſo much the larger are their hornes. There are great ſtore of Bores, many Hares, &amp;c. but the bodies of all the wilde beaſts and birds are leſſer here than in other places. It hath many Badgers, and Weeſils. It hath few or no Goates, fallow Deere, Hedghogs, Moles; but infinite ſtore of Mice. It hath alſo Wolves and Foxes. But enough of theſe things, I returne to other matters.

The Mountaines abound with Cattell, &amp; the woods with wilde beaſts. <hi>Solinus</hi> writeth thus concerning the Sea, which floweth between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi>: 
<q>The Sea betweene <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet all the yeare, and is ſcarce navigable but in ſome part of the Summer.</q>
But hee erres, for it is quiet enough, unleſſe it bee ſtirred up with windes. And not onely in Summer, but alſo in Winter paſſengers doe ſayle to and fro. All the Sea ſhores doe abound ſufficiently with Fiſh. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath in all three and thirty Counties, and foure Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. The Biſhop of <hi>Armach,</hi> Primate of all <hi>Ireland</hi>: the Biſhop of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>: the Biſhops of <hi>Caſsil</hi> and <hi>Toam:</hi> and theſe foure have nine and twenty <hi>Suffragans</hi> or Vicegorents. <hi>Ireland</hi> (from the manners of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants) is divided into two parts. For thoſe who refuſe to obey the Lawes, and live more uncivilly, are called <hi>Iriſhrie,</hi> and commonly <hi>Wild Iriſh.</hi> But thoſe who are willing to obey the Lawes, and appeare before the Judges, are called the <hi>Engliſh-Iriſh,</hi> and their Country the <hi>Engliſh Pale.</hi> they ſpeake <hi>Engliſh</hi> naturally and uncorruptly, yet they underſtand

There thoſe that are accuſed, if they be convicted, have certaine Arbitratours to judge of the cauſe, whom they call <hi>Brehoni:</hi> theſe are all of one familie, and although they have no knowledge in the Law, yet for their wiſdome &amp; honeſtie of life they are accounted divine. Their warre is partly on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and partly on foote. The Gentrie have horſes well managed, ſo that without any advantage they will mount them in their armour, and taking a Javelin or dart of great weight by the middle, they will throw or brandiſh it againſt their enemie with much eaſe. Among the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome are Souldiers in Caſſocks very ſtrong, whom they call <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glacii,</hi> having Cuttle-axes as ſharpe as razors, and they are the chiefe ſtrength of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> warres. The next are Footmen wearing a light ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with ſwords in their hands, and theſe are called <hi>Karnes,</hi> and they thinke a man is not dead, untill they have cut off his head. In the third place are footmen, whom they call <hi>Daltines,</hi> who going unarmed, attend upon the horſmen. The footmen as well as horſmen, as oft as they come to fight with their enemies, doe crie with a great voyce <note n="q" place="margin">The reaſon of this, See in <hi>Camden, p.</hi> 678.</note>

This Citie was built by Pyrats of <hi>Norway,</hi> which although it have a thick aire, a ſoile not very pleaſant, and very narrow ſtreets, yet ſuch is the conveniencie of the Haven, that it is the ſecond Ctity in <hi>Ireland</hi> for wealth &amp; populouſnes, &amp; is filled with many wiſe &amp; well behaved Citizens. It hath a ſafe &amp; quiet Haven, &amp; which is often full of outlandiſh &amp; forraine ſhips.

The Citizens are curteous, bountifull, thriftie, hoſpitable to ſtrangers, and ſerviceable both in private and publique affaires.

though this Citie bee diſtant from the Sea ſixtie miles, yet the ſhip-maſters doe bring ſhippes of great burthen even to the walls of the Citie, neither neede they feare any rockes all the way they come up.

the Kings and the Kings Sonnes lawfully begotten have the firſt place, of which if there bee many, the eldeſt Sonne is called Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the reſt are onely called Princes; but when the King is publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowned, hee promiſeth to all the people, that he will keepe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Lawes, Rites, and Cuſtomes of his Anceſtours, and uſe them in the ſame manner as they did. The Dukes have the ſecond place, the Earles the third, and thoſe Nobles the fourth place, who are not known by that Title in forraine Countries, but the <hi>Scots</hi> doe call them <hi>My Lords.</hi> This name is ſo much eſteem'd amongſt them, that for honours ſake they attribute it to their Biſhops, Earles, and chiefeſt Magiſtrates. In the fifth place are the Knights and Barons, who are uſually called Lords. They are in the ſixth and laſt place, who having attained to no title of honour, but yet deſcended from a noble Familie, are therefore commonly called Gentlemen; as the Brothers, and Sonnes of Earles and Lords, the youngeſt Sonnes of Knights, who have no part in the Inheritance, becauſe (by the Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi>) that commeth unto the eldeſt Sonne, for the preſervation of the Familie, but the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call all thoſe Gentlemen, who are either rich or well ſpoken of for their hoſpitality. The whole weight of warre doth depend on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the loweſt degree. The Plebeians or Citizens are partly chiefe men, who beare office in their Cities, partly Merchants, and partly Tradeſmen, or Handy-craftes-men, all which becauſe they are free from Tribute and other burdens, doe eaſily grow rich. And leaſt any thing ſhould be too heavily enacted againſt any Citie, the King permits that in publick aſſemblies or Parliaments three or foure Citizens, being called out of every Citie, ſhould freely interpoſe their opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters propounded. Heretofore the Clergie was governed by the authoritie of Decrees &amp; Councels, but now (as the reſt) they are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lawes, which the Kings have deviſed, or confirmed by their royall aſſent. The Booke which containeth the <hi>municipall</hi> Lawes, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Latine, is entituled <hi>Regia Majeſtas,</hi> the Kings Majeſtie, becauſe the Booke begins with thoſe words: In the other Bookes of the Lawes, the Acts of their Councels (which are called Parliaments) are written in <hi>Scotch.</hi> There are many and divers Magiſtrates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as in other Nations. Among theſe, the chiefe and next to the King is the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Kingdome (whom they call the Governour.) Hee hath the charge of governing the Kingdome, if the Common-wealth at any time be deprived of her King; or the King by reaſon of his tender age cannot manage the affaires of the Kingdome. There is alſo a continuall Senate at <hi>Edenburrough,</hi> ſo framed of the Clergie and Nobilitie, that the Clergie doth in number equall the Laiety. The Clergie have a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over them, who hath the firſt place in delivering his opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Chancellour of the Kingdome bee preſent, for hee hath the chiefe place in all affaires of the Kingdome. Hee that ſits on matters of life and death, they call The great Juſtice; hee that lookes to Sea-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Admirall: he that lookes to the Campe, the Marſhall: and he that puniſhes offences, committed in the Court, is called the Conſtable. There are alſo in ſeverall Provinces, which they call Viecounties, thoſe which are Governours of them, whom by an ancient name they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14932:48"/>
call Vicounts. Their authority in deciding thoſe matters which belong to civill cauſes, doth depend on a certaine hereditary right, by which they claime alſo unto themſelves thoſe Vicountſhips. So that theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts may be ſaid not to be created by the King, but borne unto it by right from their Parents. The Cities alſo and Townes have their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, their Bailiffes, and other Magiſtrates of that kinde, who keepe the Citizens in obedience, and doe maintaine and defend the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Cities, whereby it comes to paſſe that the Common-wealth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the apt diſpoſition and ranking of Degrees, by the holy Majeſtie of Lawes and the authority of Magiſtrates, doth flouriſh, and deſerveth great praiſe.

For the generall, this Country hath greater plenty of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, then of fruit or cattle, for it is altogether of a light ſandie ſoyle: which doth ſharpen the induſtrie of the Inhabitants, and their ſparing life doth confirme the ſtrength of their mindes and bodies. In this Country about ten miles from the Towne <hi>Ayr,</hi> there is a ſtone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twelve foot high, and thirty Cubits thicke, which is called the deafe ſtone, for if you hollow or ſhoot off a Musket on the one ſide, hee that ſtandeth on the other ſide next to the ſtone cannot heare it, he that ſtands farther off ſhall heare it better, and he that ſtands fartheſt off ſhall heare it beſt.

Next on the Eaſt ſide is ſituated <hi>Renfroan,</hi> ſo called from a Towne, in which the Inhabitants kept their publike meetings, it is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Baronia.</hi> Two Rivers doe cut through the middle of it, which are both called <hi>Carth.</hi> After this Country is <hi>Clideſdale</hi> aforenamed, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth to either banke of <hi>Glotta,</hi> and poureth forth many Noble Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: on the left hand <hi>Aven,</hi> and <hi>Duglaſſe,</hi> which doe runne into <hi>Glotta:</hi> on the right hand another <hi>Aven,</hi> which ſeperates <hi>Sterling</hi> on the South from <hi>Lothiana,</hi> and on the Eaſt from the <hi>Fyrth,</hi> untill at laſt growing leſſer, it hath a Bridge over it neare <hi>Sterling.</hi> There is one Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that cutteth through this Country, which is worthy of memory, called <hi>Carron,</hi> neare to which are ſome ancient Monuments. On the left ſide of <hi>Carron</hi> there are two little hills built by the induſtrie of men, which are commonly called <hi>Duni pacis.</hi> On the right ſide of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> there is a plaine field that at laſt riſeth into a little hill, being in the middle betweene <hi>Duni pacis,</hi> and a little Chappell. On the ſide of this hill there appeareth yet the ruines or remainder of a ſmall Citie. But the foundation of the Walls, and the deſcription of the ſtreetes, partly by tillage, and partly by digging forth ſquared ſtones for the building of rich mens houſes, cannot be diſtinctly knowne. This place <hi>Beda</hi> doth call <hi>Guidi,</hi> and doth place it in a corner of the trench made by <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour. Many famous <hi>Roman</hi> Writers have made mention of this Trench and Bulwarke.

There is in <hi>Knapdale</hi> the Lake <hi>Avus,</hi> in which there is a ſmall Iſland with a fortified Caſtle.

All <hi>England</hi> is divided into nine and thirty <note n="r" place="margin">Shires were firſt made by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> for the better adminiſtration of Juſtice.</note> Shires; and theſe Shires are divided into Hundreds and Tithings: In each of theſe Counties is one man placed, called the Kings <hi>Praefect</hi> or Lievtenant, whoſe office is to take care for the ſecurity of the Common-wealth in times of danger: and every yeare there is one choſen, whom they call the Sheriffe, that is, the Provoſt of the Shire, who may bee rightly called the <hi>Queſtor</hi> of the Countie or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For it is his office to collect publick money, to diſtraine for tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes, and to bring the money into the Exchequer, to aſſiſt the Judges, &amp; to execute their commands: to empannell the Jurie, who are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning matters of fact, &amp; bring in their verdict to the Judges (for the Judges in <hi>England</hi> are Judges of the Right, not of the Fact) to bring the condemned to execution, &amp; to decide of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. But in great matters thoſe Judges do adminiſter right, whom they call <hi>Itinerarie</hi> Judges, &amp; Judges of Aſſiſe, who twice every year do viſite moſt of theſe Shires, to determine and end matters of difference, and alſo to give judgement upon Priſoners. For aſmuch as concernes Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction, <hi>England</hi> hath now two Provinces, and alſo two Archbiſhops: the Archb. of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Primate of all <hi>England,</hi> and the Archb. of <hi>Yorke:</hi> Under theſe are ſeven and twenty Biſhops, two &amp; twenty under <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other five under <hi>Yorke.</hi> The Tribunals or Courts of Juſtice in <hi>England</hi> are of three ſorts, for ſome are Spirituall ſome Temporall, and one mixt, which they call the Parliament, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the three Orders of <hi>England,</hi> and it repreſenteth the body of the whole Kingdome. This Parliament the King cals and appoints accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleaſure: Hee hath the chiefe authority in making, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, abrogating, and interpreting of Lawes, and in all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the good of the Common-wealth. The temporall Courts are two-fold, namely of Law, and of equity. The Courts of Law are the Kings Bench, the Starre-Chamber, the Common Pleas, the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, the Court of Wards and Liveries, the Court of the Admiraltie, and Aſſiſes; wee omit others which are obſcure. The Kings Bench is ſo called, becauſe the King is wont to ſit in it, and it handleth Pleas of the Crowne. The Starre-Chamber, or rather the Court of the Kings Counſell is that, in which criminall matters are handled, as perjuries, impoſtures, deceits, and the like. The Common Pleas is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe common pleas are tried there betweene the Subjects, by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which they call the Common Law. The Exchequer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth its name from a foure ſquare Table, covered with a Chequer-Cloth, at which the Barons ſit; in it all cauſes are heard, which belong to the Exchequer. The Court of Wards hath his name from Wards, whoſe cauſes it handleth. The Admirals Court handleth Sea-matters. Thoſe which wee call the Aſſiſes, are held twice in a yeare in moſt Shires; in which two Judges of Aſſiſe appointed for it, with the Juſtices of peace doe enquire and determine of civill and criminall matters. The Courts of Equity are the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> the Court of Requeſts, and the Councell in the Marſhes of Wales. The Chancerie draweth its name from the Chancellour, who ſitteth there. This Court gives judgement according to equitie, and the extreame rigour of the Law is thereby
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14932:55"/>
tempered. The Court of Requeſts heareth the cauſes of the poore, and of the Kings Servants. The chiefe ſpirituall Courts are the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergie, the Courts which belong to the Archbiſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the Chancellours Courts, kept in every Dioceſſe. There are two famous Univerſities in this Kingdome <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth produce happy and good wits, and hath many learned men, skilfull in all Faculties and Sciences. The people are of a large ſtature, faire complexion'd, and for the moſt part, gray-eyed, and as their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſoundeth like the <hi>Italians,</hi> ſo they differ not from them in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and diſpoſition of their body. Their foode conſiſteth, for the moſt part, of Fleſh. They make Drinke of Barley, being a very ſavorie and pleaſant drinke. It is tranſported often into forraine countries.

All <hi>Denmarke</hi> is a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> as the Deſcription ſheweth, and is divided into 184 Prefectſhips or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which they call <hi>Horret,</hi> and they are governed by ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects skilfull in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Lawes. It hath a King rather by election of the Nobles, than by ſucceſſion of birth: the ancient manner of chuſing him was, that when they gave their voyce, they ſtood in the open field upon ſtones, devoting by the firme ſtabilitie of the ſtones under them, the conſtancy of their election. The Kings are crowned at <hi>Hafnia</hi> in the Church of the bleſſed Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> before the Altar, and are led into the aforeſaid Church by the Senatours of the Kingdome, the enſignes of regality being carried before them, as the Sword, Globe, and Crown. Neither are theſe things attributed to ſpeciall Families, as it is in moſt Countries, but as every one excelleth in vertue and dignitie, ſo is hee choſen to that place. Firſt the King is compelled to ſweare that he will obſerve certaine written Articles, and that hee will ſtrictly defend the Chriſtian Religion, and the Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Kingdome. Afterward hee is anoynted by the Biſhop of <hi>Roeſchild,</hi> and firſt the Crowne is ſet upon his head by all the Senatours, who then take their oath to his Majeſtie, if they have not done it before the Coronation, and then the King maketh out of the Gentry ſome Knights by the light ſtroke of a ſword, for ſome ſervice done either in peace or warre. Thus the ancient <hi>Danes</hi> did eſtabliſh an excellent Politicall State and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, neither hath any Nation ever brought them into ſubjection, or tooke away their Country Rites and Priviledges.

By which it appeares, as alſo by the following warres, which divers Kings of the Familie of the <hi>Oldenburgs</hi> happily waged, that it is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nation, and fortunate in vanquiſhing their enemies both by Land and Sea. The Noble men and Senatours of the Kingdome have a free power to elect the Kings, but for the moſt part they chuſe the Kings el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne, unleſſe there be ſome ſufficient cauſe for the contrary. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they alwayes chuſe one of the Royall bloud, and they doe not ſuffer the Kingdome to be divided, unleſſe they be compelled thereunto by civill warres. They ſend the younger ſonnes or brothers into other Countries, ſeeing they cannot participate in the government of the Kingdome: and hence it is that ſo many expeditions are undertaken by them. Moreover, ſeeing all the Nobles and Common-people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live conveniently in their owne Countrie, therefore they ſeeke out to get themſelves a more fit ſeate. For the Northerne people have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of children, in regard of their abundance of bloud and heate; they are quarrellers and fighters, they drinke and eate much, (for the cold Ayre excites their appetite) and yet digeſt it well, whence it is that they live long; they are faire complexioned, of great ſtature, crafty and faithfull. And an argument, that they are long liv'd, is that their Kings have raigned very long, many of them thirty yeares, ſome forty, and ſome longer.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14932:76"/>
becauſe they anciently uſed them. There are ſome Families yet living, whoſe Anceſtors were preſent at the Parley between <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, &amp; <hi>Hemmingus</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> upon the River <hi>Egidora</hi> or <hi>Eider,</hi> as the Familie of <hi>Vren</hi> and others. Theſe hold their goods and lands in <hi>Capite,</hi> and they have free liberty to hawke and hunt in their owne lands, as the Counts have in <hi>Germany.</hi> Their goods are not feudatory, but hereditary. All the Caſtles, lands, and goods, as well moveable as immoveable, left them by their parents, are equally divided among the brethren: and the ſiſters by a ſpeciall priviledge have a ſhare alſo, yet ſo, that the brother hath two parts with the Caſtles and places of ſtrength, and the ſiſter but one. By this meanes the eldeſt ſonnes have not much lands, yet ſome of them comming of a good Familie, and being endued with ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue, through the Kings favour, doe advance themſelves to great poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by marriage. Out of this order the Senatours of the Kingdome are choſen, who are ſeldome more then 28. Theſe Senatours have a certain allowance from the King and Kingdome, for they have Caſtles ſo long as they bee Senatours, for which they pay no rent to the King, but are charged to keepe certaine horſes both in peace and warre, and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King calls them, they are to be ready at the proper charge of the Kingdome. If they be ſent on any Embaſſage out of the Kingdome, they have allowance out of the Exchequer, that they may performe their journey in a Princely manner, as becommeth a Kings Embaſſadours. The other Nobles alſo have ſufficient maintenance from the King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live at Court or not. For the King hath lands which in the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> ſpeech are called <hi>Verleghninge</hi> or Benefices, and out of theſe hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth maintenance, either for terme of life, or for yeares, to thoſe who have done him or the Kingdome any ſervice. And thoſe who hold theſe Benefices of the King, are charged to keepe certaine horſes, and to pay yearely a certaine ſumme of money into the Exchequer, yet ſo as they may gaine ſomething in reward of their labour and ſervice. There is alſo a good Law &amp; Inſtitution in the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> whereby the King is prohibited and reſtrained from buying any immoveable goods of the Nobles, leaſt any diſſention ſhould ariſe betweene the King and them. For otherwiſe the King might by violence take into his hands thoſe lands which the Nobles would not ſell: yet the King may change any immoveable goods with the Nobles, though on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Nobles cannot buy any of them of the Kings Farmers, many of which have hereditarie, and (as it were) free lands.</p>

                  </gap>matters, for the ſecuring of the coaſts. He hath under him an other Admirall appointed, and in every ſhip a Captaine, who muſt bee borne a Gentleman. There is alſo the Chancellour of the Kingdome, to whom out of all the Provinces and Iſles they appeale and make ſuite unto, and from whom appeale is alſo made to the King and the Senate of the Kingdome. All the Provinces are divided into <hi>Haeret,</hi> as they call them, or into Dioceſes, under which are many Pariſhes, heere, if there be any controverſies, matters are firſt tried. And from hence they appeale to the Judge of the <hi>Haeret.</hi> Afterward to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and laſt of all to the King and Senatours, where it hath a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and finall Judgement. They have a written Law, compoſed by <hi>Woldemare</hi> the firſt, together with the Biſhops and Senators, which is very agreeable to the law of Nature, and not much differing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes; and that cauſes and ſuites may ſooner have an end, and judgement be given and put in execution, It is provided that Judges, if they doe any wrong or give falſe judgement, are condemned to loſe halfe their goods; whereof the King hath the one part, and the injured partie the other. <hi>Woldemare</hi> the firſt (except I be deceiv'd) added the Biſhops to the Senators, whom <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> the third, for rebellion and certaine other cauſes did put out againe. The Kings Chancellour, who for the moſt part followeth the King in the Court, hath ſeven or eight Noble men adjoyned unto him as Aſſiſtants, beſides Secretaries and Clerkes; and all buſineſſes are diſpatch'd by the King himſelfe. But if it be ſome matter of conſequence, as concerning peace or warre, entring into league with forraine Nations, or into conſultation concerning the defending of their owne Territories, then the King calleth a Councell of Senators. Neither can the King impoſe any taxe upon the Kingdome or Countrie, without their conſent, and the conſent of the Nobles. There is alſo in this Kingdome a Maſter of the Exchequer, who colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14932:77"/>
and gathereth all the Revenues of the whole Kingdome, both of Caſtles, Farmes, and Cuſtomes, as well by Sea as by Land. Hee taketh account of them, enquireth into them, and giveth acquittances for the receit of them. Hee hath two Aſſiſtants of the Nobilitie, and many Clerkes under him; and for his office hath a yearely ſtipend or penſion.</p>
               <p>The third State is of the Clergie, in which there are ſeven Biſhops, as the Biſhop of <hi>Lunden,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe have the Tenths of the Kingdome; which in divers Countries are divided in a divers manner: for the Biſhops have an halfe part of the Tenths, and the King an halfe part, the Canoniſts and Preachers have a part, and a part is contributed toward the building and repairing of Churches. And as concerning the Popes authoritie in this Kingdome, as alſo in <hi>France,</hi> the ordination of Prelates and Biſhops have beene alwayes in the Kings power, as may appeare by the anſwer of <hi>Woldemare</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> which heere I have annexed. When the Pope required theſe and the like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges from the King, it is reported, that the King writ back unto him, <hi>Wee have our Kingdome from our Subjects, our life from our Parents, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the Romiſh Church, which if you will take from us, I ſend it you by theſe preſents.</hi> And as the wiſe Decree of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth is praiſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Eccleſiaſticall perſons from buying any immoveable thing without the conſent of the King, ſo <hi>Christian</hi> the third as wiſely did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that the Clergie ſhould not ſell any thing without the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement. In other matters the Clergie-men through the whole kingdome are well provided for by <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the third, of famous memorie, and many Schooles erected in many places, as alſo two in <hi>Iſeland,</hi> where they have likewiſe a Printing-Houſe. There is but one Univerſitie in the whole kingdome, called the Univerſitie of <note n="h" place="margin">This Citie is called by the <hi>Germans Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Haffen</hi> or <hi>Hafnia,</hi> founded by <hi>Chriſterne</hi> the firſt, by permiſſion of Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt 1470: which <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, although hee were ſeven yeares incumbred with the <hi>Swethiſh</hi> warres, did ſo enrich, that the yearely revenues thereof are very much.</p>
               <p>The fourth State is of the Citizens and Merchants, dwelling in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes. Theſe have proper and peculiar priviledges which they enjoy, beſides certaine fields and woods that belong to them; and theſe doe traffique both by Sea and Land in all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Out of theſe, as alſo out of the Countrey-people, the Biſhops, the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, the Preachers, and Senators of Cities, the Clerkes of Bands, the Lievtenants of Towres, and the Maſters of Ships are choſen, and ſome of them are Maſters of the Cuſtomes or Tributes; laſtly, of theſe all leſſer Councels of Juſtice doe conſiſt, one of the Nobility, for the moſt part, ſitting as Preſident.</p>
               <p>The fifth State is of the Ruſtick, or Countrey-people, and there are two ſorts of them, the firſt they call <hi>Freibunden,</hi> that is, Free-holders. Theſe doe hold Lands of Inheritance, yet paying for the ſame ſome little free-rent every yeare. Theſe doe alſo uſe merchandiſe and fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They are not oppreſt with doing ſervices, neither doe they pay any taxes, unleſſe the Senators of the kingdome doe grant it as a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14932:77"/>
The other ſort is of thoſe, who doe not poſſeſſe goods of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but doe farme them of the King, the Nobles or Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and are conſtrained to doe many ſervices for their Lords, in ſuch manner, as they ſhall covenant with their Land-lord. Theſe are the chiefe things which I thought good to declare concerning the <hi>State politick of Denmarke</hi>; whereby it appeareth, that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Monarchie was, for the moſt part, well framed: for the free election of the Kings being in the hands of the Nobilitie, and yet notwithſtanding out of the royall Progenie, as wee ſaid before: it followeth, that the <hi>Danes</hi> have no civill warres or diſſentions, unleſſe thoſe which are betweene ſuch as bee of the Blood Royall, which are quickly compoſed by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and helpe of the Nobles; but eſpecially ſeeing the Kings younger Sonnes can have no part of the kingdome. Moreover, as they are all ſtiled but Nobles, and know not the titles and names of Barons, Earles, and Dukes, ſo there are none that have ſo much wealth and power, as that repoſing truſt therein, they dare oppoſe themſelves againſt the Royall Familie; becauſe the Fathers Inheritance is alwayes divided betweene the Sonnes and Daughters. Thus the Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> have a flouriſhing Common-wealth, which may eaſily bee defended from forraine enemies, whom their Subjects, living in unanimity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with them as their naturall Lords, are able to reſiſt both by ſea and land.</p>

And as theſe things appeare outwardly, by reaſon of certaine engines, and wheeles framed within to that purpoſe, So is there added a covering ſo made by Art, that as often as the Clocke ſtrikes, two little Images like two Champions do meete together, &amp; do give one another ſo many blowes as the Clocke ſtriketh ſtrokes. But that which is more wonderfull is this, in the middle of this Table, as it were in a Throne, is placed the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> holding her Infant in her armes: on both ſides of her there are, as it were, two Gates, and before her feet a Theater of a ſemicircular forme, with the arch thereof turned toward the ſpectators, within there is a deviſe with the Images of the three wiſemen, having every one their ſervant. The whole engine being turned as he pleaſeth that keepeth it, ſtraightway the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges come forth. And before the reſt there comes as it were a threatning Herald, who brandiſhing his ſword knocks at the left doare, that being open'd hee goeth forward while two Images ſeeme to blow two trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets before him.

But when hee commeth to the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Image hee reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently bends himſelfe unto it, as if hee did adore her. And ſo alſo do the other two.

For it is neither ſcortched with the violent heat of the Sun as <hi>Africke,</hi> nor troubled with daily windes as <hi>France</hi>; but lying between them both,<note place="margin">The temper of the Aire.</note> it hath a temperate Winter and Summer. Hence it is (as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> witneſſeth) that <hi>Spaine</hi> hath a very wholeſome aire, the equall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thereof being never infected with Mooriſh fogges. Beſide the coole blaſts of winde which come from the Sea, and doe as it were ſearch all parts of the Country, doe drive away all earthly vapours, and ſo make it very healthfull. Yet all parts of <hi>Spaine</hi> are not of one qualitie, for toward the North, as it is ſomething cold and obnoxious to the Sea, ſo it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth freſh water, and therefore affordeth no convenient habitation: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing the moſt parts of it are full of Rocks, Forreſts, &amp; woody places. Towards the South where it extendeth it ſelfe in a continued ridge of Mountaines,<note place="margin">The fertilitie of the Soyle.</note> it hath a happy &amp; good ſoyle, being watered with many great Rivers, and refreſhed with ſeaſonable raine, ſo that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth fruits of all kindes.

What ſhould I ſpeake of the Wines of this Country, having an excellent taſte and ſmell, and being made in all parts, yet in ſome places better than in other? <hi>Spaine</hi> was heretofore (as now alſo) rich in mines of Gold, Braſſe, Iron, Leade, and other mettals: and it doth not onely boyle and make ſalt, but in ſome parts thereof it is digged out of the Earth. For as it is made in many places in <hi>Spaine</hi> of pit or Well-water, as at <hi>Seguntia</hi> and elſewhere, inſomuch that the King ſetteth a great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome thereon, ſo there are Mountaines (if we may beleeve <hi>Marineus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>) which have native ſalt in them. Beſides, <hi>Spaine</hi> is rich and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all kinde of Cattle, ſo that the Woods, Mountaines, Meddowes, Fields, and Forreſts doe reſound with their bleating and lowing.

Of theſe things therefore I will ſpeake briefly, and thus it was. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did rule all <hi>Spaine,</hi> and had all things under their owne command, the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſend firſt of all the two <hi>Scipioes</hi> againſt them with an army of Souldiers, in the beginning of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were ſlaine in the ſeventh yeare of that war, <hi>Q. Fulvius Flaccus</hi> and <hi>Ap. Claudius Pulcher</hi> being Conſuls. The next year <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</hi> being ſent next to his Father &amp; Uncle, did performe many things very proſperouſly, and firſt of all made a Province of it, <hi>Q. Caecilius Metellus,</hi> and <hi>L. Veturius Philo</hi> being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls. Firſt, <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Mago Carthaginian</hi> Captaines, being overthrown and put to flight in the battell, neere to the Citie <hi>Baetula</hi> (which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been in that place where now <hi>Baeca</hi> and <hi>Vbeda</hi> are ſeated) and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies beaten out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee eſtabliſhed a league of friendſhip with <hi>Syphax</hi> King of the <hi>Maſsilians,</hi> who is now called <hi>Bile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgerid</hi>; a litle after hee compelled the rebellious people of <hi>Spaine</hi> to yeeld themſelves unto him, and having made a league with <hi>Maſſaniſſa</hi> King of the <hi>Maſaeſulians,</hi> and the <hi>Gaditanes,</hi> hee committed the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Province to <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> and <hi>L. Manlius Acidinus,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Rome.</hi> After <hi>Scipio, L. Cornelius Lentulus</hi> the Proconſul did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne <hi>Spaine,</hi> and after many proſperous acts and atchievements, entred the Citie in triumph. Three yeares after, <hi>C. Cornelius, Cethegus,</hi> and <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Rufus</hi> being Conſuls, the two <hi>Spaines</hi> were firſt bounded, and two new Pretors ſent into them, <hi>C. Sempronius Tuditanus</hi> into the hither <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>M. Helvetius Blaſio</hi> into the farther. Two yeares being ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſt, ſo great a warre began in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that it was neceſſarie, that a Conſul ſhould be ſent out with an Army: <hi>Marcus Portius Cato</hi> Conſul being allotted to goe into the hither part, did ſo appeaſe and quiet rebellion, that the Proconſul in regard thereof triumphed. This is that <hi>Cato,</hi> who, as <hi>Livie</hi> writeth and others, by a wonderfull ſtratagem, did throw downe the wals of many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cities in one day. After <hi>Cato</hi>'s victorie, <hi>Spaine</hi> was diverſly poſſeſſed, and many times loſt and regained againe, ſo that there were above 30 triumphs for victories obtained heere. They did not begin to pay any taxe, before the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who having by long continuance of warres tamed all <hi>Spaine,</hi> and overthrowne the <hi>Cantabrians</hi> and <hi>Aſturians</hi> that had longeſt of all made reſiſtance, divided the whole Countrie into three Provinces, <hi>Baetica,</hi> ſo called from the River <hi>Batis, Luſitania,</hi> and <hi>Tarraconenſis,</hi> ſo called from its citie <hi>Tarracon</hi>; and every one of theſe have their Dioceſſes or Circles of juriſdiction.

Thus things by degrees being changed, the chiefeſt Provinces were under the <hi>Romans</hi> command, even untill the Conſulſhip of <hi>Honorius</hi> the third, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> the third.

In the field they can endure both hunger thirſt and labour. In battle and matters of warre they are more politick than ſtout: they are of a light body, and being lightly armed, they not onely eaſily purſue their enemies, but when they are put to it, they can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſave themſelves by flight, (alwayes meditating on ſome militarie or warlike deſigne). In their feaſtes and banquets at home they are frugall, ſober, and content with a little, but abroade they have more delicate fare.

            <p>Theſe things may ſuffice which have beene ſpoken hitherto concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Spaine.</hi> But yet I thinke it fit to adde, by way of concluſion, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent teſtimonie of a <hi>French-man</hi> concerning this Kingdome, wherein whatſoever wee have hitherto ſaid in praiſe and commendation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is briefly and pithily repeated by way of recapitulation.

<q>Now it will appeare, that hee is declared Prince, who ought to bee choſen of all men, and out of all men. For firſt, <hi>Spaine</hi> is thy Mother, a Land more happie than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, (the great Fabricator and Maker of all things hath beene more favourable, in enriching and adorning this Countrie, than the Countries of others Nations) for it is neither obnoxious to the Summers heate, nor ſubject to the Northerne cold, but is ſeated in the temperate Climate, and by the witty diligence of Nature, it is, as it were, an other world, as being encloſed on one ſide with the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaean</hi> Mountaines, heere with the Ocean, and there with the ſhores of the <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Sea. Beſides, adde to this the many famous Cities which are therein, the whole Countries being either tilled, or full of fruites and flocks, the gold-bearing Rivers that water it, and the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling pretious ſtones that enrich it; I know that Poets in their Fables which they have invented to pleaſe the eare, have attributed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things to ſome Nations, which whether they are true or not, yet are very ſtrange: neither doe I now ſeeke out the truth: Let <hi>Gargara</hi> (as it is written) yeeld a great increaſe of corne: let <hi>Menavia</hi> be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for her flocks, <hi>Campania</hi> for the Mountaine <hi>Gaurano, Lydia</hi> for the River <hi>Pactolus, Spaine</hi> hath every thing that is praiſe-worthy.

This Country is the Mother of Judges and Princes: this Countrie yeelded the Emperours <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> and the Empire is beholding to this Countrie for thee. Let <hi>Crete,</hi> which boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of <hi>Iupiters</hi> being nurſed in it when hee was a childe, give place to this Countrie: let <hi>Delos,</hi> honoured by the birth of two Gods, and noble <hi>Thebes</hi> of <hi>Hercules</hi> who was brought up there, yeeld unto it.

The Countrie of <hi>Balneole</hi> or <hi>Aquae Voconis</hi> hath a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of a golden colour, ſo that you may ſee any thing that is caſt into it. And there is a wholeſome Fountaine in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being drunke often and in great abundance, doth not onely not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſtomack, but alſo miraculouſly cures men of many diſeaſes: they fabulouſly report, that <hi>S. Maginus</hi> after ſome prayers to God to give it that vertue, did digge and open it with his ſtaffe, being in a drie mountanous and ſtonie place. Over againſt the Towne <hi>Aulotum</hi> there are about 12 Fountaines ariſing or ſpringing from braſſe mynes, which both day and night all Winter and Summer doe, as it were, breathe out a thinne vapour, warme in Winter, but ſo cold in Summer, that no man can endure it for any while; and the water, if the Inhabitants doe ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bottles into it (as they often doe) maketh them as cold as Ice, ſo that the water which is in theſe bottles affordeth a delicate drinke to coole the heate of the ſtomack. There are alſo many Fountaines alwayes hot, which ſhewes, that there is ſome fire there which lyes hidden in the bowels of the Earth. There are more than foure ſuch hot Fountaines in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and all of them very excellent to helpe divers kindes of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherefore many that have griefes and infirmities doe reſort unto them from all parts. <hi>Catalonia</hi> doth abound with Rivers, for it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fiftie which runne through it,<note place="margin">The Rivers.</note> and all of them very full of Fiſh: ſome are ſmall, but yet very pleaſant ſtreames, ſome are of a midle ſize, and laſtly there are ſome very faire ones, as namely <hi>Tettus,</hi> (which is alſo called <hi>Ruſciſon) Techum</hi> (which is alſo called <hi>Tetrum) Fluvianus</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Clovianus</hi> and <hi>Plumialbus) Tardera</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num) Beſotium</hi> (which is alſo called <hi>Biſocto</hi> and <hi>Betulo) Rubricatus, Cinga, Sicoris,</hi> and <hi>Iberus.</hi> All of them doe flow and runne into the Sea except <hi>Cinga</hi> and <hi>Cicorus,</hi> the former whereof runneth into <hi>Sicoris,</hi> the later into <hi>Iberus,</hi> which being much enriched with the watry tribute of theſe and other Rivers becommeth one of the greateſt Rivers in all <hi>Spaine.</hi> The beſt <hi>Corall</hi> groweth in the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Sea on the Eaſt thereof.

Chryſtall is found in the Mountains of <hi>Nuria,</hi> on the <hi>Cardonenſian</hi> rocks. And that which any one will wonder at, as being worthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is found at the Towne of <hi>Cardona</hi> a Mountaine having very wholeſome ſalt growing in it, and ſhining againſt the Sunne with a great deale of variety and delight to the eye, out of which (as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of the Mountaine <hi>Oromenus</hi> in <hi>India</hi>) ſalt is daily cut and digged, and yet groweth againe; yea the Mountaine ſtill groweth ſo much the higher, by how much the more ſalt is cut out of the pits that are in it. There is alſo an other thing very wonderfull, and that is, whereas places where ſalt is found are barren, and produce or beare nothing, yet this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

hath many Pine-trees and Vines upon it. In the Biſhoprick of <hi>Gerunda</hi> on the South ſide thereof, there is a Hill of white ſmall ſand, which (as in <hi>Lybia</hi>) the winde carries heere and there, and makes great driftes of it, which are very perillous and dangerous for thoſe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that way. Heere I cannot but mention the Mountaine called <hi>Mount Serrato,</hi> being diſtant toward the Eaſt ſeven leagues from <hi>Barcinona,</hi> it is very rockie and cliffie, in manner of a rugged Saw, and ſo high, that from thence the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountaines, and the fartheſt Mountaines of the Iſland <hi>Majorica</hi> may bee ſeene. This Mountaine is full of great ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stones like <hi>Iaſpers.</hi> There are ſome Fountaines which ſpring and flow out of it: it produceth many hearbs which have ſpeciall and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne vertues: and it is watered toward the North with the River <hi>Lubricatus,</hi> and at length like <hi>Soractus</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>Tabor</hi> in <hi>Galile,</hi> it here raiſeth up it ſelfe, wherefore it is very delightfull to behold.

The uſe and utility of Geographie in reading Hiſtories and retaining them, is greater than that I neede to make any admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deſcription of; but there is an other greater dignitie belonging unto it, if it be directed to its proper end, and rightly uſed, and that is, it doth much availe to the knowledge of Politick Government, when the ſituation of a place is not onely deſcribed, but alſo the nature and condition thereof, which is ſometimes the office of a Geographer to doe. And as that Painter doth not ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his profeſsion, which delineates a man according to the proportion of his limbes, but doth not with colours and phyſiognomicall ſhadowes expreſſe his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and affections; ſo hee ſhall but figure out an unpleaſing and, as it were, a dead Geographicall body or carcaſſe, who having ſet downe places according to their ſymmetrie and proportion, ſhall not ſhew their Politicall reſpect which they beare one to an other. Wherefore I eſteem'd it as a thing chiefly to be reſpected, that in every ſeverall Countrie the nature and order of Government appendant thereunto, ſhould be prefixed before the Tables themſelves, whereby I might ſomewhat benefit thoſe who are ſtudious of politicall and publick affaires. If our writing be in many places imperfect, defective, or erronious, the Reader needes not wonder, for the formes of things throughout all Nations are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, neither have I found all that are, purpoſely deſcribed by any Author; yet even as I could gather them out of Hiſtories, I have collected them, whereby thou maiſt partly underſtand the order and manner of every government, and ſo maiſt ſupply and correct that which is wanting in thy owne Countrie, which if every one would doe, how profitable would Geographie be to Students? There are three heads eſpecially to be conſidered in the adminiſtration of Kingdomes, Principalities, and Provinces, namely the Eccleſiaſticall State, the Politicall State, and the Adminiſtration of Iuſtice: firſt therefore according to the title of the Countrie deſcribed in the Table, I will reckon up how many members or parts there are of the Politicall State thereof, according to the order of dignitie as they are obſerved there. Secondly in diſtinguiſhing Noble-mens places (ſith the whole government is in the hands of the Nobilitie) I will in the firſt place reckon thoſe who are Feudals to the Prince, and afterward thoſe that are free, deſcending ſtill in order from the higheſt degree of Nobilitie, as Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Lords. Thirdly, I will ſhew into what Prefectures the Countrie is divided: and I ſuppoſe that by theſe three things the Politicall State will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

declared. In the adminiſtration of Iuſtice, the juridicall Dioceſſes ſhall be noted, and the higher Senates to which appeale may be made. Laſtly, in the Eccleſiaſticall State, the Archbiſhops, if there be any, ſhall bee placed firſt, and then the ſuffragan Biſhops which are under them, as alſo thoſe which are ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to others. To reckon up all theſe things requires much ſtud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, but ſeeing for want of matter it may be briefly delivered, I will performe what I may, that ſo I may ſtirre up lovers of their countrie to emulate a greater perfection in their writings. The ſeverall places ſhall be noted with numbers, that they may be ſtraight-way found out in the following Table; the firſt number ſhall containe the degrees and minutes of Longitude, which ſhall be ſought out in the Northerne or Southerne ſide of the Table, the later ſhall have the numbers of Latitude, which are to be ſought on the Weſterne or Eaſterne ſide. From theſe bounds, heere by the direction of the Meridian, and there of the Parallel of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, you ſhall come at laſt to their interſection, and ſo finde out the place propounded. The ſituation of thoſe places which are in the deſcription of the generall Tables ought to be ſought from thence. But if ſo be that ſome names are not found in the table following, it was the fault of the Chorographer who delineated it, for the right deſigning and placing of principalities and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is not to be omitted. The rule and government of Countries is in the power of the Nobilitie, and therefore it is both profitable and delightfull to know and diſtinguiſh their ſeverall degrees, and the proper conditions of them. The higheſt degree is that of Emperour or King, whom in order doe follow the degrees of Duke, Earle, Baron, the militarie Tribune, whom the <hi>Low-country-men</hi> call <hi>Banderheer, quaſi Bendae,</hi> that is, Lord of the Troupes, which he leadeth under his Banner. After him is the Knight, or hee that hath attained to be of the Horſemans Order, whom the <hi>French-men</hi> doe call <hi>Chevalier,</hi> and the <hi>Low-country-men Ridder.</hi> In the laſt place is <hi>vn Eſcuyer,</hi> who beareth Armes, but hath attained to no publick dignitie. There are three degrees of Earles, the firſt whereof the <hi>French-men</hi> call <hi>Viconte,</hi> who excelleth the reſt in dignity &amp; priviledges, <hi>Ludovic. Guic.</hi> would have him now called a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</hi> And though this Order of Earles in time hath remitted ſomething of its honour, yet in the beginning it was of more excellent dignitie, as the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof ſhall by and by declare. In the ſecond degree is the Earle Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, who is called in <hi>Dutch, Landgrave.</hi> In the third degree is the Marqueſſe, or Marckgrave. Theſe are the ſpeciall degrees and orders of Nobilitie, among which the government of every Countrie is divided. There are alſo ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in theſe degrees which might occaſion a ſubdiviſion, but ſuch as are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht rather by priviledges than by forme of government. Yet moreover I will deliver the lawfull differences and conditions of every order which I have mentioned, as I have found them in a certaine <hi>French</hi> Booke, entituled <hi>La di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion du monde:</hi> deducing their creation from the loweſt degree of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whence their proprieties and order of government doe moſt clearely appeare. A Knight, ſaith this author, or a <hi>Chevalier</hi> ſhall be thus created of one that was a Squire before, and bore armes in his Eſcutcheon. If hee, having long fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the warres, exerciſed armes, beene preſent at many conflicts, hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meanes to maintaine the ſtate of his degree, and commeth of a great, noble, and rich Familie; then in any skirmiſh hee ſhall make knowne his requeſt to the Generall of the Army, or to ſome valiant generous Knight, and when the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell is ended, hee ſhall come unto the ſaid Generall or Knight, and entreate him
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14932:132"/>
in the name of God and S. <hi>George,</hi> to give him the Order of Knighthood. Whereupon hee ſhall draw out his Sword and ſtrike him thrice with it, ſaying: I make thee a Knight (or <hi>Chevalier</hi>) in the name of God and S. <hi>George,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to defend the Faith, Iuſtice, the Church, Widowes, and Orphanes. But if the ſupplicant, although he be valiant, yet be poore, hee ſhall not bee admitted, unleſſe ſo much yearely revenues be aſsigned and given unto him, as is neceſſarie to preſerve and maintaine the honour and dignitie of his Order. And this is the firſt degree of Nobility ariſing from the loweſt. A militarie Tribune called <hi>een Bander-heer</hi> ſhall be made of a Knight, if having long followed the warres hee hath lands and revenues enough to keepe and maintaine fiftie Gentle-men in pay, that is, one Band of horſe men which ſhall follow his colours in the war. For no man can ſet up a Colours or ſtanderd of his owne, unleſſe hee can bring into the field at his owne charge a Troupe or Band at the leaſt of fiftie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who receive pay from him. A Baron may bee created of a Knight, or alſo of a Noble Squire, which hath foure Caſtles in his dominion, and all power within himſelfe, for then the King may conferre a Baronrie upon him: yet hee cannot give him this honour, unleſſe he hath behaved himſelfe valiantly in the warres. Therefore after the firſt conflict or battell he is made a Knight, after the ſecond a militarie Tribune, and after the third a Baron. The degree of an Earle is the next, and firſt an Earle of the Marches, whom wee call a Marqueſſe, that is, Marcgrave. And hee may be created one, who hath two or three Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies included in one Dukedome, and that by the Duke in whoſe precincts they lye. Hee may be made a Provinciall Earle, that is a Landgrave, who hath foure Baronies in one Dukedome, by the Duke or the King, by the inſtance or permiſsion of the Duke. Hee may bee made a Vicount, who hath five Counties or more within one Dukedome, or which are joyned together by vicinitie of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. And (by the Kings permiſsion) he may be created by the Duke with great ſolemnitie. But if the King himſelfe be preſent the Principality is more honourable. The Duke who is to be made of an Earle, muſt firſt poſſeſſe in the Kingdome wherein hee is to bee crowned, foure principall Counties, and muſt have in every one of them foure other Counties or Baronies, which muſt bee bound to doe fealtie and ſervice to them. But he muſt be crowned by the King or Emperour whoſe ſubject hee is, his Hatt being adorned with pearles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones, in the moſt flouriſhing Citie of his territories, and that in a great aſſembly of Princes, Dukes, Earles, and Barons, a ſolemne feſtivall being alſo held, as it is the cuſtome as the Coronation of Kings. Hee that is to bee King, muſt have foure Dukedomes lying neere together ſubject unto him, and in every Dukedome foure Cities, which hee alone governeth, in every one of theſe foure Cities one Archbiſhop, and under euery one of theſe againe ten Provinciall Biſhops. Hee being endowed and adorned with theſe dominions and dignities ſhall come unto the Emperours Majeſtie as to his ſuperiour, or ſhall invite him by an honourable Embaſſage to come unto him, and ſo deſire to be crowned by him. But this ſeemes to be a later manner of electing the Kings and other Princes, for as long as thoſe wandring Nations of the <hi>Gothes, Vandals, Longobardes,</hi> and many others did bring in their Kings with them, they did not meaſure the royall dignitie by large poſſeſsion of lands, but by the multitude and ſtrength of the people which they brought in. Neither was there any other choiſe of Dukes, who firſt began to bee inſtituted by <hi>Longinus</hi> Governour of <hi>Ravenna</hi> in the yeare <hi>569,</hi> and afterward by the <hi>Longobards,</hi> than for their valour and wiſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14932:132"/>
atchievements. Adde to this that which <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> witneſſeth, namely, that Dukes and Earles were in the beginning made Prefects by the King over Nations and Cities on this condition, onely that as often as there was occaſion they ſhould bee diſmiſſed or changed. Now how could the afore ſaid Lawes of creating Princes (which are meaſured by, and doe claime the hereditarie poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Lands) be in force at that time, ſeeing Dukedomes and Counties were conferr'd by Kings and Emperours as a temporary bountie? Therefore though the preciſe time of the Inſtitution of them cannot be ſhewed (for that <hi>French</hi> Booke doth mention nothing of it) yet it is very likely, that under <hi>Otto</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Emperour, or about the yeare one thouſand, or a litle after, that manner of conſtituting and confirming dignities was ordained by the Monarches. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven untill <hi>Otto</hi> the ſecond, every Prince according to his power and ambition, did aſpire to greater dignitie and royall Majeſtie. So out of one Kingdome of <hi>Lotharingia</hi> or <hi>Lorreine,</hi> which being extended from the <hi>Rhene</hi> even to the River <hi>Scaldis,</hi> was bounded with the <hi>Frieſland</hi> Sea, and belonged to <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Lodovicus Pius,</hi> more Kingdomes did afterward ariſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>transjurane Burgundie,</hi> which being extended from the Mountaine <hi>Jura</hi> even to the <hi>Alpes,</hi> did containe all <hi>Helvetia,</hi> the <hi>Rauraci,</hi> the <hi>Allobro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and the <hi>transjurane Burgundians:</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Provence</hi> which did certaine ſome part of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> and was afterward called the Kingdome of <hi>Arelatum,</hi> of which at this day the Elector of <hi>Trevers</hi> is called the Archchan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And ſo, Reader, thou haſt the diſtinct Degrees of all the Nobilitie, and the differences of their dignities. Now if thou obſerve how Provinces in every Kingdome are divided in reſpect of them, how the government and adminiſtration of the whole, and in what proportion it is diſtributed among theſe degrees, what is every ones peculiar office, what is the habitude or relation which they have one to an other, and eſpecially to their head, you ſhall behold either an excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony tending to the preſervation of peace and tranquillity, ſtrength and power, riches and ſtate, vertue and wiſedome to the Majeſtie of a Kingdome, and the enlarging of territories; or a confuſed disorder tending to inſtabilitie, declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            <div type="use_of_tables">
               <head>An Admonition concerning the uſe of the Tables following.</head>
               <p>WHen it was my purpoſe to reduce all Geographie to the conſideration of the Heavens, that the juſt ſymmetrie of places, as they lye in the Sphericall figure of the Earth, might as neere as could be obſerved <hi>in plano</hi> or on a plaine ſuperficies, a due proportion of degrees of Longitude was to be ſet down, according to the degrees of Latitude. Seeing therefore the Table could containe but a few degrees of Latitude, I have reduced the proportion thereof almoſt to the midle Parallel of the Table, ſo that what the proportion is of that Parallel to the Meridian, the ſame ſhould be the proportion of the degrees of Longitude in the ſame Parallel to the degrees of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſo all the Meridians are Parallels one to an other. But ſeeing there were more degrees of Latitude, becauſe there is a great difference of proportion in the Parallels both in the top and the bottome unto the Meridian, leſt the ſymmetric of places ſhould not be true, I have choſen two Parallels almoſt equally diſtant from the midle and the extreames, to the proportion whereof, I have drawne the Meridians to deſigne and note out the degrees of Longitude, which are not then Parallels, but according to the greater or leſſer diſtance of the aſſumed Parallels, they doe encline more or leſſe one to an other and to the midle Meridian of the Table.</p>
               <p>Moreover thou ſhalt finde the degrees of Latitude and Longitude deſigned and ſet forth on the ſides of the Tables, and for the moſt part, the degrees of Latitude on either ſide of the Table, and of Longitude on the top and bottome, ſeeing according to the uſuall manner of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers wee place the North on the higher part. But if the Countrie to be deſcribed be more extended toward the South and North, than toward the Eaſt and Weſt, then commonly wee place the Weſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Howſoever it be made the Eaſt and Weſt ſides ſhall alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto thee the degrees of Latitude, the other two ſides the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Longitude. And all the degrees are divided into 60 partes which they call minutes, ſometimes into ſingle parts, when the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will permit, ſometimes into two, five, or ten. This foundation being laid, wee have followed the beſt deſcriptions in delineating of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in which I had much helpe from a famous Meaſurer of Countries, and a moſt diligent Geographer to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> called <hi>Chriſtianus Grothenius,</hi> who had viewed many Countries, and deſcribed them more largely and exactly than any other, and alſo from a moſt diligent Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14932:133"/>
to the King of <hi>Spaine Abraham Ortelius,</hi> who was candor and curteſie it ſelfe, and who, in evidence thereof, liberally communicated unto mee what Tables ſoever hee had gotten, though he had the ſame purpoſe that I intended. Thoſe who beſides did helpe mee any thing at all, I will mention in due place, ſo that Students may give them their deſerved praiſe, and I may not bee found ungratefull. And whatſoever hath beene offerr'd mee by others, and I found out by my owne diligent ſearch, I have compar'd together, that as neere as may bee I might ſet forth accurate deſcriptions: yet in one thing which I chiefly deſired I am defective, namely in an exact numbring and reckoning up of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities &amp; Noble-mens places, which are much ſought for in Tables that are ſet forth: therefore (READER) thou muſt pardon that defect, and vouchſafe to helpe mee in deſcribing the Politicall Order of the Nobilitie, and in ſhewing their places, names, and qualities, which will be an honour and grace unto thy name. Litle round circles doe ſhew the true ſituation of every place, from whence their diſtance is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and theſe have ſome markes whereby places are diſtinguiſht one from an other. The Villages are marked onely by round circles: where wee meete with a Caſtle, wee marke it in this manner <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If any one would finde out the Longitude and Latitude of any place,<note place="margin">How by the Mappe to finde out the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> hee ſhall do it where the Meridians are Parallels, by taking with a paire of Compaſſes the diſtance thereof from the one ſide of the Table, and by applying the Compaſſe ſo opened to the other ſide. If you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the diſtance from the Eaſt ſide, the Compaſſe from the ſame ſide in the North ſide will ſhew the degree and minute of Longitude. But if you have the diſtance from the North ſide, it will ſhew you the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the Eaſt ſide. When the Meridians are not Parallels, the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a place ſhall bee found out in the ſame manner, as in univerſall Tables, where the Parallels are circular, for the diſtance of the place taken from the next Parallel will ſhew the ſame in the Eaſt ſide. But the Longitude is to be ſought out with a thread or ruler laid upon the place, and turned about, untill on the North and South ſide the ſame minute of the ſame degree be on either ſide deſigned, and whatſoever that is, is the Longitude of the place aſſumed.</p>
               <p>The miles in divers Countries do differ much, therefore if you pleaſe to compare them one to an other, bring them with your Compaſſes to the degrees of the Meridian, and then finde out how many miles are comprehended in one degree, and you ſhall ſee how many miles of one countrie, and how many miles of an other countrie doe make up one degree; ſo you ſhall finde the common <hi>German</hi> miles (fifteene whereof are in one degree) foure times larger than the <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and double as much to the <hi>Swethiſh</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> miles.</p>

            <p>And ſo much concerning the <hi>French-mens</hi> Religion, now let us adde ſomething concerning their cuſtomes and faſhions: <hi>Livie</hi> teſtifies, that the <hi>French men</hi> doe come to Councell in Armour; <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, that it was the manner of the <hi>French</hi> Councels, that if any one did interrupt a Suiter, a publick Officer went to him, and drawing out his ſword, did threaten him, and command him to keepe ſilence: and if hee did not then hold his peace, the Officer did in the ſame manner as formerly, the ſecond and third time; and laſtly he cut off ſo much of the Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cloake, ſo that the reſt was good for nothing: <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>French-mens</hi> Councels are raſh and ſuddaine, and that they are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in Councell, and deſirous of innovation. The ſame <hi>Caeſar</hi> noteth, that the <hi>French-men,</hi> when any matter of note happeneth, are wont by a ſpeedie way, to notifie it unto the Countries round about, and that is by acclamations and ſhouting with the voyce, for from them the others receive it, and they againe by the ſame meanes make it knowne to their neighbours. They doe not ſuffer their Children (ſaith <hi>Caeſar</hi>) when they are growne to ripeneſſe of yeares, to come unto them openly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould not neglect the ſervice of the warres: and they thinke it an unſeemely thing for the Sonne in his Childehood to ſit in publick in the ſight of his Father. The men doe make their wives a dowrie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the portion which they receive with them, both which are put into one ſtock, ſo as that which ariſeth from it is kept to their uſe: and which ſoever of the parties doth out-live the other, he or ſhee hath both parts with the uſe and profit which hath ariſen from thence. The <hi>French</hi> women are beautifull, and like men for ſtrength and ſtature, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith; they are fruitfull, and when they bring forth children, they give them good education. Servitude was uſuall in <hi>France</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of other Nations. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. that the moſt of them when they are oppreſſed either with debt or by great taxes, or by the power of great men, they betake themſelves to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Noble-men, who have as much power over them, as Maſters
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14932:141"/>
have over their Servants: yet they uſe them with more humanity and curteſie than the <hi>Romans</hi> did. For the <hi>French</hi> Lords had theſe Servants, or (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> calleth them by a <hi>French</hi> word) <hi>Ambacti,</hi> who attended on them to increaſe their traine, and they us'd them in ſervice of warre. Moreover they commonly uſed (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> witneſſeth) thicke earthen Cups, and wrought with flowres on them. They did all ſuppe ſitting, not on ſeates but on the ground, upon the skins of wolves and dogges ſpread thereon, the younger youths ſerving them at meate. And neere unto them there was a fire made, and pots of fleſh ſet thereon, eſpecially with Swines fleſh both freſh and ſalt. But for the moſt part, as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, their meate was Milke. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> thus delivereth his minde out of <hi>Poſidonius</hi> concerning this Nation: <hi>The</hi> French <hi>uſe to drinke upon a litle hay ſpread under them, having litle woodden Tables before them. Bread (which, as</hi> Plinie <hi>noteth, they make light with leaven) is there a common foode. They uſe much roſted and broyled fleſh: and they take up whole joynts in both hands like Lions, tearing them in pieces with their teeth, and that which they cannot pull in pieces, they cut it with a litle knife. Thoſe that live neere Rivers or the Sea-coaſts have fiſh as a common ſervice at their Table, which they broyle on fire with ſalt, vineger, and cummin, which they put alſo in the drinke.</hi> And a litle afterward he ſaith, <hi>The rich and wealthy men doe drinke wine which is brought out of</hi> Italie <hi>or out of</hi> Maſſilia, <hi>and that either pure by it ſelfe, or ſometimes mingled with a litle water.</hi> But <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>cap. ult.</hi> that they make a kinde of drunken drinke of fruite. <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith, that they made a drinke of Barley, which they called <hi>Zythum,</hi> and an other of water and honey. Concerning their habit, they wore a kinde of Caſſock,<note place="margin">Their Habit.</note> as <hi>Strabo</hi> noteth, woven of thick wooll, this Garment they called <hi>Laena,</hi> by which is meant, as <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> doth note, thoſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the <hi>French-men</hi> doe now call <hi>Lanſanguies, quaſi Laurangiae,</hi> from the figure of a Laurell or Bay-leafe, which is like unto a <hi>Rhombus.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> did uſe looſe or ſtraite Breeches, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> cals a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous covering. <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>French</hi> in ſtead of Cloakes uſed to weare ſhort Coates that reached downe but to the buttocks: the ſhape of which Garment may be ſeene in that which <hi>Germans</hi> commonly call <hi>Pallatrock,</hi> or by contraction <hi>Palt rock. Diodorus</hi> ſaith, that they uſe to weare Rings on all their fingers, and without diſtinction: <hi>Plinie</hi> in his naturall Hiſtorie <hi>lib.</hi> 33. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſaith, that they wore them onely on their middle finger.

For two foreine Cohorts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Duraſſius,</hi> ſo that the Citizens were left deſtitute of all helpe. But as the favour and aide of men did decreaſe, ſo the Citizens courage did increaſe. For they tooke an oath altogether, that they would ſuffer all extremities in the defence of their Country, rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates of their Citie, to their malicious enimies. <hi>Monluccius</hi> being certified by one of the Captaines of the army, called <hi>Fontgravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> both of their want of munition, and the ſmall number of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, marcheth thither in all haſt, and the enimies in the third watch of the night did aſſault the Walls in three places with Scaling ladders, and Musket ſhot. In the meane time while the Citizens ranne to defend that part of the Wall, a ſtrong band of Souldiers well armed without making any noiſe, came to the Fortreſſe of the Ialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, thinking ſo to come upon the watch unawares, becauſe the Citizens were buſie in fight elſewhere. But they in the watch Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er having diſcover'd them before they could approach to the Walls, cryed out that they were diſcover'd, they clapt ſealing ladders to the Walls, and made a breach in them with an iron Ramme, which 12. men drove againſt the Walls, and ſet up two Colours or Bonners on the Bulwarke, with the ſound of Drum, Trumpets, crying out to their companions that followed, that the Citie was taken, but yet the Towneſmen encountred them ſo bravely, that they were enforced to ſound a retreate with the loſſe 200. men, and to leave their Ranime and ſcaling Ladder, there being but one ſlaine of the beſieged. But ſeeing that cunning ſtratagems did not prevaile, they determined to beſiege the City the third time. Firſt <hi>Terrida</hi> came and brought 21. Cohorts with him two wall peeces of Ordnance, and 7 Colverins: which being planted againſt divers parts of the Wall did batter it ſhroudly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all in vaine, ſeeing that men, women and children run cheerefully to repaire the breaches, and brought earth and other Materials to mend them, which ſucceded ſo well, that although the enemy had made 500. ſhot againſt the walls, yet there were but 5. men

The inhabitants doe complaine of the temper of the ayre, ſometimes for cold, and ſometimes for heate. And yet the Lake, and the River <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> are almoſt never frozen over. Moreover the heate is not ſo violent, as in the <hi>Delphinate,</hi> nor the cold ſo ſharpe as in the low Countries, where Rivers are uſually frozen over. The ſoile is fit for tillage and fruitfull; for it hath abundance of Grapes, Wheate, Peaſe, Rapes, Cauly-flowres, French-beanes, Melons, Leekes, Onions, Lentills: Alſo Barley, Hay, Oates, and other graines.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Rhetians</hi> are accounted an auncient people by the conſent of all men. For ſome ages before Chriſts birth the <hi>Tuſcians</hi> being beaten by the <hi>French</hi> out of their owne habitations, under the conduct of their Captaine <hi>Rhetus,</hi> ſeated themſelves in an <hi>Alpine</hi> Country, which was called from their Captaine, <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and they themſelves <hi>Rheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But whereas this Countrie was heretofore very large, and that the name of the <hi>Rhetians,</hi> for warlike matters grew famous amongſt their neighbours, ſo that they were a terrour unto many which <hi>Ovid</hi> declareth in this verſe:
<q>

                  <l>The <hi>Thracian</hi> armes, now every where,</l>

            </p>
            <p>At length being conquered by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they made two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of it, namely the firſt, and the ſecond <hi>Rhetia</hi>: which did not onely containe the <hi>Alpine</hi> Countries, but a great part of <hi>Suevia</hi> and <hi>Bavaria.</hi> Now by this name we underſtand thoſe people, whom they call <hi>Griſones,</hi> for their griſely habit which was made of their owne Countrie cloth; but the <hi>Germains</hi> at this day doe call them <hi>Grauw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntner,</hi> who doe inhabite the ancient <hi>Alpine Rhaetia,</hi> neere to the Spring-heads of the River <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Oenus,</hi> who are perpetually joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together by a threeſold tye of amitie, and confaederacie. The firſt confaederacie, which is called the higher, hath eighteene aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in it, among which the chiefe heretofore were, <hi>Diſentinus</hi> the Abbot, the Barons of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and the Earles of <hi>Miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Although they that now poſſeſſe the Caſtle of <hi>Rhaetia,</hi> doe challenge that title, from the <hi>Plantinian</hi> familie.

The ſecond confaederacy is called the houſe of God, or <hi>der Gotthuſs bunt,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Biſhopricke and Colledge of <hi>Curienſe</hi>; it hath 21. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions or partnerſhips in it, which are ſometimes contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eleaven greater. The Citty <hi>Curia</hi> is the head of this confaederacie,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:14932:219"/>
and hath a ſpeciall Commonwealth; not unlike unto <hi>Tigurinum.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them the chiefe partnerſhips, are <hi>Ingadinus,</hi> and <hi>Bregalianus,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Territories</hi> are the heads of the Rivers <hi>Atheſis</hi> and <hi>Oenus.</hi> The third confaederacie hath 10 Iuriſdictions, the firſt whereof is <hi>Davo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> ſo called from the Towne <hi>Davoſium,</hi> in which is the Court for this confaederacie, and the <hi>Aſsiſes</hi> for all the juriſdictions are held.

And ſometimes they haue entred into other confaederacies, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this perpetuall confaederacie. In the yeare 1419. the Biſhop and the <hi>Curienſian</hi> Colledge made a league with the <hi>Tigurinians</hi> for 51. yeares, having formerly entred into ſocietie with the <hi>Glaronians.</hi> The <hi>Rhaetians</hi> alſo of the higher confaederacie, did a long time joyne themſelves with the <hi>Vrians</hi>; and the confaederates of the houſe of God, did joyne themſelves in perpetuall league, with the 7 <hi>Cantons</hi> (as they call them) of the <hi>Helvetians.</hi> He that deſireth to know more concerning theſe matters, let him have recourſe to <hi>Sprecherus</hi> his <hi>Rhaetia,</hi> and <hi>Egidius Scudius</hi> his <hi>Rhaetia,</hi> and <hi>Simlers Helvetia.</hi> I will onely adde, that the length of <hi>Rhaetia</hi> at this day, if it be taken from the South, unto the North, is about 15 <hi>Rhaetian</hi> or <hi>Germaine</hi> miles, accounting 8000 paces to every mile; the breadth of it from the Eaſt to the Weſt, is thirteene miles, or there abouts.</p>

               <p>I Have hitherto faithfully deſcribed the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> now I come to the Low Countries, being my deareſt and Native Country. And firſt to begin with the name. Some would have this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> the which is now called the Lower <hi>Germanie,</hi> to be called <hi>Belgium</hi> by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in which he writeth that he billited three Legions, and <hi>Hircius</hi> foure. But <hi>Marlianus</hi> and <hi>Glaroanus</hi> doe take it for a Cittie not for a Country. But <hi>Vegetius</hi> will hardly beleeve that one Cittie can containe five Legions. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his fourth booke, that many Citties were comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Belgium,</hi> where he ſaith that they did inhabite the Sea coſt of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> who paſſed over out of <hi>Belgium,</hi> to get ſome prey and bootie, who were all called after the names of thoſe Citties, from whence they came. But yet he doth not underſtand by <hi>Belgium</hi> all <hi>Gallia Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gica.</hi> For in the ſame booke, he doth diſtinguiſh the <hi>Nervians,</hi> the <hi>Morimans,</hi> and <hi>Eſsuans,</hi> who are people of <hi>Belgica,</hi> from <hi>Belgicum.</hi> Therefore it ſeemeth by <hi>Ortelius</hi> that he calleth a part of <hi>Belgica Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and that part moſt likely which is toward the North, which doth containe <hi>Holland, Zeland, Flanders, Gelderland,</hi> and <hi>Cleveland.</hi> Some call that <hi>Belgica</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> maketh the third part of <hi>France</hi>: which name ſome doe derive from a famous Cittie in this Countrie, others from <hi>Belgius,</hi> a certaine Captaine of the <hi>Belgians,</hi> and others from other occaſions. <hi>Hadrian Iunius,</hi> ſuppoſeth that it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <hi>Belgium</hi> from the fierceneſſe of the Nation, being named <hi>Belgae</hi> as it were <hi>Velgae,</hi> that is, fierce and violent; or elſe they were called <hi>Belgae</hi> by changing of the ſecond vowell into the firſt, as it were <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi> from their hotneſſe and proneneſſe to fight: for <hi>Balgen</hi> ſignifies to fight.

It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Netherland,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> call it <hi>Le Pais Bas.</hi> It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo almoſt throughout all <hi>Europe</hi> by the figure Synecdoche, that is, by taking a part of the whole, <hi>Flanders,</hi> either in regard of the power and beauty of that Country above the reſt, or for the chiefe and famous Mart Townes, or the ancient Faires kept at <hi>Bruges</hi>; or laſtly becauſe it is better knowne, and is neerer to <hi>France, England, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Italie.</hi> And ſo much concerning the name, the ſituation and quantitie followeth. The bounds of Lower <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Belgium</hi> (for theſe words I will uſe promiſcuouſly) are on the North the <hi>Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>: on the South <hi>Lotaringia, Campania,</hi> and <hi>Piccardie</hi>: on the Eaſt the Rivers <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Moſa</hi>; on the Weſt the Sea. Theſe Princes are neighbours unto it, the Earle of Eaſt <hi>Friſeland,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Trevers,</hi> and the King of <hi>France.</hi> This is the ſituation: the quality of the ſoyle followeth, which ariſeth from the Climate. Low <hi>Germany</hi> is under the middle of the ſeaventh and all the eight climate, betweene the degrees of longitude 22 and an halfe, and 30, and betweene the degrees of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 48, and a halfe, and fiftie three and a halfe. The longeſt day in Summer towards the middle of the Climate is 16 houres long, and at the beginning of the ninth climate, it is 16, houres long, and three quarters. It containeth all the Parallels, which are betweene 16 and 21, the Aire in the Low Countries is moiſt, yet wholeſome to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. The ſummers are delightfull, pleaſant, and temperatly hot: they have not too much heate, nor no great ſtore of flies and gnatts, nor ſildome any thunder, or earth-quakes. The winters are long and windy, and when it is a North or Eaſt winde, it occaſions ſudden froſts: but when the winde is in the South or Weſt, the ayre is more milde, and the cold is turned into raine. The ſoyle for the moſt part is ſandie and gravelly, as a great part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all <hi>Brabant,</hi> it is reaſonable fertile in producing corne, and other fruites, and ſome places are very fertile, as <hi>Zeland, Flanders, Hann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It produceth alſo all kindes of fruites in great plenty, as Apples, Peares, Prunes, Cherries, Mulberies, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Apricockes, Filberts, Medlars, and in ſome places Cheſnuts. And heere is abundance of Madder gathered for Dyers, and a great gaine is made of it, by tranſporting it into other Countries. There are no metall Mines of any great note: As concerning the trees; they doe yeeld a pleaſant proſpect, ſtanding thicke and very orderly, and

being loaden with fruite, and beſides they ſerve for fire-wood and timber for building of houſes, being very high and wondrous thicke, and there are great ſtore of them here. There are few Bay-trees, and Cypreſſe trees. There are alſo great ſtore of Teile trees common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Lindon, which are like to Elmes in ſhape, and leaves, but they be bigger and doe ſooner come forward. For in 16, or 18, yeeres they will be as big as a mans middle. They uſe them alſo in building: and they make coales of them which are better to make gunpowder than Willow coales. Betweene the Barke and the wood there is a kinde of downe like Cotton, of which they make roapes and cordage. But many beaſts will not eate the leaves thereof though they be new budded forth.

There is alſo another kind of tree which is not found any where elſe, which is like a white Poplar, the inhabitants doe call it in the plurall number <hi>Abeelen.</hi> There is great ſtore of them in <hi>Brabant,</hi> which ſerve for divers uſes, eſpecially at <hi>Bruxels.</hi> The Low Countriemen may prayſe the goodneſſe of their ſoyle for bringing up of Cattell. For Oxen, horſes, ſheepe, and great heards of cattell are bred there. And eſpecially great, ſtrong horſes fit for ſervice in the warres. There are alſo the beſt Oxen, eſpecially in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Frieſland,</hi> where an Oxe often waigheth a thouſand and two hundred pound waight. <hi>Ludovicke Guicciardine</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> unto whom our Country is much beholding for making an accurate and true deſcription thereof, ſaith that the Earle of <hi>Mech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> had an Oxe given him which weighed two thouſand, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and eight and twentie pound, which he cauſed afterward to be painted in his Pallace.

Ludovicke Malanus</hi> Earle and Lord of <hi>Flanders, Nivernia, Raſtella, Salina, Antuerp,</hi> and <hi>Mechlin,</hi> and after his Mothers death, Earle of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and <hi>Arteſia,</hi> marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> by which marriage he came to be Duke of <hi>Brabant, Limburg,</hi> and <hi>Lotaringia.</hi> By his wife he had one onely daughter, who was the inheritrix to her fathers Lands, who in the yeare 1369. at <hi>Gandave</hi> married <hi>Philip Valeſius</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> who for his ſingular Valour, was ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Bold.</hi> He lived 70 yeares, and dyed at <hi>Halla</hi> neere to <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,</hi> in the yeere of Chriſt, 1404. He left theſe children behind him, <hi>Iohn, Antony,</hi> and <hi>Philip Valeſius: Catharine, Mary,</hi> and <hi>Margaret.</hi> All of them did encreaſe their Patrimonie by marriage. <hi>Catharine</hi> married <hi>Lupoldus</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria: Mary</hi> married <hi>Amedees</hi> Duke of <hi>Sabaudia: Margaret</hi> married the Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Hannonia, Antonius Vaſelius</hi> was made by his father Duke of <hi>Brabant, Lota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringia,</hi> and <hi>Limburg,</hi> he married <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> by whom he had theſe ſonnes, <hi>Iohn</hi> who married <hi>Iacoba</hi> Counteſſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> both Dukes of <hi>Brabant. Antonius,</hi> and his younger brother <hi>Philip Valeſius,</hi> were ſlaine in the <hi>French</hi> warres neere <hi>Teroana</hi> in the yeare 1415. <hi>Antonius</hi> his ſonnes, dying after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without iſſue, left their Vncle <hi>Iohn Valeſius,</hi> their heyre, and <hi>Iohn Valeſius,</hi> who was called the <hi>Vndanted,</hi> being the elder brother, ſucceeded his father in the yeare 1404, and obtayning by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Nephewes death many large poſſeſſions, was miſerably and unjuſtly put to death, in the yeare 1419, by <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> with whom he alwayes lived in continual enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hoſtilitie. He left theſe children, <hi>Philip, Margaret, Iſabell,</hi> and <hi>Catharine. Philip</hi> ſurnamed the good or godly ſucceeded his Father, in the three and twentyeth yeere of his age, in the Dukedome of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> the County of <hi>Flanders, Burgundie, Arteſia,</hi> in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhip

of the Empire, of <hi>Salina,</hi> and <hi>Mechlin.</hi> He at <hi>Atrebatum</hi> made a league with <hi>Charles</hi> the 7 and with the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and freed him out of priſon, having beene five and twenty yeares priſoner in <hi>England,</hi> and payd his ranſome, and gave him his ſiſter <hi>Mary</hi> to wife. He after the death of <hi>Theodericke,</hi> Earle of <hi>Murcium</hi> was made heyre of this Countie: and after the death of <hi>Philip,</hi> he had the Dukedome of <hi>Brabant, Lotaringia,</hi> and <hi>Limburg</hi>: and after the death of <hi>Iacoba,</hi> he had the Counties of <hi>Hannonia, Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Frieſland</hi>: And alſo the Dukedome of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> came to him by his wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the widdow of his Vncle <hi>Antonius</hi>: ſo that it came to paſſe, that the large and rich Provinces of both <hi>Burgundies,</hi> of <hi>Brabant,</hi> of <hi>Limburg,</hi> of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> of <hi>Arteſia,</hi> of <hi>Hannonia,</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> of <hi>Zeland,</hi> of <hi>Namurcium,</hi> of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> of <hi>Mechlin,</hi> and the Marquiſhip of the Empire were all ſubject to <hi>Phillip</hi> the good. Hee had to wife <hi>Iſabell,</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Portugall</hi>: he lived ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty two yeares, and dyed in the yeare 1457, leaving one ſonne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bold,</hi> to be heyre unto ſo many Provinces, who did not onely keepe his fathers Empire, but alſo enlarged it, by joyning unto it <hi>Gelderland, Zutphania,</hi> and the <hi>Iuliacenſian</hi> Dukedome. And this is that <hi>Charles</hi> who was the Grandfather of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who was borne in the yeare 1500 of <hi>Ioane</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the wife of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi>: which <hi>Phillip</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by his mother <hi>Mary</hi> the daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> the bold; under whom, theſe Provinces which before had many Lords, being united, grew to be one body, and now they are commonly called the Low Countries. Long ſince the Low Countrimen were accounted brave ſouldiers. And <hi>Caeſar Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Commentaries,</hi> concerning the <hi>French</hi> warre, doth call them the valianteſt of all the <hi>Gaulls.</hi> For he writeth thus. The valianteſt of all the <hi>Gauls</hi> are the Low Countriemen, becauſe they care not for trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of attire, and merchants have not frequent recourſe unto them, and therefore thoſe commodities are not brought to them which doe effeminate the minde; and they are neere to the <hi>Germaines,</hi> who live beyond the <hi>Rhene,</hi> with whom they wage continuall warre; by which reaſon alſo the <hi>Helvetians</hi> doe exceede the other <hi>French-men</hi> for valour, becauſe they have dayly skirmiſhes and fights with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> when either they drive them forth out of their borders, or they doe make inroades into their Territories. And hence wee may collect their ſtrength and courage in defending their liberties, that in the time of <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> they endeavoured to ſhake off the <hi>Romaine</hi> yoke of ſubjection. And ſo they muſtred &amp; joyned armies to contend with them. The <hi>Bellovacians</hi> ſet forth 6000 ſouldiers, the <hi>Sueſſones</hi> 5000, &amp; the <hi>Nervians</hi> (who were then ſo wilde and uncivill, that they would not ſuffer Merchants at that time to bring them wine or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) did ſet forth 5000. The <hi>Atrebatians</hi> and <hi>Ambianians</hi> did ſet forth 10000, the <hi>Morineans</hi> five and twentie thouſand. The <hi>Menapians</hi> 60, thouſand. The <hi>Caletians</hi> 10 thouſand; the <hi>Velocaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Veromanduans,</hi> did ſet forth 10 thouſand a piece: the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaticians</hi> 18, thouſand: the <hi>Condruſians, Eburonians,</hi> and <hi>Caemani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:14932:223"/>
40 thouſand. So that the whole ſumme of choyſe Souldiers was 273 thouſand, as <hi>Oroſius</hi> witneſſeth: or as <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe delivers, their number was 368 thouſand, whereby it appeareth that the Low Countrie men were alwayes noble Souldiers. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his Commentaries ſaith, that it was they alone who in our fathers time did vexe all <hi>France,</hi> and did keepe out the <hi>Teutomanes</hi> and <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> out of their <hi>Territories</hi>; whereby it came to paſſe, that the memorie of their atchiuements, did make them valiant and full of courage in Militarie affaires. And forreine armies have found it in our age, who being freſh ſouldiers and joyning battell with the old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they found that the Citizens, Countrymen, and Sea-men, were al ſtout of courage. There are 17 Provinces in the low Countries, all of which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did poſſeſſe: in which there are 4 Dukedomes, the Dukedome of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Limburg,</hi> which together with the Countie of <hi>Dale</hi> and the Lordſhips of <hi>Valckenburg,</hi> and <hi>Rode le Duc,</hi> is joyned to <hi>Brabant,</hi> and it dependeth on the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie of <hi>Brabant</hi>: alſo the Dukedomes of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> and <hi>Gelderland.</hi> There are 7 Counties, <hi>Flanders, Arteſia, Hannonia, Holland, Zeland, Namurcium</hi> and <hi>Zutphania</hi>: alſo the Marquiſhip of the holy empire, which hath foure principall Citties, <hi>Nivella, Lovanium, Bruxelis,</hi> and the <hi>Metropolis Antwerpe</hi>; it is now a part of <hi>Brabant.</hi> There are five Lordſhips, or Signiories, of <hi>Weſt-Frieſland,</hi> of <hi>Mechlin,</hi> of <hi>Vltrajectum,</hi> of <hi>Tranſ-Iſaliana,</hi> and <hi>Groneland.</hi> There are many Citties, in the Low Countries, which are well fortified, the number whereof as alſo of the Townes and villages you may finde in <hi>Mercator.</hi> But the chiefe Citties are <hi>Lovaine, Bruxells, Antuerpe, Silva Ducis, Gandavum, Bruges, Hipra, Mechlinia, Cameracum, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trebatum, Tornacum, Valencena, Inſulae, Dort, Harlem, Amſterdam, Lugdunum Battavorum, Namurcum, Neomagum, Trajectum</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. There is a great company of Lakes, Pooles, and Marſhies, in the Low Countries, which doe not onely hold great ſtore of fiſh, but doe alſo fortifie thoſe Countries, againſt the invaſion of enemies. Few Rivers doe riſe in this Country, but many Rivers, which have their ſpring head farther off, doe glide through it, and doe much enrich it. The chiefeſt are <hi>Rhene, Moſa, Scaldis, Amiſis</hi>: the leſſer are <hi>Moſella, Liſa, Aa, Sambra, Dela,</hi> and many others. Wee will ſpeake of <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Amaſis</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and wee have ſpoken of <hi>Moſella</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> now we will deſcribe the reſt. <hi>Moſa</hi> doth flow out of the Mountaine <hi>Vogeſus,</hi> which is ſituate on the borders of the <hi>Lingonians,</hi> not farre from the Fountaines of <hi>Araris</hi> and <hi>Matrona,</hi> and ſo running Northward it glideth by the Church of Saint <hi>Theobald,</hi> or Saint <hi>Tibaut,</hi> where it beginnes to be navigable: from thence it ſlideth to <hi>Virdunum,</hi> and from thence bending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Caecia,</hi> it runnes ſtraite forward to <hi>Moſa</hi> and <hi>Maſeriacum.</hi> From thence turning Northward, it viſiteth <hi>Carolomont, Boviniacum, Dinantum,</hi> and <hi>Namurcum</hi>; and there growing wider by the receipt of the River <hi>Sabis,</hi> it turneth it ſelfe Weſtward, and ſo having view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hoium,</hi> and <hi>Leodium,</hi> and glided by <hi>Trajectum,</hi> and <hi>Stochemum,</hi> it paſſeth by <hi>Ruremunda</hi> and <hi>Venloium</hi>: where turning Weſt-ward it

And Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions delighting in this ſweete freſh water are allured to come up the River, and ſo are eaſily taken; which doth not happen to other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe they entring the Sea with a quiet gentle ſtreame, their water preſently becomes ſalt, as <hi>Seyne, Iberus Thames,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Rivers. On the contrary, <hi>Eridanus, Tiber, Rhodanus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumna,</hi> and other Rivers which runne into the Sea with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doe in like manner as <hi>Moſa</hi> allure and entice the Sturgeons to come up into them, but not in ſo great Plentie. Beſides, the Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions which are taken in the Rivers <hi>Moſa</hi> and <hi>Rhene,</hi> are greater and more pleaſant in taſte than thoſe in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. They are of a ſilver ſhining colour, of a great bigneſſe. There are ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which do waigh above 400 pound. <hi>Guicciardine</hi> doth report, that he ſaw in the Market at <hi>Antwerp</hi> a Sturgeon of 420 pound waight, &amp; that it was above 12 feete of <hi>Antwerp</hi> long: and on another day in the morning he ſaw 70. Sturgeons together, the leaſt of which was above five foote long. This fiſh is firſt ſeene in <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and it is found three moneths together or longer, during which time great ſtore of them are taken. And from hence tranſported into other Countries, eſpecially into <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalted up, and ſo kept from putrifying; &amp; alſo at other times, all the yeere through, they take leſſer ſturgeon, which are delicate in taſte. Out of this, being enticed by the freſhwater, they come up into the mouth of the River <hi>Moſa,</hi> in which there are very fatte Salmones, Trouts, which are taken here all the yeere long, alſo <hi>Lampreys, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letts, Congers,</hi> and other kinds of excellent fiſh, which here for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſake I omit. But this is wonderfull, that thoſe fiſh are bad if they be taken in the Sea, but very good and fat, when they enter into freſh water. Beſides, this River doth naturally breed beſides other fiſh, Trouts, Lampries, ſome greater &amp; ſome les, but more delicate in taſte. <hi>Schaldis</hi> which <hi>Ptolemie</hi> calls <hi>Thahuda,</hi> the Low countriemen <hi>Schelt,</hi> the <hi>French Eſcault,</hi> doth riſe in <hi>Veromanduum,</hi> neere Saint <hi>Martines Abby,</hi> as they call it, where it gently ſlideth betweene <hi>Caſtellet,</hi> and <hi>Beau-revior,</hi> two <hi>French</hi> Fortifications, &amp; ſo runneth to <hi>Cameracum:</hi> thence going toward the Country of <hi>Hannonia,</hi> it watreth the noble Citty of <hi>Valence</hi>: and afterward growing navigable, having received the River <hi>Hania,</hi> it glideth by the <hi>Condatum</hi>; and afterward being enlarged by the receipt of the River <hi>Scarpa,</hi> it vieweth S. <hi>Amandum,</hi>

Moreover the tyde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth up into this River, even to <hi>Gandauum,</hi> which is thirty miles from the mouth of it, if you count them by the winding courſe of the bankes. There doe come up into this River Sturgeons, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones, Troutes, great Lampreys, Turbotts, Congers, Cuckow fiſhes Mullets, Crabs, Lobſters, Sardins, and many moſt delicate fiſh, which come up out of the Sea into <hi>Scaldis,</hi> and doe there feede, and caſt their ſpawne; ſo that for two or three monethes, betweene the Spring and the Summer, beſides the greater fiſh, there is taken ſo great a number of ſmall Frie, that many men doe live by them. Alſo many Sea Dogfiſhes, and Porpoiſes doe come up this River, which two land of fiſhes doe not caſt forth any ſpawne, but doe bring forth their young ones perfectly formed. The Dogfiſhes doe bring forth their young on the Land, and doe ſuckle them with their dugges, untill they are growne to a good bigneſſe. Moreover, this River without the helpe of the Sea, doth yeeld divers kindes of fiſh all the yeere long, of which theſe are the chiefe: Pikes, Barbells, Tenches, Carpes and Breames of an unuſuall bigneſſe, ſo that they doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, weigh 20 pound, alſo Gudgeons, and many other kindes of fiſh both great and ſmall. Alſo divers kindes of Eeles, and Crabbes, and in the mouth of the River, there are ſome Oyſters, which come thither out of the Sea. And therefore this River for multitude of fiſh and variety, is not inferiour not onely to any River of <hi>France,</hi> but alſo of all <hi>Europe.

And I paſſe over alſo the Torrents, and greater Rivers, leaſt I ſhould be tedious to the Reader; which doe not onely yeeld great ſtore of fiſh, but are alſo an ornament and fortification to the Country, and are very convenient for the paſſing of commodities to and fro. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people by the helpe of theſe Rivers making Sluces and Dams to ſtay the water, doe afterward digge channells for ſome miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after letting the water into them doe make them navigable: ſo that there is no Cittie which hath not great Barkes, which come up unto it. But this Countrie hath but few fountaines, or Springs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except in the Mountainous places. And thus having ſhewed the Rivers that are in the Low Countries, it remaineth that wee ſhould ſpeake ſomewhat concerning the Ocean: ſeeing in regard it is ſo neere unto it, it may be counted not only a member of this Province, but the chiefe head thereof. I ſay therefore that the Ocean is wide and large, and in rough weather, it is fearefull and terribly furious: for ſome times when tempeſts happen, the waves goe ſo high, that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:14932:225"/>
it doth overflow and drowne whole Countries: and eſpecially it breaketh oftentimes in about the coaſt of <hi>Zeland</hi>: but the inhabitants doe caſt up trenches and bankes, which do prevent the danger which might enſue thereby: unleſſe when a weſterne winde doth contend and blow againſt the ſpring tide. The windes which doe moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſea, and thereby doe endanger the Countrie, are the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, the Weſt and the South windes. Alſo it is much troubled at the New Moone or Full-moone, and the two Aequinoctialls, at which time (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth) the Sea doth ſwell very much. For every new Moone, and full Moone, wee ſee that there are ſtill the greateſt tides and greateſt tempeſts. Theſe tides doe produce ſome good, and ſome evill effects. As for the former, it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the water (as common experience doth teach us) and will not ſuffer it to corrupt: and alſo it maketh ſhips ſayle more ſpeedily. For as <hi>Vegeſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. concerning Military matters, <hi>Cap.</hi> 42. <hi>Haec reciprocantis meatus ambiguitas curſum Navium ſecunda adjuvat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardat adverſa</hi>: that is, Thoſe tides if they be with a ſhip, doe haſten her courſe, but being againſt her doe foreſlow and ſtay her courſe. The other evill effects, are the inundations, and violent irruptions of the Sea: For the Ocean doth ſometimes come up into the land with ſuch violence, that it driveth backe great Rivers, and doth overflow ſpacious fields, as we ſayd before. <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> doth write as much, and the miſerable experience of many ages doth confirme it. But ſo much concerning theſe things. And now having ſpoken of the Detriment and loſſe, which ſome Countries of this Province doe receive by the Ocean, when it is rough and troubled, we muſt ſpeake ſomewhat of the commodities, which the whole Province doth reape by it, when it is quiet and peaceable, which commodities are ſo many and ſo great, that if they ſhould want them, the Country could not ſuſtaine the halfe part of the inhabitants. And hence it comes to paſſe, that this Province is as it were the Haven and Mart of all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that there is an infinite multitude of Merchants and Factors, and as it were a confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of inhabitants and forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Beſides, the Ocean bringeth many commodities to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as Herring fiſhing, and other fiſhings, which ſerve not onely to ſatisfie the voluptuous deſires of the rich, but alſo to ſuſtaine the poore: and the inhabitants doe not onely get their foode, but all their wealth by it. For the over-plus of that which they take, doth furniſh a great part of <hi>France, Spaine, Germany, England,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: yea great ſtore of barreld ſalt-fiſh is ſent even into <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Salmones and Herrings. Now there are three kinds of fiſh which they ſalt, namely Herrings, Codfiſh, and Salmones. But firſt we will ſpeake of their Herring fiſhing of which they make a great commodity. Herrings are found in no River, nor in the <hi>Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea, nor the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> nor any other Sea, but onely in this Northerne Ocean: their bigneſſe, forme, and goodneſſe is ſufficiently knowne. And when they goe out of the Northerne Sea, which is alwayes in the Spring time, as if they fleeted from their owne native quarters, and went to ſeeke ſhady places, they come in ſuch great ſhoales, that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:14932:225"/>
no Nets can hold them, but that they breake through them, and do even darken the face of the Sea. And many broade bottom'd veſſells, which they call <hi>Buſses,</hi> are ſet out from <hi>Holland, Frieſland, France, Brittaine,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; and doe all to avoyd contention, fiſh in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts, and quarters, either about <hi>England,</hi> or the Coaſts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Orcades.</hi> Theſe fiſhes are unbowelled alive if it may be (for aſſoone as they are out of the Sea waters they are dead) by one who hath good wages for doing it; and then another ſalts them, and ſo they are preſently barrelled up, and afterward ſold; afterward the Herring men and Coupers doe ſalt them anew, and take out the Pilchers which have no Milts nor Rowes, they are barrell'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with new pickle: afterward they are ſurveyed by men ſworne for that purpoſe, and ſo ſealed up, in like manner as <hi>Diana's</hi> Prieſt did ſeale up red Vermilion, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth. And theſe are the firſt kind of Herrings which with <hi>Plautus</hi> we may call ſalt or pickled Herrings: the other ſort are thoſe which are lightly ſalted; and ſo dryed in the ſmoake, being as yellow as gold, whence they call them <hi>Soretum,</hi> becauſe they call a red colour in their language <hi>Sorus.</hi> This Herrng fiſhing is very commodious and advantagious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> ſeeing not onely one Citty, but many Citties doe wholy depend and live on it, and the Citty and Country get their food by it, pay their debts, maintaine families, and doe get wealth by it. There is another ſpeciall kind of fiſh which they uſe to ſalt, called in Latine <hi>Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llus Major,</hi> or Cod-fiſh, thereby to difference it from that which is commonly ealled <hi>Caballian.</hi> It is a great fiſh, ſo that ſome of them are threeſcore pound weight. It is taken at many times of the yeare, but eſpecially in Lent time, and chiefely in the <hi>Frieſland</hi> Sea, and great ſtore of it is uſually ſalted up, whereby the whole country reapeth yeerely great profit. The third kind of ſalt fiſh is Salmon: being very good when it is freſh as well as ſalted. <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi> have ſtore of this kind of fiſh, in all moneths, but moſt plentie in <hi>Aprill, May,</hi> and <hi>Iune</hi>: of which there is ſuch great ſtore ſalted up, that the gaine which is made of them amounteth to 200000 crownes. But of theſe things enough, let us proceede to the reſt. The Low Countries are plaine and levell: there are few Hills in it, and fewer Mountaines, unleſſe it be in <hi>Lutzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Namurcum,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Hannonia,</hi> where they are very thicke, and there are many alſo in <hi>Leodium.</hi> It is every where beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Forreſts and Woods, which both grace the Countrie, and afford much pleaſure in hunting. The Forreſt of <hi>Arden,</hi> in <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> time, as he himſelfe writeth, was the greateſt of all <hi>France,</hi> running betweene the <hi>Treverians,</hi> from the River <hi>Rhene</hi> to the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> and the <hi>Rhenicans,</hi> being above fifty miles long. And now at this time no wood in all <hi>France</hi> can be compared with it: but now there is a great part of it converted into arrable ground, ſo that it is farre leſſer than it was: and that part which remaineth hath many glades made in it, which the husband men doe till, and call it by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name, but the greateſt part of it is from <hi>Theonis Villa</hi> even to <hi>Leodium,</hi> which is thirty miles in length. In the middle of it is
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:14932:226"/>
the Citty of S. <hi>Hubert,</hi> which as <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> witneſſeth, lyeth under 26 degrees of Longitude and forty minutes: and 50 degrees of Latitude, and 4. minutes. This Wood hath all kindes of pleaſant trees, which are very high, and broad-ſpreading, which afford both pleaſure and profit. <hi>Strabo</hi> calleth it <hi>Arduenna,</hi> the Inhabitants <hi>Arddenna; Rhenanus, Luitticherwald,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>Leodienſian</hi> Wood. <hi>Mormavia,</hi> or <hi>Morman,</hi> is a faire wood in <hi>Hannonia,</hi> which beginneth neere to <hi>Queſnoy,</hi> and ſo runneth out Southward toward the <hi>Veromanduans</hi>: and hath many Townes in it, and Villages, and many cleare ſprings and pleaſant Fountaines. Here is great ſtore of Charecoale made: whence ſome ſuppoſed that it is a Part of the wood <hi>Carbonaria,</hi> but ſome affirme that the wood <hi>Carboina</hi> did lye more Eaſtward betweene the Rivers <hi>Moſa,</hi> and <hi>Sabis</hi>; and that the pleaſant wood <hi>Archia</hi> is a part of it, in which there is a Towne of the ſame name, fortified with a ſtrong Caſtell, and there the Lords of <hi>Berlaymont,</hi> were wont to reſide: There is alſo in <hi>Hannonia</hi> the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant wood of Saint <hi>Amand,</hi> which is alſo called the <hi>Ramenſian</hi> wood, becauſe it is neere unto it. It beginneth on the edge of <hi>Flanders</hi> neere the towne of Saint <hi>Amand,</hi> whence it receiveth his name, and ſo runneth forth Eaſtward toward the <hi>Valeſians,</hi> with a great breadth. The <hi>Ramenſian</hi> wood belongeth to the Lord of <hi>Emerie,</hi> who is the chiefe ranger of <hi>Hannonia,</hi> which title belongeth unto him onely. <hi>Silva Faignenſis,</hi> or <hi>le bois de Faigne,</hi> beginneth in <hi>Hannonia</hi> neere <hi>Avenna,</hi> and reacheth even to <hi>Maſieris,</hi> which is ſixteene miles, though heretofore it were farre larger. It ſeemeth that it was ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the <hi>Fawnes</hi> and <hi>Satires,</hi> whom perhaps the Poets did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faine to have hornes, and Goates feete, becauſe the firſt inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Wood were ſo rude and ſavage, that they were like beaſts. The <hi>Sonienſian</hi> wood is three or foure flight ſhots off from <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and it runneth Southward toward <hi>Brenna,</hi> even to <hi>Alleuda,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Brenna,</hi> for three miles in length. It is a great ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wood, ſo that it is ſeaven miles compaſſe round about: and there are very may Citties, Towes, Abbies, and Monaſteries in it, ſo that in Summer time many of the Nobles, and wealthier Cittizens doe goe thither with their whole families for recreation ſake, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry three or foure weekes. <hi>Saventerloo</hi> is encloſed with <hi>Lovanium, Bruxells,</hi> and <hi>Vilvordia.</hi> It is a pleaſant wood, and receiveth his name from <hi>Saventria,</hi> a Towne lying neere unto it. Alſo <hi>Grootenhout</hi> is a Wood in <hi>Brabant,</hi> which ſtandeth not farre from <hi>Turneholt,</hi> in which the River <hi>Ada</hi> riſeth, which doth afterward diſcharge it ſelf into the River <hi>Natha.</hi> It is a great Wood, in which Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom <hi>Turnholt</hi> did belong, was wont to hunt much. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Marlaigne,</hi> a Wood in <hi>Namurcum,</hi> which beginneth neere the Cittie <hi>Namurcum</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and runneth Southward toward <hi>Phillipolis</hi>: and ſo reacheth even to <hi>Moſa. Niepa</hi> is a chiefe Wood in <hi>Flanders,</hi> not farre from the confines of <hi>Arteſia,</hi> it is two miles diſtant from the River <hi>Liſa,</hi> from the Caſtell of the <hi>Morineans</hi> and <hi>Baliolum</hi>: it is a pleaſant, ſpacious and ancient Wood, having a ſtrong Caſtle in it. Alſo <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen</hi> is ſituate in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and extending it ſelfe Northward in a great
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:14932:226"/>
breadth, it doth containe many Villages &amp; ſome Abbies. <hi>Poodsbergia</hi> is a great wood, between <hi>Flanders</hi> &amp; <hi>Hannonia,</hi> not far from <hi>Gerardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montium</hi> and <hi>Leſsina,</hi> and is pleaſant in regard of the roundnes of it. <hi>Gulielmi Silva,</hi> or <hi>Williams</hi> Wood is ſituate in <hi>Arteſia,</hi> nere <hi>Rentiacum</hi> where the Emperour joyned battell with the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the yere 1554. <hi>Engelerwallia,</hi> is a pleaſant wood in <hi>Gelderland</hi> nere <hi>Arnhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi> The 7 woods, are 7 great woods, which are nere unto the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilanians,</hi> from whence one part of <hi>Fieſland</hi> is denominated, which is now called <hi>Sevenwolden,</hi> that is to ſay, 7 Woods: every one of them is very ſpacious &amp; hath many faire towns in them. But ſo much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the woods. I come now to the publick works. There are in theſe Countries innumerable magnificent Temples, and Churches, many Abbies, infinite numbers of Monaſteries, &amp; Friaries, many Hoſpitalls for ſtrangers, for the ſick, for the poore &amp; for Orphans. Truly in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> only there are 42 ſuch like buildings: the chiefe of which is the Cathedral Church of S. <hi>Mary,</hi> which is very ſpacious, having a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Steeple, which is 400 &amp; 20 foote high, being built of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the top whereof you may view the Cittie, the River cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſhips, and the Countrie round about which is full of Townes and Citties. What ſhould I deſcribe the other Temples, Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſuch like places, of which there are great ſtore both heere and in other Citties and Townes? What ſhould I reckon up the ſumptuous Pallaces belonging to Dukes, Earles, and Noblemen? Or what ſhould I mention the other publicke or private buildings? for if I ſhould endeavour to reckon them up, I ſhould ſooner want time than matter; wherefore it is better to be ſilent, than to ſpeake too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. The politick ſtate of theſe Countries both in generall and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall is threefold: the firſt is the Eccleſiaſtick ſtate, in which the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots are the chiefe, the ſecond is of the Nobility, as the Duks, Earles, Marcgraves, Princes, Barrons, and great Lords. The third is of the Citties, which the chiefe Citties of every Country doe repreſent. Theſe ſtates the Prince calleth together, when they are to conſult concerning matters appertaining to the Prince, or to the Principality, or to the preſervation or utility of the Countrie. The Eccleſiaſticke ſtate is thus; there are foure Biſhops in the Low Countries, the <hi>Camaracenſian,</hi> the <hi>Tornaycenſian,</hi> and the <hi>Atrebatenſian</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe three are under the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and the <hi>Vltrajectine</hi> who is under the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Colen.</hi> I proceed to the Vniverſities, which are 4, the Vniverſitie of <hi>Lovaine,</hi> and <hi>Doway,</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Flankford. Lovaine</hi> is famous for the many Colledges, Students, and learned men; the chiefe Colledges are <hi>Lilium, Caſtrenſe,</hi> the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Porus</hi> and <hi>Falcon,</hi> in which Philoſophie is read. The <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidian</hi> Colledge hath three languages taught in it, namely, Greeke, Latine, and Hebrew. This Vniverſitie, at the requeſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Brabant,</hi> was firſt inſtituted and adorned with Priviledges by <hi>Iohn</hi> the 4, Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> in the yeare 1426. <hi>Martinus</hi> the fifth being Pope. The other were erected in our memory. Out of which as it were out of the <hi>Troian</hi> horſe innumerable learned men have proceeded, and doe dayly come from thence. For in the Low
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:14932:227"/>
Countries there are learned men, skilfull in all faculties and ſciences: and as heretofore, ſo now it produceth famous Schollers; whom it would be too tedious to reckon up. Here are divers Libraries in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places, which are repleniſhed with excellent rare Bookes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which that at <hi>Leyden</hi> is the chiefe. The inhabitants are faire, quiet, not cholericke, nor ambitious, nor proud: not much given to venerie; civill, plaine, curteous, affable, ingenious and ready, witty, and ſometimes talkative: laborious, induſtrious, faithfull, gratefull towards thoſe that have done them a curteſie, capable of all Arts and Sciences, ſtout in defending their liberties, and Priviledges even to death. And this may truely be ſpoken in the generall prayſe of them, that the Low Country men are frugall houſe keepers and thrifty huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: who following the example of the Ant, do lay up before win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that which cannot then be gotten; and doe buy fiſh and fleſh, which they either pickle up, or doe dry it in the ſmoake. For every houſe, according to the number of their familie, doth kill in Autumne an whole Oxe, or provideth halfe an one, beſide a Hogge, which they ſalt up, and then it will ſerve them to ſpend a good part of the yeare, untill the Spring returne againe. Yet many of them are very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and deſirous of wealth. The Women are beautifull, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd and curteous. For according to their Country faſhion, they are uſed from their childhood to converſe familiarly with every one: and therefore they are very ready both in action or ſpeech or any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: neither doth this freedome or liberty make them leſſe honeſt. Neither doe they onely walke alone through the Cittie, but they will goe for fellowſhip to the next Townes, without any the leaſt ſuſpition of diſhoneſtie. They are very continent, and apt and ready in their affaires. And they are not onely carefull of houſhold matters, of which their husbands take no care, but they alſo uſe Merchandiſe, and diſpatch and conferre of buſineſſes belonging unto men: and that with ſo great dexterity and diligence, that in many of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> the men do commit all their affaires unto them. And by this manner of living, joyned with the innate deſire which women have to rule, they become for the moſt part too Imperious and proud. It is the faſhion both among Princes, and men of inferior ranke, as alſo among other Nations, on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to give the firſt born their Parents names, althogh they be yet living. And the Noble of what quality and condition ſoever they are, doe more eſteeme of their eldeſt daughter, than the reſt of the younger, although they have all an equall dowry: ſo that they marry the reſt to thoſe unto whom they denyed her in marriage, reſerving her for a better husband. And they are to be prayſed, becauſe they eaſily contract marriages with forrainers, if occaſion ſo require, and are not bound to match them in their owne Country, which is a matter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable and commodious: for theſe alliances by marriage are very advantagious to themſelves and the Commonwealth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is accounted undecent and abſur'd, for young men to marry old women, or on the contrary for old men to marry young maydes: as alſo for a noble perſonage to marry an ignoble perſon, or a maſter
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:14932:227"/>
to marry his Maide, and a Miſtreſſe her ſervant. But the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men are chiefely given to Mechanicke Arts, but not of the baſe and ſervile ſort, but the more nobler, as weaving, clothing, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of hangings, &amp; tapeſtry, which ſerve not only for the uſe of their owne country: but are alſo tranſported into <hi>France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and alſo into <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affricke.</hi> For Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, there is no Nation that doth excell it, nor none doth excell in Muſicke, or for variety of Languages. <hi>Iohn Eickius</hi> a Lowcountry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, did firſt ſhew the way how to mingle colours with oyle. And every one in <hi>Flanders, Brabant,</hi> or <hi>Zeland,</hi> can ſpeake not onely their owne Country ſpeech which is Low-Dutch, but alſo <hi>French.</hi> The Sea men, Merchants, and Schollers, can ſpeake alſo <hi>Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> for the moſt part: and ſome can underſtand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Arabicke</hi> language. The Lowcountrie men are alſo skilfull Seamen. I come to their food, the Lowcountrymen doe uſe Wheate, Rye, Oates, and Barly: they eſteeme of no pulſe but Beanes, and Peaſe: they have few Vetches and no Millet at all. For the great ſtrong windes doe lay it, and ſpoyle it. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people maintaine their families ſoberly and frugally. Their drinke is for the moſt part Beere, which is made of Malt, into which they afterward put ſome ground Barly, and Hops. And this is a very good and wholeſome drinke for thoſe that are uſed to it; they doe alſo drinke much milke. The rich have wine. They eate commonly Rye bread. They are wont alſo upon Feſtivall dayes, eſpecially thoſe which beare their owne name, to make great feaſts, and to invite their Parents, Kinſemen, and friends unto them, and to banquet ſumptuouſly with them, and to ſhew themſelves generous and magnificent. They keepe their houſes very neate and cleane, being furniſhed with all kinds of neceſſary houſhold ſtuffe. And truly it is a faire ſight to ſee what ſtore of houſholdſtuffe they have, and how well ordered it is, and how cleane it is kept; in which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it doth excell all the Nations of the World. But the Low Countriemen are too much given to the Vice of drinking, in which they take great delight, ſo that oftentimes they never give over drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king day nor night; and thereby beſides other inconveniences, they do much wrong their bodyes and witts: and without doubt it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the cauſe of their untimely death, according to that of <hi>Properti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>:

There were in the Haven of <hi>Sluce</hi> 2 Block-houſes, the one in the very mouth of the Haven commonly called <hi>de Haſe ſchantſe,</hi> the other is ſeated not farre from the Towne common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd <hi>Beck-of</hi>: the former whereof was yeelded to <hi>Grave Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> and the latter taken by force. Over againſt this Cittie is a ſmall Iſland which the inhabitants call <hi>Cadſant,</hi> in which there is a Towne of the ſame name. It was heretofore much larger, having a Cittie in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neere unto which at ſeverall times there have beene many ſea fights: when either the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> the <hi>Batavians,</hi> or any other enemies to <hi>Flanders</hi> did arrive heere. But this Iſland is more than half worn away by the tempeſtuous Seas, &amp; by the tides and ebs thereof.

               <note place="margin">Ardenbug.</note> and was heretofore the Metropolis of <hi>Flanders,</hi> containing <hi>Tourout</hi> and <hi>Oſtburg,</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> (which were not then walled,) and all the Sea coaſt even to <hi>Bononia.</hi> But now it is all waſted. It hath a Church conſecrated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which is the faireſt and moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in all <hi>Flanders.</hi> There is alſo <hi>Middleburrough,</hi>

There is alſo <hi>Damme</hi> two miles from <hi>Sluce,</hi> which is a very rich Towne, being very populous, and full of Merchants, and a great Haven for wines,<note place="margin">Damme.</note> being a key of the Sea, in regard that it did ſhut and open the Ocean, both to thoſe of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and to all Merchants. But now by the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>French,</hi> and the civill diſſentions of the <hi>Gandavians</hi> and <hi>Brugians,</hi> and having loſt the recourſe of Merchants, it is now but like a Towne or Village, and the Haven is a digged Channell, being onely navigable at a full tyde, three <hi>Flanders</hi> miles, even to <hi>Sluce. Bruges</hi> followeth, which we deſcribed before, with the Territorie of the <hi>Francones</hi> or Free-men, becauſe they did ſhake off the <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans</hi> Yoke, and freed themſelves from it: and contayneth all that ground which lyeth eight miles round about <hi>Bruges,</hi> and is commonly called <hi>'t Landt Vanden Vryen</hi>; it hath juriſdiction over many free Townes.

There came hither eight great Whales in the yeare 1404, every one of them being 4 foote long. Alſo in the yeare 1426, there was a great Sea Hogge taken, being like unto a Land-Hogge but that it was greater. But in the yeare 1099. and in the yeare 1200, in the Archduke <hi>Alberts</hi> time, the <hi>Flandrians</hi> to reſtraine the incurſions of the enimie, did ditch it round about, and yet they could not hinder their inroades, although it were entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with 17 Baracadoes and <hi>Bulwarkes,</hi> as the Bulwark or Fort of S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> of <hi>Iſabell,</hi> of <hi>Albert,</hi> of <hi>Clara</hi>; wherfore the <hi>Flandrians</hi> were very deſirous to beſeige this Cittie, which they attempted on the 5 of <hi>Iuly</hi> the yere 1601. The beginning of the ſeige was very terrible, and continued ſo to the end thereof, as it is well knowne; yea it was ſuch a long and grievous ſeige, as there was never the like in the memory of man, ſo that during the time of this ſeige, there were ſlaine on both ſides about 110000 men. There was a Table book found about a certaine commiſſary of <hi>Spaine</hi> being dead, in which the number of men that were ſlaine, were ſet downe, and the number of women and children by themſelves: of which this was the totall ſumme: Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes or Praefects of the Souldiers, commonly called Marſhalls of the field 9. of Colonells 15. of Sergeants 29. Captaines 165. Ancients 322. Lieutenants 200 and 1, maſters of the Horſe 101. Common-ſouldier 54663. Mariners 611, children and Women 119.

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:14932:233"/>
other matters. Moreover, there was a battaile fought betweene <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> on the ſecond of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the yeere 1600, between the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> and <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> in which there were ſlaine on both ſides ſeaven thouſand foote and horſemen.

After him there ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Archbiſhopricke <hi>Divus Bonifacius,</hi> who together with 52 more ſuffered Martirdome at <hi>Doccomum</hi> in <hi>Frieſland.</hi> But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the grievous <hi>Norman</hi> perſecution, the Archbiſhopricke was tranſlated to the <hi>Agrippine Colonie.</hi> But afterward it was reſtored by King <hi>Pipin,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who did not onely dignifie the Cittie with the auncient honour of the Biſhopricke, and gave the Biſhop temporary power and meanes to defend himſelfe againſt his enemies; which temporary power was ſo large, that it did almoſt containe all <hi>Batavia.</hi> Truely it is manifeſt that the Countrie of <hi>Tranſ-Iſalana,</hi> and <hi>Groninga,</hi> were ſubject to this Biſhopricke, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven untill the yeare 1527, when <hi>Henry Bavarus,</hi> being much injur'd did commit himſelfe to the Protection of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; and that he might recover his Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, did paſſe over all his temporall power unto him: of which when hee had certified <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was Governeſſe of the Low Countries at that time, it was agreed that the Earle of <hi>Hoogſtrat</hi> ſhould come to <hi>Trajectum,</hi> on the 15 of November, where the Biſhop of <hi>Vltrajectum,</hi> did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and freely reſigne up to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, as Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> and alſo to his lawfull Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, all his temporall ſtate and juriſdiction in <hi>Vltrajectum</hi> and in <hi>Tranſ-Iſalania</hi>: which being done, the Biſhop did free his ſubjects from their oathe of alleagiance which they had taken a little before;

The Church of S. <hi>Audomare</hi> was heretofore called <hi>Sithin,</hi> as <hi>Meyerus</hi> witneſſeth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it was called S. <hi>Omer,</hi> from S. <hi>Audomar.</hi> This <hi>Audomar,</hi> was biſhop of the <hi>Morineans</hi> about the yeare 1570, and built a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie there neere the River <hi>Aa.</hi> This Cittie excelleth both for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and populouſneſſe of the Cittizens.

It flouriſheth with all kinde of commodities, as corne and other things which are neceſſary to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine mans life, and fit to be tranſported. <hi>Aria</hi> is ſeated by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Liſa,</hi> which runneth through the middle of it, it is two miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Teroana,</hi> being a faire Towne and well fortified. It hath an auncient Caſtell, and neate buldings. There is alſo <hi>Heſdinunt,</hi> which is a ſtrong fortreſſe againſt <hi>France,</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> after he had raced the Towne which was of the ſame name, builded by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the warre that was betweene the moſt powerfull Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is conveniently ſeated on the banke of the River <hi>Canchia,</hi> one mile neerer towards <hi>France,</hi> being foure miles diſtant from <hi>Monſtrolium,</hi> and 5 from S. <hi>Paul.</hi> It is watered alſo with another Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, commonly called <hi>Blangis,</hi> from the place where it ſpringeth. So that in regard of the convenient ſituation thereof, it is accounted a ſtrong Fortreſſe, and in regard of the lawes and Priviledges which auncient <hi>Heſdinum</hi> did enjoy, it was ſoone repleniſhed with inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. Neere to S. <hi>Omers</hi> there is a Lake, full of fiſh, in which there are floating Iſlands, which with a rope tyde to the trees growing thereon, or with long poles may be ſhou'd and drawne up and down: like thoſe which <hi>Plinie</hi> mentioneth to be in <hi>Lycia,</hi> called the <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae.</hi> Neither are there ſmall pieces of Land; for Oxen &amp; other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

            <p>This Dukedome hath two Marquiſhips under it, ſeaven Counties, many <hi>Baronies,</hi> and Lordſhips, and great ſtore of Noble men, ſo that no Province doth produce ſo many. All of them doe live magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and are curteous, vertuous, conſtant, and faithfull to their Prince. Their exerciſe is Armes and hunting. They live civilly and courteouſly together, viſiting one another in mutuall kindneſſes. They contract marriages with their neighbours, and in their matches they doe more reſpect honour and dignity than portion. If any one doe commit an enormity, he loſeth his credit, and is not admittted to converſe with the Nobles, and is thought to be unworthy of any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke office, and his oath is not eſteemed in publicke trialls. If any controverſie doe ariſe amongſt them, they referre it to certaine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators, who are to compound and end the matter, ſo that they have no great uſe of Lawyers and Proctors: yet they are too much given to wine. And the Country people doe complaine very much of their hard uſage and ſervitude, ſo that if a Country-man intend to put forth his children, he cannot doe it without his Lords leave, which is farre different from the libertie of the Low Countries. <hi>Arlunum,</hi> which we mentioned before, is ſituate on the top of a Mountaine, and is foure miles diſtant from <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> and ſixe from <hi>Mommedy.</hi> It was ſometime a faire Towne, but ſomewhat defaced by the violence of warres. <hi>Rodemachera</hi> is three miles diſtant from <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> which though it be no great towne, yet is very beautifull, and fortified with a ſtrong Caſtell. <hi>Theodonis-villa,</hi> which in <hi>Dutch</hi> is called <hi>Dieten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe,</hi> is very conveniently ſituated on the left hand bancke of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Moſella</hi>: it is foure miles from <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> having a faire bridge; it is a pleaſant ſtrong Towne and well fortified againſt the invaſions of enemies. <hi>Regino</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was uſed to hunt very much neere unto this Cittie. <hi>Gravemakerum</hi> and <hi>Koninck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makerum</hi> are ſmall little Townes neere <hi>Moſella,</hi> being a mile diſtant one from another, and 5 miles from <hi>Lutzenburg.

Firſt <hi>Ivoſium</hi> which is 12 miles from <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> and foure from <hi>Mommedy,</hi> being heretofore a good ſtrong Town, but at laſt <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt it round with an Armie in the yeare 1552. and tooke it; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a peace being made, it was reſtored backe againe to <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but the walls were ruinated as at <hi>Teroana,</hi> and a law was made that it ſhould not be walled in againe. <hi>Chinium</hi> is 12. miles from <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> which is unwalled, but by degrees it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified. It hath a County belonging to it, although it be ſubject to the Archdukes, and hath a large juriſdiction over ſome townes and Villages, neither is it ſubject to the Dukedome of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> but is joyned unto it.

from the great <hi>Deluge,</hi> which drowned all the world: when <hi>Noah</hi> parted the world among his three children: at what time (that I may ſpeake nothing of <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Cham) Europe</hi> fell to <hi>Iaphets</hi> ſhare.

The longeſt day in ſommer in the Southerne parallel is fifteene houres long and an halfe: in the Northerne Parallel, it is ſeaventeene houres long and a quarter; and albeit <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> is in a cold ſharpe climate, and <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth that it is alwayes winter in <hi>Germanie</hi>: yet it hath a temperate ayre, which though it bee ſomewhat cold, yet it is healthfull and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>The ſoyle yeeldeth Barly, Wheate, Rye, Mill, Oates, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindes of corne and pulſe. The fields and Meddowes are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the ſoyle is every where very fertile, and yeeldeth great ſtoare of Corne. <hi>Germanie</hi> alſo hath rich Mines of Silver, Braſſe, Iron, Lead, and other mettals, and in ſome places of gold: ſo that for mettalls it is inferiour to no Countrie. There are alſo many excellent Salt pitts. <hi>Plinnie</hi> alſo ſaith, the Cadmian ſtones, the Callais, the Cryſtall, the Onyx, the Topaz, and the Adamant; are found in <hi>Germanie.</hi> Alſo the hearbes.

            <p>What, ſhould I mention the wines? which are of an excellent taſte and colour? Truely there are excellent wines every where; but yet in ſome places better than in others. Heere is alſo great variety of living creatures, and great ſtoare of Cattell and wilde beaſts, which I will not ſpend time to reckon up. <hi>C. Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> writeth, that many kindes of wilde beaſts are bred in the Wood <hi>Hercynia,</hi> which are not ſeene in any other place; of which (ſaith hee) thoſe that differ moſt from the reſt, and are moſt worthy of remembrance are theſe: there is a kinde of Oxe which is like a Hart, which hath in the middle of his forehead one high horne, and more ſtraite than uſuall, from the toppe whereof large Antletts or Tines doe ſpread forth; the male and femall are of one ſhape, and have one as bigge hornes as the other. There is alſo a beaſt called Alcis, which is like unto a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ate, but it is ſomewhat bigger, and having no hornes at all, and their legges are without joynts, ſo that they cannot by any meanes lye downe to their reſt, or if they fall downe by chance, they cannot riſe up againe; therefore they leane againſt trees, and ſo they take their reſt: and when the hunters have found by their
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:14932:270"/>
footing where they uſually haunt, they either ſtub up all the trees, or elſe they cut them halfe downe, and ſo leave them ſtanding: So that when the beaſts reſt againſt them according to their uſuall manner, they overthrow the trees with their weight, and ſo fall downe with them. The third kind of beaſts are thoſe which are called <hi>Vri,</hi> which are almoſt as bigge as Elephants, and like Bulls in ſhape and colour: they are very ſtrong, and ſwift, and will prey on men and beaſts: theſe they uſually take in trappes, and ſo kill them. But now I come to the auncient government. The ſacred Romaine Empire, which being divided into the Weſt and Eaſterne part, was much weakned by the excurſions of divers Nations, and rent by civill diſſentions, was ready to be ruined by its owne weight; having forſooke <hi>Italie</hi> did ſeeke defence and ſtrength in no other Countrie but <hi>Germanie,</hi> and choſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Great King of <hi>France</hi> to be Emperour, who as they report, was borne at <hi>Ingelheimij,</hi> which is a village Towne two miles from <hi>Moguntiacum,</hi> and built there a famous Pallace, whoſe ruines may be yet ſeene.

There are alſo many other famous Rivers, which doe either runne into the Sea or into ſome greater River, which I paſſe over leaſt I ſhould be tedious. Now I come to the <hi>Germaine</hi> Sea. For ſeeing we purpoſe to deſcribe al <hi>Germanie,</hi> we muſt add ſomthing concerning the Sea, which waſheth the ſhore thereof. But in regard we have entreated otherwhere more largely concerning the Sea, and
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:14932:272"/>
eſpecially in the generall deſcription of <hi>Belgia</hi>: we will ſpeake firſt concerning the tide of the Sea, and afterward we will reckon up the properties of the <hi>Germaine</hi> Sea. It is manifeſt that the Moone is the cauſe of the tides of the Ocean. But as the Moone hath divers chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in her motion, ſo the tides doe alſo change. For they following the Moone, doe flow twice betweene the riſing thereof, and doe ebbe twice in foure and twentie houres: ſo that the Seas doe flow twice, and ebbe twice every day: they flow when the Moone aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth above the Eaſterne <hi>Horizon,</hi> and do ebb when it declineth from the <hi>Meridian</hi> weſtward; and it floweth againe when the Moone goeth downe under the earth, and commeth to the contrary part of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,</hi> and ſo likewiſe it ebbeth untill it riſe againe. But as the Moone does not alwayes riſe at one time, and in one place, but every day ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in another place than it did before: ſo the tides doe not flow at certaine houres, but at that time when the Moone paſſeth through the Poles of the heavens. Moreover it is to bee noted, that the full Moone doth move the Sea in another manner than the halfe Moone. For this <hi>Luminarie</hi> hath greater force when it is at the full, than when it is weake, and in the waine. We uſe to call thoſe tides which are at the full of the Moone <hi>Sprinckuloedt,</hi> that is, a Spring-tide. Which <hi>Agel Lib.</hi> 14. concerning the Ocean, doth elegantly call the Moones companion, ſeeing it followeth the age and increaſe thereof; and alſo he noteth ſome aſpects, and configurations: As for example ſake, if the Moone have a fit aſpect unto <hi>Venus,</hi> and doe run through moiſt houſes, it doth wonderfully increaſe the tides of the ſea: but if it be aſpected with <hi>Mars,</hi> or dry Planets, it doth leſſen the tides. Here alſo the aſcention of the ſignes is to be noted. But if the Moon be in ſignes of a right aſcenſion, it maketh the tides longer than if it were in ſignes of oblique aſcenſion: for it is obſerved that the tides are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver equall to the ebbes in continuance of time; but when the Moone is in the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> ſignes and hath no Latitude. Beſides, ſome parts of the water doe finde a greater influence proceeding from the beames of the bodie of the Moone, either in regard of the rectitude and ſtraightneſſe of the beames, or ſome other hidden qualitie. But the Moone hath a different influence when it is Northward, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it is Southward; for when it is heere it encreaſes the tides on the Southerne ſhoares, and when it is there, on the Northerne ſhoares. Moreover the Tides of the Sea are greater in ſome places, and in other places very ſmall or none at all. For as concerning this our <hi>Germaine</hi> Sea, it is certaine that there are ſcarce any tides which can be perceived, but as the Sea is carried with the windes, it floweth now here and now there: for when it is an Eaſt wind, the Sea goeth very high, and driveth backe Rivers, neither doth it flow onely to the Sea ſide, but it overflowes the Land. And whereas the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and <hi>Atlanticke</hi> Ocean is of an unſearchable deapth, ſo that a line of three hundred or foure hundred fathom cannot found the bottome of it, yet the <hi>Germaine</hi> Sea, in the moſt parts is but 60. Cubits deepe and never above an hundred Cubits, except on ſome ſhoares of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> which are thought to be of an inſearchable depth. Moreover it
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:14932:273"/>
is worthy to be mentioned, that whereas all other Seas are bitter and ſalt, our Sea hath ſweete waters and not unpleaſant to drinke, and that in regard that many great freſh Rivers doe runne into it out of the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Mountaines, and becauſe the Sunne is too weake in thoſe places to exhale and draw up the lighter and thinner parts of the water, which ſome make to bee the chiefe cauſe of the ſaltneſſe of the Sea. Which reaſon if it were good and probable, then the <hi>Amalchian</hi> Sea alſo, and the <hi>Chronian</hi> Sea ſhould not be ſalt, which is otherwiſe. Wherefore it is rather to be held that the melted ſnow, and the aforeſayd Rivers flowing downe out of the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, doe make this Sea cleere and ſweete. Whereby it comes to paſſe, that other Seas doe more eaſily carry veſſells of great burden, than this. And the reaſon is becauſe the water of the ſalt Sea is of a thicker ſubſtance, while the thinner waters doe yeeld to the leaſt waight. It is eaſier alſo to ſwim in this Sea than in others. Yet it maketh Sea men more ſicke, in regard the waves goe very high, ſo that ſometimes they ſeeme to touch the Clouds, and then fall againe and breake into deepe valleyes. This Sea in divers places, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers appellations, or names; For ſometimes it is called the <hi>Germaine</hi> Ocean, from <hi>Germanie</hi> which is neere unto it, and it reacheth from the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sea, which lyeth Weſtward, even to <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> in the Eaſt. It is alſo called the Northerne Sea, the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> Sea, the <hi>Balthick,</hi> the <hi>Codanian,</hi> the <hi>Suevian</hi> Sea, &amp;c. And ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sea.

But of theſe things enough, I paſſe to other matters: The publicke and priuate workes doe follow, among which (to paſſe by others) is the Church at <hi>Argeutoratum,</hi> famous for the neate ſtructure and building, having a very high Tower. So that it is the eighth miracle of the world. This Church was founded in the yeare of Chriſt 1015. But in the yere of our Lord 1277, in the time of the Biſhop <hi>Conrade</hi> of <hi>Liechtenberg, Erkuinus</hi> of <hi>Steinbach</hi> an <hi>Architect</hi> began to build the Tower, being a famous worke; ſo that there is not the like, either in <hi>Germanie, Italy,</hi> or <hi>France</hi>; it was built up to the toppe in ſeaven and twentie yeeres. It is built even from the foundation to the toppe, of free ſquare ſtone; it hath many open places to receive the ayre and the winde, and the aſcent and going up unto it is by foure ſtaires; but when the bredth of it begins to leſſen, and grow ſharpe towards the toppe, there are eight ſtaires. The very top of it which below doth ſcarſely ſeeme as bigge as a Buſhell, is ſo great, that five or ſixe men might ſtand upon it. The height of it is 574. <hi>Geometricall</hi> feete; there is alſo a curious and artificiall Clocke.

               </gap>r crafty, but doe diſcover their owne mindes and ſecrets, and very faithfull in keeping ſecrets committed to them. Alſo the Emperour <hi>Iulianus</hi> in his <hi>Miſopogne</hi> ſaith, that hee knoweth by experience that this Nation cannot flatter, but that they deale freely and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all men. <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> 11. <hi>Quadrip.</hi> ſaith, that they muſt needes be of a quiet and peaceable diſpoſition, in regard of the qualitie of the Countrie which they inhabit. Concerning their religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the mindes of men are held and bound together by the tye and feare of ſome Deity, the <hi>Germaines</hi> (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> writeth) doe uſe no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, they account them onely to be gods whom they ſee, and from whom they receive ſome benefit: as the Sunne, and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and the Moone. But afterward, as it appeareth in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who lived under the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Nerva</hi>; they had many other gods: as <hi>Mercury, Hercules, Mars, Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Berecinthia:</hi> alſo a certaine god called <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the aforeſaid <hi>Tacitus,</hi> maketh mention of the Temple of <hi>Tanfana,</hi> who ſaith that the <hi>Suevians</hi> doe reverence the mother Earth, which they call (as <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſaith) <hi>Aer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha.</hi> But <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> doe affirme that they had no Images in their Temples, but certaine holy women, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> calleth Soothſayers, and <hi>Agathias,</hi> and <hi>Polyoenus</hi> doe call them Propheteſſes, who did foretell future events, by the ſound, and courſes of Rivers. <hi>Aemilianus</hi> doth note, that they doe foretell things to come, by the flight of birds, by the inſpection of entralls, and all other ſignes. But they did chiefely reverence <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Teutates,</hi> and offered humaine ſacrifices thereunto, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth. In the time of peace there was no common Magiſtrate, but in the time of warre they did chuſe Governours. They ſpent all their life time in military affaires: and to rob was accounted no diſgrace, as we may reade in <hi>Caeſar. Seneca</hi> ſaith, that their chiefe delight was the warres in which they were both borne and bread. If (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth) they have peace any long time together at home in their owne Country, then they goe to the warres in other Nations. They cary about with them their mothers, wives, and children, who doe carry their knapſackes, and proviſion: neither are they afraide of plagues. They joyne battell with ſongs and warlike ſounds. They count it a great diſgrace to loſe their buckler in the field, ſo that many after the battle for griefe thereof have hang'd themſelves. <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> do report; that they will march over Rivers in regard they are lightly armed, and of an high ſtature. We reade in <hi>Appian</hi> that
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:14932:274"/>
they doe contemne death, being perſwaded that they ſhall live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine hereafter. They obſerve the rites of matrimony, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their owne wives; ſo that few adulteries are committed; for which they have this preſent puniſhment: the woman that is taken in adulterie hath her haire cut off, and then her husband thruſts her out of doores before her kindred, and beates her along the Towne. Thus <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth. The Mothers doe nurſe their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and doe not put them forth to Nurſes. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, that they account it unlawfull to wrong a ſtranger, which commeth unto them upon any occaſion, ſo that they are ready to protect them from all injuries: their houſes ſtand open, and they eate one with another. And here good manners prevaile more, than good lawes in other places. The greateſt part of their food, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> mentioneth, doth conſiſt in milke, cheeſe, and fleſh. <hi>Plinny</hi> witneſſeth that they live by no other graine but Oates; and <hi>Mela</hi> addeth that in times of want they will eate raw fleſh. At dinners as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> witneſſeth, they have peeces of meate roaſted, and they drinke milke and wine. Their fare is homely, as the fleſh of wilde beaſts, Crabbes, or ſowre milke: their drinke is made of Barley and wheate, neither is there any Nation more magnificent in entertainment or in feaſting. But as no man or Nation is without ſome vice, ſo they count it no ſhame to drinke night and day. Concerning their habit, <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith that they all weare a kinde of Cloake button'd before, which looſely hangeth over their ſhoulders: the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Germaines</hi> did not weare a looſe garment but a ſtraite bodyed garment, ſuch as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> ſaith the <hi>French</hi> did uſe. The women doe goe in apparell like the men. Heretofore the <hi>Germaines</hi> were ſtrong of body, but rude, and ignorant of Arts. But now they doe make all kinde of excellent manufactures and workes, and moſt eſpecially they are skilfull in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of braſſe, and in the knowledge of mettalls. In this Countrie braſſe Ordinance and <hi>Printing</hi> were firſt invented, and the making of Clockes was found out: and laſtly, <hi>Germany</hi> is ſuch a Nurſery of all Arts, that it doth perfect ſome, and findeth out other Inventions.

The greater are thoſe that doe inhabit the Biſhopricke of <hi>Bremes</hi>: the leſſer are the <hi>Embdanians</hi> and <hi>Oldenburgians.</hi> Foraſmuch as <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemie</hi> ſeateth them betweene the River <hi>Amiſis,</hi> and <hi>Viſurgis</hi> his words are theſe: They ſaw alſo in the North, the Nation of the <hi>Chaucians,</hi> who are called the greater, and the leſſer, where the Sea floweth up every day and night, ſo that it is doubtfull whether it be Land or Sea. Where the miſerable people do get upon high hils, and their cottages do flote when the Sea commeth in, and doe ſeeme like ſhipwrackes, when it ebbeth backe againe. They have no Cattell nor milke as their neighbours have, nor can they kill any wilde beaſts becauſe there is no ſhrubbes, nor harbour for them. They make thred of Bulruſhes and reedes, to weave fiſhing Netts, and ſo making a fire with a little dryed mud, they boyle their meate, and warme themſelves. Their drinke is raine water which they keepe in tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches before their houſes. In this manner the <hi>Chaucians</hi> lived heretofore. But now they are much changed, for now the Countrie doth afford foode not onely for the inhabitants, but alſo for the neighbour Countries. But heretofore it was a rude unhabited place, ſo that <hi>Plinnie</hi> never mentioneth that Corne or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other fruites did grow heere; but now where is there greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?<note place="margin">The fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Soyle.</note> It had heretofore no fruittrees, but now it beareth all kindes of trees. They had heretofore no Cattell nor Milke, but where is greater plenty now? For nature hath given them a champion Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, full of faire Meddowes, being of a fat ſoyle, and having many pleaſant paſtures, which are well repleniſhed and ſtoared with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable flockes, and heards of Cattell. Which appeareth by that wonderfull great plenty of excellent good Butter and Cheeſe, which is made here, which to the great gaine and benefit of the inhabitants
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:14932:277"/>
is tranſported to divers Countries, and through all <hi>Germanie.</hi> Alſo the fertilitie of this Countrie appeareth by the fat and great Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, which many thouſands doe graze within the Meddowes, and doe grow ſo fat, that forraine Nations doe much eſteeme of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides heere is excellent hunting. So that this Countrie is now of ſo rich a ſoyle, that it needeth no ſupply from neighbour Countries; for it hath ſuch ſtoare of horſes, Oxen, Cattell, Hogges, Wooll, Butter, Cheeſe, Barly, Oates, Wheate, Beanes, Peaſe, and Salt, ſo that it doth yeerely tranſport great plentie thereof to the Countries round about it, and thoſe which are more remote. Moreover the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the third, <hi>Anno</hi> 1465, when this province was governed by divers Praefects, did make it a Countie, and gave it to one <hi>Vdalrich.</hi> Afterward it had Earles continually even untill our time. There are two walled Citties in that Countie, <hi>Embda</hi> and <hi>Arichum. Embda</hi> or <hi>Embdena,</hi> commonly called <hi>Embden,</hi> is the chiefe Cittie of this Countrie, and a famous Mart Towne, ſeated by the mouth of the River <hi>Amiſis,</hi> having a convenient Haven, the Channell whereof is ſo deepe, that great ſhips may come in under ſayle: ſo that for wealth, for the publicke and private building, and for the multitude of Cittizens, it is known not onely in <hi>Germanie</hi> but alſo in all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> One of the chiefeſt Ornaments is the Earles ſumptuous pallace, the great Church, and the Praetors houſe. Heere is wonderfull plenty of all things, both for neceſſity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which the Haven, and the conveniencie of importation of goods, and alſo the naturall fertilitie of <hi>Frieſland</hi> doth yeeld. The Cittie is ſo called from the River <hi>Ems,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> calleth <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> The other Cittie is <hi>Aurichum,</hi> which is a pleaſant retiring place for the Nobilitie, in regard of Woods and Forreſts, in which they doe freely recreate themſelves, with Hawking and hunting. The Cittizens are rich, and doe give themſelves either to merchandiſe or ſome mechanicke trade. There are an infinite many of Caſtells and Townes in this Countie. And ſuch a number of Villages, that one doth even joyne upon another. The moſt whereof both for faire houſes, large ſtreets, and populouſneſſe, may compare with ſome Citties of <hi>Germanie.</hi> Neither doe ruſticke people or husbandmen onely live in them, but alſo Merchants, and divers kinds of artificers and ſome of the Nobility: There are alſo two other Counties which are ſubject to the Earle of <hi>Embda, Eſenſis,</hi> and <hi>Ieverenſis,</hi> ſo called from their chiefe townes: the Countrie <hi>Ieverenſis</hi> is ſituated beyond the River <hi>Iada</hi> Weſtward, and doth containe eighteene Villages. On the North, where the River <hi>Viſurgis</hi> doth diſcharge it ſelfe into the Sea, theſe two Iſlands doe lye againſt it, <hi>Wangeroga,</hi> and <hi>Spikeroga,</hi> which are for the moſt part unhabited.

But ſeeing that after they had beene many times ſubdued, they were yet ſtubborne and refractory, and did violate the oath which they had taken, he thought it meete to chaſtiſe their inſolencie, by puniſhing ſome, to the feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of others. Therefore he conſtituted certaine Iudges, and gave them power to examine and puniſh perjur'd perſons or raſh ſweares, or thoſe that were guilty of any fact, without hearing them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any plea in their owne defence. This ſharpe ſeveritie made the <hi>Weſtphalians</hi> both fruitfull and obedient, when they ſaw that Noblemen, and men of great eſtates, were hang'd up in the Woods by Martiall law, without any triall. <hi>Aeneas Pius</hi> writeth, that this kinde of Iudgement did continew even untill his time, and that the ſecret rites, were obſerved, by which they judge delinquents, and offenders, and doe puniſh the guilty whereſoever they are found,

I paſſe by the other Townes for brevitie ſake, becauſe I intend to ſpeake ſomething concerning the Dukedome of <hi>Meckelburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dukedome of <hi>Meckelburg,</hi> was heretofore a part of a Province belonging to the King of <hi>Vandalia,</hi> lying neere unto the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, but now it is one of the chiefe Dukedomes of <hi>Germanie</hi> and a member of the Empire: it hath on the Eaſt <hi>Pomerania</hi>: on the Weſt the River com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>de Elve</hi>: on the South it hath the auncient <hi>Marca</hi>: on the North, the <hi>Balticke</hi> Sea. It is a very fruitfull Country, abounding with Wheate, Apples, Wood, and Fiſh. There are alſo divers ſorts of living creatures, and great ſtore of Oxen and Cattell, and wilde beaſts. Moreover <hi>Aritbert</hi> being deſcended of the royall ſtocke, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lived ſome while in <hi>Charles</hi> the Greats Court, marryed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſiſter, by whom he had <hi>Billingus,</hi> a man powerfull yet milde and mercifull, whom the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> even from <hi>Viſtula</hi> to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgis,</hi> and from <hi>Odera</hi> to <hi>Holſatia</hi> did obey; he had his Pallace at <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelburg.</hi> But his two ſonnes <hi>Mizilaus</hi> and <hi>Miſlevus</hi> degenerating from their fathers piety and goodneſſe, began to perſecute the Chriſtians. But concerning theſe and other Princes of <hi>Meckelburg</hi> you may reade <hi>Munſter.</hi> The firſt inhabitants of this Country, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors doe call <hi>Herulians</hi> or <hi>Obotritians,</hi> and by a generall word <hi>Vanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> It is a Country well repleniſhed with citties, townes, caſtles, and villages. In this Dukedome there is the auncient cittie <hi>Surinum,</hi> which was built before <hi>Lubecke, Sundius,</hi> and <hi>Wiſmaria.</hi> The figure thereof is foureſquare, and ſo as if it were foure citties, it hath foure names. The firſt is called <hi>Senerinus,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Neapolis,</hi> the third is named from the <hi>Cataract,</hi> the fourth from the Marſhes. The Village <hi>Fichela</hi> which ſtandeth by the Lake <hi>Suerinus,</hi> is but 5 miles diſtant from the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke</hi> Sea: the vicinitie whereof made them beſtow much labour in vaine to make a ditch out of the Lake into the <hi>Balticke</hi> ſea, as in like manner there was an attempt made, to cut through the <hi>Peloponneſian Iſthmus. Roſtochium</hi> commonly called <hi>Roſtocke,</hi> and heretofore <hi>Laci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> and corruptly <hi>Rhodopholis</hi> and <hi>Laciburg,</hi> is a ſea cittie: it was firſt a caſtle, after, <hi>Godſcall</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Endo</hi> did change it into a cittie; and afterward it was enlarged by <hi>Primiſlaus</hi> the ſecond, the ſonne of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottus.</hi> It hath now a flouriſhing Vniverſitie, which the Princes of <hi>Meckelburg</hi> did erect and conſtitute in the yeere 1415. The ayre here is wholeſome, and there is great plenty of proviſion for food, and very cheape. There is alſo <hi>Wiſmaria,</hi> which ſome imagine was ſo called from <hi>Wiſmarus</hi> King of the <hi>Vandalls,</hi> in the flouriſhing reigne of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great: ſome doe affirme, that a <hi>Colonie</hi> of the <hi>Gothes</hi> was brought thither out of <hi>Viſbina,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Gothland.</hi> But <hi>Crantzius</hi> Antiquities, and Charters of the commonwealth, dated

after the yeare 1250, doe ſhew that it was built before the yeare 1240, out of the ruines of the great auncient Cittie <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> which gave the name to the whole Countrie, by <hi>Gunzelinus,</hi> Earle of <hi>Suerinus.</hi> But in a ſhort time, this Cittie did wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by the traffike and trading of other Nations, having a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Haven on the Balticke ſhore, to receive ſhippes of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where they may lye ſafely without letting fall any anchors: whence it is likely that the Cittie was named, from the ſafety and conveiance of the Haven. It is compaſſed round about with ſmall townes; who doe bring plentie of proviſion thither, and doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves againe from thence: Moreover this ninth circle of the Empire called <hi>Nider Saxon,</hi> doth conſiſt of three orders, the firſt whereof is the Clergie, the ſecond are the Princes and Secular Lords, the third are the free Citties. In the firſt there are the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops of <hi>Bremes</hi> and <hi>Magdeburg</hi>: the Biſhops of <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> of <hi>Suerinus,</hi> of <hi>Ratzenburg,</hi> and <hi>Schleſwick:</hi> the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Princes and ſaecular Lords: as the Dukes of <hi>Lauwenburg,</hi> of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> of <hi>Luneburg,</hi> of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> and of <hi>Holſtein</hi>: the Earles of <hi>Roffain,</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt.</hi> In the third there are the free Citties: as <hi>Lubeck, Hamburg, Mulhauſen</hi> in <hi>Duringen,</hi> and <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſen, Goſlaria</hi> and <hi>Gottinga.</hi>

            <p>Haſsia hath great ſtore of Nobilitie and Noble places, which it would be convenient to know; but I could diſcover nothing hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of them, nor of the ſtate of the government. I have onely found out that there are two Counties, Solms, <hi>30.15.50.35.</hi> and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſtein. <hi>30.17.50.50.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Dukedome of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> our method layeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Haſsia:</hi> It is doubtfull whence the name thereof is derived. Some from the Mountaine <hi>Heſſus,</hi> but this Mountaine is neither found in <hi>Haſsia,</hi> nor no where elſe, unleſſe it be that which is at <hi>Noviomagum,</hi> which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what likely. For ſome doe relate that one <hi>Bato</hi> the ſonne of the King of the <hi>Cattians</hi> (who both enlarged, reedified, and walled <hi>Novioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi>) had a ſonne called <hi>Heſus,</hi> who for the love of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, called it after his owne name. Whence alſo the Mountaine <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> was ſo called. Others would have it ſo named from the <hi>Cattians,</hi> who (as they report) did inhabit this Country, by changing the Letters, whence it is yet called <hi>Catzen Elbogen,</hi> which ſheweth the antiquitie of this Nation. <hi>Beatus Rhenanus, Li.</hi> 1. of the <hi>Germaine</hi> affaires ſaith, that the <hi>Heſſians</hi> comming out of high <hi>Gremanie,</hi> and having expeld the <hi>Catti</hi> did poſſeſſe theſe parts, and did call them after their owne name. This Country hath <hi>Turingia</hi> on the Eaſt, on the South <hi>Franconia,</hi> on the Weſt <hi>Weſtphalia</hi>: and on the North it hath the Dukedome of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> the Biſhopricke of <hi>Minden,</hi> and other Principalities. The ayre of this Countrie is wholeſome, having great plentie of wheate, pulſe, and fruite: But hath no Wine, except it be by the <hi>Rhene.</hi> There are alſo faire Meddowes for fatting of cattell, in which there are great heards of Oxen and young beaſts. The woods alſo are full of wilde beaſts, and eſpecially of Harts, which doe afford the Nobility good ſport in hunting. It hath alſo in ſome places Mettalls, as Braſſe, and blacke Lead. It hath no ſalt pits, but ſalt Fountaines. All the writers of our age are perſwaded that the <hi>Catti</hi> did formerly inhabite this Countrey, which was then a County, but now it is a Landgraviate, although <hi>Crantzius</hi> be againſt them, who in ſtead of the <hi>Catti,</hi> maketh them to be the <hi>Saxones: Ptolomie</hi> calls them <hi>Chattae</hi>; who afterward,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14932:314"/>
as <hi>Tacitus</hi> mentioneth did paſſe into the Iſland of <hi>Batavia,</hi> where ſome memory of their name doth ſtill remaine in two Townes of one name, the one by the Sea, and the other by the <hi>Rhene.</hi> Concerning their Etymologie the moſt learned <hi>Iunius</hi> writeth thus: The <hi>Catti,</hi> whom both ours and the former age did call <hi>Heſsians,</hi> were ſo named from <hi>Catts,</hi> in regard of fierceneſſe in aſſailing their enemies. For who knoweth not the violent fierceneſſe of that beaſt, which though it bee domeſticke; yet will flye in his throate, that perſues him cloſely: or elſe from their ſudden ſtratagems and ambuſhments by which they ſuddainely came upon their enemies as Catts doe leape upon the Mice. For ſuch the nature and diſpoſition of the warlike and fierce Nation of the <hi>Catti</hi> ſeemeth to be. Hither alſo may be referred the word <hi>Heſsius,</hi> which among the <hi>Hueſdenians</hi> doth ſignifie a Catt. Truely the vertue, and excellencie of this Nation doth no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more, than in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who for militarie diſcipline doth preferre them before the other <hi>Germaines,</hi> &amp;c.

This Cittie as if fortune an enemie to greatneſſe, meant to triumph over it, was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes burnt, ſo that no other great Cittie in <hi>Germany,</hi> was ever burnt ſo often as this: the laſt time that it was burnt, which was in the yeare 1472, it ſuſtained much loſſe, eſpecially in the Churches of the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> ſo that a third part almoſt of the Cittie was burned downe. This was a terrible fire, which began by ſome that were hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſet it on fire, of whom the chiefe was a Dominican. Two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Churches, as they call them, together with the Bridge, and a great part of the Cittie were all burnt downe. In the yeare of our Lord 1509 there aroſe a greivous ſedition betweene the Senate and the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Erford,</hi> occaſioned by thoſe unuſuall impoſitions which the Senate laid upon the Common people. For the Commons ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together, would needes know how much the Cittie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted. The Senate giving way to the tumultuous furie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, endeavoured to appeaſe them with faire and gentle words, telling them, that in convenient time they would bring in an account of their receipts and expenſes; which words quieted the Cittizens for a while. But when the day appointed came, they aſſembled themſelves together, and deſired the Senate to bring in their account. But then one more inſolent than the reſt, ſpoke ſharpely unto thoſe whom the Cittizens had ſent to the Senate, which did much provoke and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the Cittizens. And when the Cittizens ſaw that they prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nothing, but were put off with delayes: they put downe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and choſe a new. In briefe, from hence there aroſe a grievous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, contention and warre.

Neere to <hi>Kelheime</hi> there are many Vines growing on the bancke of <hi>Danubius.</hi> But they yeeld a kind of hard ſharpe Wine, ſo that it is a common ſaying that Vinegar growes on thoſe Mountaines.

There is alſo an excellent kinde of blew colour, which they call <hi>Lazurus.</hi> Moreover <hi>Noricum,</hi> which is now the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was heretofore a Kingdome, and had Kings of its owne, when the <hi>Romanes</hi> had reduc'd the other part of <hi>Bavaria</hi> into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince even till the yeare of our Lord 500: whence <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries, mentioneth that <hi>Arivoviſtus</hi> King of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> married the King of <hi>Noricums</hi> Siſter. But what Princes the <hi>Noricians</hi> had afterward doth not appeare, untill they became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But in the yeare 511, by the labour and induſtrie of <hi>Theoden</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Bavaria</hi> was reduc'd into one Kingdome, who made a great ſlaughter on the <hi>Romanes</hi> and drove them out of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; afterward it was divided into three Dukedomes by his three ſonnes; <hi>Theodon</hi> the third who was ſeated at <hi>Ratisbon, Otto</hi> at <hi>Otingia,</hi> and <hi>Theobald</hi> at <hi>Tyrolu.</hi> It would be too long to reckon up the other Princes. But at length the Emperour <hi>Ludovicke</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt 1439, did divide it in this manner, that the whole <hi>Norican Bavaria</hi> ſhould belong to the Prince <hi>Palatines,</hi> except ſome Emperiall Citties, and whatſoever formerly appertained to the Empire. The Metropolis of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is commonly called <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> which is pleaſantly ſeated by the River <hi>Pegnitius,</hi> which watereth the Cittie, it is very large and beautifull, and hath many faire Churches, curious buildings, great ſtreetes, being fortified with ſtrong walls, Towers, and Bulwarkes; and full of Cittizens, rich in Merchandiſe and famous through the whole world for <hi>Mechanick</hi> Arts: it is ſituated not only on the Navel as it were or middle of <hi>Germanie,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Europe</hi>; it is 500 miles diſtant from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Though the Cittie be of no great antiquitie, yet the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle which is ſituate on a high hill, which was heretofore called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum Noricum,</hi> is very auncient being built by the Emperour <hi>Claudius Tiberius,</hi> whence it was called <hi>Neroes</hi> Caſtell. Heretofore it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Franconia,</hi> after whoſe deceaſe it came to the Empire in the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Ludovicke</hi> the third, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it increaſed and began to grow very populous. In the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth it was walled about: and againe in the yeare 1538. Now it is the faireſt and largeſt Cittie in all <hi>Germanie,</hi> ſo that it hath 128 ſtreetes, 11 ſtone Bridges, which doe conjoyne and unite the two parts of the Cittie. The River <hi>Flavius</hi> paſſing through the Cittie doth drive 68 water-mills. There are alſo in this Cittie 116 wells, and 12 Conduites, 6 great gates, and 13 common bathes.</p>

There is a ſtone Bridge to paſſe over it, which is covered over head. But of all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and private coſtly aedifices, S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, and the Pallace are the chiefe. This Cittie was firſt founded and built in the yeare 1030, as the Annalls thereof doe witneſſe. But in the yeare 1301, it was burnt downe to the ground, ſo that there was not one houſe left ſtanding. But like a Phoenix that riſeth out of her owne aſhes, ſo eight yeares afterward out of theſe ruines, it was built fairer and more curiouſly than before. It is ſubject to the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as alſo <hi>Luſatia.</hi> And <hi>Iohn Dubravius Lib.</hi> 21. concerning the affaires of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> doth ſhew how it came to the Crowne of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The River <hi>Niſſa</hi> doth water <hi>Luſatia</hi> and doth much enrich it.

Neither doth the Bohemian degenerate from him in this alſo, for he contemneth others both in word &amp; deed, and ſheweth much pride and arrogancy both in his gate and geſture. And he is moſt fierce, when he is roughly entreated: Moreover he is as bold as a Lion in any enterpriſe, and ſtout and hardy in the Execution: but yet he is ambitious and vaine-glorious.

Moreover, it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that there is Frankincenſe and Myrrh in <hi>Moravia,</hi> which doth not diſtill out of a ſweating Tree, as in other parts, but is digged out of the ground, eſpecially in one place called <hi>Gradiſco,</hi> in which there is both male and female Frankincenſe.

This Country was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore adorned with the title of a Kingdome, and it had formerly Kings, who governed all <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Poleland,</hi> and it was a very large and potent Kingdome. About the yeere of Chriſt 700. <hi>Zuantocopius</hi> did poſſeſſe <hi>Moravia, Bohemia, Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Poleland,</hi> and the Dukes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were ſubject unto him.

The <hi>Hungarians</hi> were as it were a bolt or barre, which the King of <hi>Moravia</hi> had placed, to ſhut up the paſſage that way. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who purpoſed not to depart from <hi>Moravia</hi> without victory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving where they were ayded, opened a paſſage to <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and let in the Turkes amongſt them, who did grievouſly afflict this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. And ſo the Emperour uſing the Turkes Forces, did ſuppreſſe the King of <hi>Moravia,</hi> and having made a great ſlaughter, and taken many priſoners, he put him to flight. Who by this meanes eſcaping, betooke himſelfe to a thicke Wood, and having caſt away his royall Robes and apparell, hee went to a Hermit, with whom hee liv'd a ſolitary Hermits life untill his death, and then hee diſcovered who hee was, and ſo ſlept in Chriſt. After that the Princes of <hi>Bohemia, Poleland,</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> had every one Dukes of their owne, yet they payd ſome tribute to the Emperour. At the ſame time, when <hi>Michael</hi> was Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> there came <hi>Cirillus</hi> Doctor and Apoſtle of all <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> together with <hi>Merodius,</hi> who layd the foundation of the Chriſtian faith in <hi>Moravia</hi>; and erected an Epiſcopall Church in the Towne <hi>Vielagrad.</hi> So that being called and ſummoned by the Pope to anſwer why they read Maſſe in the Sclavonian tongue, they anſwered, becauſe it is writtten. <hi>Omnes Spiritus laudet Dominum.</hi> Let every ſpirit praiſe the Lord.

For the longeſt day of Summer in the Southerne Parallel is 14. houres long, with three fifths, but in the Northerne Parallel it is 15. houres long with three fifths.. <hi>Italy</hi> having ſuch a Situation, and having the Alpes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thorow it, which paſſe length-wayes thorow the middle of <hi>Italy,</hi> on both ſides, eſpecially on the South ſide have faire fruitfull Fields &amp; Hills lying by them: and therefore it is no marvell, that all the times and ſeaſons of the yeere are ſo temperate, and that it is ſo fruitfull, eſpecially in ſome places. The Country is very temperate, and very plentifull, and hath good ſtore of Corne, being not chargeable in til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but very gainefull to the Husbandman. The Roſſelanian fields in <hi>Vmbria</hi> are reported to have beene ſo fruitful, that <hi>Varro</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Caeſar Vopiſcus,</hi> when he pleaded his cauſe before the Cenſors, ſaid that the Roſean Fields were the <hi>Senum Italiae,</hi> in which if a Pitchforke bee left the day before, the graſſe will cover it over in one nights growth. <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeaking of the endowments of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſaith, that it produceth all things neceſſary for food. <hi>Campania</hi> doth yeeld Corne, <hi>Falernus</hi> wine: <hi>Caſsinas</hi> Oyle: <hi>Tuſculan</hi> Figges, <hi>Tarrentine</hi> Honey: and <hi>Tiber</hi> Fiſh. Moreover <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth that <hi>Italy</hi> is the Mother of all kindes of Trees. I will not mention the Vulgar common ſort. For here are great ſtore of Orange Trees, Lemmon Trees, and Quince Trees. All the Coaſt, as for example, <hi>Liguria,</hi> and that which belongeth to <hi>Genoa,</hi> is adorned and beautified with faire Trees, and great high Palme Trees, which are full of ſweet ſmelling fruit, ſo that it is pleaſant both in ſight and ſcent: and it hath every where pleaſant Gardens to recreate ſad mindes, and drive away Melancholy. And the ſame may be ſaid of a thouſand other places. The ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> ſheweth that there are Pepper trees in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Hydruntine Country hath abundance of Olives, ſo that he that hath not ſeene the great Woods of Olive trees which are in theſe parts, would thinke it incredible. The Barian

It is gathered from the Leaves of certaine Trees. <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth that it hath the choiſeſt and beſt Vines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that it excelleth the moſt odoriferous Nations of the world, for there is no ſcent to be compared with the delicious ſmell of the ſweet budding Vines. As the excellent Wines which are ſo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and praiſed by ancient Writers doe teſtifie. <hi>Pliny</hi> doth devide the Wines of <hi>Italy</hi> into foure ſorts. He preferreth the Setine Wines before all others, which was ſo called from <hi>Setia</hi> a Towne of <hi>Latium.</hi> The next he accounteth to be the Falerne Wine. The third he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be the Albanian, the Surrentinian, the Maſſuan, the Stanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the Calenian, the Fundanian, the Vilitertian, the Privernatian, and the Signinian Wines. The fourth ſort are the Pretutian, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conian, and the Palmeſian Wines. But of theſe things others doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: I paſſe to the other gifts of <hi>Italy:</hi> and will deſcribe them briefly. It is very fruitfull in producing all kinde of hearbes. What ſhould I ſpeake of the Mettals, Stones, and other gifts. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that it is inferiour unto no Country for Mettals. In <hi>Forum Iulium,</hi> there is the River <hi>Hydra,</hi> and not farre from thence a Mine of Quickſilver. Great ſtore of Allom was found heretofore among the Etruſcians in the Territory of <hi>Maſla.</hi> In <hi>Campania</hi> there are Mines of Brimſtone. Three miles from <hi>Volaterris</hi> toward the River <hi>Caecina,</hi> there are ſome Hills, in which there are Salt-pits. At <hi>Brutia</hi> alſo there are Salt Mines, which are hollowed into the inner parts of the Mountaine with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth of Salt. I omit the Stone Quarries, out of which divers Stones are cut. I doe not mention the Marble, the Alablaſter, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, and divers ſorts of precious Stones, nor the Saffron, Blue, and Roſen. And that I may not be tedious in reckoning up the variety of living creatures, <hi>Aulus Gellius. Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Noct. Atticar. Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Timaeus</hi> in his Hiſtory, and <hi>M.

               <hi>Italy,</hi> beſides other Fowle, hath Eagles and Vultures, which are ſo often mentioned in the ancient Romane Hiſtories. I come now to the ancient Government. There is no indubitable certainty concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ancient Government of <hi>Italie. Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbium</hi> doth ſpeake of <hi>Comer,</hi> who came firſt into this Country as a ſtranger, alſo of <hi>Chamus, Ianus, Sabatius, Sagus, Cranus, Aurunus, Malotte, Tages, Ofrides, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Tuſcus, Alteus, Ritis, Italus, Morgetes, Roma, Romaneſſus, Iaſius,</hi> and
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:14932:354"/>
others: but approoved Hiſtorians doe make no mention of them. But if we read <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus, Pompeus Trogus, Solinus Polyhiſtor,</hi> and other Greeke and Latine Writers, that many yeeres before the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> wee ſhall finde that <hi>Italie</hi> was governed by divers people, as Sicilians, the Aboriginians, the Ligurians, the Umbrians, and the Etrurians: which at laſt were all reduced under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Romane Empire. <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt was governed by Kings for 245. yeeres together, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Livie</hi> doe witneſſe, whom in the Romane Hiſtory it is beſt to follow. In whom wee may read the order and progreſſe of their atchievements, and it is to be conſidered, that their power did encreaſe abroad by military Diſcipline, and at home by moderation and Juſtice, and by the order of government. Afterward the Kings for their tyranny and luſt were expelled, which many times had cauſed many changes, and mutations in the Empire. The names of the Kings are theſe: <hi>Romulus,</hi> who raigned 38. yeeres, <hi>Numa,</hi> who raigned 43. yeeres, <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> who raigned 32. yeeres, <hi>Aneus Martius,</hi> who raigned 24. yeeres, <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus,</hi> who raigned 37. yeeres, <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> who raigned 44. yeeres, <hi>Tarqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nius Superbus,</hi> who raigned 25. yeeres. He was expelled the Kingdome for his Sons wicked act, who raviſhed <hi>Lucretia.</hi> But when the Kings were expelled, the government became Annuall, and two Conſuls were created. The firſt of which was <hi>L. Iunius Brutus,</hi> unto whom was joyned <hi>Sp. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius Tricipitinus.</hi> and after him <hi>M. Horatius Pulvillus.</hi> Thus <hi>Italie</hi> was governed by Conſuls, untill the time of the Emperour <hi>Caeſar Fl. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myllus Auguſtulus,</hi> whom <hi>Odoacer Herulus</hi> King of the Gothes did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſubverted the Country to himſelfe, and afterward being ſlaine, he left it to <hi>Theoderick</hi> his Succeſſors. I need not ſet downe a Catalogue of the Romane Conſuls and Emperours, which are well knowne. And we may read in Hiſtories the forme of the firſt royall government, the changes of Lawes and Magiſtrates, the Romanes valour, their warres, and their many civill diſſentions, untill <hi>Rome</hi> had got the Monarchie of the World: and how by luxury, civill warres, and the fatall viciſſitude and change of things, it loſt againe both vertue, and Empire. I proceed to other matters. <hi>Italie</hi> hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faire flouriſhing rich Citties, many famous populous Townes: and many Villages, adorned with Noblemens houſes.

Mountaines with ſo great a violence, that it ſeemes to threaten theſe places by which it floweth, and with the ſame vehemency it doth runne headlong by <hi>Verrona,</hi> beneath which it is devided into two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the one whereof goeth toward the Marſhes, the other bendeth to the Sea-ward, and maketh a faire Haven, you may ſee more in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> From the Spring-head thereof to <hi>Verona,</hi> it is not navigable or paſſeable for boates, by reaſon that it hath ſuch a violent Current, but they bring downe trees, and pieces of timber out of the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Mountaines, which they tye together and make them ſwim downe the River. But from <hi>Verona</hi> it is navigable even to the <hi>Foſſions. Torel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Verona,</hi> would have <hi>Atheſis</hi> to be the ſame which <hi>Ptolemie</hi> calleth <hi>Atrianum.</hi> And ſome doe thinke that <hi>Adrias</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Atheſis,</hi> which <hi>Stephanus</hi> and others doe mention. The third River is <hi>Rubicon,</hi> which <hi>Ptolemie</hi> and other Greeke writers doe call <hi>Rubikoon: Strabo</hi> calleth it <hi>Roubikoon</hi>: now it is called <hi>Piſatellus.</hi> It was that River which a <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth did anciently bounder <hi>Italie,</hi> after the bounds thereof were tranſlated from the River <hi>Aeſus.</hi> The fourth River is <hi>Tiber,</hi> which is the bounds betweene <hi>Etruria</hi> and <hi>Latium.</hi> There is no River more famous in Roman Hiſtories. It hath had divers names, ſome prophane and ſome ſacred. The prophane heathen names are <hi>Ianus, Albula, Rumen,</hi> and <hi>Tiberis,</hi> the Divine is <hi>Serra. Athenaeus</hi> reporteth that it was anciently called <hi>Ianus,</hi> from the God <hi>Ianus.</hi> It appeares in <hi>Varro</hi> and others that it was called <hi>Albula,</hi> which <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> &amp; <hi>Servius</hi> doe derive <hi>ab albo colore</hi> from the white colour of it, who ſheweth alſo that it was called <hi>Rumon.</hi> But the chiefeſt name of this River was and is <hi>Tiber,</hi> of which there are divers Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies. Some doe derive it from <hi>Tibris,</hi> a King of the <hi>Aborigines, Festius</hi> and <hi>Servius</hi> ſay that hee was King of the <hi>Tuſsians: Livy, Ovid, Feſtus Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> doe derive it from <hi>Tiberinus Silvius,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Albanians. Varro</hi> delivers that this River was called <hi>Dehiberim</hi> from <hi>Dehebris</hi> an Earle of the <hi>Vejentians: Servius</hi> ſaith that it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture by a ſacred name <hi>Serra a ſecando</hi> from cutting. So much concerning the names, in which it is to bee noted that there was a difference obſerved in the pronunciation of theſe words <hi>Tiberis, Tibris,</hi> and <hi>Tiberini.</hi> For in common ſpeech it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tiberis</hi> in Poeſy <hi>Tibris</hi>; and in holy writers <hi>Tiberinus,</hi> as <hi>Servius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, which is not alwayes true. It was called commonly <hi>Tevere.</hi> The head of <hi>Tiber</hi> is in the <hi>Apennine</hi> Mountaines, in the middle of it, neere the confines of the <hi>Aretineans,</hi> in that parte, where the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Arnus,</hi> is above <hi>Aretium.</hi> It is a ſmall ſtreame at firſt like a little Rivilet, but when it hath runne forward it increaſeth but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in regard it receaveth no great ſtreames, but ſuch as proceede from ſmall Fountaines, but afterward by the receipt of ſome Rivers it groweth larger, and is Navigable for boates and little veſſels even to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo running not farre from <hi>Tiphernum, Peruſia, Otriculus,</hi> it divideth <hi>Eturia</hi> from the <hi>Vmbrian</hi> and <hi>Sabinians</hi>: and afterward 13. Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> it divideth the <hi>Veſentians</hi> from the <hi>Cruſtiminians</hi> and <hi>Fidenations</hi>: alſo it ſeperateth <hi>Latium</hi> from <hi>Vaticanum</hi>: and is ſo great and broade a River at Rome, ſo that they cannot paſſe over it but by

Out of this Mountaine it runneth by the <hi>Lepontians</hi> Southward among the ſteepe Rocks to <hi>Belinzona</hi> a ſtrong Towne, and afterward growing greater by the averſion of many Rivers and Torrents, it rowleth it ſelfe into the Lake <hi>Verbanum,</hi> through which it runneth, as <hi>Pliny</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and ſo returning through the Plaine, it runneth with a cleare ſtreame into <hi>Padus.</hi> The water of this River is ſo cleare, that you may ſee any thing in the bottome of it.

To ſearch out the riſing of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would be troubleſome. The common received opinion is that two ſmall Rivers doe runne out of the Lake <hi>Frigidulph,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Alpes, the one on the right hand is called <hi>Fridigulph,</hi> and at length is joyned with <hi>Ollius</hi>: the other on the left hand doth runne with another River, and from thence the River <hi>Ollius</hi> beginneth. Others make other conjectures. It runneth into the Lake <hi>Iſeum</hi> neere the Towne <hi>Piſonium</hi>: it watereth the fields of <hi>Brixianum</hi> and <hi>Cremona,</hi> and make their barren ſoyle very fruitefull: and it ſeperateth the <hi>Brixian</hi> Country from <hi>Cremonia</hi> and <hi>Bergoma</hi>: It receaveth above 37. other Rivers. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> doe call that River <hi>Abdua,</hi> or <hi>Addua,</hi> which <hi>Polib.</hi> and <hi>Strab.</hi> doe call <hi>Adovas,</hi> it is commonly cal'd <hi>Adda.</hi> It divideth the <hi>Cenomanians</hi> from the <hi>Inſubrians.</hi> It riſeth in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Baulius</hi>: and <hi>Strab.</hi> noteth that it taketh his force from the Mountaine <hi>Adula.</hi> And ſo returning from the Lake <hi>Larius,</hi> through which it runneth, it windeth through the Plaine toward <hi>Padus,</hi> and

bringeth with it many other Rivers, as <hi>Pilclavo, Meyra, Lira, Tarlene, Lacieumortum, Brembrum,</hi> and <hi>Serimortum,</hi> and alſo <hi>Serius,</hi> which riſing in the Mountaines above <hi>Bergomum,</hi> and flowing by <hi>Seriana,</hi> in the winter time it hides himſelfe in his channell, and runns under ground, and afterward riſing up againe neere <hi>Crema,</hi> it runneth into <hi>Addua</hi>: but in Summer by reaſon that the heate of the Sun melteth the ſnow upon the Mountaines, it doth ſo increaſe and ſwell, that it doth not onely fill thoſe ſubterranean channels, and windings under the earth, but alſo it continually overfloweth the upper face of the earth.

The chiefe whereof are the Alpes, which whether we make them belong to <hi>France, Germany,</hi> or <hi>Italie</hi> it matters not: for theſe Mountaines running along doe with a wall as it were ſeperate <hi>Italie</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germanie.

The Germaine ſpeech doth acknowledge the name of Alpes, for Alp or Alpen ſignifies in their language paſturing Mountaines, on which no Hay is cut or got againſt Winter, but onely Oxen and other heards of Cattell are put there to graze. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth that theſe Mountaines were heretofore called <hi>Albia</hi> and <hi>Alpioni: Stephanus</hi> alſo calleth them <hi>Alpia</hi> and <hi>Alpij.

<pb n="699" facs="tcp:14932:357"/>
of the Alpes over which they traveled. And theſe are the Sea Alpes, which ar alſo calld the <hi>Liguſtina</hi> Alpes: The Cottian, Graecian, Penine, the Sammian Alpes, the Lepontian, the Rhetian, Iulian and Carnici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And ſo much concerning the Alpes, which breadthwayes doe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat and parte <hi>Italie</hi> from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> the Apinine follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which running with a continuing ridge betweene the higher and the lower Sea, it divideth it length wayes into two parts or ſides. It is thought to have beene ſo called, becauſe the foote of this Hill is by <hi>Hannibals</hi> Penine paſſage. Some thinke it was called the <hi>Apenine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Paenians or Carthaginians breaking into <hi>Italie</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Hanniball</hi> did make and open a paſſage this way, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from <hi>Apis</hi> and ancient Captaine who overcame and conquerd all <hi>Italie. Ptolamie</hi> and others call it <hi>Appennina, Stephanus Apennium,</hi> the Apennine Mountaine, ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> is the greateſt in <hi>Italie,</hi> running with a continued ridge from the Alpes to the Sicillian ſtraite. <hi>Italie</hi> hath many other Mountaines, which are either parts or pieces of the Apennine, or ſuch as it thruſteth forth here and there, or ſuch as lye at the foote thereof, ſo that it overlookes them. But I paſſe over them, leaſt I ſhould be tedious. Moreover the Mountaines &amp; aforeſaid, the Valleys and fields are crowned with woods, groves, and thicketts, many of which are named and celebrated by the ancients. In <hi>Etruria</hi> there is the wood <hi>Viterbium,</hi> which in Italian is called <hi>Boſcodi Monte Fiacone,</hi> which is commonly calld <hi>Bolſena,</hi> the ancients as <hi>Leander</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth did call it the Valſinan Wood. On <hi>Ciminus</hi> a Mountaine of <hi>Etruria,</hi> here was a wood, ſo thick that few travelld through it, of which <hi>Livy</hi> thus. <hi>Silva erat Cimina, magis tum invia atque horrenda, quam nuper ſuere Germanicj Saltus, nulli ad eam diem, ne Mercatorj quidem adita, Eam intrare haud fere quiſquam praeter Ducem ipſum audebat.</hi> That is, the <hi>Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Wood was more thick and impaſſable, than the Germane For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts were of late, ſo that no man nor Merchant hath paſſed thorow it, into which none but the Captaine durſt enter.

And that we may begin with the ſacred workes, they are almoſt infinite, for <hi>Rome</hi> alone hath at this day above 300. Churches, of which ſeven are chiefly reſorted unto for Religion ſake; the firſt is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in the Vatican: which exceedeth all the Churches in the World for coſtly Marble worke, and magnificent building. There are many ſingular things in it: as ſome Pillars which were brought out of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple: two Braſſe Peacocks which were brought from <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</hi> his Pyramiſſe, which was heretofore in the Vatican Valley. There are alſo the Tombes and Sepulchers of many Popes, and a Marble Tombe of the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the ſecond: and in the Popes Chappell there is Doomeſday, or the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lively drawne by <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> And that I may not omit the Monaſteries, the Hoſpitals for Strangers, the Hoſpitals for the Sicke, and for Orphanes. What ſhould I ſpeake of the Popes and Cardinals Palaces? The Popes Palace is in the higheſt part of the Valitan, being fairely ſeated: who leaving his Lateran Palace, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove thither in regard of the pleaſantneſſe and wholeſomeneſſe of the Seate. It was begun by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third, and enlarged by others, but perfected by <hi>Iulian</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and at laſt it was adorned with Buildings and Pictures by <hi>Xiſtus</hi> the fifth, ſo that now the proud Pile ſeemeth to touch the Heavens. The Staires are broad and eaſie to aſcend, ſo that one may ride on Horſeback to the top of the Houſe. For it is ſo great that it ſeemeth rather a Town than a Houſe, there is <hi>Xiſtus</hi> Chapell which is as big as a great Church, whether when the See is vacant, the Cardinals doe meete together to create a Pope, which is commonly called the Conclave. It would be tedious to mention the other Palaces, and therefore we will paſſe to other matters. The government of <hi>Italie</hi> followeth, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, Politicall and Eccleſiaſticall. Concerning the Politick and Civill government, this noble Country is devided into many Signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Among which, beſide the Pope, the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the free Commonwealths, as <hi>Venice, Genoa, Lucenſis,</hi> and others, the chiefe in the Northerne part are, the Princes of <hi>Etruria, Ferrara, Mantua, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="701" facs="tcp:14932:358"/>
government the Pope is the Hierarch and the head of the Church, and hath a great Traine. <hi>Quoties procedit Gemmis conſpicitur ornatus, &amp; Sericis veſtibus, tectus Auro, vectus Equo albo, ſtipatus Milite, circumſtrepenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſeptus Miniſtris.</hi> That is, as often as the Pope goes forth, hee wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſilke Robes, embroidered with Gold and Pearle, he rideth on a white Horſe, and is garded with Souldiers, and hath Officers which play on Muſick before him. The other Prieſts are here much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and have great authority. And are more honoured than Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Cardinals as <hi>Peter Meſsias</hi> noteth, did ſucceed in place of the Conſuls, who heretofore governed the Romane Empire: the Archbiſhops are equall to Dukes: the Biſhops to Earles, their Vicars or Subſtitutes are as it were Preſidents of the Empire, &amp; the Provoſts are as it were Praefects: the Arch-prieſts are in the place of Tribunes of Souldiers, and the Chancellors doe repreſent the Tribunes of the People. Moreover, <hi>Italie</hi> hath a threefold Law, the Pontificall, the Caeſarian, and the Municipall, the firſt and ſecond are to be knowne other wheres; the third conſiſts of Statutes and Lawes, which the Citties themſelves doe enact and make: but let ſo much ſuffice. I will onely here ſet downe that which is read in a certaine Manuſcript concerning the Counſels of theſe ſeverall Citties. It is written the Mediolanians are excellent in Counſel: the Venetians wiſe: the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians raſh: the Piſanians inconſtant: the Placentians provident: the Florentines ſlow: the Veronians faithfull: the Ferrarians wary: the Genoans ignorant: the Lucenſians profitable: the Volſcians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious: the Brutians blockiſh: the Mutinenſians acute and ingenious: the Peruſinians quick and ready: the Senenians ſlow: and the Patavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans irreſolute. The Italians doe maintaine, cheriſh, and honour Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and are good Maecenaſſes unto them. And hence there are ſo many Univerſities in <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Romana, Mediolanum, Bononia, Patavina, Papienſis, Naples, Peruſina, Salerne, Piſona, Ferrara, Senenſis, Florence, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Bergomenſis, Mutinenſis,</hi> and <hi>Taurinenſis</hi>; for the Univerſities of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Placentia, Anconita,</hi> and <hi>Macerata,</hi> are for the moſt part decayed. And hence proceedeth that great plenty of Doctors, and famous men learned in divers Arts and Diſciplines. It would be troubleſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me to reckon up a Catalogue of them, and tedious to the Reader. Moreover, the Italians doe exceed other people for courteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, for gentleneſſe, and for witty conference, and diſcourſe. They are very ingenious and witty, quick of invention, and very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, in matters of ſtudy, and alſo in learning divers Arts. They have in all ages thirſted after honour and glory, and have beene more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of praiſe than any others. They are ſoft and effeminate, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Venery, quenching pleaſure with Milke, as fire is with Oyle. They are very deſirous of revenge: and they thinke it ſweeter than life, and doe ſometime leave it by Will to their Poſterity. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the aforeſaid Manuſcript doth paint forth the women of divers Citties in this manner: the Senenſians are faire: the Florentines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate: the Peruſenians neat: the Cajetanians faire: the Conſentine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans obſtinate: the Beneventanians clowniſh: the Bononians arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and proud: the Mutinenſians bountifull: the Ceſenatians cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly

The Italians were heretofore ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly adicted to many ſuperſtitions. But now they doe all religiouſly obſerve the Ceremonies and Rites of the Romane Church: but that ſome few in the Southerne part of <hi>Italy</hi> do follow the Graecian Rites, who are alſo deſcended of the Graecians. But what a warlike people the Italians have beene, the conqueſt of the world doth declare. And the aforeſaid Manuſcript doth ſhew which Citties doe exceed others in matter of Warre. In warlike affaires the Peruſinians are ſtout: the Calabrians raſh: the Spoletanians crafty: the Senenſians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: the Bononians fierce: the Neapolitans couragious: the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines are mitigators of their enemy: the Prarenſians ſacrilegious: the Collenſians luſtfull: the Picenians ravenous: the Aemilians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate: the Placentinians cruell: the Romanes valiant: the Mediolanians undaunted: the Vincentinians deſirous of revenge: the Piſtorians bloody: the Papienſians firme and conſtant. Their Diet is ſober and frugall, and they are not curious in furniſhing their Tables, but when neceſſity requires. They doe not all weare one kinde of habit, but they vary according to the time or the quality of the Perſon, and alſo in the forme and ſhape of it. The Mattoas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did goe with naked armes, breſts, and ſhoulders, and now they cover all with thin Vailes according to the Spaniſh faſhion. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians goe civilly and neatly, the Florentians, the Tuſcians, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diolanians, the Aemilians, and Ligurians, doe goe ſomewhat bravet. But the Romane Courtier doth excell all the reſt for long various colour'd Garments, but the Romane Citizen goeth more frugally, yet hanſomely, but eſpecially the women who of late did affect the Tuſcane dreſſing. <hi>Naples</hi> hath a habit that is more ſhining and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dide than coſtly. The Mediolanians in their apparell are gorgious, the Genoas neat, the Mantuans childiſh, the Neapolitans coſtly, the Venetians magnificent, the Florentines ridiculous.

be derived from their noble generous birth. The Venetians as <hi>Livie</hi> noteth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. did drive the Euganeans from home, from whom the whole Country was called <hi>Venetia.</hi> The Citties of <hi>Marca Tarviſina</hi> are <hi>Verona, Vincentia, Patavium, Venetia, Tarviſium.</hi> Of the former of which, namely, <hi>Verona, Vincentia,</hi> and <hi>Patavium</hi> we will ſpeake in their proper Table. <hi>Venice</hi> is a Citty which containeth about 60. ſmall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, &amp; it is ſeated in the innermoſt part of the Hadriatick Bay, in the middeſt of the Lakes, which the Tyde filleth every 6. houres: the Sea floweth on the Eaſt ſide, which that the violence and rage thereof may doe no harme, ſome other Ilands doe lye before it to reſtraine the fury of the Sea. And although it be not fortified with walls, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, or Towers, yet it is ſtrong by the naturall ſituation. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with many Channels. There are Rivers in all the ſtreets, which are joyned together by 450. ſtone and woodden Bridges. The chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Channell is that which is called <hi>Canal grande,</hi> three miles long, which devideth the whole Citty into two parts. So that you may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe on foote, or by Boate, of which there are 8000. thorow the Citty, they commonly call theſe Boates <hi>Gondelas.</hi> The compaſſe of this Citty is about 8. miles, which is famous for populouſneſſe, wealth, and ſtore of Merchandiſe: it hath produced excellent wits, and moſt learned men, and it is adorned with good Lawes, and laudable Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. It doth abound with Corne which is brought thither out of divers parts of the World, as alſo with divers ſorts of Wine, among which is that generous ſort of Wine, which is commonly called Malmeſy, and with other things, neceſſary to mans life, ſo that it may be rightly call'd the Paradiſe of Delight. There are in it 64. Pariſhes. There are alſo magnificent and ſumptuous publike and private buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The chiefeſt Church is that which is dedicated to Saint <hi>Marke</hi> the Evangeliſt, which is gilded in many places. And to omit other matters, there is an Armory within the Citty, commonly call'd the <hi>Arſenale,</hi> which is about two miles in compaſſe. Here are made of Wood, Iron, Braſſe, Hempe, and Flaxe, all kindes of proviſion for Ships, as Anchors, Guns, Cables, Ropes, Tackles, and Sailes. Here are alſo ſome Enſignes kept which were taken from the Turke, or Pirates, or Enemies, and thoſe Trophies which were taken at <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactum</hi> in the yeere 1581. And alſo there are the Praetorian Barges, and the Ship <hi>Bucentaurus,</hi> in which the Prince accompanied with the Senate and chiefe men of the Citty, is carryed every yeere to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Sea, where the Caſtle ſtandeth, and there after ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies performed by the Biſhop, he marrieth the Sea, and puts a Ring upon it to ſhew his perpetuall dominion over it. There is alſo a publike Library, together with the Library of <hi>Beſſarion</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Nicen,</hi> which at his death he gave to the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice. Venice</hi> is very populous, ſo that there are thought to be in it about 300000. Citizens. They are of three ſorts or rankes: the Patricians who governe the Empire and Common-wealth: the Citizens who doe beare under Offices: and the Artificers who uſe Mechanick Arts. And beſides theſe there are great ſtore of Merchants and Strangers, which come thither in divers habits out of all parts of the World to

trafficke: as Turkes, Aethiopians, Slavonians, Arabians, Syrians, Cretenſians, Cyprians, Macedonians, Germanes, Hungarians, Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Frenchmen, and others. The Venetian Common-wealth was governed at the firſt by Conſuls, afterward by Tribunes for 252. yeeres: afterward in the yeere 707. it began to be a Dukedome. The Duke commonly call'd <hi>Doge,</hi> is the head of the Common-wealth, and the Prince of the Senate, and he can doe nothing neither in time of peace or warre without the conſent of the Senate, for he conſulteth with them. The Senate make Decrees which yet are publiſhed in the Dukes name. The Duke hath certaine ſtipends paid him out of the publike ſtock: and after his deceaſe another is choſen by ſuffrages and voyces, out of the Senate. The Senate which is commonly call'd <hi>Gran Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are many other Magiſtrates beſides the Duke, which here for brevity ſake I omit. This Citty is held to bee the faireſt and moſt flouriſhing Citty of all others, the Theater of the World, and the common Mart for the whole Univerſe, the Miſtreſſe and Conquerour over ſo many Enemies: the Queene of the Hadria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea, and the glory and honour of <hi>Italie.</hi> Although it hath waged many warres, and tryed the varieties of fortune for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres, yet it was never ſubdued by any forraine Enemy. I paſſe by the other Citties and leſſer Townes. The moſt famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of this Country are <hi>Plavis,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Piave,</hi> alſo <hi>Brenta, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilio,</hi> and <hi>Atheſis,</hi> which is the greateſt of them all.

This Country as <hi>Strionnius</hi> writeth, was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore barren, and had nothing in it worthy of memory, but that it had great vaſt Trees, fit for building of Ships. But now it yeeldeth good ſtore of Wine, Oyle, and other fruits. The Country <hi>Dianus</hi> doth ſo abound with Oyle, that ſometimes it maketh 18. ſometimes 20000.

The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants doe call it <hi>Zircknitzerzee</hi> from the Towne <hi>Zircknitz,</hi> which is ſituated by it. But I will make a more accurrate deſcription of it out of <hi>George Wernherus</hi>: it is encloſed every where with Mountaines, for halfe a Mile together it is not very broade. Out of the Mountaines there doe iſſue certaine ſmall Rivers, which are every one contayned in their owne Channells: on the Eaſt ſide there are three, on the South five. The farther that they runne the more narrower they grow, for their bankes are ſtraite, untill they are ſwallowed up in the ſtoany paſſages of the Cliffes, which ſeeme as if they were cut out by humane Induſtry. So that where they find an open place the waters doe ſpread abroade, and make a Lake. Theſe waters doe as ſpeedily runne back as they flowe forward, not onely in thoſe narrow channells, but alſo through the earth, which when the Inhabitants perceive, they ſtopp the greater paſſages, and Concavities, and ſo goe to fiſhing, which is both pleaſant and profitable. For the fiſh which they take here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalted is tranſported to other Countries. Moreover when the Lake is drie they have a kind of harveſt, for they ſowe it and mowe it before that it be overflow'd againe. It beareth ſuch abundance of graſſe, that in twenty dayes it will be ready to cut. Who therefore cannot chuſe but admire at theſe wonders of nature? But ſo much cocerning theſe things, I paſſe to the reſt.</p>

That part which looketh toward <hi>Etruria</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different plaine, having a fruitfull Soyle, which beareth excellent ſweet fruites. This Iland hath excellent wines, of chiefe note, which the Romanes much eſteemed, they are called from the place Corſican Wines. Here is great ſtore of Honey, Roſen, Oyle, and Figges. But <hi>Servius</hi> noteth in his 4. Booke of Geogr. that the Corſian Honey is bitter, which comes to paſſe by reaſon that there are great ſtore of Ewe trees, from whence the Bees doe gather Honey.

The Souldiers being terrified at the approaching of this army, the Baſhaw of <hi>Boſnia</hi> tooke the ſtronge Fort <hi>Hraſtovitza</hi> by treachery. And afterward the fury of his Souldiers being not appeaſ'd therewith, hee laid ſiege to <hi>Wyhitz,</hi> a ſtrong walled Citty: the Souldiers having neither munition nor victualls, yeelded up the Towne by ſurrender, and the Turke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward contrary to his promiſe put them all to the Sword, and many inconveniences follow'd after this ſurrender, which I omit. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the yeare following, which was 1593. The Turke glorying in his many victories, and Townes which hee had taken, had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to get the ſtrong Citty <hi>Siſſegkum</hi>: and ſo rayſing an army hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it. But the Germanes conſidering what great detriment and loſſe, not onely <hi>Germanie</hi> but all <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould ſuſtaine, if the Turkes ſhould take it, they levied an army, and ſo paſſing over the River <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> they intended to relieve the Citty. The Turkiſh horſe-men who were 8000. or ſome ſay 10000. made haſte to poſſeſſe themſelves of the other Banck of the River <hi>Savus</hi> by the Bridge which was built before, that ſo they might hinder the Chriſtians approach, where joyning
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:14932:402"/>
battell with the Chriſtians, the Turkes were put to flight, and fled to the Bridge, which the Caroloſtadien Souldiers had firſt poſſeſſed. The Turkes were at laſt all cut off, and a great many drown'd in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Savus</hi> and <hi>Kulpa.</hi> The other part of the Turkiſh Army fled, the Bridge being cut downe, ſo that they could not retire to the reſt of their army. And ſo on the 22. of Iune in the yeare 1593. this Citty was freed from this ſtraite ſiege.</p>

Citty of God, affirmeth according to <hi>Varros</hi> opinion, that the Romans and Graecians together had above 3000. gods, of which there were 300. <hi>Iupiters.</hi> Every one had his Lar or Houſhold god.

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people doe not now keepe their ancient faſhions.

They never mingle any wine with water, and women are not preſent at their drinking feaſts and meetings, neither doe they ſitt downe at Banquets. But the Heatheniſh Greekes have an ancient cuſtome in bewailing the dead. The Greeke Chriſtians doe differ in Religion from the Romanes, and doe call themſelves the Eaſterne Church.

In this Kingdome there are no great ſtore of Churches, Colledges, nor Hoſpitals.

If any one looke downe from the higheſt Tower he will thinke that men of great ſtature are no bigger than children of a yeere old. And this Tower hath a golden Moone for a Weathercock, and three golden Globes, ſo faſtned upon Iron, that the greateſt is placed loweſt, and the leſſer higheſt. There is alſo a ſtrong Caſtle in this Citty, ſo that if you beheld the ſpaciouſneſſe thereof, the Walls, Towers, and Gates, built of Tiburtine Marble, you would thinke it a Citty.

This Queenes name was <hi>Maqueda.</hi> The Aethiopian Kings doe beleeve that they are deſcended of the Stock of <hi>David,</hi> and the Family of <hi>Salomon.</hi> And therefore they are wont to ſtile themſelves the Sonnes of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and of the holy Patriarcks, becauſe they are come of their Seed.

Which as ſoone as <hi>Meilech</hi> or <hi>David</hi> had attained unto, he choſe many Prieſts and Earles out of every one of the 12. Tribes, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning back to the Kingdome of <hi>Aethiope,</hi> he tooke upon him the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof. And hee brought in with him the old Law and Circumciſion. Theſe were the firſt beginnings of the Jewes Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and they ſay that untill this day there are none admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any Office in Court, or Canonicall place, unleſſe he be deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Jewes. And by them the knowledge of God was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and tooke roote, and ſo was derived and ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by ſucceeding ages. For the Aethiopians had the Bookes of the Prophets, and went to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to adore and worſhip the true God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Which may bee underſtood by the ſtory of Queene <hi>Iudiths</hi> Eunuch, who is properly called <hi>Iudith.</hi> For hee 10. yeeres after the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, came 240. miles journey to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And when he had there worſhipped God, and was returning home ſitting in his Chariot, he read the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah.</hi> And ſo <hi>Philip</hi> one of Chriſts Diſciples by Gods command was ſent unto him. And when they came both to the Citty <hi>Bethzur,</hi> three Miles from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>: there the Eunuch ſpyed a Spring or Well at the foote of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, with the water whereof he was baptized by <hi>Philip.</hi> But as ſoone as the Eunuch returned into <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> he baptized the Queene, and a great part of her houſhold and people.

But they baptize their Male children on the 40. day, and their Females on the 80. day, unleſſe the weakeneſſe of the childe doe require haſte. They every yeere baptize them anew, both thoſe that are come to ripeneſſe of yeeres, and alſo Infants, ſaying theſe words. <hi>Ego te baptizo in nomine Patris, Filij, &amp; Spiritus Sancti.</hi> That is, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt. And they doe religiouſly keepe this cuſtome from their Anceſtors, not to extenuate or weaken the firſt baptiſme, but that they may have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from their ſinnes every yeere. They receive the Lords Supper <hi>ſub utraque ſpecie,</hi> or in both kindes, both the Lay-people and the Clergie.

They hold that the chiefe uſe of the Law is to ſhew us our ſinnes, and they beleeve that wee can bee ſaved by no other but Jeſus Chriſt, who fulfilled and ſatisfied the Law for us. They love and reverence Saints, but make no Invocation unto them. They doe much honour <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Chriſt, but yet they doe not worſhip her, nor implore her helpe. The Clergie and the Prieſts are permitted to many as well as the Lay-people. And they puniſh all kinde of Luſt and Fornication. They have a Patriarke

This Iland hath a ſtiffe clommy ſoile, of a red duskiſh colour. It doth not beare Corne, Vines, or any Tree that hath ſtone fruit: but it beareth Mellons, Cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Gourds, Figges, and great ſtore of Ginger, and eſpecially Sugar, for which they doe bring in Wine, Cheeſe, Corne, Hides, and other neceſſaries. But this traffick hath ceaſed ſince that certaine wormes began to eate the rootes of the Sugar-canes, ſo that now ſcarce 6. Ships doe goe from thence loaded with Sugar. It hath alſo great ſtore of Millet, Rice, and Barley, and great plenty of Lettice, Colworts, Cabbages, Rape-rootes, Beete, Parſley, or wilde Alexander, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Garden hearbs. And beſides it hath a roote which groweth in the Weſt-Indies in the Iland <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which is there called <hi>Bata.</hi> The Negroes of this Iland doe call it <hi>Ignama,</hi> and doe plant it as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry choiſe and ſpeciall hearbe. The outermoſt barke is black, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt white, and it is long like a Rape-roote, and hath many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſpreading from the roote. It taſteth like Cheſnuts, but more pleaſant and ſweete. They commonly roſt them in the aſhes, and ſometimes they eate them raw. The Spaniards have brought hither Olive-trees, Peach-trees, Almond-trees, and other kindes of Trees, which being planted were faire and pleaſant to behold, but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beare any fruit. There is in this Iland a ſtrange kinde of Crab, which liveth in the Earth like a Mole, of a Sea-water colour, which caſteth up the Earth, and doth gnaw and conſume all things neere it. There are alſo in this Iland great ſtore of Birds, as Partridges, Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Blackbirds, greene ſinging Sparrowes, and Parrots. The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals built a Citty in it which they called <hi>Pavoſa,</hi> by the River, in which it is thought that there 700. Families, beſides the Biſhop and other Clergie men. It hath a good Haven, and a wholeſome River, and the Sea affoordeth good fiſhing. And which is wonderfull, there are great ſtore of Whales, which are ſometimes found on this ſhore, and on other ſhores of <hi>Affrick.</hi> In the middle of the Iland there is a wooddy Mountaine, which is alwaies coverd with ſuch thick Clouds, in ſo much that water doth runne out of the woods, and water the Sugar-canes: and the higher the Sunne is, the Skie round about that Mountaine is the more cloudy. The Inhabitants are partly white, and partly black. And it is very ſtrange that the black people are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much troubled with Gnats, Lice, and Fleas: but the white people have neither Lice, nor Gnats, nor Fleas in their Beds.</p>

But of all thoſe things which ſerve either for delight or medicinable uſe, the Balſame is eſpecially commended, which God heretofore gave to this part of the World, but now it wanteth it, alſo the Aromatick ſweet Spices, and Maſtix, and two kindes of Nuts, the one called Almonds, and the other Piſtack Nuts. In the Mountaines alſo there is Iron and Braſſe. It hath abundance of ſweet Springs, and pleaſant Meddowes which are cloathed with Flocks and Heards of Cattell, which doe yeeld great ſtore of Milke. And here is good hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Boares, Goates, Hares, and Hawking after Partridges, Stares, and other Birds. Moreover, the Land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> had 31. Kings, which were Philiſtins, but after Iſraelites entred into this Country, the moſt part of the Philiſtins and ancient Kings were ſlaine and droven out. And the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were governd by Captaines about 450. yeeres, untill the Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi> Neither did they rule by Succeſſion, or Election, but it was a kinde of Ariſtocracy, where the Seniors in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Tribe did governe, but afterward at the requeſt of the people, God changed this forme of government into a Kingdome, and this government continued many yeeres. For in proceſſe of time the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſuffered many calamities, untill at length they loſt their Kingdome. For both ſacred and prophane Hiſtories doe witneſſe, that this Nation had beene ſubject to divers changes, and had beene vexed continually with warres, either through the diſpoſition of the people, who could neither endure their own nor others government, or through their ſinnes which provoked Gods anger toward them, or through the felicity and happineſſe of this Country which tempted Strangers to invade them. Sometimes they were overcome, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time carried away into captivity, ſo that they were unfit to live ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in proſperity or adverſity. Sometimes they were under the yoke of ſervitude, and in bondage to their neighbours, and ſometimes to remote people farre off, as the Aegyptians, Chaldaeans, Medes, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Macedons, and Romanes: and they never ceaſed to tread downe and overthrow themſelves, and their Common-wealth by their evill counſell, untill at length they faſtned and nayled the Sonne of God, and the Saviour of mankinde, with their wicked hands to the Croſſe, than which there could bee no greater ſinne or impiety. After that there enſued new calamities and miſeries. For <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> having conquerd <hi>Iudaea</hi> tooke <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and carried away many thouſand Jewes into Captivity, and many of them being ſlaine by famine, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, fire, and ſword, he waſted and deſtroyed the Temple and all the ſacred and prophane buildings, in the yeere from the birth of Chriſt 73. which Chriſt himſelfe while hee lived here on Earth had foretold. <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> did re-edifie the Citty, but hee changed the Situation thereof. And the old Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> lay ruinate and waſted, even untill the yeere 363. when <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata gave the Jewes leave to re-edifie it, who being diſmaid by a miracle deſiſted from their enterpriſe, and left it off againe.

They had all of them many Wives, and many Concubines, which they kept for Of-ſpring ſake, that they might have Children by them.

They buried their dead bodies in the ground, and anoynted them with waxe. It was counted a hainous offence to laugh or ſpet before the King. Concerning the burying of their dead others doe write the cleane contrary, namely, that the Perſians did bring forth the bodies of their dead without the Citty into the Fields, and there caſt them forth naked to be devourd by Dogs and ravenous Fowles. And moreover that they would not ſuffer the bones of the dead to be buried or interr'd. And when any Carkaſſe was not preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Fowles and the wild Beaſts, they accounted it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky ſigne, ſuperſtitiouſly beleeving that that man had a wicked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure ſoule, and therefore worthy of Hell, and his neighbours did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him as a man who after this life had no hope of Felicity. But if he were ſoone devoured by the Beaſts, they judged him happy. But now the Perſians are more ſoft and gentle in their manners and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour then either the Turkes, the Tartarians, or the Sarazens. They are by nature liberall, and doe love civility: and they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Learning and Arts, but eſpecially Aſtrologie, Phiſick, and Poeſie. They uſe Parents and Brethren with much reſpect: and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of blood is greatly eſteemed: wherein they differ from the Turkes, which make no differences of blood or diſſent. Moreover, they doe entertaine and uſe ſtrangers curteouſly: but yet they are very jealous. So that they ſuffer not their Wives to come in a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſight, though in other matters they uſe them with great reſpect, contrary to the maner of the Turkes, who uſe their Wives like ſlaves. The Perſian women are very faire. They doe addict themſelves to Mechanick Arts, and eſpecially weaving of Silke ſtuffes which are tranſported thorow all <hi>Syria,</hi> and other Eaſterne Countries. They did feed heretofore on the fruit of the Turpentine Tree, and on Acornes, and wilde Peares: their daily food after running, or other exerciſes of the body was hard bread, their drinke was water. They get much by buying and ſelling of Pearles, and ſweet Spices, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Silke, of which here is great ſtore.</p>

It is very ſweet, and the root having put forth of the ground, will grow up as high as ones middle. Beſide this is more wonderfull: as long as it hath other hearbes growing round about it, ſo long it doth live like a Lambe in a pleaſant Paſture, but when they are gone it doth wither and dye, which hath beene often tryd.

For the breadth of it in ſome places is 10. miles, in others 8. miles, and in ſome 6. miles. The length of it is 100. dayes journey: I omit other matters, and ſo paſſe to the publike Workes and Buildings. The firſt is a faire great Marble Palace, beautified with Gold, which was built by the great <hi>Cham</hi> in the Citty <hi>Ciandu.</hi> And there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Citty, and another in the Citty <hi>Cambalu,</hi> built very curiouſly, and it is about 4. miles in compaſſe, every <hi>Quadrangle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a mile. It hath a very thick wall, which is 10. paces high. The outward ſuperficies of it is white and red. In the foure corners of the wall there is a faire great Palace, which is in ſtead of a Caſtle. And ſo likewiſe in the middle of the fore walls there is a faire Palace built, ſo that there are 8. Palaces in all. In theſe they keepe their Armour, their warlike Furniture, their Ordnance, their Bowes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, Quivers, Spurres, Bridles, Launces, Bowſtrings, and other things neceſſary in warre, and every ſeverall kinde of Armour is laid up and kept in ſeverall Palaces. But in the middle of them, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt Court is the Kings Palace, in which the King dwelleth. This Palace hath no Chambers, but the lower Pavement thereof is raiſed 10. hand breadths from the ground: The roofe is very high, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Pictures, the walls of the Court yards and dining-roomes, doe gliſter with Gold and Silver. At the firſt entrance there are faire Pictures to entertaine the eye, and warlike Hiſtories drawne foorth with gold and lively colours. The great <hi>Cham</hi> hath twelve Barons in his Court, who are Governours of his 34. Provinces: and it is their Office to appoint two Rectors or Governours in every Province, and they are to provide things neceſſary for the Kings Army whereſoever it be, and they acquaint the King with their purpoſes, who by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority confirmeth their determinations. Malefactors are puniſht in <hi>Tartary</hi> after this manner. If any one hath ſtolne ſome ſmall matter, which doth not deſerve death, he is beaten 7. times with a Staffe or Cudgell: and hath 17. blowes or ſtrokes given him at a time, or 27. blowes, or 47. according to the quality of his offence: untill at laſt they come to an hundred and 10. ſtripes or ſtrokes. And ſome doe die upon this beating. But if any one have ſtolne a Horſe or any other thing that deſerveth death, hee hath a Sword thruſt thorow him. But hee that will buy out his life, hee muſt reſtore nine times as much as that which he ſtole was worth. If any man or woman be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in adultery they are put to death by the Law. The Tartarians are devided into Hordes, which words ſignifies amongſt them a Tribe

or Company. And as they live in ſeverall Provinces farre diſtant one from another, ſo they are as farre diſtant and different one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in their manners and kinde of life. The men are of a ſtrong ſquare ſet ſtature, having broad fat faces, darke hollow eyes, having great rough Beards, but the reſt of their haire is ſhaven: they are ſtrong of body, and bold in courage, and can endure want and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: when they are on Horſeback, if they chance to bee hungry or thirſty, they cut their Horſes veines, and ſo drinke his blood. It is a prophane ard barbarous Nation, who make warre their right, and ſtrength and power their law. Many of them have no houſes, but doe live in Carts. And becauſe they wander from place to place, they doe uſually direct their courſe by the Starres, and eſpecially by the North Pole. They doe not tarry long in one place, for they thinke it a great unhappineſſe to continue long in the ſame place. They have on uſe of money, and therefore they exchange one thing for another. They ſay that they are Iſmaelites, and received the law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the yeere 1246. The Tartars doe feed on groſſe meat, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on fleſh, and that raw, or halfe ſod, and on Milke, and Cheeſe, but they abſtaine from Hogs-fleſh. They drinke Mares Milke, which they doe ſo temper, that it is like white wine, and is a ſavory well-taſted drinke. They feed very ſluttiſhly, for they neither uſe Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes or Napkins, neither doe they waſh their hands, bodies, or Garments. They drinke alſo Water and Milke, and a kinde of Beere made of Millet.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HINA is a large and potent Kingdome. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants doe call it <hi>Tame,</hi> and themſelves <hi>Tangis. Ptolomy</hi> calleth them <hi>Sinas,</hi> which <hi>Ortelius</hi> liketh of, whom the moſt doe follow, or their neighbours the Cathajans, which <hi>Mercator</hi> doth more approve of. All this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ſituate by the Eaſterne Ocean, and it is thought to bee the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Country Eaſtward. The bounds thereof on the Eaſt are the Eaſterne Sea; on the South the Province of <hi>Cauchinchina</hi>; on the Weſt <hi>Brachmana:</hi> on the North the Tartarians, a warlike Nation, from whom they are devided by the Mountaines, and a long Wall, which doe reach 500. miles. The Hiſtorians of <hi>China</hi> doe report that this Wall was built long ſince by a King whoſe name was <hi>Tzinzous,</hi> after that by his wiſedome he had freed the Inhabitants of this Country from the Tyranny of the Tartars, which they had endured 93. yeeres. This Country by reaſon of the goodneſſe of the ayre and ſoyle, and the induſtry of the people is very fruitfull. For the men are not ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but laborious, ſo that they ſcorne to live idlely. Whence it comes to paſſe that every corner of this Country doth produce and bring forth ſomething. They ſow the dry ground with Wheate and Barley. The plaine wet mooriſh places, with Rice, which they ſow foure times every yeere. The Hills and Mountaines have abundance of Pine-trees, betweene which they ſow Millet and Pulſe. So that every place and field beareth ſome fruit: and there are every where Gardens full of Roſes, and divers kindes of flowers and fruits. They have great ſtore of Hempe and Flaxe, and Woods of Mulberry Trees, for keeping of Silke-wormes. Moreover there is great ſtore of Gold, Silver, Braſſe, Iron, and other Mettals, alſo Pretious Stones, Pearles, Muske, Sugar, and Rheubarb: and that is thought to bee the beſt which is brought from thence thorow <hi>Perſia</hi> by Land: for ſome think that the Sea doth take away much vertue from it. This Kingdome alſo doth produce and yeeld a medicinable kinde of wood, which the people of <hi>China</hi> doe call <hi>Lampala,</hi> and we <hi>Radix Chinae,</hi> or the <hi>China</hi> Roote: and it is commonly us'd thorow all the Indies, againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes, the Palſie, and the French diſeaſe. The Roote of it is hard and heavy, and of a white colour. There are infinite ſtore of Cattell on the Mountaines, and in the Medowes. The Woods are full of Boares, Foxes, Hares, Cunnies, Sables, Martines, and other beaſts of the ſame kinde, whoſe skins are much uſed for lining of Garments.
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:14932:442"/>
So that it is both pleaſant and profitable hunting of them. There are alſo great plenty of Birds, eſpecially water Fowle, and ſuch great ſtore of Ducks, that in <hi>Canton</hi> which is one of the leaſt Citties of this Kingdome, 10. or 12. thouſand Duckes are ſpent in one day. And though this Country have great ſtore of Fowle, yet they make them increaſe by this meanes. In the Spring time they lay two or three thouſand Egges in the Sand, by the heate and warmth whereof young Duckes are hatched. And they doe the ſame in the Winter time but then they doe not lay their Egges in the Sand, but under a Wicker Basket or Pannier, on which they ſtrew warme aſhes, the heate whereof in ſome few dayes doth hatch the Egges. This Country is under one King and Monarch, whom the people call Lord of the World, and ſonne of Heaven. There are in it 250. chiefe Citties, whoſe names doe end in <hi>Fu:</hi> which ſignifies a Citty: as <hi>Cotonfu, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinfu.</hi> And their Townes, which are many doe end in <hi>Cheu.</hi> There are innumerable ſort of Villages which are inhabited, by reaſon of their continuall tillage and Husbandry. All the Citties are ſituate by the banke of ſome Navigable River, &amp; fortified with ſtrong walls, and deepe ditches. There are many pleaſant Lakes, as the round Lake in the Province of <hi>Sancius,</hi> which was made by an Inundation in the yeere 1557. which is memorable in regard that 7. Citties, beſides Townes and Villages, and a great number of people were drowned in it, onely one Boy ſaved in the body of a Tree. The Rivers and the Seas are full of Fiſh. And this Country becauſe it bordereth on the Sea, and hath many Navigable Rivers, is very populous both by Sea and Land. The Gates of their Citties are very magnificent and ſtately built. The ſtreetes are as ſtrait as if they were made by a line, and ſo broad, that 10. or 15. men may ride together in a ranke, and theſe are diſtinguiſht and ſeverd one from another with triumphall Arches, which doe grace the Citty very much. The Portugals doe report that they ſaw in the Citty <hi>Fuchus</hi> a Towre, which was built on 14. Marble Pillars, which were 40. hand breadth high, and 12. broade. This is ſuch a curious, beautifull, and coſtly worke, that it farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all the proud and magnificent ſtructures in Europe. They have faire Temples both in their Citties and in the Countrey. The King of <hi>China</hi> hath a Governour under him, who is as it were a Viceroy, whom they call <hi>Tutan.</hi> Hee judges and determines all ſuites and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies within the Kingdome, and is very ſevere in adminiſtring Juſtice. Theeves and murtherers are kept continually in priſon, untill they dye with whipping, and with hunger and cold. For though they are condemned to dye, which is for the moſt part by whipping, yet the execution is ſo long delayd after the ſentence is given, that the moſt part of thoſe which are condemned doe die in priſon. Hence it comes to paſſe that there are ſo many priſoners in every Citty: So that there are ſometimes a thouſand Priſoners in the Citty <hi>Canton.</hi> Theft (than which no crime is more hatefull in theſe parts) is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with whipping and cruell ſtripes. And this is the manner of their whipping. They ſet a man with his face bending downeward, with his hands bound behind him, and then they whipp him on the

thighs with a whipp made of Reedes and Canes, which giveth ſuch a vehement ſtroke, that the firſt blow will make the blood ſpring forth, and the ſecond blow will ſo torment the malefactor, that he cannot ſtand upon his feete. Two Beadles doe whipp him on both his thighs with ſuch vehemency, that the moſt of them do dye at the 50. or 60. ſtroke for al their ſinewes are broken. The Portugals report that every yeere above 2000. men are put to death in this manner. Their whipp is 5. fingers thick, and one broade, which they wet continually with water, that it may be more flexible, and may give the ſtronger blow. It is lawfull for the men to have many wives, one of which they keepe at home, and the reſt in other places. They puniſh adultery with death. In the Citties there are no Brothells, for all the whores are baniſht into the Suburbs. They celebrate their Nuptiall Feaſts, and weddings, at the time of the new Moone, and commonly in the Moneth of March, which is the firſt day of their new yeare. And they doe keepe theſe Feſtivalls with great ſolemnity, and for many dayes together, with Organs, Muſick, and Comicall Playes. The Chinoans have for the moſt part broad faces, thin beards, flat Noſes, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Eyes: yet ſome of them are well favoured enough. Their colour and complexion is like the Europeans, but they are ſomewhat browne, and ſwarfie that dwell about <hi>Canton.</hi> They ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goe out of their owne Countrey, neither doe they admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtranger to come into the innermoſt parts of their Countrey: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the King give him leave. They are as ſtout drinkers, as the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines and Dutchmen. Concerning the Religion of this Countrey, they beleeve that all things were created, that all things here below are governd from above, and from the Heaven: which they beleeve to be the greateſt of al the Gods, whom they expreſſe by the firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their Alphabet. They doe worſhip the Sunne, the Moone, and the ſtarres, and the Divell (whom they painte in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Europaeans doe) leaſt hee ſhould doe them harme as they ſay. The Chinoans are ſo neate in making all kind of houſehold ſtuffe, that they ſeeme rather the workes of nature then of Art. The uſe of Ordinance, and the Art of Printing is here of ſuch antiquity, that they know not the firſt Inventor thereof. The Portugalls doe write much concerning their ſagacitie and craftineſſe, and that they have Coaches, which will goe with Sayles, which they know ſo well how to guide, that they will make them in a ſhort time carry them by Land whither the liſt. Neither can I omit their cleare white kind of Potters ware, which wee call <hi>China</hi> ware, which they make in this manner. They mingle Sea ſnales or Periwinkles, with egge-ſhells, and putting ſome other things to them, they beate them till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one ſubſtance. Then they lay it under the ground, and there they let it lye to ſeaſon and ripen 80. or 100. yeare, and they leave it to their heyres as a precious treaſure, ſo that they commonly do come to uſe that which their Grandfathers firſt laid to ripen. And it is an ancient cuſtome obſervd amongſt them, that he that takes away the old muſt lay new in the place.

The Country hath a wholſome gentle ayre, yet it is ſo great that it hath a different climate in many places; for in ſome places it is hott name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the Aequator, and in other places temperate enough and rather cold towards the North. But the Countrey it ſelfe in generall both for the Situation, the ayre, and the fertility of the Soyle, doth farre exceede other parts of the world.

For they know not what belongs to Bonds and Morgages, and they lend without witneſſes or ſealing of Bonds, even upon their owne words. Hee that is found and convinced do have borne falſe witneſſe, hath the tops of his fingers cut off. Hee that depriveth another of any members, is not onely puniſhed in the ſame member, but his hand is alſo cut off. But if any man deprive an Artificer or Tradeſman of his hand or eye, it is death.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE followeth in our method the <hi>Molucco</hi> Ilands with others, which are famous thorow the World for abundance of ſweet Spices and eſpecially Cloves. There are five Ilands which are comprehended under this name, <hi>Ternate,</hi> or <hi>Tarante, Tidor</hi> or <hi>Theodori, Motir</hi> or <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thil, Machian</hi> or <hi>Mare,</hi> and <hi>Bachian</hi> or <hi>Bachianum.</hi> They lye under the Aequinoctiall betweene the Ilands <hi>Celebes</hi> and <hi>Gilolo.</hi> The greateſt of them is ſcarce 6. miles in compaſſe: and all of them are not above 25. miles in compaſſe. The Ayre is very unwholeſome, and many Merchants that come to trade, doe die here. The ſoyle is dry, and ſpongie, ſo that it preſently drinkes in all the raine that falls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can runne into the Sea. It doth bring forth many Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and ſweet Spices, as Nutmegs, Maſtick, Aloes, Saunders, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Ginger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pepper, and Cloves, of all which it hath wonderfull great ſtore. It yeeldeth no kinde of food, but that which is gotten by exchange of theſe commodities. There are alſo in the <hi>Molucco</hi> Ilands ſuch great Canes, that the Inhabitants doe make Tunnes and Hogſheads of them. The Clove Tree groweth out of the Rocks, and afte 4. yeeres growth, it beareth fruit. The Leaves of this Tree both for ſhape and thickneſſe are like the leaves of a Bay Tree. The Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes doe put forth like Fennell ſeed, and are like the Bloſſomes of an Orange Tree. The Fruit as ſoone as the Bloſſome is fallen off, buddeth forth like a Naile, whence it is called a Clove from <hi>Clavus,</hi> which ſignifies a Naile, becauſe a Clove is like a Naile. At the firſt they are red, but afterward the heat of the Sunne maketh them waxe black: and they ſprinkle them with Salt-water to harden them and make them laſt the better. And theſe Trees grow thick together, like a Wood. The Inhabitants doe part theſe Trees among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and doe hide the fruit of them, that they may ſell it to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. In theſe Ilands there is a kinde of Bird called <hi>Manucodiata,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſſe of a Magpie, and halfe a foote long: The head of it is not round but flat like a Swallowes, and it hath a long forked tayle, but no feete, ſo that it flyeth continually, and liveth by the ayre. On the fore part of the head it hath feathers as ſmall as an haire. It is of a freſh bright greene colour, like the greene feathers of a wilde Ducke, or an Emerald. Under the throate it hath ſmall ſhort feathers, which are yellow, or of a Citron or Orange colour, and the breaſt is brighter. The uppermoſt part of the neck from the head is coverd with thick feathers, of a ſooty colour, which reaching to the tayle, doe ſpread abroad, and are there of a lighter colour. The belly of it is of the ſame colour, and it is as bigge beneath as above. The
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:14932:447"/>
wings of it being ſpread forth, are halfe a foote in breadth. And the feathers are underneath of a Box colour, and thoſe about are white and halfe ſpeckled with blacke. The Quills of the Feathers doe not ſtick in the wings, but ſtand off from them, ſo that the winde and ayre may paſſe thorow them. If this Bird light there they ſuperſtitiouſly beleeve that it is ſent from Heaven or from <hi>Mahumets</hi> Paradiſe. And they make ſo great account of it, that Kings thinke themſelves ſafe in Battle by the protection therof, albeit according to their cuſtome they place themſelves in the forefront. The chiefeſt of theſe Ilands are <hi>Tidor</hi> and <hi>Ternate,</hi> the laſt of which hath two convenient Havens. The Inhabitants of theſe Ilands are Heathens, and doe worſhip the Sunne and Moone as Gods: they aſcribe the government of the day to the Sunne, and of the Night to the Moone, and they ſay that the Sunne is a Man, and the Moone a Woman, and they call them the Father and Mother of the other Starres, all of which they account to be the leſſer Gods. They doe ſalute and reverence the riſing Sunne with certaine Verſes, and alſo the Moone when it ſhineth by night, and doe pray unto her for Children, that their Cattell may proſper, and the Earth may be fruitfull, and ſuch other matters. But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Piety and Juſtice, and eſpecially they love Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and doe hate Warres. Theſe <hi>Molucco</hi> Ilands were diſcover'd by CHARLES the fifth, concerning which I will diſcourſe, becauſe it is worthy of memory. When there aroſe a diſſention betweene the Portugals in the Eaſt, and the Caſtellanians in the Weſt, both ſtriving to enlarge their Princes Territories: that the one might not hinder the other, the new world, by the authority of Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the ſixth, and others, was devided into two parts: and Articles and Conditions drawne betweene them, that whatſoever ſhould bee diſcoverd by any voyage made from the Ilands of the Atlantick Sea, which are commonly call'd the <hi>Heſperides</hi> toward the Eaſt, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Portugals: and whatſoever was diſcover'd Weſtward ſhould belong to the Caſtellanians; ſo the latter diſcover'd <hi>America:</hi> and the former the moſt parts of the Eaſt, and in proceſſe of time the deſire of gaine drew them on ſo farre, that it is ſaid they encroached on the part which was adjudged to the Caſtellanians: which contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie cannot be decided unleſſe <hi>Ferdinando Magellanus</hi> be made Judge thereof. For he being a Portugall and hating his Prince <hi>Emanuel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not rewarded him for the ſervice he had done him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Moluccoes by the former diviſion did belong to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellanians, and being ſent in the yeere 1519. by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, to diſcover the aforeſaid Ilands by a new way, he ſo caſt and framed his voyage, that having ſayled from <hi>Spaine</hi> 52. degrees Southward, and then bending his courſe Weſtward, hee ſayld round about by the lower Hemiſphere, and ſo at laſt his Ships arrived in the Eaſt at the <hi>Molucco</hi> Ilands which he ſought.

Cinamon, which <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth is ſometimes found in Birds Neſts, and eſpecially in the Phoenix Neſt, is the Barke of a Shrub, which is like a Pomegranate Tree. This Barke when it gapeth and cleaveth with the heat of the Sunne is tooke off from the Tree, and ſo being hardned in the Sunne, it becomes Cinamon, and becauſe it is long like a Reede or Cane it is commonly call'd Canella or Cinamon rinde.

He rayles at him being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and chafes at the Elephant and maketh him carry back the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen veſſell againe. He doth ſo, and in a grumbling manner flings it at the Smith. He ſpeakes him faire meaning to cozen him againe, and taking his Hammer makes a ſhow as if he meant to ſtop and cloſe up the leakes, but he would not be deceived againe: for he takes the braſſe Kettle and carries it to the River, dippes it in, and fills it with water, to trie it. He ſeeing it runne out and leake, being very angry runnes back to the Smith, and brayes at him aloud. The neighbours flock together, and among them the Vice-Roy. The Smith ſtrives to mittigate the Elephants anger with faire words, and at laſt takes the Veſſell and mends it very well. But the Elephant would not truſt him, goes back to the River, drawes up water with it, and when hee ſaw that it held water, hee turned himſelfe to thoſe that ſtood neere him, and ſhewd them it, and call'd them as it were to witneſſe what he had done, and ſo at laſt went home: So much I have thought good to inſert, for variety ſake, which is the beſt prevention for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in reading.

In this Iland there are 8. Citties, the chiefe whereof is <hi>Colmuchi.</hi> Here many Ships are loaden with Cinamon, Elephants, and Pretious Stones. The Portugals have a Caſtle here which they built by the Kings permiſſion. The Haven is large and ſafe. Moreover it hath 6. chiefe Havens, beſides others of leſſe account. The Iland is very Mountainous, and there is a high Mountaine which the Inhabitants doe call <hi>Pico de Adam.</hi> For the Indians doe verily beleeve that Paradiſe was there, and that God there created <hi>Adam,</hi> and moreover they ſay that the print of our firſt Parents feete may be yet ſeene, being above two hand-breadths long. <hi>Ludovick Patritius</hi> writeth from the relation of one <hi>Mercator</hi> a Mahometan, that there is on the top of this Mountaine a certaine Cave, in which all the Inhabitants of this Country did dwell in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our firſt Parents: for the Inhabitants doe report, that <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, did there with penitence, teares, and continence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme and ranſome himſelfe from his firſt fault. The ſame Author doth report that there is another very high Mountaine, at the foote whereof Carbuncles are found, which are commonly called Rubies. Here is ſuch great ſtore of excellent Cinamon, ſo that they have whole Woods of Cinamon trees. The Inhabitants of the Sea Coaſt are for the moſt part Mahumetans: the Mediterraneans Gentiles, (whom they call <hi>Cingales</hi>) they are of a white colour, a large ſtatute, and great bellies ſticking forth, for they love to feed their bellies. But they are weake, cowardly, and unfit for matters of Warre. The ſame <hi>Ludovick</hi> writeth that they doe not uſe Ordnance, Gunnes, nor Iron: but their armes are reedes, ſo that they are ſeldome ſlaine in the warres. But they are uery ingenious, and doe make many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workes of Gold, Silver, Iron, and Ivory. And now they make Musket Barrels, as if they were caſt by ſome Artificer. The aforeſaid <hi>Linſcotanus</hi> doth often tell us, that an Image of the Croſſe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to an Archbiſhop, which an Artificer of <hi>Zeilon</hi> had made of Ivory, being an Ell long, and ſo cunningly he had wrought it, that the haire, the beard, and the face of it, did reſemble a living man, and likewiſe the ſtature: ſo that the like hath not beene ſeene in <hi>Europe.</hi> So that the Biſhop having put it in a Cheſt ſent it to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as a precious Jewell worthy to bee eſteemed of ſo great a King.

and nature teacheth them that which is right without lawes. They went commonly naked. And in their marriages they obſerved a ſtrange kinde of cuſtome: for the Bridegroome did not lye with his Bride the firſt night, but if he were a Gentleman, a Gentleman did ſupply his place, but if the Bridegoome were a Merchant or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, than a Mercbant or Country-man did ſupply their places. The men did repudiate and put away their Wives for any light cauſe. But the Women could not put away their Husbands for any cauſe: the men were very luſtfull and obſcene. The Spaniards found it well inhabited with people, but now it is inhabited onely by Spaniards, becauſe the native Inhabitants are all dead partly by famine, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the veneriall diſeaſe, and beſides after that <hi>Cortes</hi> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and planted himſelfe in this Iland, they carried the moſt part of the Inhabitants into new <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo that there is ſcarcely one Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an now upon the whole Iland.</p>

New <hi>Spaine</hi> is ſituate by <hi>Mare del Nort,</hi> or the Northerne Sea. The Spaniards have here two Colonies, namely <hi>Panuca,</hi> and S. <hi>Iames</hi> of the Valleyes Colonie. Laſtly, there is in new <hi>Spaine</hi> the Citty <hi>Tlaſcalan,</hi> which is ſecond to <hi>Mexico,</hi> which is very populous and rich, and hath a fruitfull ſoyle round about it, it is governd like a Common-wealth, but it is under the poſſeſſion of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> There are in new <hi>Spaine</hi> many Lakes, which are for the moſt part ſo ſalt, that Salt is made out of them. The chiefe Lake is that, which in regard of the bigneſſe thereof is call'd the Chapalican Sea. There is alſo the Lake of the Citty <hi>Mexico.</hi> There are alſo many Rivers in it full of Fiſh, ſome of which have golden Sands. There are alſo Crocodiles in them which the Inhabitants doe eate. The Country alſo is full of Mountaines and rugged Rocks. In the Province of <hi>Mexico</hi> there is a flaming Mountaine, which the Inhabitants call <hi>Popocampeche.</hi> There is alſo a Mountaine in the Country <hi>Guaſtecan,</hi> in which there are two Fountaines, the one of black Pitch, the other of hot red Pitch. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this Country is full of Woods, and generally it hath great ſtore of Trees, eſpecially of that Tree of which they make Boates or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noas of one bough. It hath alſo Cedars which are ſo tall and thicke, that they cut ſquare timber out of them, which is 120. foote long, and 12. broad, and ſuch great ſtore of it, that you may ſay that Ceders doe grow as commonly on their Mountaines, as Oakes doe on ours. I come to the publike workes. There were in theſe parts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies many faire and magnificent Temples conſecrated to Idols, and ordained for the worſhip of the Divell, which the Spaniards hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Cu.</hi> Firſt there was in the Citty <hi>Mexico</hi> the famous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Vitziliputzli,</hi> being very large within. But the care which the Mexicans ſhew in educating and bringing up their children is very ſtrange, for they know aſſuredly that there is nothing, which avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth more to the right ordering of publike or private matters, than the inſtruction of children. The Indians are cunning Artificers in Mechanick Arts, eſpecially in weaving of divers ſorts of Birds fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Beaſts skins: and they are ſo painefull and laborious, that oftentimes they doe not eate in a whole day, untill they have coyned and neately filled ſome one feather, and then they view it on every ſide, both in the Sunne and in the ſhade, that they may ſee whether it will become them to weare it with their haire ſtanding on end, or lying on either ſide. So that they will preſently make any kinde of Beaſt, or Flower, or Hearbe, and ſet it forth to the life. The Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths are the chiefe Artificers, and are more cunning than the reſt, ſo that they will expreſſe a thing to the life: and they are excellent caſters of mettall, ſo that they will caſt either any Hearbe or the ſmalleſt thing ſo lively, that you ſhall thinke it to be naturall. The Citty of <hi>Mexico</hi> hath the beſt government and policy of all new <hi>Spaine.</hi> For it being the Metropolis of the whole Empire, divers Nations of the ſame Country did flock thither to trade and traffique, ſo that ſeverall Nations kept their ſeverall places, and every 5. dayes they kept markets, which were well furniſhed with all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

It was ſo called from <hi>Magellan</hi> who diſcoverd this narrow Sea. Of whoſe skill and experience which hee ſhewed in finding out the <hi>Molucco</hi> Ilands by a Voyage made Weſtward, wee have ſpoken other wheres. He on the 24. of Auguſt when the winde ſtood faire, weighed Anchor out of S. <hi>Iulians</hi> Bay, where he had laine a long time, being not vexed ſo much with windes and high Seas, as the civell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions of the Caſtellanians and Portugals. After hee ſayled ſome dayes Southward, hee came to the Promontory of the holy Croſſe. Here one of his Ships runne a ſhore, but the Men, Ordnance, and fraight was ſaved. Afterward when he obſerved that the ſhore did bend a little from the South Eaſtward, hee began to bee in hope of reaching the Straites. And on the 26. of November this narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was diſcover'd, into which <hi>Magellan</hi> with foure other Ships en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. Here they thought good to ſtay in a certaine Bay, and to ſend 3. Ships before to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound the paſſage, and to make diſcovery. One of the Ships in which was <hi>Alvarus Meſchita,</hi> having paſt thorow, ſtood out to Sea againe, and ſo directing their courſe Northward, it was brought firſt to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and afterward to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and 8. moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had left their company, <hi>Alvarus</hi> was brought before <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> as a Captive. The third Ship made report that it was a ſtraite narrow Sea, by obſerving the flowing and ebbing of the Sea. It was the Moneth of November and the night was five houres long, the ſhore on the right hand and the left, or the Starbord and Larbord ſhore was very ſolitary and no creature to be ſeene, but that on the left ſide they ſaw a great fire. And this was the cauſe why they called that Country <hi>Terra del Fuego,</hi> and they ſuppoſed that the Inhabitants had diſcoverd them. <hi>Magellan</hi> having left 2. Ships in this manner, he furniſhed the other according as was fitt for the preſent occaſion, and diſcovering all as he went, two and twenty dayes after he entred the Bay or Straite he was brought into another Sea, which for the quiet peaceableneſſe thereof he called <hi>Mar del Zur,</hi> or <hi>Mare P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="926" facs="tcp:14932:472"/>
for ſometimes it is 2. or 3. miles broad, and ſometimes 10. or 5. and where it is narroweſt it is a mile broad. The Northerne Sea on the Eaſt ſide is carried betweene the Straites of either land 70. miles and more, where it mingleth with the Southerne Sea, on the Weſt ſide winding thorow thoſe Promontories, it meeteth with the Northerne Sea, where their Waves meete very violently, and with a great noiſe, ſo that all the Sea is coverd with froth. The Southerne Sea doth flow and ebbe more gently, for the Weſterne part of the Bay being very deepe and broader<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Eaſterne part of the Straites is full of Flats and Sands, and many Ilands, which cauſeth the raging and troubleſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Seas: on either Shore there are high trees. Moreover, when <hi>Magellan</hi> had layne halfe a yeere in theſe Southerne parts, hee viewed and diſcoverd nothing but the ſhoares, but the innermoſt parts of the Country remained unknowne, but yet it is manifeſt that that part which lyeth Southward, is moſt of it a Mountainous, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Country, and hath Snow continuall upon it.

Thoſe that have deſcribed the new World, doe ſay that this Sea is deepeſt about the unfortunate Ilands, which are now knowne by the name of <hi>Tuberones</hi> and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Ilands, and that it hath Pearles on the Coaſt of <hi>Peruvia:</hi> and that there are in it 7440. Ilands, ſo that ſome doe not undeſervedly call the Weſterne part of it the <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> becauſe this is full of Ilands like the Aegean Sea, which containe the <hi>Ciclades,</hi> the <hi>Sporades,</hi> and many other ſcattering Ilands, and it is commonly call'd the Italian <hi>Archipelagus. Francis Vlloa</hi> and <hi>Antonius Pigiafelta</hi> doe relate that there groweth in the Sea a certaine kinde of Hearbe which is 14. or 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Cabits high, and that it groweth about the Sea 4. or 5. Cubits high, ſo that it ſeemeth not to grow in the Sea but in a greene Meddow. I with <hi>Ortelius</hi> doe ſuppoſe this to be that which <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> doe mention out of <hi>Megaſthenes,</hi> namely, that all the Eaſterne Ocean, or Indian Sea is coverd with Woods. And that place in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is agreeable hereunto, who writeth that the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians who inhabited <hi>Gadyra,</hi> when they had ſayled beyond <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, arrived at certaine Countries which were full of weedes and Reedes. <hi>Polibius</hi> writeth that the Sea which waſheth <hi>Portugall</hi> hath Oakes in it. Adde to this that which <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> hath 4. <hi>Hiſtor. Plantar.

But of theſe things enough. The Southerne people are of a lowe ſtature, but the Northerne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are of a great large ſtature, ſo that they are commonly 11. or 13. foote high, they are of a white colour as our Northerne people: but have ſuch loude horrible voices, ſo that it is more like the lowing of an Oxe, or the braying of an Elephant, than a humane ſound. And they are ſo agill and nimble that they will out-runne and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Deere, ſo that they are hardly wounded with a Musket ſhot, unleſſe they goe in troopes together, or at unawares. And this is an Argument of their ſtrength, the one of them will take up an Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhead of Wine and bring it a Ship-boord, and 3. or foure will hale a Ship from the ſhoare, which 30. of our men can hardly doe. The cauſe of their whiteneſſe and largeneſſe of ſtature is attributed to the coldneſſe and humidity or moiſtneſſe of the Country, becauſe the Country being alwaies loaden with Snow, maketh it continuall Winter. It is a very barbarous and cruell Nation, and hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humanity, but are onely ledde by the inſtinct of nature like

When they would ſhew a ſtranger ſome token of friendſhip or goodwill, which they doe very ſeldome, among their Songs and Dances, they caſt duſt upon their Heads, or if they ſee others doe it they eſteeme it as a rare complement of friendſhip. When they goe to Warre they chuſe a Captaine, unto whom they are all obedient, the moſt of them are ſo cunning and skilfull in their Bowes, that they will hit whatſoever they ayme at, and when an Arrow ſticketh in a Planck of a Ship, it can hardly be pulled forth againe. They have great Bowes, and they make their Bowſtrings of wilde beaſts guts, and as bigge as ones Thumb: they are armed alſo with great woodden ſwords; and they uſe the ſling, with which they will hit any thing they ayme at within their reach. And thus they defend their liberty though to no purpoſe, for no man will take the paines to goe unto thoſe cold Countries, and there to fight with theſe bloody Giants for no reward. The Inhabitants doe clothe themſelves with the skins of wilde beaſts and Sea-wolves, which they hunt every day. There are alſo Eſtriches, with whoſe feathers they adorne and deck themſelves, and they make holes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their faces, in which they put a greene kinde of Marble, they get their food and cloathing by hunting. And they deſire to take Sea-wolves not ſo much for their fleſh as for their skinnes, for they have found by often experience that their fleſh is hard and unſavory. There are alſo great ſtore of Whales, with the bones thereof they build them Cottages.
