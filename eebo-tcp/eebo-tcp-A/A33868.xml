         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FOrasmuch as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
being served with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48191:5"/>
to answer, may by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Council upon sight of
the Bill, only be enabled to
demurre thereunto, if there be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause,
or may by like advice
be enabled to put in any just
plea which he hath in disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the person of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
or to the jurisdiction of
the Court: It is therefore
Ordered, That such Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
or such plea in disability,
or to the jurisdiction of the
Court, under the hand of
Council learned, shall be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and filed, although the
Defendant do not deliver the
same in person, or by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And therefore if the
Defendant shall pray a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48191:6"/>
and thereby return
Demurrer only, or only such
plea, which shall be afterward
over-ruled, the Defendant shall
pay five marks costs: and a
though it be allowed, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
shall have no costs in
respect of the Plaintiffs need|
less trouble occasion'd by such
Commission.</p>
               <p>Every Demurrer shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the several causes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer,
and shall be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in open Court. And such
pleas also as are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the substance and body of
the matter, or extend to the
jurisdiction of the Court, shall
be determined in open Court,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48191:6"/>
And for that purpose, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
is to enter the same
with the Register, within
eight dayes after the filing
thereof; or in default of such
entry made, the same shall be
disallowed of course, as put in
for delay. And the Plaintiff
may then take out process to
enforce the Defendant to
make a better answer, and pay
forty shillings costs: and the
same shall not afterwrads be
admitted to be set down or
debated, unless upon moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it shall be Ordered by the
Court: And if any cause of
Demurrer shall arise, and be
insisted on at the debate of
the Demurrer (more than is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48191:7"/>
particularly alledged, yet the
Defendant shall pay the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
costs of Over-ruling
a Demurrer (which is here|
by Ordered to be five marks
costs) if those causes which
are particularly alledged be
disallowed: although the
Bill, in respect of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
so newly alledged
shall be dismissed by the
Court.</p>
               <p>A Plea of Outlawry, as
it be in any suit for that
duty, touching which relief
is sought by the Bill, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
according to the
Rule of Law, and shall be
disallowed of course as put
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48191:7"/>
in for delay: And the
Plaintiff may notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Plea, take out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to enforce the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
to make a better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and pay five Marks
costs; otherwise a plea of
Outlawry is alwayes a good
plea, so long as the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry
remaineth in force:
And therefore the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
shall not be put to
set it down with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
And after the said
Outlawry reversed, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
upon a new <hi>subpoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
served on him, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto him of twenty
shillings costs, shall answer
the same Bill, as if such
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48191:8"/>
Outlawry had not been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But if the Plaintiff conceive
such plea of Outlawry tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
mispleading, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be insufficient, he
may, upon notice given to
the Clerk on the other side,
set it down with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to be debated with
the rest of the Plea's and
Demurrers in course: But
if the Plaintiff shall not in
such Case enter it with the
Register within eight dayes
after the same shall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Defendant may
take out process against the
Plaintiff for his Ordinary
costs of five marks, as if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48191:8"/>
the same had been heard.</p>
               <p>The Dependancy of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
suit for the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is also a good plea, and
therefore the Defendant shall
not be put to set it down
with the Register; But if
the Plaintiff be not satisfied
therewith, the same shall
be referred to one of the
Masters of the Court to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the truth thereof; and
if it shall be determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Plaintiff, he shall
pay five pounds costs to
the Defendant; But such
reference shall be procured
by the Plaintiff, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thereupon within one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48191:9"/>
month after the filing of
such plea, otherwise the
Bill to stand dismist of course
with the ordinary costs of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Nobles.</p>
               <p>If after a suit commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the Common Law,
or any other inferiour Court, a
Bill shall be exhibited in this
Court to be relieved for
the same matter, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy
of the former suit
shall be admitted as a good
plea, and the Defendant
not be put to motions for
an Election or Dismission,
and that plea shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in, as in case of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48191:9"/>
a plea of a former suit
depending in this Court for
the same matter.</p>
               <p>After a Contempt duly
prosecuted to an Attachment
with proclamation returned,
no Commission to answer
shall be made; nor no plea
or demurrer admitted, but
upon motion in Court, and
Affidavit made of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
inability to travel, or
other good matter to satisfie
the Court touching that delay.</p>

cause to dispence with
so positive an answer: And
if the Defendant deny the
fact, he must traverse or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it (as the cause requires)
directly, and not by way
of negative pregnant. As if
he be charged with a receipt
of a summe of money, he
must deny or traverse that
he hath not received that sum,
or any part thereof, or else set
forth what part he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And if a fact be laid to be
done with divers circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48191:11"/>
the Defendant must not
deny or traverse it literally, as
it is laid in the bill, but must
answer the point of substance
positively and certainly.</p>

answered, the Plaintiffs and
their Council are seriously to
advise of the Answers, and if
they find that upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

proof, there be sufficient
ground for a final Order or
Decree, to proceed upon the
Answer without further leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
of the cause. Or if it
be needful to prove one or
a few particular points to reply
unto those points, and not to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48191:11"/>
draw into pleading or proofs
any more than those necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
points, thereby making
wrong books, and putting
both sides to unnecessary
Charges, the Defaulters
herein to be punished by
paying the charge of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
or otherwise, as the cause
shall require.</p>
               <p>If a hearing be pray'd
upon Bill and Answer, the
Answer must be admitted
to be true in all points,
and no other Evidence to
be admitted, unless it be

who shall give any such Fees
or Reward, or make any such
Contract or Agreement, shall
be from thenceforth dispauper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48191:44"/>
and not be afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
again in that Suit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secure
in <hi>forma pauperis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it shall be made appear to
the Court, That any person
prosecuting in <hi>forma pauperis,</hi>
hath sold or contracted for the
benefit of the Suit, or any part
thereof, whiles the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
such cause shall be from
thenceforth totally dismissed
the Court, and never again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>Such Councel or Atturney
as shall be assigned by the
Court, to assist the person ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>in forma pauperis,</hi> either
to prosecute or defend, may
not refuse so to do, unlesse they
satisfie the Lord Chancellour,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48191:44"/>
or Lord Keeper of <hi>England,</hi> or
Master of the Rolls, who
granted the admittance, with
some good reason of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</p>
               <p>That Councellour who
shall move any thing to the
Court, on the behalf of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
admitted <hi>in forma pauperis,</hi>
ought to have the Order of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
with him, and first
to move the same before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motion. And if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
shall finde that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was not admitted <hi>in forma
pauperis,</hi> he shall not draw up
any Order upon the second
motion, made by any such
Councel, but he shall lose the
fruit of such second motion, in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48191:45"/>
respect of his abuse to the
Court.</p>
               <p>No process of Contempt
shall be made forth, and sent to
the Great Seal, at the Suit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
person prosecuting as Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
<hi>in forma Pauperis,</hi> until it
be signed by the six Clerk, who
deals for him and the six Clerks,
are to take care, that such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
be not taken out needlesly,
or for vexation, but upon just
and good grounds, as they will
answer it to the Court, if the
contrary shall appear.</p>
               <p>And lastly, It is Ordered,
that all Masters of the Court
of Chancery, Councellors, and
all Officers, Ministers, Clerks,
and Solicitors in the said Court,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48191:45"/>
do observe these Orders, which
are to continue, until upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
any Alterations shall be
thought fit to be made therein.</p>
