            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as much then as it hath pleased the great God to bring Your Majesty and Parliament together, let no man dare to put asunder: and yet so it is, that there are many in these dayes who desires nothing so much, as to make a difference between Your Majesty and your Parliament, but beleeve it, Sir, who ever they are, they are no friend to <hi>Caesar,</hi> how ever, I will smite <hi>David</hi> to the wall, is become profitable to the Church and State, and well it is for the innocent that wicked men cannot keep their owne counsels, God fetcheth their thoughts out of their mouths, or their countenance to be a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable prevention to the godly, which otherwise might proceed to a present execution for your Parliament; they are even wearied both from <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> with several complaints, and they have a long time tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, as it were, with child, and fain would they bring forth a son, but behold there is no strength to bring forth; that Counties and Cities petition, sure it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have just cause of complaint, let then the sighes of the poore come before You, and since Your Majesty have refused to heare the Petition of both Houses by the hands of the Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; call to mind the saying of <hi>Iob, If I did despise</hi> (saith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>the cause of my man servant, or of my maid ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when they contended with mee, what then shall I doe when God riseth up, and when he visiteth, what shall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> True it is, by reason of some evill minded people, the Crown is become full of cares, and many that have brought your Majesty into them, have with <hi>Orpha</hi> left

you, and the more to blame they. For to ingage Your Majesty in an Action, the successe whereof can be but slight and of small moment, whereas the miscarrying may beget dangerous defects to Your Majesty and the whole State, and better it were for Your Majestie to fore-see the dangers at first, and prevent them, or desist from the motion; for Your Parliament they have met with many fears, difficulties and oppositions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have already stayed the tyde, yet untill I saw them remaine firme and constant, I had thought that both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had died without issue, but me thinks I see them now quitting themselves like men, and are not willing to suffer three Kingdoms to perish, for that they cannot preserve it by ordinary wayes, and it is not fit a father should suffer his son to be drowned for feare of pulling him out by the haire of the head; and sure I am, it were lawfull to cure a sick man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking his consent, if he were capable of remedies: For Your Parliament, they seek not themselves, if they had, they would have been wearied after so much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour afore now, how ever for discharging of their duty they are defamed, despised, and neglected of many, yet I doubt not but God whose battels they fight will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a due reward of their patience, and sure I am Your Majsty is happie in them, though You will not come nigh them, nor be ruled by them: But know, if You still withstand them, halfe the thanks will be lost, besides al this while You loseth Honour; for by reason of Your evill Councellours men are not apt to beleeve You: Wherefore, O King, give me leave to say unto you as <hi>Ioab</hi> said to the King, <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>Now therefore arise and speak comfortable to Your people</hi>; and if You doe not, the Parliaments enemies will at length be Yours, and

that will bee worse unto you than all the evill that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell you from your youth untill now. But if your Majesty will yet hearken unto them, you will winne them to obedience with kindnesse, and in so doing, you will make good that which you were sent for, whose care ought to bee imployed for the good of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, knowing that their love is your greatest safety, and their prosperity your greatest Honour and felicity, and this is that, which will make your bed easie for you when you shall possesse the just title to the Crowne, with the love of your people, and sure I am that the countenance of it with the willing applause of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the nighest way to a blessing: true it is, were it not for Flatterers and evill Councellors your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would appeare just men unto your Majesty, The Lord Jesus Christ had many enemies, but there was made known one <hi>Iudas:</hi> Your Parliament have many <hi>Iudases,</hi> but one enemie, and if your Majesty would know him, it is he that hates to be reformed; and for your Parliament, they may justly take up the saying of <hi>David,</hi> and were it Papist or an open enemie that should envie them, and so speak evill of them, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was not so great: but as <hi>David</hi> said when his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend that eat bread at his table and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together: <hi>This, even this, is that which troubled him.</hi> Most gracious Soveraign, if You love God, set Your selfe against this kind of men (that set Your Majesty against Your Parliament, and call to remembrance the principall contrivers of former plots, doubtlesse they that now blow the coales will heat the fornace; they owe you a good turn, and will (if they can) pay it, You see their hearts by their deeds; prove Your faith so too, the best worke that you can doe, is to doe the best

you can against them, or suffer it to bee done upon them. I must confesse the Church and State alwayes thrived, and was made a gainer by forraigne Jarres, but by home-division it loseth honour, and suffereth much by civill warres, the Lord so assist Your Majesty that You gaine peace at home, that so You need not care with whom You war abroad: the Church of God was twice preserved in AEgypt, in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in Christ; and who knows but that Your Majesty a fourth time, nay, forever may be a means to preserve a Church to God: true it is, there is <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and much adoe about the setling of the government of the Church.
