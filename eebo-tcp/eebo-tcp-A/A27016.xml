            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I take it for no ſmall mercy that I have been ſo much employed about the Great and
<pb facs="tcp:59464:3"/>
Neceſſary things, in deſpight of all the malice of Satan, who would have entangled me, and taken up my time, in perſonal vindications and barren controverſies. As I never knew that I had one enemy in the world that ever was <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me;</hi> ſo thoſe that <hi>know me,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading me from Apologies againſt the <hi>accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of thoſe that <hi>know me not,</hi> have ſpared my time for better work. Though there is about fifty writings (in whole or part) againſt me publiſhed, (by <hi>Infidels, Seekers, Familiſts, Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, Quakers, Papiſts, Antinomians, Levellers, Covenant-breakers, State-ſubverters, Church-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> beſides <hi>impatient diſſenting Brethren,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants</hi> that took it for the riſing way), I yet find no cauſe (as to the <hi>preſent age,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that know me</hi>) to be at any great care or pains for a defence; while malicious lyes do but make men wonder, that wrinkled Envy ſhould be ſo mad as to come ſo naked on the Stage, and ſhew her ugly deformities to the world, and could not ſtay at leaſt till Wit had helpt her to a Cloak.</p>
                  <p>I was alſo when I firſt intended <hi>Writing</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another temptation; being of their mind that thought that nothing ſhould be made publike, but what a man had firſt laid out his
<pb facs="tcp:59464:3"/>
choiceſt art upon; I thought to have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world with nothing but what was the work of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Diligence:</hi> But my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſoon told me, that there was too much of Pride and Selfiſhneſs in this; and that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal</hi> required me to lay by the affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſtile, and ſpare that induſtrie, which tended but to advance my name with men, when it hindred the main work, and croſt my end: And Providence drawing forth ſome popular unpoliſhed Diſcourſes, and giving them ſucceſs beyond my expectation, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rebuke my ſelfiſh thoughts, and ſatisfie me that the <hi>Truths of God</hi> do perform their work more by <hi>their Divine Authority,</hi> and <hi>proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and <hi>material Excellency,</hi> than by any <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>fleſhly wiſdom:</hi> and (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) though I will not deſpiſe an <hi>elegant Phyſicion,</hi> yet will I not think my ſelf much the happyer, for his adding eloquence to his healing art. Being encouraged then by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> I venture theſe popular Sermons into the world; and eſpecially for the uſe of you, my late Auditors, that heard them. I bleſs God that, when more worthy Labourers are fain to weep over their obſtinate, unprofitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful people, and ſome are driven away by
<pb facs="tcp:59464:4"/>
their injuries, and put to ſhake off the duſt of their feet againſt them; I am rather forced to weep over my own unthankful heart, that did not ſufficiently value the mercy of a faithful flock, who parted with me rather as the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. and who have lived according to this <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary</hi> doctrine which they have received: Among whom Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that perſwade men that our doctrine tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to diviſions, can find no diviſions or ſects: Who have conſtantly diſowned both the <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious uſurpations</hi> which have <hi>ſhaken</hi> the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and the <hi>Factions, Cenſoriouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>cruel vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> which <hi>Pride</hi> hath <hi>generated</hi> and <hi>nouriſhed</hi> in this trying Age. Among whom I have enjoyed ſo very large a proportion of mercy, in the liberty of ſo long an exerciſe of my Miniſtry, with ſo unuſual advantage and ſucceſs, that I muſt be diſingenuouſly unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if I ſhould murmure and repine at the preſent reſtraining hand of God: But I muſt ſay with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 25. [<hi>If I ſhall find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again and ſhew me the Ark and habitation</hi> (There or elſwhere uſe me in his ſervice): <hi>But if he ſay, I have no delight in thee, behold here I am, let him do to me as it ſeemeth good unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59464:4"/>And now with this Treatiſe, let me leave you theſe few ſeaſonable requeſts.</p>
                  <p>1. Be faithful to your faithful Paſtors: Think not that you can live in <hi>order</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> without their Miniſtry. When you can, attend their <hi>publike Miniſtry!</hi> Refuſe not their <hi>more private help:</hi> Read well my two ſheets for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: Where the <hi>lawful Paſtor</hi> is, there the <hi>Church is:</hi> Be not either <hi>impiouſly indifferent</hi> in your worſhipping of God, or <hi>peeviſhly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſom</hi> with what is commanded or practiſed by others, nor diſobedient to Authority in lawful things.</p>
                  <p>2. Maintain ſtill your antient Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Peace among yourſelves, and improve your company and converſe to the advantage of your ſouls. Be daily interlocutory preachers to one another: Speak as the Oracles of God; and Preach by a holy, patient, harmleſs, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and heavenly life. This kind of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none can ſilence but your own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>3. Improve the profitable books which are among you. 1. Read them frequently, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently, and ſeriouſly to your families; when you have called them together, and prayed for Gods bleſſing. 2. Carry them abroad with
<pb facs="tcp:59464:5"/>
you, and when you fall into company where you cannot better ſpend your time, read to them ſome ſeaſonable paſſages of ſuch writings. 3. <hi>Give</hi> or <hi>Lend</hi> them to thoſe that <hi>need,</hi> and want either <hi>Purſes</hi> or <hi>Hearts</hi> to provide them; and get them to promiſe you to read them, and enquire after the ſucceſs. By ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Books may become ſuch <hi>Seconds</hi> or <hi>Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>4. Make ſpecial and diligent proviſion to ſatisfie your ſelves and others againſt Popery, which is like to be none of the leaſt of your temptations. To this end, I pray you read well the <hi>ſingle ſheet againſt Popery</hi> which I publiſhed, and give of them abroad to others where there is need: Read alſo my other books againſt it: (My <hi>Safe Religion,</hi> and <hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>Diſpute with Mr.</hi> Johnſon) and Dr. <hi>Challoners Credo Sanctam Eccleſiam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam:</hi> And when their ſophiſtry puzzleth you, 1. Call your able Paſtors to debate it. 2. And remember that they have the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>far greater part of the univerſal Church,</hi> and the <hi>ſenſes</hi> of <hi>all the world</hi> to confute, before they can make good the cauſe their of ambitious
<pb facs="tcp:59464:5"/>
Clergy. If you are but ſure you know <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> when you <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> and <hi>ſmell,</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi> them, then you are at the end of controverſie with the Papiſts. Above all, ſee that you maintain the Love of God, and a heavenly mind, and mortified affections, and grow not opinionative, ſuperficial or looſe in your Religion: For he that is <hi>heartily</hi> of <hi>no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is prepared to be of <hi>any Religion:</hi> And it is becauſe men are falſe to the acknowledged Truth, that they are given up to make a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of deceit and falſhood: Your fidelity to your King and Countrey, obligeth you to do your part to preſerve the ſubjects from a diſeaſe ſo injurious to them. Saith Dr. <hi>Sherman</hi> in his late [<hi>Account of Faith</hi>] againſt the Papiſt, <hi>Preſ. p.</hi> 4, 5. [<hi>If Kings would think upon it, there mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>5. Take heed of all temptations to turbulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, reſiſting of Authority, or other unlawfull means in the obeying of your paſsions or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. As God choſe moſt eminently to Glorifie his <hi>Power</hi> under the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit of bondage to fear</hi> did much prevail; but under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> he hath choſen moſt eminently to magnifie his <hi>Goodneſs, Love and Mercy;</hi> ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

Often have I noted that a whole flock of ſheep will run away from the ſmalleſt dog, and yet there is few of them killed by dogs, becauſe they are under their Maſters care; when a Woolf or Fox is purſued by all, and few of them ſuffered to live. And oft have I obſerved, that when men that ſhift for themſelves can ſcarce paſs the ſtreets, yet children play in the way of Carts and Coaches without hurt, while every one takes it for his care to preſerve them, that cannot take care of and preſerve themſelves. And though the Deer that is within the Park is killed when the <hi>Owner</hi> pleaſe, yet he is preſerved there from <hi>others,</hi> when the wild and ſtragling Deer that are abroad, are a prey to <hi>any man</hi> that can catch or kill them.
<pb facs="tcp:59464:6"/>

                  <p>Many a time I have wondered how the Devil can thus abuſe a man of reaſon, and ſuch as think themſelves no fools! and how ſuch unexpreſsible dotage can ſtand with either learning, ingenuity, or common underſtanding; and what ſhift the Devil and theſe men make to keep them from ſeeing that have eyes, or from ſeeing the Heavens, that can ſee the ſmalleſt duſt or atome. But my admiration is abated when I conſider, that the wit that ſerveth to move a poppet, is not enough to Rule a Kingdom; and that <hi>ſleeping Reaſon</hi> is <hi>as none;</hi> and that it is the very art and buſineſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to charm ſinners to ſleep and wake at once. <hi>Dormire Deo, at mundo vigilare:</hi> to be aſleep to God, and awake to the world: And that <hi>preſent things</hi> engage the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> and call off <hi>Reaſon</hi> from its work: And that the ſeeming diſtance of the life to come, occaſioneth the neglect of ſtupid half-believing ſouls, till they find it is indeed at hand: even as Death though certain, affecteth few in youth and health, as it doth when they perceive that they muſt preſently be gone: And withall, that a man is not a man in act till he be <hi>conſiderate:</hi> and that it is as good be without eyes, as ſtill to wink.

                  <p>1. That <hi>materially</hi> it contain theſe three things.</p>

                  <p>3. The <hi>Reception</hi> and <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the <hi>true Rule</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> which is <hi>[the Will of God revealed partly in Nature, and fully in the Holy Scriptures:]</hi> This muſt be in our very <hi>hearts, Pſalm 37. 31.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. It is <hi>Eſſential</hi> to <hi>Godlineſs</hi> that it <hi>formally</hi> contain theſe three Relations.</p>
                  <p>1. It is a Devotedneſs of our ſelves as <hi>HIS OWN</hi> to <hi>GOD</hi> as our <hi>OWNER,</hi> or Proprietary, or Lord; quitting all pretence to any co-ordinate title to our ſelves, and reſigning our ſelves abſolutely (and all that we have) to him that by the right of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Redemption is</hi> our Lord, <hi>Pſal. 100. 3. &amp; 119. 94.

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> containeth a <hi>Devotedneſs</hi> of our ſelves as <hi>Beneficiaries</hi> to <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> as our <hi>Great Benefactor,</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude.</hi> Or as <hi>Children</hi> to our <hi>Reconciled Father</hi> to <hi>Love him</hi> and <hi>thankfully obey him,</hi> and depend on him, and be happy in his Love.</p>
                  <p>3. It is <hi>eſſential to Godlineſs</hi> and neceſſary to ſalvation that this <hi>Devotedneſſe</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> be with a true <hi>Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>Forſaking</hi> of the three great <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi> or Enemies to God and us:</p>
                  <p>1. Of the <hi>Devil</hi> as the <hi>Deceiver</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>2. Of <hi>the world</hi> (its <hi>Profits, Honours,</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures)</hi> as the <hi>baite</hi> by which the Devil would deceive us, and ſteal away our hearts from God, and take up our time, and turn our thoughts from the one thing neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>3. Of <hi>the Fleſh,</hi> as the rebelling faculty that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt it ſelf above our Reaſon, and be pleaſed before God, and ſo would take its <hi>Pleaſure</hi> as our <hi>felicity</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> inſtead of the true <hi>felicity</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It is <hi>Eſſential</hi> to <hi>Godlineſs ſubjectively,</hi> that God have the <hi>preheminence</hi> above all Creatures, 1. In the <hi>Habitual Eſtimation of our Judgements,</hi> preferring him as the <hi>moſt Great,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> before all others. 2. In the <hi>Wills habitual Conſent</hi> and <hi>Choice;</hi> refuſing all in compariſon of him, and <hi>Chooſing</hi> him as <hi>our Lord, our Ruler,</hi> and <hi>our Beſt,</hi> and <hi>Conſenting</hi> truly to the <hi>Relations</hi> in which he is offered to us. 3. In the <hi>wills Reſolution</hi> to <hi>ſeek</hi> him and <hi>obey him,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to expreſs theſe inward principles, ſo as to prefer no Competiter before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59464:12"/>5. The <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Internal</hi> part of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> conſiſting Eſſentially in the things already mentioned; the <hi>Body</hi> of it, or <hi>Godlineſs expreſſive</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> conſiſteth in theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>1. In <hi>our</hi> Covenant <hi>with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> our <hi>Creator, Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> our <hi>Owner, Governour,</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> (or <hi>Benefactor.</hi>) It is <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>viſible expreſſive Godlineſs,</hi> that there <hi>be ſuch a Covenant</hi> made: and <hi>regularly</hi> it is to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized by <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> And thoſe that are Baptized in Infancie, muſt neceſſarily renew, and perform it themſelves when they come to age, and that <hi>underſtandingly, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, freely,</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Godlineſs viſible</hi> and <hi>expreſſive</hi> conſiſteth in our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of that <hi>devotedneſs to God,</hi> and <hi>that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>fleſh,</hi> which we have before deſcribed as the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Internal Godlineſs,</hi> and to which in the <hi>holy Covenant</hi> we oblige our ſelves. Chriſt will be <hi>confeſſed before men,</hi> and will be aſhamed of them before God and Angels, who are ſo far aſhamed of him before men, as ordinarily to refuſe to own him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him. The publike worſhiping of God in Chriſt, in Prayer, Thansgiving, Praiſes, Sacrament, is appointed as the <hi>Profeſſings acts,</hi> by which we openly own our Lord: And therefore <hi>ordinarily</hi> the <hi>Aſſembling our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for this publike worſhip</hi> is not to be <hi>forſaken,</hi> through <hi>negligence</hi> or <hi>fear;</hi> but with <hi>Daniel</hi> we muſt <hi>pray</hi> though we are ſure to be caſt to the Lyons den; For though no duty be at all times a duty, yet the diſowning of our God, or denying him, or being aſhamed of him, or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately afraid of man, is at all times a ſin: and ordinarily and ſeaſonably to <hi>Profeſs true Godlineſs,</hi> our ſubjection and devotedneſs to God, is eſſential to <hi>External Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59464:13"/>3. <hi>Viſible Expreſſive Godlineſs</hi> doth eſſentially conſiſt in the <hi>Practice</hi> of our fore-deſcribed <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:</hi> That our faces be truly Heaven-wards, and that our walk be in the way of God, through we ſometimes ſlip and ſtumble and if we ſtep aſide, that we turn not back again, but return by Repentance in our way: that the drift and aime, and bent of our lives, be for God and our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and that there be in us no ſin, which truly and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually we had not rather leave then keep: And that our great buſineſs in the world be the pleaſing of God, and the ſaving of our ſouls: and that neither Honours, nor Profits, nor Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh, have the preheminence, and be preferred: that Chriſt be not put under the Great ones of the world, nor put after your commodity, nor put off with the leavings of the fleſh, but that all be made to ſtoop to him, and take his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: All this is of neceſsity to ſalvation, and eſſential to <hi>expreſſive Godlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time Reader thou mayſt eaſily ſee, 1. that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> is not an <hi>uneffectual opinion,</hi> or <hi>dead belief;</hi> If thou were the moſt <hi>Orthodox profeſſour,</hi> or <hi>Preacher</hi> in the world, thou art <hi>ungodly</hi> if thou have no more. All have not <hi>Faith</hi> that ſay the Creed; The notional apprehenſion, and the practical judgement are often contrary; The <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> that is <hi>inſufficient</hi> to <hi>change the Heart,</hi> to <hi>move the will,</hi> to <hi>renew</hi> the life, ſhall prove inſufficient to <hi>ſave the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. You may ſee that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is not the <hi>adhearing to a Party,</hi> though ſuch a <hi>Party</hi> as pretendeth to ſome ſpecial excellency, or calls it ſelf the <hi>only Church,</hi> or the <hi>pureſt Church.</hi> It is a <hi>ſin to make</hi> and <hi>cheriſh parties, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and <hi>factions</hi> in the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> and it is not <hi>Godlineſs</hi> to ſin. A Godly man through weakneſs may be of a <hi>ſinful party,</hi> but that is contrary to <hi>his Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He will worſhip God with his beſt, and be where be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59464:13"/>
may have beſt advantage to his Soul, and therefore if he can, will hold perſonal local communion with the beſt and pureſt congregations; but not as ſeparating from the reſt, and betaking himſelf to a <hi>Party ſet againſt the Church univerſal,</hi> or a <hi>Party</hi> ſinfully diſtant from <hi>others in the Church univerſal.</hi> The grand deſign of the Devil is, when men will needs look after Religion, to make them believe that to be of ſuch a <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi> is to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> and to truſt to that inſtead of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> for the ſaving of their Souls. And carnal ſelf-ſeeking Teachers are the principal inſtruments of this deceit; who for their honour or commodity would draw away Diſciples after them, and make poor Souls believe that they muſt be their followers, or of their ſide, or opinion, or Church, if they will be ſaved: The Papiſt ſaith, You muſt follow the Pope, and be of our Church, or you are no true Catholicks, nor in the true Church, and cannot be ſaved: And ſome other Sects ſay the like of their Churches. And how many thouſand ungodly wretches do think to be ſaved, becauſe they are ſuch a Church or party. But the Catholick or Univerſal Church, is the whole company of Believers Headed only by Chriſt: and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> muſt prove thee a Living member of this ſociety, unleſs thou wilt be burnt with the withered branches: And God will never condemn any one that is truly Godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe be is not of this ſect or party, or of that: And the Papiſts that are the moſt notorious ſect and grand dividers of the Church, and condemners of the juſtified, ſhall know one day, that <hi>Ambition</hi> was not <hi>true Religion;</hi> and that the <hi>name of unity,</hi> and <hi>univerſality</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> were unmeet inſtruments to be uſed to the deſtruction of <hi>Unity,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of <hi>Univerſality</hi> and <hi>Antiquity:</hi> and that <hi>God hath ſet apart himſelf the man that is Godly,</hi> though the Accuſer of the Brethren would caſt ſuch out, <hi>Pſal. 4. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>4. You may now ſee that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is not the meer <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance</hi> of the outward acts or practice of any ſin. For elſe a <hi>ſleep,</hi> or a <hi>priſon</hi> might make a man Godly by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining him from the acts of ſin: He is ungodly that <hi>had rather</hi> live in the ſin which through ſome reſtraint he doth forbear. If you <hi>would do it,</hi> you <hi>have done it,</hi> in Gods account.</p>
                  <p>5. You may ſee alſo that whatſoever Religiouſneſs, Obedience, or Endeavours ſubject Chriſt to the fleſh and world, and make him give place to them and come behind, do not deſerve the name of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> You are not <hi>Godly,</hi> how far ſoever elſe you goe, if God and your Salvation take not place before all the honours, profits and pleaſures of the world. As he is not <hi>God</hi> that hath any <hi>Greater, Wiſer or Better</hi> then himſelf; ſo that is not <hi>Godlineſs</hi> which giveth the precedency practically to any thing but God: that pretendeth never ſo highly to Honour him, and yet more eſteemeth their own Honour with the world: or that profeſſeth Love and Obedience to him, and yet Loveth and obeyeth a Luſt before him, and ſets more by Love and Obedience to themſelves, then by their own or other mens Love or Obedience to God. All theſe are the <hi>cheating counterfeits</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. And if none of theſe be <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> much leſs doth it conſiſt in <hi>any ſin:</hi> in ſuperſtition, Idolatry, or in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, blood and perſecution through a carnal zeal: in a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others by violence to our proud impious wills: in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, ſedition, rebellion, or reſiſting lawful Powers, under pretence of propagating religion: Godlineſs conſiſteth not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59464:14"/>
in Jeſuitical contrivances, and undermining others, and equivocations and pious frands: in diſturbing Kingdoms, killing Kings, blowing up Parliaments: abſolving ſubjects from allegiance, and giving away the Dominions of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords if they will not obey the Pope in exterminating their Hereticks, (as is Decreed to be done in the Approved General Council at the Laterane under <hi>Innocent 3. Can. 3.</hi>) nor doth it conſiſt in murdering thirty thouſand or fourty thouſand treacherouſly in a few weeks, as in <hi>France,</hi> or much above twice as many in <hi>Ireland;</hi> nor in butchering Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by hundreds or thouſands as they did long agoe by the Waldenſes and Albigenſes, and Bohemians: Nor in racking and tormenting them by Inquiſition, nor in frying them in the flames of fagots, as in Queen <hi>Marics</hi> days, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently elſewhere: This is the Religion of the father of malice, that thirſts for blood, and not of the Merciful Prince of Peace. Godlineſs is not the running to arms, and pulling down Governments, to ſet up the proud ſelf-conceited actors under pretence of ſetting up Chriſt and preparing for his Kingdom: ſnatching in their dream at Crowns and Kingdoms, and finding when they awake that they have catcht agallows. When the Fryers had ſpawned the turbulent people among us in <hi>England,</hi> that thought they muſt do any thing and overturn the Governments of the world to make Chriſt the fifth Monarch, and bring him from heaven to Reign viſibly on earth before he is willing to come, I muſt confeſs l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But you will ſay, We are ſo far from joyning with theſe Fryars, that we hate the Pope much more then you do.

                  </p>
                  <p>Pardon this Digreſsion; I thought meet to tell you that Godlineſs lyeth not in breaking the Law of God, nor in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pride, nor being the enemies of Government and order

In a tender deſire of the unity of the Saints, and their concord and increaſe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and a trouble at their diſcord and diviſions. 13.

                     <p>And now out of <hi>all</hi> I will draw up ten <hi>practical directions,</hi> which in a ſpecial manner I would intreat you to Practice, if you would be ſolidly <hi>Godly,</hi> and not be deceived with names or counterfeits.</p>
                     <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Be ſure to live upon the ſubſtantials of Religion,</hi> and let them receive no detriment by a pretence of zeal for leſſer points: Lay not your Religion in uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual opinions; and let lower truths and duties keep their places, and not be ſet above the higher.</p>
                     <p>Dir. 2. <hi>See that your Religion be principally ſeated in the Heart.</hi> Underſtand it as well as you can (leſt it be taken from you;) but never think it is <hi>ſavingly your own</hi> while it is but in the brain: ſo much you <hi>believe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as you <hi>Love,</hi> and as hath imprinted the Image of God upon your hearts: Ever ſee that your <hi>wills</hi> be Reſolved for God and holineſs; and that you be able truly to ſay, <hi>I would
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59464:19"/>
be perfect:</hi> and I would fain be better then I am.]</p>
                     <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Be ſure you take up with God alone as your whole felicity,</hi> and think not that there is a neceſsity of the approbation of men, or of liberty, plenty, life or any thing beſides God. Do not only <hi>think that there is a God,</hi> and a life of Glory for you: but <hi>Live upon them,</hi> and be <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>actuated</hi> by them: <hi>Truſt to them;</hi> and take them for <hi>your part. Live</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> and not by <hi>ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Direct. 4. <hi>Live daily upon Chriſt as the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> without whom we have no acceſs to God, acceptance with him, or receivings from him. Look for all that you have from God to come by him; Live on him for Reconc liation, for Teaching, for Preſervation, for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, for Conſolation, and for Salvation. Let Chriſt make your thoughts of God more familiar, as now Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and Condeſcending to us.</p>
                     <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Obey the ſanctifying motions of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> and if you have diſobeyed, Repent; not <hi>deſpairing,</hi> but <hi>returning</hi> to obedience; but ſee that you live not in any known ſin, which a <hi>ſanctified will</hi> can enable you to avoid. Reſiſt ſins of paſsion; but moſt carefully take heed of <hi>ſins</hi> of <hi>intereſt, deliberately choſen,</hi> and kept up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Direct 6. <hi>Make it the principal work of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and your Lives,</hi> to <hi>inflame your hearts with the Love of God, as he is preſented amiable in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Grace in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Strive no further to

effect your hearts with <hi>Fears</hi> or <hi>Griefs,</hi> or other <hi>troubling paſſions,</hi> then as tendeth to the work of Love, or is a juſt expreſsion of it. Go daily to promiſes, and mercies, and Chriſt, and Heaven, of purpoſe for fewel to kindle Love: Be much therefore in Thankfulneſs and Praiſe, which are works of Love. All goeth on ſweetly, and eaſily, and acceptably, that is carryed on by Love.

                     <p>Direct. 7. <hi>Keep up Charity to all, even unto enemies;</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Love to all the Godly.</hi> And therefore hate back-biting and ſlandering, and making the worſt of other mens actions: Take them as thieves that come to rob you of your Charity: He that ſpeaks evil of another, perſwadeth you ſo far to hate him (unleſs it be in Charity, perſwading you to ſeek his cure.) Hear the reproacher and back-biter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly, as if he ſaid, in <hi>words,</hi> as he doth in <hi>ſenſe,</hi> [I pray you hate ſuch a man, or abate your Love to him.] As the way to <hi>cauſe Love</hi> is to repreſent the <hi>object Lovely,</hi> which doth much more then to <hi>command</hi> me to <hi>Love</hi> it: So the way to <hi>cauſe Hatred,</hi> is to repreſent the <hi>object hateful</hi> or <hi>unlovely,</hi> which is more then to <hi>bid</hi> us <hi>hate our brother.</hi> And he that hateth his brother is a man-ſlayer; and none ſuch have eternal life abiding in them. Away thereſore with thoſe Volumes of Learned ſlanders and reproaches, begotten betwixt <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> and <hi>ſelf love,</hi> (or <hi>pride;</hi>) and take them as the Devils Books, that are written to draw thee to hate thy Brother.

Cheriſh meekneſs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and reject all that carnal Zeal or Envy, Contention and Animoſities, which are contrary to Love. Read and ſtudy well the third Chapter of St. <hi>James,</hi> and the Epiſtle of <hi>John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Direct. 8. <hi>Underſtand the preciouſneſs and uſe of time.</hi> Love <hi>Diligence</hi> the better, becauſe it is a <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time;</hi> a doing much in a little time. Hate that which would rob you of ſo precious a commodity.</p>

Set not the bait too near you: Keep the Gun-powder from the fire.

                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing that I have to do, for the conquering all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this Concluſion, is, to prove the <hi>NECESSITY</hi> of <hi>HOLINESS:</hi> which (being now to ſpeak to ſuch as profeſs to believe the holy Scriptures,) I may eaſily do from this plain and pregnant Text: To which I ſhall annex ſuch cogent <hi>REASONS</hi> as may ſilence thoſe that will not acquieſce in the authority of the holy Word.</p>
                  <p>So great is the difference between a <hi>dreaming Opinion</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (called a <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Did they believe this Text, as verily as they pretend to believe the Goſpel, it would help to the recovery of the underſtandings of the Ambitious, and make the proud aſhamed of their glory, and ſettle the drunken aſpiring minds of thoſe that think it worth more than their ſalvation, to ſit upon the higheſt pearch: It would call off the covetous worldling from his immoderate ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſions for the fleſh, and ſave them that are drowned in the cares of this life, by ſhewing them the true and neceſſary treaſure: It would ſpare them many a vexatious thought, and a great deal of unneceſſary labour, and prevent the ſhame and horrour that muſt befall them, when in the end they find their labour loſt, and all their expectations fruſtrate: It would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtop the mouthes which prejudice, ignorance, malignant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59464:22"/>
and deliration, have opened againſt a life of faith and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Godlineſs; and cauſe them that ſcorn it as a Needleſs thing, to make it their daily buſineſs and delight. It would tell the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh ſenſleſs ſinner, that he hath work of everlaſting confequence upon his hand, and that it is no time to dream or loyter: And it would tell the brutiſh ſenſualiſt that there are more ſweet and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable delights; and the time-waſting fool that time is precious, and he hath none to ſpare and caſt away, having ſo great a work to do. It would ſet men on ſeeking with greateſt diligence, the Kingdom which before they did but dream of; and would turn the very ſtream of their hearts and lives on that which before they minded but as on the by. In a word, it would make the earthly to become heavenly, and the fleſhly ſpiritual, and the ſloathful to be diligent, and rotten-hearted ſinners to become <hi>renewed SAINTS,</hi> as all muſt do that ever will be ſaved. And if theſe words of Chriſt be not thus received by you, and work not ſuch wonders on mens hearts, it is not becauſe there is any want of <hi>fitneſs</hi> in the Text, but becauſe mens hearts are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a wilful contempt of the moſt precious truths, which in themſelves are apt to change and ſave them.</p>
                  <p>Of all waies of <hi>Teaching, Hiſtory</hi> is accounted One of the moſt effectual; becauſe it hath the greateſt advantage on our apprehenſions, as ſetting our leſſon before our eyes in the great character of <hi>Example,</hi> and not only in the ſmaller letter of a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked precept.</hi> And of all <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> What can be more powerful, then I Where <hi>one</hi> of the actors is the eternal ſon of God: and that not above our reach in Heaven, but here in our fleſh, on the ſtage of this ſublunary world. 2.

                  <p>But the plain truth lieth between theſe two extreams: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> though moſt probably a true Diſciple, was here too blame, in preferring a <hi>leſſer duty</hi> before a <hi>greater,</hi> and doing that <hi>unſeaſonably,</hi> which in due time was to be done, and in negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting an opportunity for the hearing of Chriſts word, which <hi>Mary</hi> took. It was not only <hi>blameleſs,</hi> but a <hi>duty</hi> in it ſelf, to make proviſion for Chriſt and his attendants: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he ſhould have been hearing <hi>firſt</hi> while he was preaching, and taken that opportunity for the benefit of her ſoul: It was no ordinary Preacher that was come under her roof: His ſtay was not like to be long: his doctrine concerned her ſalvation: She knew not whether ever ſhe ſhould have the like opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity again: And therefore ſhe ſhould have rather ſtayed for his own direction, when to go make proviſion for their bodies, then to have omitted the hearing of his word.</p>
                  <p>But you'l ask perhaps, [<hi>When a Sermon and other worldly buſineſs fall out at once, are we alwayes bound to hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?</hi>]</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59464:24"/>

See <hi>Pauls</hi> example, v. 8. [<hi>Neither did we eat any mans bread for nought: but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you</hi>] We muſt <hi>labour, working with our hands, that we may have to give to him that needeth,</hi> Eph. 4. 28.

                  <p>No one therefore from this determination of Chriſt to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> is to be driven from their lawfull Calling into a contrary extream. But this was not the caſe between <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha:</hi> It was a <hi>ſpecial opportunity</hi> which then was to be taken: We muſt <hi>firſt</hi> ſeek Gods kingdom, and its righteouſneſs: and prudently take ſuch opportunities for our ſouls as we can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out omitting greater duties, and as our caſe requireth: not taking as much food as we can <hi>ingeſt,</hi> but as much as we can <hi>digeſt:</hi> It is poſſible to <hi>eat too much,</hi> but not to <hi>digeſt too well.</hi> A Chriſtian muſt have prudence, when two duties come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to know which at that preſent time is the greateſt, and to be preferred: which dependeth much on the <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and the <hi>ends:</hi> the good that will follow the doing of them, and the hurt that will follow the omiſſion: And without this pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſcerning of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> we ſhall never order our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations aright, but ſhall live in a continual ſin, when we are doing that, which in its own nature and ſeaſon is our duty.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>poor man</hi> may not Read and Hear ſo frequently as a <hi>Rich</hi> (ordinarily,) nor a <hi>Servant</hi> as the <hi>Maſter;</hi> becauſe there would <hi>greater evils</hi> follow the omiſſion of their common labour at that time.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. As to the <hi>Matter, Martha</hi> had <hi>many</hi> things in hand; multifarious care and trouble; but <hi>Mary</hi> had but <hi>One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As to the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of their employments: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> was full of <hi>care</hi> and <hi>troubles,</hi> diſtracted or diſturbed by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>mberance of her buſineſſes: but <hi>Mary</hi> was quietly hearing and learning how to be <hi>free</hi> from <hi>care</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> and how to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ttain Everlaſting reſt.</p>
                  <p>3. As to the <hi>quality</hi> of their buſineſs; <hi>Martha's</hi> was of <hi>leſs neceſſity</hi> or concernment, though good and honeſt in its place: but <hi>Mary's</hi> was about the thing of <hi>abſolute neceſſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Martha's</hi> was <hi>Good</hi> in its ſeaſon, but a <hi>leſſer good:</hi> but <hi>Mary's</hi> was [<hi>that Good part,</hi>] which containeth all other <hi>good,</hi> or referreth to it, and therefore was to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>4. And therefore as to the <hi>continuance, Mary's</hi> being a more eligible imployment, and about an everlaſting treaſure, ſhall not be taken from her, when the fruit of <hi>Martha's</hi> imployment will quickly have an end.</p>
                  <p>Yet in theſe different caſes, each one had <hi>her choice:</hi> Had <hi>Martha choſen</hi> better, ſhe had <hi>had</hi> better. And the <hi>choice</hi> much proceeded from the <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>dispoſition:</hi> Had ſhe <hi>judged</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Before we come to the principal Doctrines, we may profitably note theſe Obſervations by the way.</p>
                  <p>1. Note here that [<hi>the neereſt Natural Relations (as Brothers and Siſters, yea, Parents and Children) are not alwayes of one mind or way in the matters of their ſalvation.</hi>] Greater difference may be between them, then this between <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> in the Text. They may riſe up againſt each other, and ſeek each others lives, as Chriſt foretold, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 12. And therefore Father, Mother, Brother Siſter, and all are to be <hi>denyed</hi> for Chriſt (that I ſay not <hi>hated,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.) when they ſtand in oppoſition to him. The ſame parentage and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made not <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> of a diſpoſition, or of one mind or way: nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael:</hi> nor <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Cham:</hi> not would <hi>reſtrain Cain,</hi> the <hi>firſt man born</hi> into the world, from cruel murdering his brother, upon a difference about their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,</hi> cauſed by his own <hi>ungodly mind;</hi> even becauſe <hi>his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous and acceptable to God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 12. And therefore Parents muſt patiently ſubmit (having done their duty) if even the children of their bodies ſhould prove reprobates: And Brothers and Siſters muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, if theſe in ſo neer a relation be Caſt-awayes: God hath not promiſed that <hi>all our kindered</hi> ſhall be ſaved. Rejoyce that <hi>you</hi> are not <hi>your ſelves</hi> forſaken; and be glad that <hi>any</hi> and <hi>ſo many</hi> are ſanctified, though further from you in the fleſh; and love them in their more excellent relation to Chriſt and you.</p>
                  <p>2. Note here, <hi>how our Lord doth ſpend his time in the place and company where he is.</hi> When he entreth into a houſe, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently at <hi>work</hi> in teaching poor ſouls the way to God; Or elſe how could <hi>Mary</hi> have been imployed in hearing him? In <hi>our places</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> we ſhould <hi>imitate</hi> him in this: Can you come into any houſe or company, and find nothing to ſay or do for God? Is there <hi>none wiſer</hi> then your ſelves that <hi>you</hi> may <hi>learn</hi> of, as <hi>Mary</hi> did of Chriſt? nor none <hi>more ignorant</hi> whom Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity requireth you to teach? Nor none that need a quickening word, to mind them of their everlaſting ſtate? As ſoon as <hi>worldly,</hi> or <hi>vain ungodly people</hi> get together, <hi>they</hi> are preſently upon ſome <hi>worldly,</hi> or <hi>vain</hi> diſcourſe: And if you be indeed a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59464:25"/>
heavenly and ſpiritual people, ſhould <hi>you</hi> not be more ready when you come together, for <hi>heavenly ſpiritual</hi> diſcourſe? Have you not a thouſand fold more to ſet your tougues on work? The neceſſities of the hearers: the hopes of doing good; the preſence of God; the ſenſe of the duty; the ſweetneſs of the ſubject; the avoiding of ſin; and the bleſſing of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance to your ſelves? O had we but the skill, and will, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that this interlocutory preaching by holy conference doth require, what a ſupply party would it be for the promoting of mens ſalvation, where the more publick preaching of the Goſpel is wanting? Who can forbid us by familiar diſcourſe to exerciſe our charity, in minding poor regardleſs ſinners of the life to come? and exhorting them to due preparation, and repentance; and to open to them the riches of Chriſt, and ſet forth his love, and draw them to embrace him.</p>
                  <p>3. Note here, <hi>how carefully we ſhould take the preſent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for our ſouls, to hear and learn as</hi> Mary <hi>did.</hi> She ſtands not carelling like our full ſtomackt hearers, that ask, <hi>How can you prove that I am bound to hear ſuch a Lecture, or to come to Church and hear a Sermon twice on the Lords day, or to come to the Miniſter to ask advice, or be inſtructed by him?</hi> No more then a <hi>hungry</hi> man will ask, How prove you that it is my duty to eat every day? Or then a <hi>ſick man</hi> will ſay, How prove you that I am bound to ſeek to the Phyſicion, to go or ſend to his houſe, and to look after him? As there is much in the very New nature, and health, and reliſh of a gracious ſoul, to decide ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies as theſe without any ſubtilty of argument; ſo a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> prudence and care of his ſalvation will tell him, that when Chriſt hath a voice to ſpeak to him, it beſeemeth him to have an ear to hear; and that the <hi>Sermon</hi> telleth the <hi>hearer</hi> the ſeaſon of his duty, and the offer of a mercy telleth us when it is our duty to accept it, without any other more particular obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: unleſs when we can truly ſay as before God, that ſome duty that at <hi>that time</hi> is <hi>greater,</hi> hindreth us. Theſe are eaſie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to thoſe that ſavour the things of the Spirit. When Chriſt is ſpeaking, <hi>Mary</hi> will be hearing; and <hi>leſſer things</hi> ſhall not call her off.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall ſay, [<hi>So would we too, if we could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And he that will not <hi>now</hi> believe and hear Chriſt ſpeaking by his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> when he is acknowledged to be the ſon of God, and his ſealed Word hath had ſo long poſſeſſion in the world, would hardly have regarded Chriſt himſelf in a time when he appeared in the form of a ſervant, and was found in faſhion as a man, and was believed on but by a few perſons then counted but inconfiderable.</p>
                  <p>4. Note alſo, <hi>the humility and teachableneſs of Diſciples in thoſe times, who were wont to ſit learning at their Teachers feet:</hi> Which was then an <hi>ordinary caſe,</hi> and not of <hi>Chriſt Diſciples only. Paul</hi> was brought up at <hi>the feet of Gamaliel, Acts</hi> 22. 3. Not like the proud and ſelf-conceited part of <hi>our hearers</hi> in theſe times, that come to hear ſomewhat for their malicious or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minds to quarrel with, and expect that their Teachers tell them nothing but what is agreeable to their own conceits, and think us to be <hi>injurious</hi> to them, if we would heal their ignorance or impiety, and make them any wiſer or better then they are; and that reproach us and ſet themſelves againſt us as their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if <hi>we</hi> will not be <hi>ruled by them</hi> and humour them in all our adminiſtrations, as if <hi>we were</hi> the <hi>patients</hi> and they the <hi>Phyſicion, we</hi> the <hi>learners</hi> and <hi>they</hi> the <hi>Teachers,</hi> yea <hi>we</hi> their <hi>ſervants,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> our <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> in the matters of our <hi>own Office.</hi>

                     <p>And this bleſſed ſtate is <hi>One,</hi> conſidered 1. <hi>Objectively:</hi> It is <hi>One</hi> God that we have to pleaſe, and to behold, and love, and praiſe for ever. 2.

though the <hi>Means</hi> may be <hi>more</hi> then <hi>One</hi> that are neceſſary to obtain it.</p>
                     <p>And yet even with reſpect unto the <hi>means,</hi> it may be ſaid that <hi>One thing</hi> is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> by a General Comprehenſive ſpeech, as <hi>One</hi> containeth many parts: As to <hi>cure a ſickneſs</hi> may be ſaid to be the <hi>One thing needful</hi> to preſerve a mans life; when yet that cure muſt be done by <hi>many</hi> acts and means: The <hi>means</hi> are but <hi>One thing</hi> as <hi>denominated</hi> from their <hi>End;</hi> even our everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.

And they are all <hi>One</hi> in the principal ſtock that proceedeth from this Original or root: and that is, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf,</hi> who is therefore eminently called <hi>the way;</hi> becauſe there is <hi>no other way</hi> or <hi>means,</hi> but what ſtandeth in a <hi>due ſubordination</hi> to the <hi>Redeemer</hi> as the <hi>chief means,</hi> as well as to the <hi>pure God-head</hi> as the <hi>End.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo as all the <hi>means</hi> of Gods appointment, have a union of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>ſimilitude</hi> with the <hi>End:</hi> And as <hi>Gods Image</hi> is <hi>One</hi> in all his <hi>children,</hi> ſo is it, in their kind and meaſure, in all his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> and <hi>Means: They</hi> alſo in their kind and place are <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine nature:</hi> The name of God is as it were written upon them, and his bleſſed nature legible in them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the <hi>means</hi> are all but <hi>One,</hi> as all are parts of <hi>One</hi> holy <hi>frame,</hi> which moſt harmoniouſly concurr to the doing of one work: As all the wheels and other parts are but <hi>One Coach</hi> which carryeth us to our journeys end. As Chriſt and his Church are <hi>one Body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. So Chriſt and all ſubordinate means for the recovery and ſalvation of his own, are <hi>one Kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>one way to the Father,</hi> and <hi>one ſalvation:</hi> I ſhall fullyer open it under the next head.</p>
                     <p>And now for the <hi>Negative,</hi> you may diſcern by what is ſaid, 1. That here is no ſuch <hi>unity</hi> as even in <hi>the end</hi> muſt confound <hi>God and man,</hi> or <hi>his glory</hi> and <hi>our ſalvation.</hi>

                     <p>If indeed you no more know your <hi>own minds,</hi> nor what you have all this while been <hi>doing</hi> in the world, ask thoſe that you have converſed with; <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>and judge by the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>ſigns: Others</hi> can tell what you have moſt <hi>ſeriouſly talked</hi> of: They may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture by their obſervation, what you have moſt carefully ſought, and reſolutely adhered to. Whether it be God or the fleſh; this world or Heaven? The <hi>One thing Needful,</hi> or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubling trifles in your way: It is like that <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers can help you to diſcern it; though <hi>ſenſualiſts</hi> will but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you.</p>
                     <p>A mans <hi>Love,</hi> at leaſt his <hi>chiefeſt Love,</hi> cannot be hid, but will appear in his <hi>behaviour:</hi> If you <hi>Love God</hi> above the world, you will <hi>ſeek him</hi> and his <hi>Glory before the world:</hi> and if you do ſo, it may partly be diſcerned, if you have converſed with diſcerning

                     <p>But I will urge you no further to the tryal: I will take it for granted that your Conſciences are telling many of you, that you have been troubled about many things, while the <hi>One thing Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hath been neglected:</hi> And if indeed this be your caſe, ſuffer me to tell the guilty plainly, what it is that they have done.</p>
                     <p>1. Whatever you have been doing in the world, <hi>you have loſt your Time,</hi> if you have not been ſeeking the <hi>One thing neceſſary.</hi> If you have been gathering riches, or growing up in honour as the ruſh groweth in the mire, (<hi>Job</hi> 8. 11.) or filling your purſes or your barnes, or pleaſing your fantaſies and fleſh; you have but fooled away your time, and done juſt nothing, and much worſe: <hi>Nothing</hi> is done, if the <hi>One thing Neceſſary</hi> be undone Believe it, <hi>Time</hi> is a precious thing, and ought not to have been thus caſt away. When you come to the end of it, the worſt and proudeſt of you ſhall confeſs it is precious. Then O for one year more! O for a few daies or hours more, to make ſure of this <hi>One thing,</hi> which you ſhould have ſpent your lives in making ſure of. Will you <hi>then</hi> think thus, and yet can you <hi>now</hi> afford to caſt away twenty or thirty years upon <hi>Nothing?</hi> If <hi>Time</hi> be <hi>worth Nothing,</hi> your <hi>Lives</hi> are <hi>worth Nothing:</hi> And why ſhould a man <hi>deſire</hi> to <hi>Live</hi> for <hi>Nothing?</hi> You <hi>Love</hi> your <hi>lives too much,</hi> and yet will you ſo contemptuouſly caſt them away? He hath <hi>loſt his life,</hi> who hath loſt the <hi>End of his life.</hi> The loſs of an hundred pound in money is not (to your ſelves) ſo great a loſs, as the loſs of a dayes or hours time. What then is the loſs of ſo <hi>many years?</hi> Did you ever well conſider of this? If you live a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, it is all loſt, if you have not ſpent it in making ſure of the <hi>One thing Neceſſary.</hi> For is not that loſt, and worſe a thouſand times then loſt; that is ſpent in <hi>croſſing</hi> the <hi>End</hi> that it is given for? and which is no comfort, but terrour in the review, and which leaveth no fruit, but grief and diſappointment? Let me tell you, if you hold on thus unto the end, you will wiſh and wiſh a thouſand times, either that you had never had an hours time, or elſe that you had had hearts, to have better perceived the worth and uſe of it, then to caſt it away as you have done upon nothing. It is but <hi>One thing</hi> that is worth your Time and Lives.</p>

                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59464:35"/>2. Whatſoever elſe you have been doing, <hi>you have loſt all your Labour with your Time,</hi> if this <hi>One thing Needful</hi> have been neglected. No doubt you have been <hi>buſie</hi> ſince you came into the world, but to little purpoſe. You might as well have been idle, as ſo laboriouſly doing nothing. No doubt many a journey you have rode and gone, and many a hard daies labour you have taken, and ſharpened perhaps with care and grief: But you have loſt it all, if it were an hundred times more, if it have not been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How many thoughts and fears, and cares, have poſſeſſed and peſtred your minds, and now they are all loſt? Some of you have followed your trades, and ſome your husbandry, and ſome have run up and down after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations: ſome of you have been ſcraping riches, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to keep up their reputation, and ſome to ſatisfie their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and live in pleaſure and contentment to the fleſh; and now look back upon all that you have done and gotten, and tell your ſelves whether all this be not loſt, yea alas much worſe then loſt: If you be not ready to paſs this concluſion at the very heart, it is becauſe your hearts are yet blinded and hardened in ſin; but God will ſoon bring that to your hearts, that ſhall convince you of it. If God have made uſe of any worldly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual perſon of you, for publick good, of Church or ſtate, as men do of thorns for hedging to their lands, or of bryars to ſtop a gap, or of fire-wood to warm their family; yet as to any <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefit to your ſelves,</hi> I may well ſay that all your <hi>Labour is loſt.</hi>

                     <p>Beloved Hearers, I have no deſire the Lord knows to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe your minds, or to diſquiet you with any moleſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſcruples; nor cauſeleſly to diſhonour either you or your imployments: But I muſt needs ſay, that it is a dolefull caſe, that men in their wits, ſhould ſpend a life of precious time, and alſo a great deal of care and labour, in doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and much worſe then Nothing, when they have a work of everlaſting conſequence to do, and they know that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils chiefeſt hopes do conſiſt in the ſucceſs of <hi>theſe diverſions!</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59464:36"/>
I muſt ſeriouſly profeſs to you, that I am conſtrained by the word and teachings of God, and by undenyable reaſon it ſelf, to look upon all the labour of your lives, the higheſt, and the buſieſt, but as the picking of ſtraws, or playing with a feather, or riding upon a ſtaff or a hobby-horſe, or ſuch like actions as children, fools or mad men uſe, as long as you mind not, and ſeek not after the <hi>One thing neceſſary.</hi> What ever they may be to <hi>others,</hi> they are no <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better</hi> to <hi>your ſelves:</hi> This is my judgement; yea, this is the judgement of the Spirit of God: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. If <hi>Paul</hi> was not miſtaken, your <hi>gain</hi> it ſelf is to be <hi>accounted Loſs, and all but dung</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>knowing and winning of Chriſt, that you might be found in him, and have his righteouſneſs:</hi> Think not the name of <hi>dung</hi> too baſe, when God himſelf hath written it here upon your higheſt endowments and honours, by his Spirit. And indeed what will they all do more then <hi>dung</hi> to procure you the favour of God, or the pardon of your ſins? If you offer him gold, will it do any more then if you offered him ſo much dirt? Is not the prayer of a beggar heard as ſoon as of a Lord or Gentleman? If they would do any thing to buy you peace of Conſcience, or everlaſting life, or if they would but keep you alive on earth, I ſhould not marvail at your courſe: But when they will do none of this, but make your way to Heaven more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, yea, your ſalvation a thing impoſſible while you thus live after the fleſh (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.) how then can any eaſier ſentence be paſt upon your choice? Be you the Greateſt or the Wiſeſt in your own eſteem, or in the eſteem of others of your mind, <hi>I believe,</hi> yea, <hi>I am ſure,</hi> that you are all this while but laboriouſly idle, and honourably debaſing your ſelves, and delightfully tormenting your ſelves, and wiſely befooling your ſelves, and thriftily undoing your ſelves for ever. I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay that your riſing and honourable and voluptuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, are not only like childrens playing in the ſand, and making them houſes with ſticks and ſtones: but ſo much <hi>more pitifull,</hi> as the reaſon which you abuſe exceedeth theirs. And could you all attain to be Lords and Ladies, I ſhould look upon you but as a King or Queen upon a Cheſs-board, as to any felicity that it bringeth to your ſelves; whatſoever uſe the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling providence of God may make of you for his Churches. <hi>The wiſe Merchant</hi> is he that <hi>ſeeking pearls</hi> doth find this <hi>One

There is more true Riches in this <hi>One pearl</hi> then in a thouſand loads of ſand or dirt.

                     <p>O Sirs, with what eyes, with what hearts do you uſe to read ſuch paſſages of Chriſt that ſpeak ſo plainly to you, as if he named you, and ſo piercingly as one would think ſhould make you feel, Luke 12. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry: But God ſaid to him, Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee; and then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided? ſo is he that layeth up treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich towards God.</hi>] Would you have Chriſt ſpeak <hi>plainer</hi> to to you: or <hi>cloſelyer</hi> apply it, that you may perceive he ſpeaks to you? You have loſt all the Labour of your lives; but thats not all.</p>
                     <p>3. But furthermore conſider, that if the <hi>One thing needfull</hi> have been neglected, whatever elſe you have been doing, or whatever you have got, (unleſs as preparatory to this) you have not only <hi>loſt your labour,</hi> but you have all this while <hi>been buſily undoing your ſelves, and labouring for your own perdition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it were but the <hi>loſs</hi> of your <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> you would then die but as <hi>brutes,</hi> and be as if you had never been: and to thoſe that have brutified themſelves, this will ſeem more tolerable, then to live in <hi>holineſs to God:</hi> But alas, you have done much worſe then this; You have not only been digging your own graves, but barring up againſt your ſelves the doors of heaven, and kindling the unquenchable fire to torment you; <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 44.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you give me a conſiderate hearing, you ambitious Gentlemen, you covetous worldlings, and you that ſerve your luſts and pleaſures! Do you think you had been doing the the work of wiſemen, if you had all this while been burning your own fingers, or cutting your own fleſh, or ſetting your own or your neighbours houſes on fire? What would you have us call that man that would live in ſuch imployments as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59464:37"/>
theſe, and yet would be accounted wiſe or honourable? Do I need to tell thee, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> that [<hi>Thou art the man?</hi>] Do I need in ſo plain a caſe to tell you, that you have been doing <hi>worſe,</hi> (I ſpeak not raſhly) a <hi>thouſand times worſe,</hi> againſt your ſouls, then this would have been which is ſuppoſed to be only againſt your bodies! Alas ſelf-deſtroyers, what do you mean? Did God ſend you hither on no better an errand than to kindle and blow the fire of his wrath, and fall into it when you have kindled it? Have you no better work in the world to do, then to prepare your ſelves a place in hell? and with a great deal of care, and coſt, and ſtir, to labour for damnation, as if you were afraid of loſing it?</p>
                     <p>I know you will ſay, [<hi>God forbid, we hope better, we intend no ſuch thing</hi>] But alas the queſtion is not, <hi>What you intend,</hi> but what you <hi>are doing?</hi> Not whether it be <hi>your deſire</hi> that <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death ſhould be the wages of ſin,</hi> but whether it be the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>unchangeable will of God? Rom.</hi> 6. 23. If you <hi>ſeek not firſt Gods Kingdom and his righteouſneſs,</hi> and look not after the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> with your chiefeſt <hi>Eſtimation, Reſolution,</hi> and <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> as ſure as Chriſt is true, this will prove your caſe at laſt, though now you wink, and wilfully go on, and will not believe it: As ſure as the Goſpel is true, this is true. There are but two Ends, Heaven and Hell; and if you miſs the former, you fall into the latter. <hi>If you live after the fleſh, you ſhall die,</hi> whatever you imagine: and you muſt <hi>mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the ſpirit,</hi> if you <hi>will live, Rom.</hi> 8. 13. If you ſee a man cutting his own threat, and you ask him, [<hi>What are you doing man! will you kill your ſelf?</hi>] and he anſwereth you, <hi>No, God forbid; I have no ſuch meaning; I will hope better</hi>]. Would you think that this would ſave his life? or that his <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>meanings</hi> would prove him ever the wiſer man? I tell you from the Word of God, it is one of the plaineſt truths that is there contained, that if you <hi>value not, chooſe not,</hi> and <hi>ſeek not</hi> the <hi>One thing Needful above all other things</hi> whatſoever, you are all this while but ſowing the ſeeds of endleſs miſery, whoſe fruit you muſt reap in <hi>outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where will be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, Mat.</hi> 13. 42, 50. You are <hi>treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgement of God, who will give to every man according to his works, Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6. You are <hi>ſowing</hi> in pleaſure to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> in eating, and drinking, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59464:37"/>
mirth, and honour: but you ſhall <hi>reap in corruption,</hi> lamentation and woe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. <hi>For woe to you that now laugh, for you ſhall mourn and weep: Woe to you that are rich</hi> (and have no better, but want the everlaſting riches), <hi>for you have received your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelation: Woe to you that are full,</hi> (and yet are empty of Chriſt and grace) <hi>for you ſhall hunger, Luke</hi> 6. 24, 25. Theſe are the words of Chriſt himſelf; and therefore true if Chriſt be true.</p>
                     <p>Yea more then this, let me have leave to tell you, (for why ſhould I not tell you of your greateſt folly, and that which is neceſſary for you to know?) As long as you neglect the <hi>One thing neceſſary,</hi> you are acting the part of the <hi>moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> againſt your ſelves. No enemy that you have in all the world, could do that againſt you, as you do againſt your ſelves. You abhorr the Devil; and I blame you not; for his malice and enmity deſerveth it: But you do much worſe againſt your ſelves then the Devil himſelf could ever do. To <hi>tempt</hi> you to ſin is not ſo much as to <hi>Conſent to it</hi> and <hi>commit it.</hi> He can but <hi>entice you,</hi> and not <hi>conſtrain you:</hi> It is <hi>you</hi> that are the neglecters of your Maker and Redeemer, and the wilful rejecters of your own fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity: Satan doth bad enough againſt you by temptation; but you do <hi>worſe</hi> by <hi>yielding</hi> and <hi>ſinning;</hi> much worſe then all the Devils in hell could do againſt you. For God hath not given all of them ſo much power over you, as he hath given you over your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Lord, what a diſtracted caſe is the ungodly world in! They <hi>hate</hi> any man elſe that they do but imagine is their enemy! Though he do but diminiſh their worldly wealth or honour, they cannot forgive him: If a man give one of them a box on the ear, he cannot bear it: And as for the Devil, who is the common enemy, they ſpit at his name, and (think they) bleſs themſelves from him: And yet theſe ſame men do ſpend all their care, and time, and labour, in doing <hi>more</hi> againſt themſelves, then all their enemies could do in earth or hell: and are <hi>worſe then Devils to themſelves;</hi> and yet they never <hi>fall out with themſelves</hi> for it; but can forgive themſelves as eaſily as if they did themſelves no harm.</p>
                     <p>This is true, too true Sirs, as harſh as it ſeemeth to your ears; And if it diſpleaſe you to hear of it, bethink your ſelves what it is to do it; and how God and all wiſe men muſt judge of you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59464:38"/>
that have no more mercy on your ſelves: Certainly it is much worſe to <hi>do</hi> it, then to tell you what you do. <hi>God</hi> tells men of their ſin, and <hi>God</hi> doth nothing but what is <hi>good;</hi> but it is <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only</hi> that <hi>commit it:</hi> I beſeech you do but underſtand what you are doing, as long as the <hi>One thing neceſſary</hi> is neglected by you.</p>
                     <p>4. Conſider alſo, that whatſoever elſe you have been doing in the world, if you have not done the <hi>One thing needful, you have unman'd your ſelves, and lived below your Reaſon, and in plain Engliſh, you have lived as be ſides your wits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I give you no harder language then God himſelf hath frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given you in his Word, and then you will ſhortly give your ſelves, if you repent not; yea and ſooner if you do repent. If you have (in this) the uſe of your Reaſon, you muſt needs know what you have your Reaſon for: And I beſeech you tell me for what you have it, if not to ſerve and pleaſe your Maker, and prepare for your everlaſting ſtate? Is it only that you may know how to plow and ſow, and follow your trades and pleaſure in the world, and ſatisfie your fleſh a little while, and then die as the beaſts that periſh? None of you, I ſuppoſe, will ſay ſo, that calls himſelf a Chriſtian: If God had made you for no higher things then beaſts, he would have given you no higher faculties and endowments. As <hi>they</hi> be not made to <hi>enjoy God,</hi> ſo they have no <hi>knowledge of him:</hi> he ſendeth not his Word to them, and calleth them not to learn the knowledge of his will: But <hi>you</hi> know, or may know, that <hi>there is a God,</hi> and that he <hi>is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him;</hi> and are <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Loving him, intending him,</hi> and <hi>ſerving him,</hi> and therefore of <hi>enjoying</hi> him: <hi>Beaſts</hi> are not ruled by the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of a life after this: For their nature and end do not require it. But <hi>men muſt</hi> be <hi>thus</hi> ruled, or elſe there can be no ſufficient ruling of them, in an ordinary way: Which ſhews that the Nature of man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the things which are the matter of their hopes and fears.</p>
                     <p>Verily Sirs, I think, as to any good that cometh by it, there is very little difference between having Reaſon, and having none, if we had nothing to do with it, but cunningly to lay up our food, and make proviſion for this corruptible fleſh, and had not another life to mind. It were no ſuch great difference, in my opinion, as it commonly goes for, whether we were <hi>men</hi> or <hi>dogs,</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59464:38"/>
if it were only for the matters of this tranſitory life. For though I may not deny but yet <hi>man</hi> were the nobler creature, yet alas the difference would be but graduall and ſmall, as an Ape or Dog excells a Swine: And as to his Happineſs, it is doubtful whether Man would not have the worſt of it. For as brutes have not mans knowledge, ſo they have not his toil and trouble of mind, his care, and fear, and griefs, and diſappointments: Nor have they ſo terrible fore-thoughts of death through all their lives, as man muſt have, much leſs ſuch fears of what would follow after death.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I may boldly ſay, that you have thrown away your wits, and laid by your Reaſon as to the principal uſe of it, if you have <hi>forgot,</hi> or <hi>have not chiefly ſought</hi> the <hi>One thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Where were your wits when a lump of fleſh was preferred before immortal ſouls? and when the trouble and dung of a tranſitory world, was more eſteemed then God and endleſs Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Where were your wits when you might have had Chriſt, and Life in him, and his pardoning, healing, ſanctifying grace, and you had no mind of him, and were not ſenſible of your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and paſt him by with as much neglect, as if you could have been ſaved without him? When you might long ago have made ſure of <hi>Heaven;</hi> and now you are <hi>even ready</hi> to drop into <hi>Hell,</hi> and ſtay but for a Feaver, or Conſumption, or ſome other diſeaſe to cut the thred, and turn the key, unleſs a ſpeedy ſound converſion ſhall yet prevent it. What have you <hi>done</hi> in all your life-time, that ſhould make a wiſe man judge you <hi>Reaſonable?</hi> Is that your Reaſon to be <hi>penny wiſe and pound fooliſh;</hi> to be wiſe to do evil, and to have no knowledge to do good? <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 22. To run up and down for I know not what, and to leave that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that you were created and redeemed for? Can you think that it is Reaſonable to make ſuch ado for the air of dying mens applauſe, and to be well thought of, or to live like Gentlemen, or to the contentment of a fleſhly mind, when you know that you are juſt ready to paſs out of this world into an endleſs life of Joy or Torment, (yea <hi>certainly of torment,</hi> if you thus hold on)? Where all theſe things will afford you no relief or benefit; but the memory of your courſe will be the fuell of your miſery: Can that man be wiſe that damns his ſoul? Can he deſerve the name of a ſober man, that will ſell his ſalvation for ſo ſhort, ſo ſmall, ſo filthy a pleaſure as ſin affordeth? Is he worthy the name
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59464:39"/>
or reputation of a wiſe man, that hath not wit enough to ſcape eternal fire? nor wit enough to forbear laying hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and doing all this againſt his own ſoul? What think you, is not the caſe here plain enough?</p>
                     <p>Be not offended if I ſpeak yet plainlyer to you; for in a caſe ſo lamentable, how can we be too plain or ſerious? Suppoſe you knew a Prince or Lord, that had an itch upon him, which the Phyſicion offereth ſpeedily and eaſily to cure; but he hath ſo much pleaſure in ſcratching, that he doth not only refuſe the cure, leſt it deprive him of his delight, but he will give his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Lordſhip to one that will ſcratch him but a little while, though he be ſure to live a beggar after it all his dayes. I put it to your ſelves, <hi>What name</hi> you would give this man, or what eſteem you would have of him: Do you think that <hi>any ungodly worldly perſon</hi> is <hi>wiſer</hi> than <hi>this man?</hi> Alas their caſe is <hi>ſo much worſe,</hi> that there is <hi>no compariſon:</hi> They are <hi>more fooliſh</hi> then your hearts can now conceive, or then I am able fully to expreſs. You have now the <hi>itch</hi> of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luſt;</hi> and your <hi>throats</hi> muſt be pleaſed in your <hi>meats,</hi> and <hi>drinks;</hi> and you <hi>itch</hi> after <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>recreations;</hi> and Chriſt telleth you by his Word, that theſe are but your <hi>ſick deſires,</hi> and that the <hi>pleaſing</hi> of them tends to kill you; and he offereth you for nothing, a ſafe, and certain, and ſpeedy cure: But you refuſe it, and will not hearken to him: You <hi>muſt be ſcratcht</hi> whatever it coſt you: You muſt have your riches, and honour, and fleſhly pleaſure, as the felicity which you cannot part with, though it coſt you your ſalvation. Though God be neglected, and his favour loſt, and your ſouls be loſt, and the <hi>One thing needful</hi> caſt aſide, you muſt have your carnal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations gratified: And is this your wiſdom? The Lord bleſs us from ſuch a kind of wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Yet this is not the worſt: I will ſhew you one ſtrain more of the diſtraction of the ungodly world. If theſe men do but ſee <hi>one perſon</hi> of an <hi>hundred</hi> that are more diligent for <hi>Heaven</hi> then <hi>carth,</hi> to fall into <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or diſtreſs of ſoul; or ſuppoſe it were into ſome loſs of reaſon; they preſently cry out againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>ſtrictneſs,</hi> and <hi>preciſeneſs,</hi> and making ſo much ado to be ſaved; and ſay it is the way to <hi>make men mad:</hi> Hence comes the proverb of the Papiſts [<hi>Spiritus Calvinianus eſt ſpiritus melancholicus</hi>]; and of the prophane among our ſelves, that [<hi>A Puritane is a Proteſtant frightned out of his wits</hi>]: They
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59464:39"/>
dare not ſtudy the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo much, nor meddle with ſuch <hi>high matters</hi> as <hi>their ſalvation,</hi> nor be <hi>ſo godly,</hi> nor meditate on the <hi>world to come,</hi> leſt it ſhould drive them out of their wits. O miſerable men! As if it were <hi>poſſible</hi> for you to be <hi>more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly mad,</hi> then you are already! (Unleſs by growing unto greater wickedneſs!) Do you lay out your wit, and ſtrength, and time, in feeding a corruptible body for the grave, and ſpend your lives in running after your own ſhaddows, while your <hi>everlaſting life</hi> is forgotten or neglected! Do you ſell your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with <hi>Judas</hi> for a little money; and change your part in God and Glory, for the brutiſh pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon? And are you afraid of altering this courſe of life, and turning to God, leſt it ſhould <hi>make you mad?</hi> Lord, what a beſotting thing is ſin! What a cunning cheater is the Devil! What a deluded diſtracted ſort of people are the ungodly? Will you run from God, from Chriſt, from Grace, from mercy, from Scripture, from the godly, and from Heaven it ſelf for fear of <hi>being mad?</hi> Why what <hi>greater madneſs</hi> can you fear then this? What <hi>worſe</hi> is humane nature capable of? Unleſs it be the addition of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaſure of the ſame, and unleſs it be to hold on in that way, and perſecute the contrary with ſuch like aggravations of your madneſs, I know not of any worſe that you ſhould fear. Will you run to Hell to prove your ſelves to be in your wits? Again I ſay, the Lord bleſs us from ſuch a kind of wit. Nay Hell it ſelf hath no ſuch diſtractedneſs as yours: The difference between the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> and your <hi>many things,</hi> is <hi>there better,</hi> though <hi>too late</hi> underſtood! Is <hi>Loving God</hi> the way to be <hi>mad?</hi> and <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the world</hi> and <hi>fleſhly pleaſures</hi> the way to be <hi>wiſe?</hi> Is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God in humble prayer, and believing his love, and loving him, and delighting in him, and ſpeaking of his name, and word, and works unto his praiſe, and hoping to live with him for ever, I ſay, <hi>is this</hi> (which is the work of a Believer) a liker courſe to make men mad, then ſerving the Devil, and drudging in the world, and living under the curſe of God, and in continual danger of damnation? What men are they, that dare entertain ſuch horrid and unreaſonable ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                     <p>I confeſs we are not unacquainted with the ſadneſs and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly that ſome perſons have contracted by Religious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and perhaps one of a thouſand may loſe their wits: But I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59464:40"/>
muſt tell you, all theſe folowing points, that will ſhew you that Religion is not to be blamed for it, nor avoided.</p>
                     <p>1. It is ordinarily perſons of the <hi>weaker ſex,</hi> or of <hi>very weak brains</hi> and <hi>very ſtrong paſſions,</hi> that are <hi>naturally inclined</hi> to it, and are not able to bear any long and ſerious thoughts, about matters of that moment, which are apt to make the deepeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: But perſons that naturally are of ſound and calme diſpoſitions, are ſeldom troubled with any ſuch affects.</p>
                     <p>2. It is uſually the caſe of perſons that <hi>miſtake</hi> the <hi>nature of Religion,</hi> though not in the <hi>main,</hi> yet in ſome particulars of great concernment: That ſtudy not ſufficiently the Love of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us in our Redeemer, but feed their griefs and troubles only by the thoughts of their own infirmities; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not that the chief part of Religion doth conſiſt in Love, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and in Thankſgiving and delightful praiſing our Creator. So that it is not long of <hi>Religion</hi> if men will leave out the <hi>chief parts of Religion,</hi> and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Religion of ſo much only as may <hi>breed</hi> their <hi>trouble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. And I muſt further tell you, that as I have had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of knowing the ſtate of as many troubled diſtempered minds, as any one of you whoever he be; ſo I muſt needs bear witneſs, that I have met with <hi>many</hi> that have been <hi>diſtracted</hi> by <hi>worldly cares,</hi> or <hi>ſorrows,</hi> or <hi>diſcontents,</hi> for one that ever I knew diſtracted with the cares about the matter of their ſalvation. And yet though it be <hi>worldly care</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bringeth <hi>death</hi> and <hi>madneſs,</hi> you will not therefore give over your Callings, and reſolve that you will meddle no more with meat, or drink, or cloathes, or houſes, or lands, or friends, or children: Nay it were well if you would be brought to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> and taken off your <hi>inordinate deſires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. And yet in the concluſion I muſt tell you, that, though I know that the loſs of a mans underſtanding is a very grievous affliction, and ſuch as I hope God will never lay upon me, yet I had a thouſand times rather go diſtracted to <hi>Bedlam</hi> with the exceſſive care about my ſalvation, then be one of you that <hi>caſt away the care of your ſalvation</hi> for fear of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and will go among the <hi>infernal Bedlams</hi> into hell for fear of being mad. The height of your <hi>carnal wiſdom</hi> is more deplorable then their <hi>diſtraction.</hi> For God will <hi>condemn</hi> no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59464:40"/>
man becauſe he is <hi>diſtracted,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>blame him</hi> for it, (unleſs as it is the fruit of ſin,) no more then he will condemn or blame an <hi>Ideot</hi> or a <hi>beaſt,</hi> becauſe they have no uſe of reaſon: If <hi>David</hi> had been as he ſeigned himſelf to be, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 13, 14. it would not have caſt him out of Gods favour, ſo far as <hi>one ſin</hi> did, much leſs ſo far as the ungodly are. A man may go to <hi>Heaven</hi> from <hi>ſuch a madneſs.</hi> But <hi>you</hi> that have <hi>Reaſon</hi> for the <hi>world,</hi> but none for God; that are wiſe to do evil, that have wit to deſtroy your ſelves and ſerve the fleſh, but none to look after your recovery and ſalvation, its you that ſhall have the ſtripes, the many, the great, the endleſs ſtripes. You that have ſo much wit as that you glory in it, and think your ſelves wiſer then the reſt of the world, and yet have not wit to know, and love, and ſerve your maker: nor to value and ſeek firſt the <hi>One thing neceſſary,</hi> it is you that will prove the miſerable fools.</p>
                     <p>If you had not had a natural capacity of underſtanding, you had had no ſin: But now you have no cloak for your ſin, when you have the worldly wiſdom which is fooliſhneſs with God, and have a ſinning, ſelf-deſtroying wit, and are <hi>wilfully void</hi> of the <hi>wiſdom</hi> that ſhould ſave you, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 25. &amp; 3. 19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 9.) when you have not a <hi>neceſſitated,</hi> but a <hi>voluntary</hi> diſtraction: and <hi>this is your condemnation, that Light is come into the world, and you have loved darkneſs rather then Light, becauſe your deeds were evil,</hi> John 3. 19.</p>
                     <p>If you think this wilfull and ſenſleſs neglect of the <hi>One thing needfull</hi> is not a ſufficient evidence to prove that miſerable <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction</hi> which I charge upon you, will you but believe your Maker, and let the word of God be Judge between us, and mark what language it giveth to ſuch as I now deſcribe 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 2. Jer. 4. 22. Eccleſ. 7. 25. 2 Pet. 2. 12. Pſalm 92. 6. &amp; 94. 8. Jer. 10. 8. 14. Deut. 32. 6. Pſalm 73. 3. 22. 2 Sam.</hi> 14. 10. In theſe places your courſe hath no better titles, than <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, fooliſh, brutiſh, ſottiſh, &amp;c.</hi> even from the God of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom himſelf, who is the fitteſt to give you the character that you deſerve. When you have truly conſidered of your way, if indeed you find that you have dealt like wiſe men, hold on and ſay ſo at the laſt, when you have eaten the fruit of your doing, and have ſeen the End.</p>
                     <p>5. Furthermore Conſider, that what ever elſe you have been
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59464:41"/>
doing in the world, if the <hi>one thing neceſſary</hi> be yet undone, <hi>you have loſt and abuſed all the mercies that God hath beſtowed on you:</hi> Many a thouſand pretious mercies have been given you: And to what uſe, but to help you to everlaſting mercy, and to prevent your everlaſting miſery! This is the End, and this is the Life and excellency of all your mercies: For all <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mercies</hi> have the Nature of a Means to a further End: And the Goodneſs and nature of the Means conſiſteth in its fitneſs to promote the End. And therefore you have loſt all the Mercies that you have received, if you are never the nearer your End for them; and if they have not promoted the Love of God, and your ſalvation. You have had health, and ſtrength, and time, and peace, and liberty, and ſome of you alſo wealth and honour in the world. But you have loſt them all, if your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be not furthered by them. Many a preſervation you have had, when others have been cut off before your faces, and many a deliverance from dangers known or unknown, and much of the fruit of that Patience of God, which hath till now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you in your ſin: Many a Sermon you have heard, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a warning you have had, and you have been planted in God, Vineyard, and daily watered with the Ordinances of grace: But all theſe are <hi>loſt</hi> if the <hi>One thing neceſſary</hi> hath been negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Nothing in this world doth you <hi>good indeed,</hi> any further then it promoteth your <hi>Everlaſting good.</hi> And do you think that you have dealt <hi>kindly</hi> or <hi>juſtly</hi> with God, to deal ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly with all his mercies, as to caſt them away, and tread them under foot? When you <hi>want</hi> but food, or rayment, or liberty or health, you value them and pray for them; and when you <hi>have them,</hi> what do you with them, but throw them as in the channel, and ſacrifice them to your luſts and enemies: When Death looketh you in the face, you begin to know the worth of <hi>Time,</hi> and then O what would you not give for a little more, and that God would try you a few years longer: And when you have Time, what do you with it, but ſerve the Devil, and caſt it away for nothing, and ſpend it in preparing for everlaſting ſorrows? How can you for ſhame cry to God for Mercy in your next diſtreſs, when you have contemptuouſly thrown away the Mercies of twenty, or thirty, or forty years already: If your own children ſhould ask you for meat or drink, and when they have it ſhould throw it to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59464:41"/>
dogs; or ask you for money, and caſt it into the dirt, and do thus an hundred and an hundred times over, would you go on to give it them becauſe they cry for it?</p>
                     <p>O Sirs, that you could but uſe your Reaſon in the matters for which it was given you by your Maker! Either time and mercy is worth ſomething, or nothing: If it be worth nothing, never beg for it, and never be ſad when it is taken from you. Why make you ſuch a ſtir for that which is nothing worth? (I mean your corporal mercies, for ſpiritual mercies you can be too well content to be without) But if they be <hi>worth any thing,</hi> why do you caſt them away, and make no better uſe of them? What good do you with them? or what good do they do you? Believe it, ſinners, God doth not deſpiſe his mercies as you do. He will not alway give you meat, and drink, and health, and ſtrength, and life, to play with, and do nothing with. He will teach you better to value them before he hath done with you. Not that he thinks them too good for you; but he would have them be <hi>better</hi> to you then you will let them be. He would have every bit you eat, to be uſed to ſtrengthen you in your walk to heaven, and every hour of your time to help you towards eternal happineſs, and every preſent mercy to further your everlaſting mercy; that ſo by the improvement, their value may be advanced, and they may be mercies indeed to you. Be ruled by God, and you ſhall receive more in one mercy, then you do now in a thouſand. But if you will <hi>do nothing</hi> with them, blame him not if he take them from you, and leave you deſtitute of what you knew not how to uſe.</p>
                     <p>Nay your ſin is <hi>greater</hi> then meerly to <hi>caſt away your mercies:</hi> You do not only <hi>loſe</hi> them, but turn them all into a <hi>curſe,</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> your <hi>ſouls</hi> with that which is given for the <hi>ſuſtentation</hi> of your <hi>bodies:</hi> While you know no better uſe of mercies, then to pleaſe your ſenſes, and accommodate the fleſh, and forget the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> which is the End of all, you turn them all into ſin, and fight againſt God by them, and ſtrengthen his enemy and your own, and block up your way to Heaven by them, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up wrath for the dreadful day, when your wealth ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire, <hi>Jam. 5. 1, 2, 3. Rom.</hi> 2. 5. You contemptuouſly caſt that bread to dogs, which he giveth you to ſupply your own neceſſities: You treacherouſly carry over his proviſion to the enemy. Conſider
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59464:42"/>
this, you that ſay <hi>you hope to be ſaved, becauſe God is merciful:</hi> You have found indeed that <hi>God is merciful,</hi> by large experience: But if you do not learn, and quickly learn to make a <hi>better uſe</hi> of his mercies, <hi>abuſed mercy</hi> will prove your everlaſting miſery: O what a reckoning will you have? What a load to preſs you down to Hell? Unleſs you would have uſed them better, it had been eaſier for you, if theſe temporal mercies had been denyed you: Can that man look to be <hi>ſaved by mercy,</hi> that would not be intreated to <hi>conſent</hi> that <hi>mercy ſhould ſave him</hi> in the day of ſalvation? in the accepted time? but ſerved the Devil with thoſe very mercies that would have ſaved him? God ſendeth you his mercies to kill your ſins, and ſanctifie you, and engage you to himſelf; and if you will feed your ſins with them, and make them your idols, and forſake God for them, and be falſe to him, to your Covenant, and your duty, and neglect that <hi>One thing</hi> for which he gave them to you, you do not only loſe them, but turn them to a curſe. And, alas, poor ſinners, what will you have to fly to, to truſt in, or to comfort you, when mercy abuſed hath not only forſaken you, but falls upon you as a mountain, and feedeth your aggravated endleſs miſery?</p>
                     <p>6. Moreover, whileſt you neglect the <hi>One thing neceſſary,</hi> you neglect Chriſt himſelf, and reject the ſaving benefit of his blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and refuſe the healing work of his Spirit, and the precious benefits which he hath offered you in the Goſpel. And how can you eſcape if you neglect ſo great ſalvation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. How will you be ſaved, when you refuſe the only Saviour? There is indeed enough in Chriſt to heal and ſave the humbled ſoul, that thirſteth for his righteouſneſs and ſalvation, and valueth and ſeeketh him as a Saviour: and if you would thus come to him, you might have life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. But whiles you give your ſelves to pleaſe the fleſh, and follow the world, and look ſo little after Chriſt, or after the ends and benefits of his ſufferings and grace, Chriſt is as no Chriſt to you; and Grace is as no Grace to you; and the Goſpel is as no Goſpel to you; and you will be never the more ſaved, then if there had no Saviour ever come into the world, or there had never Grace been given to the world, or there had never been promiſe made, or Goſpel preached to the world: For Chriſt will not ſave them that continue to neglect him, and ſet light by all the mercy that he offereth, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which he hath purchaſed, and do not eſteem and uſe him as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59464:42"/>
a Saviour, and cannot find enough in God and Glory, to take off their hearts from the pleaſures and idols of the fleſh. If Chriſt <hi>would have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and you would not</hi> (Matth. 23. 37.) you will be as far from being ſaved by him, as if you had never heard of his name.</p>
                     <p>And yet that is not all: If you prevent it not by true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, you will wiſh a thouſand and a thouſand times, that this were all: But there is <hi>worſe then this:</hi> For Chriſt will not leave a man of you as he finds you: If you are ſo far in love with worldly wealth and fleſhly pleaſure, that you can taſte no ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Grace, and ſee no deſirable glory in his Kingdom, he will make you taſte the bitterneſs of his wrath, and feel the weight of his ſevereſt juſtice. The moſt <hi>compaſſionate Saviour</hi> is the moſt <hi>dreadful Judge,</hi> to thoſe that will not be ſaved by his grace. It will be eaſier for <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the day of Judgement, then for thoſe that were the obſtinate refuſers of his Goſpel, <hi>Matth. 6. 11, 12. He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law dyed without mercy, under two or three witneſſes; of how much ſure puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, that hath trodden under foot the ſon of God?</hi> Heb. 10. 28, 29. <hi>See therefore that ye refuſe not him that speaketh: For if they eſcaped not that refuſed him that spake on earth, how much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from heaven?</hi> Heb. 12. 23.</p>
                     <p>7. As long as you neglect the <hi>One thing Needful,</hi> whatever <hi>good conceits of your ſelves you have entertained, and whatever hopes, or peace, or comfort, you have built upon thoſe conceits, they are all but meer deluſions and irrational,</hi> like the laughter of a mad man, that is no comfort to the ſtanders by, who know that it is but the fruit of his diſtemper, and maketh him an object of more compaſſion. What wiſdom is it to look high and carry it gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the world, when you know not but vengeance may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you the next hour? Alas man, thou haſt to do with God: Though thou ſee him not, it is he that upholds thee, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth thee, and looketh for Love and Duty from thee, and <hi>will be Glorified by thee,</hi> or thou ſhalt dearly anſwer it: God will not be neglected and abuſed at ſo cheap a rate as ſottiſh Infidels imagine. <hi>He deſpiſeth thee, if thou deſpiſe him, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 30. and thou <hi>deſpiſeſt him,</hi> if thou <hi>deſpiſe his Meſſengers,</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Wayes, Luke 10. 16. 1 Theſ.</hi> 4. 8.

And is this a deſirable or rational kind of mirth? Did you but now foreſee the end; did <hi>you ſee</hi> what you <hi>muſt ſee,</hi> or <hi>feel</hi> a little of what you <hi>muſt feel,</hi> you would preſently be far from mirth or laughter; it would ſpoil your ſport, and turn your tune to doleful lamentations. O ſhort unſatisfactory pleaſure! O endleſs, eaſeleſs woe, how quickly wilt thou ſurprize them that little dream of ſuch a change! You ſay Religion is a Melancholy thing, but verily your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſo much worſe then melancholy, that it may make a man melancholy to think of men in ſo ſad a caſe. If any thing in the world will make a man melancholy, methinks it ſhould be to ſtand in your unhappy ſtate, and thence to look into eternity! and to think of your enmity to heaven, and that you have no part in Chriſt, no title to his Kingdom, and to think what haſte you are making to your infernal home, and how faſt the wheels of night and day do hurry your unprepared ſouls to Judgement, and that your <hi>judgement lingreth not, and your damnation ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth not,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. Whether you ſleep or wake, be ſure <hi>it ſleepeth not.</hi> In a word, to neglect the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> is to neglect <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf and your ſalvation: to <hi>neglect Heaven</hi> is to <hi>loſe it:</hi> and <hi>loſe Heaven</hi> and <hi>loſe all.</hi> And what comfort can the fore-thoughts of <hi>life everlaſting</hi> afford a ſoul in a ſtate of ſin, that is paſſing to everlaſting miſery?

what comfort can <hi>any thing</hi> in <hi>this tranſitory life,</hi> afford that man that hath no matter of comfort in the <hi>life to come,</hi> yea that muſt there live in endleſs ſorrows! O let me not <hi>taſte</hi> of that frantick and unreaſonable mirth, that tendeth to ſuch heavineſs, and driveth away thoſe wiſe recovering thoughts that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent it! For the Lords ſake, and for your ſouls ſake, all you that neglect the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> will you but ſearch the Scripture, and ſoberly conſider whether all this be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth: and if it be, how it ſhould affect you, and what a change in reaſon it ſhould make upon you!

How the caſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with mankind, you have heard in my Text from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: How <hi>One thing is needful;</hi> and how the buſie-idle world is diverted from this <hi>One thing,</hi> by many <hi>needleſs troubleſom things</hi> to their own deſtruction: If hence I warn you of your danger, and tell you of your duty, and exhort you to take another courſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59464:47"/>
then you have done, I hope you will confeſs I do but what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both for you and me, and what you have no reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. Come then, for the Lords ſake, and let us treat practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and ſucceſsfully about ſo great a buſineſs; and make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it before we leave it; and end not till we amend what we find amiſs. What courſe then will you take for the time to come? Will you go on to trouble your ſelves about <hi>Many things,</hi> and neglect the <hi>One thing needful</hi> as you have done? Dare you harbour ſuch a purpoſe? Or dare you ſtifle thoſe thoughts and motions that would tend to better purpoſes? Or may I not hope that the Light hath ſhamed your ſleepineſs and works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that you are grieved at the heart for the ſinful negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of heart and life, and reſolved now to be new men? For Gods ſake Reſolve, Sirs. What will you do? Waver not, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve: Its more then a thouſand lives that lyeth on your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I come to you this day as the Miniſter of the great Paſtor of the flock, that ſpake theſe words, not only to acquaint you, if you know not, or to remember you if you know, that <hi>One thing is needful;</hi> but alſo with authority to command you in his name, to Value it, to Love it, to Chooſe it, to ſeek it, and labour for it as the <hi>One thing needful.</hi> What ſay you, will you or will you not? This unſpeakable mercy I offer you from the Lord: He is willing to put up at your hands, all that is paſt, and to lay all your ſins on the ſcore of Chriſt, and freely to forgive you through the vertue of his blood, if you will now at laſt bethink you better, and come to Chriſt, and live as men that know what they have to do: If you will but ſee your former folly, and heartily bewail it, and ſet your hearts on the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> he will encourage you, and help you, and bid you welcome, and number you with his ſons, though you have lived as his enemies. Though you have lived like Swine and Serpents, he will put you into his boſom, if you will but be waſhed and changed by his grace. Though you have ſet more by your worldly riches then by his glory, and have ſet more by the favour of mortal man, then by his favour, and though you have ſet more by your bellies, and your brutiſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and little toyes, then you have done by everlaſting life, he will yet be merciful to you, and put up all theſe indignities at your hands, and take you into his deareſt love, if you will but <hi>Now</hi> become new creatures, and give your hearts to him that made them, and ſeek that firſt that is worth the finding, and loſe not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59464:48"/>
the reſt of your lives and labour upon unprofitable things. What can you ſay againſt this offer? Is it not unconceivable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy? O what would the damned give for ſuch an offer? O what would you your ſelves give another day for ſuch an offer, if you now neglect it? What ſay you then, will you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this offer of mercy while it may be had, and cloſe with Grace, while Grace would ſave you, or will you not? As ever you look for mercy in the hour of your diſtreſs, when nothing but mercy can ſtand your ſouls in any ſtead, take mercy now while it may be had: Refuſe it not when it is offered you, as you would not be refuſed by it when Hell and Deſparation would devour you. If you ſlight it becauſe it is <hi>free,</hi> you ſlight it becauſe it is <hi>great,</hi> and therefore greatly to be valued. Think not hereafter to have it at your beck, if you neglect it now when it ſeeks for your acceptance. Do not ſay, I will a little longer keep my ſins, and a little longer enjoy my pleaſures, for I can have Chriſts offer at any time before I die. O little doſt thou know what a ſtab ſuch a trifling purpoſe may give to the very heart of all thy hopes and happineſs! and how terribly God may make thee know, how ill he taketh thy unthankfulneſs and contempt! and how dear one other week of ſinful pleaſure may coſt thy ſoul? In the name of God I warn you, do not ſo deſpiſe everlaſting happineſs! Do not ſo trample on the blood of Chriſt, if you would be ſaved by it: Do not abuſe the Spirit of Grace, if you would be ſanctified by it: Play not any longer with the conſuming fire, the wrath of a jealous and Almighty God: Jeſt not with damnation. Though Grace be now offered you, it will not be at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Deſpiſe this motion, and you may be out of hearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next. What can you expect, if you will ſlight ſuch mercy, but either that Death ſhould ſhortly bring you to your reckoning, or that God ſhould leave you to your ſelves, and give you up to the hardneſs of your hearts: And if you will needs chooſe the world, and fleſhly pleaſure, and God and Glory ſhall be thus contemptuouſly paſt by, you may take your choice, and ſee what you will get by it: But remember what an offer you had this day, and that heaven was once within your reach, and that it might have been yours for ever if you would.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe I am loth to leave you ſo, I will try by ſome ſuch Arguments as the Reaſon of man muſt needs approve, Whether

                     <p>1. REmember, it is <hi>Neceſſity</hi> that is pleaded with you in my Text. <hi>One thing is Neceſſary.

                        <hi>Neceſsity</hi> makes the Traveller trudge from morning till night; and the Carryer to follow his horſes through fair and foul from year to year; it makes ſome dig into the bowells of the earth, in mines and cole-pits; and ſome to hale Barges; and ſome to cut through the terrible Ocean, and venture their lives among the raging waves and ſtorms; and ſome even to beg their bread in rags from door to door: And O what will not <hi>Neceſsity</hi> do that can be done?

When alas, all the Neceſſity in the world, is no neceſſity at all, in compariſon of this. You muſt beg, or ſtarve, or famiſh, if you

do not work: But you muſt burn in Hell, if with fear and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence you <hi>work not out your own ſalvation, Phil.</hi> 2. 12. (for all that it is God that worketh in you). You muſt lie in priſon if your debts be not paid: But you will be caſt into outer darkneſs, if by the pardon of your ſins, you be not diſcharged from your debt to God. You may become beggars if you be idle in your Callings: But you will be the priſoners of Hell, and ſhut out of all the Happineſs of the Saints, if you labour not for the food that doth not periſh, and ſtrive not to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and give not diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure. <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. You muſt ſuffer hunger and nakedneſs, if you have not food and rayment: But you muſt ſuffer everlaſtingly the wrath of God, if you have not the <hi>One thing neceſſary.</hi> You will be the ſcorn and laughing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock of men, if you fall under their contempt and loſe your honour: But you will be the enemies of God, and hated by him, if you continue to contemn his grace.</p>
                     <p>O had you but ſeen the Life to come, you would ſay, There is a <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of attaining it! Had you been one hour in Hell, you wou'd think that there is a <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of eſcaping it, and that there is <hi>no Neceſsity</hi> to this.</p>
                     <p>What ſay you to all this? Is it not of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Weight?</hi> Can you <hi>deny it?</hi> Or ſhould you <hi>make light of it?</hi> None but an <hi>Infidel</hi> can <hi>deny it;</hi> and none but a dead-hearted ſinner can make light of it.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59464:50"/>
ſaved without <hi>Holineſs,</hi> is to ſee without eyes, and to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life: And who is ſo fooliſh as to <hi>hope</hi> for this? Few of you are ſo unreaſonable as to hope for a crop at harveſt, without plowing or ſowing; or for a houſe without building; or for ſtrength without eating and drinking; or to ſleep and play, when you have nothing to maintain your families, and ſay, You hope that God will maintain both you and them. And yet this were a far wiſer kind of <hi>hope,</hi> then to <hi>hope</hi> to be ſaved without the <hi>One thing neceſſary</hi> to ſalvation; and without a heart that is ſet upon it, and a life that is imployed for it. It is the Holy Ghoſt that calleth you to anſwer the queſtion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> If you know how, then enter the liſts with God, and diſpute the caſe with him: How will you eſcape, if you be neglecters of the <hi>Only way</hi> that he hath provided for your eſcape? Is there any device or ſhift of wit, that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your eſcape? Is there any power or intereſt of men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that can procure your eſcape? How can that be done, that God hath reſolved ſhall not be?</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you now, beloved Hearers, to remember this urgent motive of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and uſe it when you are tempted to delay or trifle about the buſineſs of your ſalvation, as if it were ſome indifferent needleſs thing. Without worldly Riches you may be rich in faith: Without worldly honours, you may have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being the ſons of God: and without worldly pleaſures, or health, or life, you may have the favour of God and Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: But without the <hi>One thing needful,</hi> you have nothing that is durably or ſatisfactorily good, but are undone for ever. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the things of the world, you will live in want for a little while, and then you will be equal to the greateſt Princes: But without <hi>this One thing,</hi> you muſt live in endleſs woe and miſery, and be far worſe then the baſeſt priſoner in the Dungeon, or than the toades and vermine that lie in the uncleaneſt holes or ſinks of the earth. And yet dare you delay another day before you make ſo Neceſſary a change? You have hearts of ſtone, if your <hi>Own Neceſſity</hi> thus urged upon your Conſideration will not awake you. If your hearts were not dead within you, while you hear theſe things, one would think <hi>ſuth a Neceſſity</hi> ſhould make you feel, and reſolve upon a ſpeedy change, and make you ſtir in the diligent performance. Can you go on in ſecurity, in negligence and worldlineſs, when you hear of your <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> that you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59464:50"/>
                        <hi>muſt</hi> change, or you are loſt for ever? O ſtupid ſouls, that will not be moved with <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of everlaſting conſequence! O what hath God, or Chriſt, or heaven, or holineſs, done againſt theſe men, that will rather lie in Hell for ever, then they will live in the love and ſervice of this God, and in the practice of holineſs, and in the hopes of Heaven! How meet are they for Hell, that will venture upon it deliberately and upon choice, to ſcape the trouble of living in the holy Love, delight and ſervice of the ever bleſſed God? that is, to ſcape the trouble of Heaven. Is it ſo great a ſin to ſhut up the bowels of compaſſion againſt our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his need? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. And is it not more unnatural to deny compaſſion to your ſelves in your own neceſſity? and in the greateſt neceſſity? O poor ſinners, remember your <hi>Neceſſities!</hi> Your own, your great, your abſolute <hi>Neceſsities:</hi> When you hear men that gather alms cry [<hi>Remember the poor</hi>] doth it make thee think [<hi>What a poor neceſsitous ſoul have I to remember?</hi>] As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Preaching to others, I may ſay much mote to you, of minding and practiſing this great work of your ſalvation [<hi>Neceſsity is laid upon you, and woe to you if you do it not.</hi>] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. Woe to you that ever you were born, and that ever you were reaſonable creatures, or rather, that ever you ſo abuſed your Reaſon, if you neglect and miſs of the One thing neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>I know you have other wants to be ſupplyed, and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to look after in the world: But alas, how ſmall are they! God will ſupply all your other wants, if you will firſt and ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look after this. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. Or if life and all go, you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will find all in heaven: But if you miſs of this One thing, nothing in the world can make ſupply, or do you good. And though now your <hi>feeling</hi> tell you not theſe things, alas how quickly will God make you <hi>feel,</hi> and teach you by that ſenſible way that you would needs be taught by?</p>
                     <p>Awake then you ſluggiſh careleſs ſouls! Your houſe over your heads is on a flame! The hand of God is lifted up! If you love your ſelves, prevent the ſtroke: Vengeance is at your backs: The wrath of God purſueth your ſin; and woe to you if he find it upon you when he overtaketh you: Away with it ſpeedily: Up and be gone, return to God; make Chriſt and mercy your friend in time, if you love your lives.

O poor ſouls! Is there, think you, a greater <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of your <hi>ſin</hi> then of your <hi>ſalvation?</hi> and of pleaſing your fleſh for a little time, then of pleaſing the Lord, and ſcaping everlaſting miſery?

If the world be divided into a thouſand opinions, or go a thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes, they may thank themſelves who are the Authors of this confuſion; but God is no cauſe of it, or friend to it. <hi>He</hi> hath made them but <hi>One work,</hi> and ſet them but <hi>One way</hi> to heaven, and given them <hi>One Maſter,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, to <hi>teach</hi> that way; and written but <hi>One Law,</hi> even his holy Scripture, to be their ſure and conſtant guide: And if men would ſtick to this <hi>One Maſter,</hi> and not make <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> their maſter, or the <hi>multitude</hi> their maſter, or the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the world, or the <hi>cuſtum</hi> of their <hi>fore fathers</hi> the maſter of their fatih: and if they would ſtick to this <hi>One Word</hi> of God, and not run after the <hi>Traditions</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> they would not be in ſuch a maze, nor of ſo many minds as now they are: But they do in their doctrines as they do in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: God hath marked them out but <hi>One</hi> way in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>ſure</hi> way, the way that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles went to heaven in, and <hi>this way</hi> will not ſerve mens turns, but they will run an hundred waies inſtead of <hi>this One:</hi> and they muſt make <hi>new wayes</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt were never acquainted with.</p>

If you cannot underſtand the depths of Sciences, nor reach the height of learning that others do attain, yet learn this <hi>One thing,</hi> to know God in the Redeemer; and if you know this, you know all. <hi>Paul</hi> was not only <hi>contented</hi> with this knowledge, but <hi>reſolved to know nothing elſe but Chriſt and him crucified;</hi> that

It is not <hi>godlineſs</hi> that they hate and reproach, but it is <hi>fervent prayer, holy conference, meditation, ſelf-denyal, mortification of the deſires of the fleſh, heavenly mindedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>general,</hi> they will ſay that <hi>Gods Law muſt be obeyed,</hi> and his <hi>Will preferred</hi> before their own: But when it comes to the <hi>particulars,</hi> they Love him not above all, they take his name in vain, they keep not holy his day, they diſobey ſuperiours that would reform them, they are envious, malicious, covetous, luſtful, and break all the Commandements in <hi>particular,</hi> which in <hi>general</hi> they profeſs to keep. As if your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould promiſe to do your work; and when you ſet him to it, one thing is too <hi>hard,</hi> and another he is not <hi>uſed to,</hi> and ſo he hath his exceptions againſt the greateſt part which he undertook. As if one ſhould wound one of you in the head, and ſtab you to the heart, and cut off an arm or a leg, and ſay, <hi>I wiſh the man no harm; It is not the man that I hate or hurt, but only the head, the heart, the arm,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>5. Is it the <hi>meeting of divers neighbours together (diſtinct from Church-meetings</hi>) that you queſtion? Why, if it be <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>publick meetings,</hi> or to do <hi>any unlawful work, we</hi> are againſt it as well as <hi>you.</hi> But if it be but for the <hi>redeeming of their time,</hi> for their ſpiritual advantage, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59464:68"/>
peaceably, and ſoberly obſerved, by ſome that have more time, or care of their ſouls, then the reſt of their neighbours; ſure you will not for ſhame imagine, that neighbours may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully meet to make merry, and feaſt, and ſport, and conferr about their worldly buſineſs, and yet may not meet to pray, and praiſe God, and repeat what inſtructions they have received of their Teachers, and prepare for and improve the publick Ordinances? Hear what the Spirit ſaith alſo in this. In the <hi>text</hi> here you find <hi>juſt ſuch a meeting,</hi> where Chriſt was teaching, and <hi>Mary</hi> and his Diſciples hearing, and <hi>Martha</hi> cumbred with providing for the company, and blamed for neglecting the advantage for her ſoul. Acts 12. 12. <hi>Peter came</hi> out of priſon <hi>to the houſe of</hi> Mary, <hi>where many were gathered together praying.</hi>] Acts 10. 24. [<hi>Cornelius called together his kinſmen and near friends</hi>] to hear <hi>Peter;</hi> who there <hi>preached</hi> to them, <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>baptized</hi> them. I need to inſtance in no more, becauſe this was the <hi>ordinary practice</hi> of Chriſt and the Apoſtles. If you ſay, <hi>Thoſe were times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> I anſwer, True: But, 1. yet ſuch times in which publick Aſſemblies were ordinarily held, and publick preaching uſed. 2. And as the good of mens ſouls required it in times of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſo when the good of ſouls requires it, in times of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is from the ſame general reaſon a duty; but <hi>never forbidden</hi> by Chriſt in any times of greateſt proſperity and peace.</p>
                     <p>6. Is it the <hi>holy obſervation of the Lords day</hi> that is the <hi>preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> that you cannot away with? Of <hi>all men,</hi> it beſeems not <hi>them</hi> to quarrel at this, that own our Homilies, and with the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer,</hi> uſe after the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> to ſay, [<hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and encline our hearts to keep this Law;</hi>] When they have heard, [<hi>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day, thou, thy Son, thy daughter, thy man-ſervant, thy maid-ſervant, thy cattle, and the ſtranger that is within thy gates.</hi>] You ſee all the foreſaid duties muſt be performed, and publick Aſſemblies for Gods worſhip and our inſtruction continued: And therefore there muſt be <hi>ſome known appointed time</hi> for theſe. And do you know <hi>any other day</hi> that is fitter? I think you will not pretend to that: You would <hi>not have another day</hi> inſtead of this; but you would have <hi>no day</hi> at all for ſuch holy works; but a day for eaſe, and idleneſs, and ſports, and vain diſcourſe, and pleaſures, with ſome little formal publick worſhip intermixt to cheat your ſouls. It is not then <hi>the Day,</hi> but the <hi>ſerious, diligent, holy employment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59464:69"/>
and duty</hi> that you are againſt; and that I have proved to be Gods will before. Doubtleſs if you leave all men to ſerve God when they will, without any ſtated time, his worſhip will ſoon be brought to nothing, and they that pretend to keep every day holy, will keep none. Look upon the <hi>places</hi> where the <hi>Lords day</hi> is kept holy, and ſee whether <hi>godlineſs</hi> flouriſh not <hi>there</hi> incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably above all other places. And I think none can doubt but that more ſouls have been converted and brought home to God on <hi>that day,</hi> then on any day of the week, if not then <hi>all the reſt</hi> beſide. And there is not the peeviſheſt malignant ſoul of you, that can with any ſhew of reaſon prove that the holy obſervation of the Lords day is <hi>unlawful,</hi> if it were <hi>not neceſſary:</hi> So that we are at leaſt on the <hi>ſafeſt ſide of the hedge:</hi> For we can ſay that we take a <hi>moſt happy opportunity</hi> for the good of our own ſouls, and the worſhipping of God; and that we are ſure we do that which is <hi>no ſin;</hi> our adverſaries themſelves do not charge us with doing that which is <hi>forbidden,</hi> but that which they conceit <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:</hi> But if we ſhould do as they, and neglect this day, we are not ſure but it may be a great ſin; (nay indeed we are ſure it would be ſo.)</p>
                     <p>But what ſaith the Holy-Ghoſt now to this queſtion? To paſs by the fourth Commandement, at this time, the letter of it, and the equity and reaſon of a ſeventh day; the advantage of reaſon why there ſhould be no leſs under the Goſpel, and ſuch like; I ſhall only now ſay theſe two things. 1. It is <hi>plain in Scripture</hi> that (<hi>de facto</hi>) the Apoſtles and Churches uſed to meet for holy Communion in Gods worſhip on the Lords day: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that this was appointed by the Apoſtles, or immediately by Chriſt himſelf, there being then no other that pretended to any ſuch authority: and that Apoſtolical allowance no man que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioneth. The Apoſtles then having the extraordinary gift of the Spirit, by which they were enabled infallibly to make known the will of God, and being commiſſioned as well as enabled here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; as their writing of the holy Scriptures, ſo their conſtitutions for the ordering of the Church, being the effects of that <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> received from Chriſt, and that <hi>Ability</hi> given them by the Spirit, are Divine, and principally the acts of Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe agents the Apoſtles were. Now that the firſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did by their appointment, obſerve the Lords day for holy actions, is apparent. As Chriſt firſt laid the ground-work by R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59464:69"/>
on that day, ſo he began that very day to preach unto <hi>Mary</hi> the comfortable doctrine of his Aſcenſion, in words that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be <hi>written in gold,</hi> or rather in the <hi>deepeſt room of every true Believers heart:</hi> [John 20. 17. <hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God and your God</hi>]; The <hi>firſt Sermon</hi> that ever was preached on a <hi>Lords day,</hi> even on the <hi>firſt Lords day by Chriſt himſelf,</hi> even to a <hi>beloved penitent woman,</hi> whom he choſe to be as it were his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to deliver <hi>them</hi> this Meſſage <hi>as from him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the <hi>ſame day</hi> the <hi>Diſciples</hi> being <hi>Aſſembled,</hi> he <hi>owned</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> their <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and gave them the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Thomas</hi> being abſent from the Aſſembly the <hi>firſt Lords day,</hi> did miſs the ſight of Chriſt and was <hi>unbelieving,</hi> Chriſt left him a <hi>whole week in his unbelief,</hi> and would not <hi>heal</hi> him <hi>till the next Lords day,</hi> which he <hi>honoured</hi> with <hi>that cure. Then the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples being met again, Chriſt came among them,</hi> and convinced <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>another Lords day,</hi> they <hi>were all with one accord in one place, and the Holy Ghoſt was in the extraordinary meaſure given them.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. it is mentioned as the cuſtom of the Diſciples, to come together on the <hi>firſt day of the week to break bread;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> then <hi>preached to them even till midnight.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. the <hi>Collections for the Saints</hi> were made <hi>every firſt day of the week in all the Churches of Galatia,</hi> and at <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe they had then their <hi>holy Aſſemblies.</hi> And therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. it is called peculiarly <hi>the Lords day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. But to clear this paſt all rational doubting, we find in all the <hi>writings of the antients,</hi> and <hi>hiſtorie of the Church,</hi> that <hi>all the Churches through the world</hi> unanimouſly obſerved the <hi>Lords day</hi> as <hi>inſtituted</hi> by <hi>Chriſt or the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles;</hi> none ever queſtioning or contradicting it, that ever I read of. He that hath read the writings of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and denyeth this, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be diſputed with. The <hi>practice of the univerſal Church</hi> is a full <hi>expoſition</hi> of the <hi>fore-cited Scriptures;</hi> and though it be <hi>no Law</hi> to us it ſelf, yet is it a full <hi>diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>fact</hi> (telling us what was the primitive practice) and ſo a <hi>diſcovery of the Law.</hi> And ſhall any private ignorant man, come in alter one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty ſix years, and ſay the Apoſtles and all the Churches in the world have been deceived till this day,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59464:70"/>
and we muſt rectifie the miſtake? Shall theſe fellows come in at the end of the world, and call the Apoſtles and all the Churches of all ages <hi>Puritanes,</hi> for <hi>keeping holy the Lords day?</hi> Or will any but a brain-ſick perſon hearken to ſuch ſhameleſs men as theſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But the antient Churches did not keep that day as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but only as a day for publick worſhip.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will not ſtick with you for the <hi>name:</hi> We urge you not to call it the Sabbath, (though the Antients ſometimes did ſo: See our Homilies of the Place and Time of Prayer) if you will call it as <hi>Scripture</hi> and the Churches did, by the name of the <hi>Lords day.</hi> And it was then the cuſtom of the Churches, to <hi>ſpend almoſt all the day in publick Worſhip and Holy Communion,</hi> and therefore they had but little time for any private duties that day. And yet (though the private practiſes of particular perſons on that day be little mentioned in Church-hiſtory) no man can prove that they uſed to ſpend <hi>any remaining hours</hi> of that day <hi>as common time</hi> in <hi>common buſineſs.</hi> So that to quarrel againſt the <hi>holy obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is but to quarrel with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>all the Churches of all ages ſince,</hi> and with the <hi>happyeſt ſeaſon for the worſhipping of God,</hi> and ſeeking our own and other mens edification.</p>
                     <p>7. What is there yet remaining then that you quarrel with as <hi>too much preciſeneſs?</hi> Is it the <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of <hi>mens lives</hi> in <hi>forbearing ſin,</hi> and <hi>not doing as their neighbours do,</hi> in <hi>rioting and vain recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and delights?</hi> For this I need not ſtand to juſtifie them, with any impartial ſober man. If <hi>ſin</hi> be <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſe God,</hi> and <hi>deſerve damnation,</hi> he that <hi>moſt fully</hi> and <hi>carefully</hi> avoideth it, is the <hi>honeſteſt</hi> and the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> man. You will not blame your child or ſervant for being loth to offend and diſobey you even in the ſmalleſt matter. You like not him that offereth you the <hi>leaſt</hi> abuſe, ſo well as him that offereth you <hi>none.</hi> You had rather be <hi>well</hi> then have the <hi>leaſt</hi> diſeaſe. You will not take a <hi>little poyſon;</hi> nor would you feel a <hi>little of hell:</hi> Why then ſhould we not avoid the <hi>leaſt ſin</hi> ſo far as we are <hi>able?</hi> If <hi>ſinning</hi> be <hi>good,</hi> then <hi>Devils</hi> are the <hi>beſt creatures,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) the <hi>worſt.</hi> But if <hi>ſin</hi> be the greateſt evil, What will you <hi>call</hi> thoſe men that do not only wilfully commit it, but <hi>plead</hi> for it, and <hi>reproach</hi> thoſe that would fain avoid it? Or what if ſome of thoſe that you reproach, are miſtaken in ſome point, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that to be a ſin that is none? Or what if you think it to be no ſin which they ſcruple? Will you blame a man that loves God, to be afraid of that which he ſuſpecteth may offend him? Or will you blame him that cares for his ſalvation, to make as ſure of it as he can? and to keep as far from the brink of hell as he able? How is it that you obſerve not that your very <hi>reproaches</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute themſelves? What is it that you are <hi>offended at</hi> in the <hi>ſervants of the Lord?</hi> Is it <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil?</hi> Surely it is ſome <hi>fault</hi> or other of theirs, that you will <hi>pretend</hi> to be the cauſe. For ſcarce any but the Devil himſelf will openly and profeſſedly oppoſe <hi>Goodneſs</hi> under the name of <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> And if it be a (real or ſuppoſed) <hi>fault</hi> that you ſpeak againſt them for, doth it not intimate that they ſhould <hi>avoid all faults</hi> as far as they are able?

And if it would do any thing with thoſe that doubt, towards the turning of the ſcales, to tell you which ſide Chriſt is on, its told you here in my Text, as plain as the tongue of man can ſpeak [<hi>One thing is Needful:</hi> Mary <hi>hath choſen that Good part, which ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi>

                        <p>If now the word of Chriſt alone would ſerve your turn, I had done my work: I needed not to go any further: You would be <hi>now reſolved,</hi> that <hi>Heaven and Holineſs is beſt,</hi> and would <hi>ſet</hi> your <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> to <hi>ſeek</hi> it; and ſo it would be your own for ever. But this Text hath long ſtood in the Goſpel, and men have heard and read it often, and yet the moſt are not perſwaded; and therefore I muſt try to open it a little farther to you, and plead it with you, and work the Reaſon of it upon your minds.</p>
                        <p>Reader, our buſineſs is but to enquire, <hi>What it is that is Beſt for Man to ſet his heart on and ſeek after in his Life, and Enjoy for ever?</hi> I ſay, it is the <hi>Everlaſting Enjoyment of God in Heaven:</hi> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith ſo. If <hi>thou</hi> think otherwiſe, let us debate the caſe. If <hi>thou believe</hi> as <hi>I do, Live</hi> as thou profeſſeſt to believe. If men did but deeply and ſoundly know <hi>what it is that is beſt for them,</hi> it would ſet right their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives,</hi> and make them happy. But not knowing this, is it that keepeth them from God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and everlaſtingly undoes them.</p>
                        <p>Though I have often opened this heretofore on other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet my preſent ſubject now requireth, 1. That I tell you, <hi>What that is that here is called</hi> [<hi>The Good part.</hi>] 2. <hi>What it is that is ſet againſt it, and by fleſhly minds, preferred before it?</hi> And having briefly opened theſe two things, I ſhall come to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi> and ſhew you <hi>which is the better part.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. That which Chriſt calls here [<hi>that good part</hi>] is 1. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,</hi> the <hi>end of man,</hi> or our <hi>everlaſting Happineſs</hi> with God in Heaven. 2. <hi>Subordinately,</hi> the <hi>Means</hi> by which it is attained. 3.

                        <p>1.

Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Happineſs</hi> which in <hi>Heaven</hi> he ſhall enjoy for ever.</p>

                        <p>3. At the <hi>laſt day,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> ſhall be raiſed and united to the ſoul, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will come in glory to judge the world, where he will openly abſolve and juſtifie the Righteous, when he condemneth the ungodly, and <hi>will be glorified in his Saints,</hi> and <hi>admired in all them that do believe,</hi> and the <hi>Saints ſhall alſo judge the world,</hi> and be themſelves adjudged to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory.</p>
                        <p>4. Their everlaſting habitation ſhall be in the Heavens, even near unto God, and in the preſence of his Glory.</p>
                        <p>5. Their company will be only Bleſſed Spirits, even the holy Angels and glorified Saints, with whom we ſhall be One Body, and conſtitute the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and be perfectly one in God for ever.</p>
                        <p>6. Their <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall be <hi>perfected</hi> and made <hi>immortal, spiritual, incorruptible</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> bodies, ſhining as the Stars in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Firmament: No more ſubject to hunger, and thirſt, or cold, or wearineſs, or ſhame, or pain, nor any of the frailties that now adhere unto them, but be made like the glorified body of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>7. The <hi>Souls</hi> of the Saints united to theſe Bodies ſhall alſo be <hi>Perfected,</hi> having far <hi>larger capacity</hi> to know God and enjoy him then now we have; being freed from all ignorance, errour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, pride, hard-heartedneſs, and whatſoever ſin doth now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us; and perfected in every part of the Image of God upon us.</p>
                        <p>8. The <hi>eyes</hi> of the <hi>Glorified Body</hi> ſhall in <hi>Heaven</hi> have a <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>behold</hi> that is <hi>ſuitable</hi> to their <hi>Bodily capacity: Heaven</hi> being not a place where the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God is <hi>confined,</hi> but where a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared glory</hi> will be <hi>manifeſted</hi> to make Happy the Angels and Saints with Chriſt. And whatever other ſenſes the Glorified Bodies ſhall then have (whether formally or eminently, we cannot now conceive what they will be) they will all be ſatisfied with <hi>ſuitable Delights</hi> from God.</p>
                        <p>9. The <hi>Bleſſed perſon of our Redeemer</hi> in our Nature Glorified, will there be the Everlaſting object of our delightful <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </p>
                        <p>10.

                        <p>11. With the Knowledge of God and the Beatifical Viſion will be joyned a <hi>perfect Love unto him,</hi> and cloſure with his bleſſed <hi>will:</hi> So that to <hi>Love him,</hi> will be the everlaſting employment of the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>12. This <hi>Love</hi> will be drawn forth into <hi>everlaſting praiſe;</hi> and it will be our work before the Throne of his Glory, to <hi>magnifie the Lord for ever.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>14.

and then we may make ſomething of our debate.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Queſtion is, [<hi>Who it is that ſhall be Judge between us in this debate? or whoſe witneſs it is that you will take for currant?</hi>]</p>
                     <p>I am willing to ſtand to the <hi>Judgement</hi> of any that <hi>underſtand</hi> the caſe, and are <hi>impartial.</hi> I hope you will conſent that we ſhall take the moſt competent witneſſes and Judge. And if ſo, 1. You know that the <hi>Devil is no competent Judge.</hi> It is <hi>he</hi> that perſwadeth you that <hi>preſent delights</hi> are the <hi>better part,</hi> and rather to be choſen then a Holy life. But <hi>he</hi> is <hi>Gods enemy,</hi> and therefore no wonder if he ſpeak againſt him: He is <hi>your deadly enemy;</hi> and therefore no wonder if he would deceive you: He is caſt out of heaven himſelf, and would not have <hi>you</hi> poſſeſs the room that he hath loſt: He is a wicked lying ſpirit: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be believed. He is a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and therefore will not ſpeak for your ſalvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. If the <hi>Devil</hi> be to be believed, then none are wiſer then the ungodly ſenſual worldly men; and none are in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then thoſe that are deſpiſed by the world for Holineſs, and that ſuffer all things for a Life unſeen. But the enmity that is planted in your very natures againſt the <hi>Devil,</hi> I hope, will help you to confeſs, that <hi>he</hi> muſt not be the Judge.</p>
                     <p>2. And truly <hi>Ignorant ungodly men are unmeet Judges.</hi> And it is <hi>they</hi> that bawle againſt Religion, and ſpeak againſt they know not what. 1. They are <hi>Blind</hi> by nature, and more blind by cuſtomary ſin: And muſt a <hi>Blind</hi> man be your Judge or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a caſe of everlaſting moment? 2. They are <hi>unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced</hi> in the ways of God. How can they judge of a ſtate that they <hi>were never in,</hi> and of a way that they <hi>never went? They never tryed</hi> the work of the new birth, nor <hi>never tryed</hi> the holy exerciſe of faith, or Love or any Grace; and therefore you may as well take the Judgement of a ſimple man concerning another countrey that was never there, or concerning Navigation, that never was at ſea, or concerning Learning that never read a book, or concerning Muſick that never toucht an Inſtrument, as the Judgement of an unſanctified man concerning Holineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> unfit to be witneſſes, or Judges? All the Scripture ſpeaks againſt the Devil, and the wicked, and the luſts of the fleſh: and therefore they are <hi>a party,</hi> even the party that is to be ejected. 4. Yea they are <hi>enemies,</hi> and therefore their teſtimony or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be regarded.

Let him but make an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned tryal</hi> of a life of <hi>Holy Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> as long as I have done, and we will receive his Teſtimony: Nay more, let him thus try a life of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly) but one year, yea or but one moneth, or day, or hour, and we will take his Teſtimony: But to be judged by a man in a matter of ſalvation, that ſpeaks of what he <hi>never knew nor tryed one hour,</hi> but ſpeaks againſt he knows not what, this is a motion too bad to be made to a very Bedlam.</p>
                     <p>6. If yet you are not reſolved which is the <hi>Better part</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> to whom do you deſire to referr it? Shall <hi>Heathens, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> be Judges? Why if they be, they will give the cauſe againſt you. <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> of the Heathen world do profeſs to believe a <hi>life to come,</hi> where ſome are happy and ſome are miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and they commonly profeſs that all men ſhould obey their Maker, and make it their chiefeſt care and labour in this life, to be happy in the next: <hi>Heathens</hi> will confeſs <hi>this.</hi> And yet I ſuppoſe you will eaſily confeſs that <hi>theſe</hi> men are none of the fitteſt Judges. The way to Life by Jeſus Chriſt <hi>they</hi> do not underſtand: But that the <hi>world</hi> is <hi>vanity,</hi> and nothing to be preferred <hi>before</hi> our <hi>happineſs</hi> in the world to come, this they will commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. And if the <hi>lives</hi> of the moſt of them contradict this profeſſion, yet ſtill they are forced to confeſs the truth: and truth is not the leſs truth, becauſe they that confeſs it will not obey it. Nay what greater teſtimony can you wiſh to ſilence your unbelieving thoughts, then the witneſſes of the <hi>enemies of the truth,</hi> who as they <hi>condemn themſelves</hi> by bearing witneſs to that which they refuſe to practiſe, ſo ſhall their witneſs aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate your condemnation, if you will live below it. What, are you Chriſtians? and yet refuſe to come up in your choice and lives to the doctrine of Heathens and Infidels?</p>

Do you not hear how they rail at us for your ſakes that are vicious and ungodly, and tell us that <hi>you</hi> are the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>ſhame of our Miniſtry?</hi> Though theſe words be the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> of their malicious Hereſie (for all the world may know that it is our daily work to procure your Converſion, and that you keep your ſins, and refuſe a holy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, in deſpight of us) yet I muſt tell you, that theſe wretches ſhall condemn you. The ſtreets and Congregations have heard them cry out againſt your ungodly lives: and yet you will not turn to God. Muſt good and bad, muſt Miniſters and raging Hereticks give in their teſtimony againſt you, and yet will you not be ſatisfied and come in?</p>
                     <p>8. If yet you know not the <hi>better part,</hi> to whom will you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal? Will you go to the <hi>Multitude</hi> and put it to the vote, not only among Chriſtians, but throughout the world? Truly there is no great reaſon for this, when moſt men are ſo blind and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: but yet if you ſhould, they would go againſt you, twenty, if not an hundred to One. I know well enough that when it comes to <hi>practice,</hi> they will not <hi>live</hi> a <hi>holy Life,</hi> and ſhew thereby a root of bitterneſs: But if you ask them what their <hi>judgement is, Whether God or the world,</hi> whether <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>earth,</hi> whether <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> be <hi>beſt</hi> and to be <hi>choſen,</hi> moſt men are againſt you, and would give it you as their judgement under their hands, that God and everlaſting life ſhould be firſt ſought: Though by this <hi>Confeſſion</hi> they <hi>condemn themſelves,</hi> yet is it their <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> As I told you before, the <hi>Jews</hi> are for this doctrine; the <hi>Turks</hi> and other Mahometans are for it; <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Heathen world</hi> is for it, <hi>doctrinally,</hi> though they will <hi>not practice it:</hi> Only there are <hi>three ſorts</hi> againſt it in the world, that ever I heard of. <hi>One ſort</hi> are the <hi>Cannibals</hi> that eat mens fleſh, and go naked, and live like beaſts, and never heard of another life; and ſome ſuch ſavages as they. Another ſort is a <hi>few</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers</hi> and and their followers, that differ in this from <hi>all the reſt.</hi> A third ſort is here and there a <hi>debauched apoſtate,</hi> that by the righteous judgement of God are ſo far forſaken by his Grace, for their pride and falſhood againſt the truth, that they have loſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59464:89"/>
of a Life to come, and live under the viſible plagues of God upon their ſouls, as men that have ſinned wilfully againſt the truth, and have <hi>no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a fearful looking for of judgement and fire that ſhall devour the adverſary,</hi> Heb. 6. 6, 7. &amp; 10. 26. and are near the ſtate of the Devils themſelves, that are reſerved in the chains of ſpiritual darkneſs to the judgement of the great day, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. <hi>Job</hi> 21. 30. And will you take the judgement of here and there a forlorn wretch, a deplorate apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, an Epicure, or a Countrey of inhumane Cannibals, before the judgement of the moſt wiſe and godly, and of almoſt all the world? What excellency hath the underſtanding of theſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, that it ſhould be ſo valued above all others? You know partly in <hi>this place,</hi> who they be that are of this Opinion: And is their Number, or Wiſdom, or Converſation ſuch as ſhould move you to be of their Opinion? Shall half a dozen deſperate apoſtates of ungodly lives, ſeem wiſer to you then all the world? And yet I am perſwaded that if you go to any even of <hi>theſe</hi> few apoſtates, whatever they <hi>think,</hi> they will <hi>confeſs</hi> that a <hi>Holy life is beſt:</hi> And yet have you not witneſs enough againſt you?</p>
                     <p>9. Who then ſhall be the Judge? Shall we appeal to the very <hi>Things themſelves,</hi> and to the daily <hi>experience</hi> of the world? You <hi>ſee</hi> that worldlings labour for the wind. You <hi>ſee</hi> that all their care and pains will not avoid the ſtroak of death, that turneth the proudeſt fleſh into a clod, and maketh dirt of the greateſt Prince. You ſee that wealth and honour do but mock men, and leave them in the grave, to darkneſs and corruption. And when you are ſure that this will be the upſhot of all your fleſhly pleaſure and worldly gains, are you not ſatisfied paſt all doubt, that the ſmalleſt hopes or poſſibility of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life ſhould be ſought with far more care then this?</p>
                     <p>10. If none of theſe witneſſes be regarded by thee, I know not whom to appeal to, but <hi>thy ſelf!</hi> And wilt thou needs <hi>thy ſelf</hi> decide the caſe? Haſt thou knowledge and experience, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and impartiality enough to fit thee to be judge: If thou hadſt, thou wouldſt make no doubt of it, but have been reſolved for Heaven and Holineſs ere this. Thy <hi>unreſolvedneſs</hi> proves thee blind and partial, and very much forſaken by the ſpirit of light: And ſhould ſuch a one be judge? But go to, I will much
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59464:90"/>
referre thy caſe to thy ſelf (reſerving ſtill the final judgement to the Lord) upon theſe juſt and reſonable conditions.</p>
                     <p>1. Wilt thou firſt thy ſelf but uſe thoſe neceſſary means for knowledge, in Reading, Faſting, Praying, Watching, Meditation, Conference with the wiſe, and ſuch like, as all thoſe do that come to ripe and ſaving Knowledge? If I referr my health to thee as my Phyſicion, thou muſt not refuſe to try my pulſe, and ſee my urine, and uſe the means to find out the diſeaſe. Wouldſt thou be my Lawyer, and refuſe to read my Evidences, and ſtudy my caſe? And wilt thou needs be judge thy ſelf of the matters of thine own felicity or miſery, and yet refuſe to read and hear and pray and meditate, and uſe the neceſſary means of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Wilt thou lie in bed and work out thy ſalvation? Wilt thou make uſe of no ones eyes but thy own, and yet wilt thou wink or draw the Curtains, or ſhut the windows, and caſt away thy ſpectacles, and neither come into the ſunſhine, nor uſe a candle? This is but to ſay, I will willfully condemn my ſoul, and none ſhall hinder me.</p>
                     <p>2. But yet another condition I muſt propoſe. If thou wilt but (as I ſaid before of others) a while make <hi>Tryal</hi> of a holy life, and try in thy ſelf what <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are, and try what <hi>ſelfdenyal</hi> is, I will then referr the matter to thy ſelf. Go back from God if thou find any Reaſon for it: and turn from Chriſt and Heaven and Holineſs if thou do not like them. But if thou wilt needs be the judge, and wilt not be perſwaded to <hi>try</hi> the <hi>thing,</hi> thou art a partial ſelf-deceiving judge.</p>
                     <p>3. But it this much cannot be obtained, at leaſt be Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in thy judging. If thou wilt but take thy ſelf aſide from the noiſe of wordly vanities and deceits, and commune ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with thy heart, and bethink thee as before the Lord, and as one that knows he muſt ſhortly dye, Whether Heaven or Earth ſhould be ſought moſt carefully, and Whether God or thy fleſh ſhould be ſerved moſt reſolvedly and diligently; and if thou wilt but dwell ſo long upon theſe manlike thoughts till they are digeſted, and Truth have time to ſhew its face, I dare then leave the queſtion to thy ſelf. The next time that the Sermon or any affliction comes near thee and awakeneth thy Conſcience, do but withdraw thy ſelf into ſecret, and ſoberly bethink thee of the matter, what <hi>hopes</hi> thou haſt from the <hi>world,</hi> and what thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Conſcience</hi> leave to ſpeak, and then I will venture the iſſue upon thy <hi>Conſcience:</hi> For <hi>thee</hi> I mean, though I muſt ſtick to a better judge my ſelf. Doth not <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſometime tell thee, that the Holyeſt perſons are the wiſeſt, and that thy labour is liker at laſt to be loſt and repented of, than theirs? Doth not Conſcience ſometime make thee wiſh that thou wert but in as ſafe a caſe as they: and that thou mighteſt but die the death of the Righteous, and that thy laſt end might be as theirs?</p>
                     <p>4. But if all this will not ſerve the turn, thou <hi>ſhalt be Judge thy ſelf:</hi> but it ſhall be when thou art <hi>more capable</hi> of judging. If God by <hi>Grace</hi> ſhall <hi>Change</hi> thy heart, I will ſtand to thy Judgement: If he <hi>do not,</hi> when thy graceleſs guilty ſoul ſhall paſs out of thy pampered dirty fleſh, and appear before the dreadful God, I will then leave the caſe to thy Conſcience to judge of. To all <hi>Eternity</hi> it ſhall be <hi>partly left</hi> to the <hi>judgement of thy Conſcience,</hi> whether <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>Holineſs</hi> be <hi>better?</hi> and whether <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>careleſs ſinners</hi> were the <hi>wiſer?</hi> and whether it had not been be ter ſor thee to have ſpent that life in preparing for thy Endleſs life, which thou ſpentſt in ſlighting it, and caring for the world and fleſh. Then thou ſhalt be Judge thy ſelf of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but <hi>under</hi> a more ſevere and righteous judge: And ſo as ſhall make thy tearing heart to wiſh with many a thouſand groans, that thou hadſt <hi>judged</hi> wiſelier in time.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe that Judgement will be to deſperation, and too late for hope or any help, let <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſpeak when thou lyeſt ſick, and ſeeſt that thou art a dying man! Then judge thy ſelf whether a Holy or a worldly life be better? and whether it had not been thy wiſer courſe to have ſowed to the ſpirit, that ſo thou maiſt reap everlaſting life, then to have ſowed to the fleſh, from which thou now lookſt to reap no better then corruption. Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: God is not mocked: whatſoever <hi>a</hi> man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it will be very late to ſtay till thy own Death draw ſo neer thee, go but to thy <hi>neighbours</hi> that lie in ſickneſs, looking for the ſtroak of death; Yea to thy companions in ſin and folly, and <hi>ask</hi> them then which way is <hi>better? Ask</hi> them then which is the <hi>better</hi> part? Whether now they had rather be the Holyeſt Saints, or ſuch as they have been?

Had you rather appear before the Lord in the caſe of thoſe that we derided as Puritans and too preciſe for making ſuch a doe about ſalvation, or in the caſe that you and I have lived in?</q>] Ask but this Queſtion to thy old companions, and try whether the Conſciences of almoſt all that approach their end, do not bear witneſs againſt ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and do not juſtifie the holy diligence of the Saints. It is but two days ſince a poor drunkard of a neighbour Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, being ready to paſs out of this world, did ſend hither (and to other Pariſhes) in the terrours of his ſoul, to <hi>deſire our Congregations to take warning by him, and to ſtrive with God if poſſible, for ſome mercy for his ſoul, that was paſſing in terrours into another world, becauſe of the guilt of his odious ſin.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Well ſirs, I have gone along with you to all the creatures in this world, that have any fitneſs to judge in this caſe: and if all theſe will not ſerve, we muſt go to another world for Judgement, or ſtay till you come there.</p>
                     <p>11.

                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59464:91"/>12. But if all theſe witneſſes will not ſerve you, what ſhall we ſay to you? Whom will you chooſe to be your Couſellor? There is none left that I remember, unleſs you will go the <hi>Devil</hi> for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But againſt this I have told you enough before. Will <hi>he</hi> ſpeak for <hi>Holineſs</hi> that is a ſpirit of <hi>uncleanneſs;</hi> and will he ſhew thee <hi>Heaven</hi> that laboureth purpoſely to <hi>hide</hi> it <hi>from thee,</hi> till thou have loſt it? Or will he let thee ſee the odiouſneſs and danger of thy ſin, when it is the ſnare and bait by which he hopeth to undo thee; But yet for all this, let me tell thee, that thou mayſt learn even from the <hi>Tempting Enemy</hi> himſelf, the Truth of that which I am now aſſerting. For as the Devil himſelf believeth it, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth thee not to believe it; ſo the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>Temptations,</hi> may help thee to perceive that <hi>Heaven</hi> is attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the only way. Would he make ſo much ado about it, to keep thee from the believing it, and ſeeking it, if there were not a <hi>Heaven</hi> for thee to find? why is he ſo eager to draw thee unto ſin, if ſin be not <hi>hurtful</hi> to thee? Doſt thou not <hi>feel</hi> the importunity of his Temptations? Its eaſie to obſerve them. Why is he ſo much much againſt a Holy doctrine, and a Holy life, and a Holy people, if it were not that he knows the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and worth of Holineſs for thy good? The actions of a Knowing Enemy, may do very much to acquaint us with the truth. Beſides this, he hath oft appeared in bodily ſhapes (as I am able to prove by undenyable evidence;) ſometime to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice men to ſin, and ſometime to be Gods executioner to afflict them for it, and ſometime to make a Covenant with witches and Conjurers for their ſouls, as many a hundred of them have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed at their death. And why ſhould he be ſo deſirous of thy ſoul, if thou hadſt none to loſe? or ſo deſirous to deceive thee, and deprive thee of ſalvation, if there were none for thee to loſe? and if this were not the chief concernment of thy ſoul, why ſhould thy chief enemy ſo much regard it? Thou ſeeſt that he is not ſo careful to deprive thee of thy fleſhly pleaſure: He careth not how much thou haſt of this: The more the glutton is pleaſed with his chear, and the more the drunkard delighteth in his cups, and the more the fornicator is pleaſed in his filthineſs, and every voluptuous perſon in his voluptuouſneſs, the Devil is pleaſed ſo much the more. He cares not if thou have all the Kingdoms of the world, if he can deprive thee of the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom: Nor will he grudge thee the glory and honour of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59464:92"/>
the world, if he can but keep thee from the heavenly Glory. He will allow thee the Hypocrites Reward, which is the applauſe of men, if he can but keep thee from the Saints Reward, which is the ſavour of God. He cares not how much of thy Good things thou haſt here, if he can deprive thee of the Everlaſting Good. It is his deſire that thou have thy <hi>Portion in this life,</hi> that thou mayſt miſs of the <hi>Believers Portion</hi> in the next. Certainly the Devil himſelf by his Temptations, Apparitions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, doth plainly tell us of a life to come, and what it is that conduceth moſt to our Good or Hurt, our Joy or Torment; and conſequently teacheth <hi>us</hi> what to <hi>chooſe,</hi> by tempting us ſo palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and eagerly to refuſe it.</p>
                     <p>You ſee now what a Jury of Witneſſes I have brought in, to teſtifie which is the <hi>Better part:</hi> The Devil and the wicked are added to the reſt, becauſe you will hear no better witneſſes. If you will, here are enow whoſe teſtimonies are unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>But when all is done, it is the Lord that is and will be <hi>Judge.</hi> All theſe are but <hi>witneſſes</hi> to diſpoſe thee to receive his ſentence. Thou art <hi>no Believer,</hi> till the Authority of the Word of God, will ſerve to ſatisfie and reſolve thee.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>2. And it is moſt manifeſt from the very <hi>nature of man,</hi> and from the <hi>common experience</hi> of the world. 1. If man be <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed,</hi> it muſt be either by <hi>Laws containtng Rewards and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or <hi>without.</hi> Not <hi>without.</hi> For, 1.

                     </p>
                     <p>2. If the Love of Vertue for it ſelf ſhould prevail with <hi>one</hi> of a thouſand, that would be nothing to the Government of the world.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor could any man be effectually induced to love Vertue for it ſelf, according to the doctrine of the <hi>Brutiſts:</hi> For <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it ſelf</hi> is made no <hi>Vertue</hi> by them, but a <hi>deformity</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> while they overthrow the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Object,</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> that it is meaſured and informed by (as I ſhall more fully open to you anon). It is therefore moſt certain that no Nation is or can be <hi>Governed</hi> as beſeemeth <hi>man,</hi> without <hi>Propoſed puniſhments and Rewards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if ſo, then theſe muſt be either <hi>temporal</hi> puniſhments and benefits, or ſuch as are to be had in the <hi>Life to come.</hi> That <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> cannot be <hi>Motives ſufficient</hi> for any <hi>tolerable</hi> (much leſs <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>ſufficient</hi>) Government, is a moſt evident Truth: For 1. <hi>de facto</hi> we ſee by experience, that no people live <hi>like men</hi> that be not Governed by the Belief of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life. The Nations that believe it not, are <hi>Savages</hi> almoſt all; living naked and beſtially, and knowing nothing of vertue or vice., but as they feel the commodity or diſcommodity to their fleſh: They eat the fleſh of men, for the moſt part, and live as brutiſhly as they believe. And if you ſay that in <hi>China</hi> it is not ſo, I anſwer, one part of them there believe the Immortality o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the ſoul, and moſt of them take it as <hi>probable,</hi> and ſo the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath the Government which it hath, from everlaſting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſay that the <hi>antient Romans</hi> had a ſufficient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I anſwer, 1. The moſt of them believed a life to come, and it was but a few that denyed the Immortality of the ſoul: and therefore it was this that Governed the Nations. For thoſe that believed another life, had the <hi>Government</hi> of the few that did <hi>not believe</hi> it, or elſe the <hi>Government it ſelf</hi> had been more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. 2. And yet the faultineſs of their belief appeared in the faultineſs of their Government. Every Tyrant took away mens lives at pleaſure. Every Citizen that had ſlaves (which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) at pleaſure killed them, and caſt them into the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds. The ſervants ſecretly poyſoned their maſters, and that in ſo great numbers, that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. <hi>ad Lucul.</hi> that the [<hi>Number of thoſe that were killed by their ſervants, through trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, deceit, or force, was as great, as of them that were killed by Kings</hi>]; which was not a few.</p>
                     <p>2. It is apparent that the world would be a Wilderneſs, and men like wild and ravenous beaſts, if they were not Governed by Motives from the Life to come.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe the Nature of man is ſo corrupt and vicious, that we ſee how prone they are to evil, that everlaſting Motives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are too much uneffectual with the moſt.</p>
                     <p>2. Every man naturally is <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> and therefore would meaſure all Good and Evil with referrence to themſelves, as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and incommodious to them. And ſo vertue and vice would not be known, much leſs regarded.</p>
                     <p>3. By this means there would be as many <hi>Ends,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Rules,</hi> as <hi>Men;</hi> and ſo the world would be all in a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>4. If Neceſſity forced any to combine, it would be but as <hi>Robbers,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> would be their <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and he that could get hold of another mans eſtate, would have the beſt Title.</p>
                     <p>5. All thoſe that had but <hi>ſtrength</hi> to do miſchief, would be <hi>under no Law,</hi> nor have any ſufficient Motive to Reſtrain them. What ſhould reſtrain the Tyrants of the world, that rule over many Nations of the earth, if they believe no Puniſhment after death, but that their Laws and Practiſes ſhould be as impious and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59464:98"/>
beſtial, as their luſts can tempt them to deſire? What ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Armies from Rapes and Cruelty, that may do it unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Or popular tumults that are ſecured by the multitude.</p>
                     <p>6. And there would be no reſtraint of any villany that could but be <hi>ſecretly</hi> committed. And a wicked wit can eaſily hide the greateſt miſchiefs. Poyſoning, ſtabbing, burning houſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming, adultery, and abundance the like, are eaſily kept ſecret by a man of wit, unleſs a ſpecial Providence reveal them (as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it doth).</p>
                     <p>7. At leaſt, the probability of ſecrecy would be ſo great, and alſo the probability of ſinful advantage, that moſt would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>8. And all thoſe ſins would be committed without ſcruple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the <hi>Law of man</hi> did appoint no puniſhment for: as Lying, and many odious vices.</p>
                     <p>9. If one man, or two, or ten ſhould be deterred from poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning you, or burning your houſes, or killing your cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by humane Laws, a <hi>thouſand more</hi> would be let looſe and venture.</p>

For 1. This will then ſhew that the <hi>Nature</hi> of man, is <hi>formed</hi> for another life: and God did not make him ſuch in <hi>vain.</hi> 2. And certainly if everlaſting <hi>Motives</hi> muſt be put into the Laws that govern us, and into our Hopes and Fears, then it is not poſſible, but ſuch things <hi>there are</hi> to be expected. For any man to imagine that God would make a world, which he cannot <hi>Govern</hi> but by <hi>falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> and <hi>deceit,</hi> this is to ſay that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>no God.</hi> For all lying and falſhood comes either from a want of <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> when men either <hi>cannot</hi> make good their words or otherwiſe attain their ends; or when they have not <hi>wit</hi> to <hi>know</hi> what is, or was, or will be, or when they are ſo <hi>bad</hi> as to be <hi>dispoſed</hi> to deceive. But he that aſcribeth any of theſe to God, doth worſe then to ſay that there is no God. If I hate deceit and Lying <hi>my ſelf;</hi> the God that gave me all that little Good which I have, muſt hate it more. Dream not of any but a worm, or fool, or impious tyrant, that needs or loves <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>falſhood</hi> to attain their ends.

He that is all for Operations of Power, as excluding Sapiential Government by Laws, and their juſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doth think ſure that a horſe hath more of the Image of God then a man: For he is much ſtronger. Bruitiſh force would be more excellent then the Attraction of Goodneſs and the Conduct of Wiſdom, if the Government (which is no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that theſe men dream of, were the moſt excellent. As he will allow his <hi>Artificer</hi> to ſhew as much at leaſt of his wit, by making a Watch or Clock that ſhall, though by a neceſſity, move without the finger of the workman continually moving it; ſo methinks he ſhould allow the Infinitely Wiſe and Gracious God, to be nevertheleſs Wiſe or Gracious, if he Rule the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional-free-agent, without a forcible Phyſical Neceſſitation, by a Gracious Attraction and Sapiential Conduct, agreeable to the Reaſon and Liberty of the Creature, as long as we exclude not the Co-working of Omnipotency, nor deny the infallibility of

Divine Predefinition, which may be ſecured with the ſecurity of the Creatures Liberty.</p>
                     <p>In a word, to deny God to be the Soveraign Governour of the world in proper ſenſe, 1. Is a denying him to be <hi>God: it</hi> being a term of <hi>Relation,</hi> comprizing Government, and not of meer <hi>Nature:</hi> When it is commanded us that we have <hi>no other Gods,</hi> and when we are required in the holy Covenant to <hi>take the Lord for our God,</hi> and <hi>give up our ſelves</hi> to him as <hi>his people,</hi> it moſt plainly expreſſeth that his <hi>Governing Authority,</hi> or his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> is comprehended in the term <hi>God.</hi> And indeed having made a <hi>Rational-free-creature,</hi> whoſe <hi>Nature</hi> requireth <hi>Moral Government,</hi> it followed by <hi>neceſſary reſultancy</hi> that he that had <hi>ſole Authority</hi> and <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> muſt be his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Theſe Proud Blaſphemers that deny Gods <hi>proper Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> do contradict the very drift of Scripture, that calleth him <hi>our King</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> and requireth our ſubjection and obedience.</p>
                     <p>3. They deny the being of <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> both the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the Written Laws, and ſo blot out the Word of God, and the ſenſe and uſe of all his works. Though they allow them a certain Phyſical operation on us, yet <hi>as Laws</hi> they do oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them: that is, as they are <hi>Norma officii &amp; judicii,</hi> our Rule of duty, and expectation, and Gods reſolved way of Judging.</p>
                     <p>4. They hereby overthrow all <hi>Duty as ſuch;</hi> and make Good actions to be but as the motion of the arrow that hits the white, and to have none but a <hi>Phyſical</hi> goodneſs in them. For there can be no proper obedience, where there is no proper <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Hereby alſo they deny all Inward <hi>Virtue:</hi> For this alſo can have but a <hi>Phyſical Goodneſs,</hi> if Government and Laws be down.</p>
                     <p>6. Hereby they deny the <hi>Being of ſin:</hi> For where there is no <hi>Law and Government,</hi> but meer Phyſical neceſſitating motion, there is no <hi>Tranſgreſſion.</hi> And therefore when they make a deal of talk about <hi>Purging away ſin,</hi> it is not <hi>ſin indeed,</hi> that they mean; but a meer Phyſical diſeaſe to be <hi>Phyſically</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned.</p>
                     <p>7. Hereby they deny all the <hi>proper Judgement</hi> of God by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59464:100"/>
Chriſt at the laſt day, and make his <hi>Judgement</hi> to be nothing but <hi>Execution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, and 8. All proper <hi>Execution</hi> is denyed, as <hi>Vindictive,</hi> or <hi>Remunerative,</hi> and ſo all <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. The Authority of every Prince on earth is overthrown. For there can be no <hi>Authority</hi> but from <hi>Gods Soveraign Authority,</hi> any more then any <hi>Being</hi> without derivation from the <hi>firſt being.</hi> They may talk to the ignorant of <hi>Contracts,</hi> and <hi>Peoples Wills</hi> being the Original of <hi>Governing Authority,</hi> and <hi>deifie</hi> the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and make them <hi>give</hi> that which they <hi>never had;</hi> but a mean underſtanding may perceive their folly.</p>
                     <p>10. Hereby they deſtroy all <hi>humane Laws,</hi> that muſt receive their ſtrength from <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> or have none: and ſo they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all ſubjects in the world from conſcientious obligations to obedience. If <hi>God</hi> have no proper <hi>Governing Laws</hi> but Phyſical motions, then we are no further obliged to obey men, by any <hi>Law of God,</hi> then we are <hi>effectually moved</hi> to it, and then we <hi>do</hi> obey them. And if ſo, then we can owe no more obedience to Parents, Maſters, or Princes then they force us to! If they can <hi>make</hi> us obey them, well and good: If not, we break no Law of God by diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and many ſuch like are the conſequents of that horrid doctrine that denyeth God to be the <hi>Soveraign Ruler</hi> of the world. In a word, it daſheth out at once all <hi>Government, Laws, Juſtice, Obedience, Good Works,</hi> and all <hi>Morality,</hi> diſſolving the whole frame of the <hi>Univerſal Monarchy</hi> of the world, and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But if you yield that <hi>God is the Governour of the world,</hi> it is then moſt evident that <hi>there's a life to come.</hi> For if he <hi>Govern us,</hi> it is by <hi>Laws, and Judgement:</hi> And if by <hi>Laws, which are they?</hi> There is nothing known among Rational men, by the name of a <hi>Law of God,</hi> which containeth not <hi>Promiſes and Threatnings of Rewards and Puniſhments</hi> hereafter. He hath no <hi>Laws</hi> for the Governing of this world, that contain no Motives but from <hi>Temporal</hi> things. And I ſhewed you before, that he <hi>need not,</hi> he <hi>cannot</hi> Govern the world by falſhood and deceit. And we ſee here by experience, that there is no ſuch <hi>Execution</hi> in <hi>this life,</hi> of the Laws of God, as are ſufficient to the ends of Government.

and make it an Argument for your Infidelity. But ſtay a little till the Aſſizes come. It follows not that there is no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Juſtice, becauſe the Thief or Murderer is not hanged before the Aſſizes, or as ſoon as he hath done the fact. Eternity is long enough for their puniſhment. If God then be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world as moſt certainly he is, then is there a Reward and Puniſhment hereafter; and <hi>Gods Day</hi> will come, when <hi>Mans</hi> is paſt.</p>

My next Queſtion is, <hi>Whether you think that God ſhould be Loved, and Obeyed, or not?</hi> If not, then certainly <hi>none</hi> ſhould be Loved or Obeyed. For <hi>none</hi> deſerves it, if he deſerve it not, from whom we are, and have all our benefits. But if he be, then I further Queſtion you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whether it be likely or poſſible, that any man, or at leaſt all the beſt people in the world, ſhould be loſers by God, and their Love and obedience to him?</hi> And whether it be Credible, that Goodneſs and Obedience to the Lord, ſhould be the conſtant certain way to mens undoing, loſs or miſery? I think you will ſay, if you believe that there a God, that this cannot be. For certainly, he that ſets us a work, will own us in it, and ſave us harmleſs. An <hi>honeſt man</hi> will take it for a diſgrace to him, that his ſervice ſhould be the ſhame and miſery of his ſervants, and he ſhould make them no ſatisfaction. If God be not <hi>Able</hi> to bear us out, he is not <hi>God.</hi> And his Wiſdom and Goodneſs aſſure us that he <hi>Will</hi> do it. So that there is no Poſſibility that <hi>Goodneſs</hi> ſhould be <hi>mans loſs,</hi> and any ſhould finally be <hi>loſers</hi> by God. On this aſſurance I am encouraged to lay out all my time and labour, and dare boldly venture all that I have, in the work of God: For I am ſure I cannot loſe by him.</p>
                     <p>But be thou judge thy ſelf whether his ſervice would not make us loſers, if there were no life but this (though I confeſs the loſs would be ſmall and ſhort:) Who are ſo hated, and perſecuted as they that ſerve God beſt? How many thouſands of them have been fain to give up their bodies to Tormentors, and their lives to the devouring flames? The very work of God conſiſteth in fleſh diſpleaſing things: To deny our ſelves and contemn this world, and live ſoberly, and righteouſly and godly in the world, and to be for this the ſcorn of men, is the lot of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, <hi>This is not the Lot of any but thoſe that are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59464:101"/>
I anſwer 1. We cannot be <hi>over obedient</hi> to God. 2. You contradict the experience of all ages. Even the <hi>form</hi> of Godlineſs is hated by the Profane; and temperance by the drunkard; and he ſhall be their ſcorn that runs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not with them to exceſſes of ryot: <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us that it was ſo even at <hi>Rome</hi> among the Heathens, that he was their deriſion that would not be as bad as the reſt. If therefore in this life only we had hope, we were of all men moſt miſerable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. Not but that even <hi>here</hi> we have the <hi>far better</hi> life then wicked men: But that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it <hi>ſavoureth of the life to come</hi> to which it hath relation. Otherwiſe we ſhould loſe onr credit, eaſe, pleaſure, profit in the world, and have nothing for it. Faithfully Labour for God, O my ſoul; and never fear being a loſer by his work.</p>

And why ſhould not <hi>all men</hi> hold it if it were true? But if you would have all of that mind, it were time for you to look about you. Certainly the Law makers would make other Laws then now they do, and men would lead other kind of lives: And what ſecurity you would have of your goods; or houſes; or lives a week, from the malice or covetouſneſs of others, I cannot imagine. You would not dare to travel by the way, or look out among men: You could not truſt your ſervants, nor your wives, or husbands, becauſe there would be nothing but temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to reſtrain them, which cunning might eſcape. I do not think but you would rather have ſervants, or neighbours or husband, or wife, that believe a Life to come, then thoſe that do not, if you had tryed others but a little while, and ſeen how little they were to be truſted, and conſequently how bad your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is.</p>

If you do, then <hi>upon what ground is it poſſible for you to be honeſt?</hi> If you believe no life to come, you muſt take your pleaſure here on earth for your chiefeſt happineſs: and you cannot believe any proper Government of the world by the Laws, Rewards, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſufficient to reſtrain men from their ſin. Vertue can be

no Vertue, if God no more regard it; and ſin is no ſin, if againſt no Law. Indeed while you live among Believers, where vice is in diſgrace, you may for your credit <hi>ſeem</hi> to be <hi>vertuous:</hi> But your Profeſſion alloweth us to judge that you avoid no evil that you <hi>dare commit,</hi> if it do but ſuit with your <hi>fleſhly intereſt.</hi> He that believeth no Life to come, and tells me ſo, doth bid me, in effect, to ſuppoſe him reſolved for all the wickedneſs imaginable, ſo far as he dare, and hath temptations and opportunity. Are you of this Brutiſh judgement! I ſhall expect from you then no better then a brutiſh life: and truſt you leſs then I would do a brute, becauſe you have more intereſt and temptation to do evil, and more cunning to perform it. Are you <hi>Brutiſts</hi> in opinion? Then you are <hi>already habitually perfidious, cruel, covetous, malicious, murderers, whoremongers, thieves, lyars,</hi> and worſe, if any thing be worſe!

                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. <hi>If the Scripture be not the Word of God, How could it tell us of the making of the world, and ſuch like things, which none but God alone could tell?</hi> I know you will ſay, <hi>I know not whether it tell us true or not; or whether the world were not, as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>thought, from eternity.</hi> But tell me this then (to paſs by the reſt now) <hi>How comes it to paſs that in all the world, there are no Books or Monuments known of any longer ſtanding then the time that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture aſſigneth to the Creation?</hi> It is not ſix thouſand years ſince the Creatiou. If the world had laſted thouſands and millions of years before, is it poſſible that all its Antiquities ſhould be loſt,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59464:102"/>
and not one to be ſeen, nor mentioned by man in all the world, (For the ſabulous tales of ſome in <hi>China,</hi> without all proof, are not worth the mentioning.) Certainly ſome Book would have been ſaved, or ſome Cities, or laſting piles or ſtony monuments preſerved, or ſome ſign or tradition kept alive, of ſome of all thoſe many thouſand years.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, that <hi>Writing or Printing were not then known;</hi> you come to that which confounds you more. How is it poſſible that in ſo many hundred thouſand years, the world grew to no more <hi>experience,</hi> and Arts and Sciences were ripened no more, when <hi>now</hi> they have ripened in a ſhorter time? How is it that <hi>Printing</hi> and <hi>Writing</hi> were not found out? and that all Sciences and Arts are of ſo late invention, and as it were, but in their youth? Certainly Knowledge is the daughter of Experience, and Experience the daughter of Time; and therefore if the world had been from eternity, it muſt needs have been many a hundred thouſand years ago at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> far higher ſtate of Knowledge then is yet attained in the world. For every age receiveth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences and writings of the former, and hath opportunity ſtill to make improvement of them. At leaſt the world could not have been ignorant ſo long, of Printing, Writing, and a hundred things that are certainly of late invention. It is therefore an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing that an <hi>Eternal world</hi> ſhould <hi>loſe all the memorials and monuments of its Antiquity,</hi> before the Scripture-time of the Creation. And therefore doubtleſs it began but then.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. And if God were not the Author of the Scripture, <hi>how come ſo many clear and notable Propheſies of it to be fulfilled?</hi> How punctually doth <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (53<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) deſcribe the ſufferings of Chriſt, and <hi>Daniel</hi> foretell the very year? and ſo of many others?</p>

And if thou hadſt not a blinded prejudiced mind, thou wouldſt perceive <hi>an unimitable Majeſty and ſpirituality in the Scripture,</hi> and wouldſt <hi>ſavour the ſpirit of God</hi> in it as its author: and wouldſt know by the <hi>image and ſuperſcription,</hi> that it is the Word of God. It beareth unimitably the <hi>Image</hi> of his <hi>Power,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu. 5. If the Scripture came not from the Spirit, it could not give or cauſe the ſpirit;</hi> and if it bore not Gods Image it ſelf, how could it print his Image upon the ſouls of ſo many thouſands as it doth? The <hi>Image of God</hi> is <hi>firſt</hi> engraven on the <hi>ſeal</hi> of his holy Doctrine, and thereby imprinted on the <hi>heart.</hi> There is no part of that <hi>holy change</hi> on <hi>man,</hi> but what that <hi>holy Doctrine</hi> wrought. If therefore the <hi>change</hi> be of God, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that wrought it is of God: For both of them are the <hi>ſame Image,</hi> anſwering each other, as that on the ſeal and on the wax. But it is moſt certain that the <hi>Holy change</hi> on the ſoul, is of God. The <hi>nature</hi> of it ſheweth this: For it conſiſteth in the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſin, and the denyal of our ſelves, and the raiſing the heart above this world, and the total Devoting of our ſelves and all that we have to God, and conforming our ſelves to his will, and reſting in it, and ſeeking and ſerving him with all our power, againſt all temptations, and living in the fervent Love of God, and of our Brethren, and deſires after everlaſting life; and a taking Chriſt for our Lord and Saviour, to reconcile us to God, and do all this in us by his Spirit: And ſurely ſuch a work as this muſt needs be of God. If it be <hi>Good,</hi> it muſt needs be <hi>Originally</hi> from <hi>him</hi> that is <hi>moſt Good:</hi> this is undenyable. (And he that will ſay, this is <hi>Evil,</hi> is ſo much of the Devils nature and mind, that it is no wonder if he follow him, and be <hi>Brutified</hi>). And you cannot ſay, that the <hi>Work</hi> is <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine bad:</hi> For the <hi>Work</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Impreſs</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine:</hi> And God doth not uſe to appoint or uſe a <hi>frame of falſhoods</hi> and <hi>deceits,</hi> as his ordinary <hi>means</hi> to renew mens ſouls, and work them to his Will.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you will ſay, that you ſee no ſuch change made by the Word, nor any ſuch ſpirit given by it unto men, but only the effects of their own Imaginations. But, 1. The Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are <hi>True or falſe Imaginations?</hi> Gods truth cauſeth <hi>that Impreſs</hi> on the mind of man, which you call his <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> For where ſhould <hi>Truth</hi> be received, but in the <hi>mind?</hi> and how ſhould it work, but by <hi>cogitation?</hi> They are <hi>cogitations</hi> above and contrary to thoſe of fleſh and blood, that are wrought by this <hi>holy Doctrine.</hi> It is nevertheleſs oſ <hi>the ſpirit,</hi> becauſe it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth man by <hi>conſideration.</hi>

                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59464:103"/>2. And if you ſee not a work on the hearts of the regenerate appearing in their lives, which raiſeth them to a far better ſtate then others, it can be no better then <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> or <hi>malice</hi> that can ſo far blind you.</p>
                     <p>3. But if it be <hi>ſo with you,</hi> give leave yet to the <hi>perſons that know</hi> this holy change <hi>in themſelves,</hi> to believe the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Word that wrought it. <hi>We know</hi> that we are <hi>renewed</hi> and paſſed from our former ſpiritual death to life: and therefore that it was the <hi>Truth of God</hi> that did the <hi>Work of God</hi> upon us. Nothing but <hi>Truth</hi> can <hi>ſanctifie:</hi> But the <hi>Word</hi> doth <hi>ſanctifie:</hi> therefore the <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed the <hi>Holy Church</hi> of Chriſt throughout all ages of the world, hath been his <hi>living Image,</hi> and ſo a <hi>living Witneſs</hi> of his <hi>Word,</hi> as ſhewing by <hi>their lives</hi> the tranſcript of it in <hi>their hearts.</hi> It is eaſie for any that know them, except the maliciouſly blind, to perceive that the true ſervants of Chriſt are a more purified, refined, honeſt, conſcionable, holy, heavenly people then the reſt of the world. For my part, I am fully convinced of it; I ſee it; there is no compariſon: for all their imperfections which they and I lament, I am fully ſatisfied that there is much more of God on them then on others. And therefore there is much more of God in the Doctrine that renewed them, then in any other: The Church is the <hi>living Scripture,</hi> the <hi>pillar and ground of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. the <hi>Law is written in their hearts, Heb.</hi> 8. 10. better then it was in the <hi>Tables of ſtone,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. And by <hi>their holy Love and Works, the world may know that Jeſus Chriſt was ſent of the Father,</hi> and may be brought to <hi>believe in him,</hi> by their <hi>Unity, John</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. God would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr ſo apparently and powerfully with a <hi>falſe doctrine,</hi> to make ſo great a change in man; nor ſo far own it, as to uſe it for the doing of the moſt excellent work in all this world, even the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering him ſuch a Church, and ſanctifying to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay that <hi>ſome of the Heathens have been as good:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1.

It would be God himſelf that ſhould miſlead us: For it is he that worketh the Miracles, or granteth ſpecial Power to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to do it. 2. Man ſhould be unavoidably miſled. For if a <hi>man riſe from the Dead,</hi> and <hi>raiſe others,</hi> and give to <hi>thouſands</hi> the guifts of <hi>Languages, healing,</hi> and the like, and all this have no greater contrary evidence from God of ſome contradiction or controllment, I am <hi>unavoidably deceived;</hi> and neither my <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt innocency,</hi> or <hi>diligence,</hi> or any other help from men, could poſſibly relieve me. And he that can believe that the <hi>Infinitely Powerful, Wiſe, and Good,</hi> is either <hi>neceſſitated</hi> or <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to deceive the world, and Rule them by deceit and falſhood, and to lend his power to confirm a doctrine that he <hi>hateth,</hi> and is againſt himſelf, this man indeed believeth not that there is any God. 3.

                        <hi>Moſes</hi> were not to reveal a <hi>new doctrine</hi> of <hi>ſalvation</hi> that could not otherwiſe be known: but partly to convince <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that the Lord was God, and partly to cauſe him to let go the Iſraelites. The peoples ſalvation lay not on the later; and the former they had abundant means to know by the works and light of Nature it ſelf. And the <hi>Magicians wonders</hi> were not to reveal a <hi>New falſe doctrine</hi> any further then to contend againg <hi>Moſes Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> and if they <hi>had,</hi> yet being againſt the doctrine of the whole Creation, that revealeth the Creator, no man could be <hi>excuſable for</hi> believing them, becauſe God hath given ſo <hi>full a teſtimony before againſt them,</hi> ſo that this objection is plainly but an impertinent cavil.</p>

                        <hi>Quer. 7. Whether it be poſſible, that ſo many and ſo wiſe and godly men</hi> (as their writings prove them) <hi>ſhould give up their lives and all that they had and could have hoped for in this world, to perſwade the world that they ſaw Chriſt Riſen, if it were falſe; and to draw them to believe a falſhood that tended to the worldly ruine of them all?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quer. 8. And is it poſſible that if they had been ſo bad and mad, that ſo many thouſands would have believed them, when their own frequent Miracles, Language,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were the witneſs of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to which they openly appealed? and this in the very age and place where all theſe things might eaſily be confuted if untrue?</hi> If I ſhould pretend to convince the world by <hi>Languages</hi> not learned, and by <hi>other Miracles</hi> and <hi>guifts</hi> which I never had, would countreys, or any ſober perſons believe me? or ſhould I not be the common ſcorn? Would the Churches of the world have been planted by <hi>pretended</hi> Miracles that <hi>never were?</hi> would they all have given up eſtates and lives upon an evident lye? It was eaſie for them <hi>all</hi> to <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> whether theſe things were <hi>done or not.</hi> And therefore he that <hi>ſeeth thoſe Churches</hi> which were the proper <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> may know the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> A real effect had a real cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Quer. 9. Was it poſſible that ſo many hundred or thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, diſperſed about the world on a ſudden, could without coming neer each other, agree both upon one and the ſame falſe doctrine throughout, and on the ſame practices to deceive the world?</p>

                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59464:105"/>Quer. 10. Is it poſſible that among ſo many thouſands, that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or death, or common ingennity, would not have forced ſome to have repented, and opened the deceits of all the reſt?</p>
                     <p>Quer. 11. Is it poſſible that ſo many Hereticks that did fall from them and ſet againſt the true Apoſles, would none of them have diſcloſed the deceit, if really the Miracles had not been done?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quer. 12. Is it poſſible that none of the Jews, their bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor any of the Learned Romans of that age, would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the fraud, and by writing confuted the matters of fact, being publik, and if falſe, ſo eaſily confuted?</hi> Where are the Books that ever any one of them wrote to diſprove any of theſe Miracles? If you ſay, <hi>The Chriſtians burnt them;</hi> give us the leaſt proof of it if you can. When did any Jew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſuch a thing? Nay how could the diſperſed perſecuted Chriſtians deſtroy the writings of their reigning enemies? The writings of Jews and Romans then written remain to this day, and had fuller humane advantages of preſervation, then any that are againſt them. No Jews or Romans complained or to do this day complain of ſuch a thing; nor tell us of any ſuch writings of theirs, that ever were in the world.</p>

                        <hi>Quer.</hi> 13. Nay the <hi>Jews confeſſed the Miracles themſelves,</hi> and had no ſhift left for their unbelief, but by Blaſpheming the Holy Ghoſt, and ſaying that they were done by the Power of the devil.</p>

                        <hi>Quer.</hi> 14. All the <hi>diſperſed Churches and Chriſtians of the world, have univerſally concurred in delivering us down theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, and the Writings that contain them;</hi> and this as a thing that they grounded all their hope of Salvation on, and for which they contemned this preſent world: And the Enemies that gainſaid their doctrine, did not gainſay theſe matters of fact. Could this be feigned?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quer. 15. Have I not fully manifeſted in my Book againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi> (to which I muſt again diſmiſs you) that there is a full and infallible Evidence, that this Scripture was written by the Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, and theſe Miracles done, as there is that any of the Statutes of this Land are the currant Statutes of thoſe Parliaments that are ſaid to make them? And your Lands and Lives are held by the credit of theſe Statutes.</p>

I lay not only all the reputation of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all the hopes and happineſs of my ſoul upon the proof of this point. If I prove it not, I will confeſs my ſelf a <hi>fool</hi> and <hi>undone</hi> for ever. But if I prove it, let the ungodly make

                     <p>1. And firſt, That <hi>Godlineſs is the Beſt for all ſocieties,</hi> (that are juſt) I prove thus.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Godlineſs doth Unite or Center all Societies in the Only Head and Center of Unity; that is, the Bleſſed God himſelf.</hi> A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth will never have <hi>Peace</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their Soveraign, (unleſs he be one that they can overcome:) Nor Souldiers in a ſtate of <hi>Mutiny</hi> againſt their <hi>General:</hi> nor Schollars in ſhutting out their Maſter. God is the only Soveraign of the whole world. The godly all unite in him. Ungodlineſs is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him. The Rebels are alwayes in his Power. There is no Peace nor ſafety therefore, nor any Unity, but an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Rebellion for a while, to any that are not by Holineſs united in him, and Loyal ſubjects to him, Iſa. 48. 22. <hi>There is no Peace, ſaith the Lord, unto the wicked.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But do we not ſee that the main Diviſions of the world are about Religion? Anſw.</hi> 1. Its true; but not by the <hi>truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</hi> The great quarrel of the world is <hi>againſt</hi> Religion in the life and practice of it. 2. It is <hi>unholy</hi> men that cannot abide to be <hi>accounted unholy,</hi> that are the chief dividers. 3. Among the truly Godly, there is no diviſion in the <hi>main,</hi> but only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences about the ſmaller Branches of Religion, which are <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,</hi> and <hi>leſs diſcernable,</hi> and <hi>leſs neceſſary</hi> then the common Truths. They are all <hi>Agreed</hi> of Truth enough to bring them to Heaven; and therefore enough to unite them in dear Affection upon earth. Nay there is not one of them that hath not a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love to all that he diſcerneth to be the ſervants of the Lord. If any be without this, he is <hi>ungodly.</hi> And we are not to anſwer for the miſcarriages of every <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>ungodly man,</hi> that will put on the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> If there ſhould be fallings out among the godly, they cannot reſt till they are healed and ſet in joynt again. But you muſt not then be ſo unjuſt as to conclude, that we can have no <hi>Unity,</hi> till we are in all things of a mind. May not men of various complexions be of one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety? Are not the multitudes of Veins and Arteries in your Bodies, united in the trunks and roots? It not the Tree one, that hath many branches?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But God whom you will needs unite in, is far from us, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59464:107"/>
his mind unknown, and ſo is not the mind of Princes: and therefore we cannot unite in God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In things <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to our <hi>future Happineſs</hi> and <hi>preſent unity</hi> in <hi>special Love,</hi> the mind of God is more plainly and fully opened to us, then the mind of any Prince unto his ſubjects. What precepts can be plainer, then to <hi>Love God above all, and our Neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>firſt to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and to Repent and Believe in Chriſt?</hi> How plain are the Articles of our Faith and the ten Commandments? <hi>Diviſions</hi> have been about <hi>niceties;</hi> I hope God will call back his Churches to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>Practical Godlineſs,</hi> and then the Chriſtian world will be agreed, except the wicked.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Godlineſs propoundeth and proſecuteth the moſt Uniting, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, Powerful End, for all that duty that ſhould advance Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and therefore muſt needs be Beſt for all Societies. God</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> is the common End of all the Godly. They are Agreed every man of them in <hi>One End;</hi> and ſo are not <hi>others.</hi> Their End hath that Power in its attractive Excellency, by which it can do the greateſt things that are to be done with the will of man. The Ends of the ungodly are ſmall and childiſh toye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>3. <hi>Godlineſs takes away the Ball of the worlds contention, that ſets men everywhere together by the ears.</hi> It teacheth men to ſlight the Honour and Vain-glory that the Gallants will fight and die for: And to contemn that wealth, that Towns, and Countries, and Kingdoms are divided and deſtroyed by. It teacheth men to ſlight that Money, the <hi>Love of which</hi> is the <hi>root of all evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. It ſheweth men a better Treaſure, and not only <hi>Verbally,</hi> but <hi>Effectually</hi> teacheth them to trample upon that which the tumultuous world doth ſo much ſcramble for, and ſeek by ſuch rapine, oppreſſion, deceit and blood. If all the Ambitious climers and State-troublers, were truly godly, they would quietly ſeek for higher Honours. If all the covetous Noblemen, Souldiers, Landlords, and Rich men were truly Godly, they would never ſet both City and Countrey into combuſtions, and poor oppreſſed families into complaints, for the Love of Money. If thieves turned godly, you might travail ſafely, and ſpare your locks, and, keep your purſes. If Tradeſmen were all truly Godly, deceit
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59464:108"/>
would not ſo break their peace. What is there for Societies to ſtrive about, when the bone of contention is taken away, and Godlineſs hath caſt down the Idol of the world, that did diſturb them?</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Godlineſs takes down the great diſturbing and dividing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in mans ſoul; and that is, Selfiſhneſs: And it both command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and worketh ſelf-denyal.</hi> Every <hi>ungodly</hi> man hath a <hi>private End,</hi> and a <hi>private Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> that is dearer to him then any other. So many ungodly men as there are, ſo many Ends and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts: And how then can there be a Poſſibility of Unity? The wiſeſt Law-givers could never yet contrive an effectual courſe for the uniting of all theſe. If <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> were down, I ſcarce know what ſhould trouble the peace of Kingdoms, Cities, Families, or any other Societies. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> Or, [<hi>Thou ſhalt not covet</hi>] is the ſumme and concluſion of all the Law of God, concerning our carriage one to another. And it is <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and nothing elſe that <hi>perfectly teacheth,</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> (though imperfectly here) <hi>effecteth</hi> this <hi>Self-denyal:</hi> (But of this elſewhere.)</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Godlineſs hath the moſt perfect Righteous Laws; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> all Societies.</hi> If God can make better Laws then man, then this is paſt all queſtion. His Laws require nothing but what is for mens good. They preſcribe nothing that is diſhoneſt or unjuſt: They promiſe the greateſt Rewards to the obedient: They drive on the backward by the threatning of the greateſt puniſhments. Their Authority is higheſt and moſt unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They all proceed from one abſolute Soveraign, and are the ſame to all the people of the world: They change not, but are to endure to the worlds end. Whereas all the Laws of men, are limited to their own Dominions, and endure but while their power can enforce them. They are ſubject to errour and injuſtice; and are not the ſame in one Countrey as in another; or in one age as in the former: and their Rewards and puniſhments are but temporal: and therefore though <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of God, they are neceſſary for the Government of Common-wealths, yet without <hi>Gods Laws</hi> they would be utterly inſufficient.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>The way of Holineſs is contrary to all Evil whatſoever, and therefore hath nothing to diſturb a Common-wealth:</hi> It is true, we cannot ſay ſo of the <hi>perſons,</hi> becauſe they are but imperfectly ſanctified. Were they in all things <hi>ſuch</hi> as their <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59464:108"/>
and <hi>Religion</hi> do require, they would have nothing that might be injurious to any. But ſurely as a <hi>ſick</hi> man or a <hi>lame,</hi> is better then a <hi>dead corps;</hi> and as a man of <hi>mean underſtanding</hi> is better then an <hi>ideot,</hi> and a <hi>mean Schollar</hi> better then the <hi>illiterate;</hi> ſo a man <hi>imperfectly ſanctified,</hi> is better in a Common-wealth, then the <hi>ungodly.</hi> You blame not the Laws of this Land, becauſe that Thieves and Murderers break them: The Laws are Good, if they oblige men to nothing but what is Good, though bad men break them. The Rules of Chriſtian Religion are moſt perfect, and direct or command men nothing that is evil. There may be faults in us, but there is none in the holy Laws which we deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obey. Religion therefore is the way to the perfecting and ſecuring of all Societies, and the want of it ſubverteth them.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Holineſs doth not only tell men of a right way, and ſhew them their duty, but alſo effectually Diſpoſeth their very minds to the performance of it, and cauſeth them to walk therein.</hi> The nature of it is, to be the very <hi>Right Diſpoſition</hi> of the heart, and right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the life. The truly gracious ſoul is <hi>habitually</hi> an <hi>enemy</hi> to all known ſin, and addicted to obey in all known Duties: And ſurely perſons thus <hi>habituated,</hi> are liker to live according to their Diſpoſitions, then others to live well that hate the good in their hearts which they ſhould practiſe. Mens Laws can <hi>command good,</hi> but cannot give men good hearts to practiſe it, as God doth by his ſervants. If you cannot tell whether wicked men that love ſin, or godly men that hate it, are better members of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, you know not what Societies are for.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Holineſs deſtroyeth the root of iniquity, and teacheth men to hate even ſecret ſins, which are in the heart, or which none can ſee but God alone.</hi> The Laws of men reſtrain the Subjects but from open injuries: but Holineſs reſtraineth men from doing the moſt <hi>ſecret</hi> wrong to others, or once thinking, ſpeaking, or contriving any evil againſt them. It reacheth the conſcience; it cleanſeth the heart, from whence all evil doth proceed. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 24. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. 8. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 14.

He is <hi>not Godly</hi> that Loveth not all men, even his enemies, with that common Love that is due to humanity, and that Loveth not all that Fear the Lord with a ſpecial Love. <hi>Pſalm 15. 4.

                     <p>10. <hi>Holineſs maketh Princes and Rulers a double bleſſing to their people.</hi> It maketh them the more Divine, and bear the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Image of God: How precious is the name of a <hi>David,</hi> an <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> a <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> (though they had all their falls) in compariſon of the name of a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> an <hi>Ahab,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Julian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> O how ſweet is the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Godly King</hi> in the Subjects mouthes? Even thoſe that are <hi>enemies</hi> to <hi>Godlineſs</hi> as in <hi>themſelves,</hi> (becauſe they cannot endure to be curbed and troubled with it) do yet uſe to admire and honour it in their Kings and Governours. <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> conjunct are two ſuch rayes of the Heavenly <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> as place man in the ſtate of higheſt excellency on earth, and make him ſo much to reſemble his Creator, as hath given ſuch the higheſt place in the eſteem and honour of the world, of any mortals: And it is not eaſie for a people to value ſuch Holy and Pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Governours too highly, or to be ſufficiently thankful for them unto God.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Holineſs</hi> effectually teacheth Governours to <hi>Rule</hi> for God: To ſet him higheſt, and make it their work to ſeek his <hi>Glory,</hi> and to avoid all <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> contradictory intereſts; and to own nothing that ſtands at enmity with his honour: but to judge that they have moſt happily attained the ends of their Government and lives, if they have promoted the Goſpel and Kingdom of Chriſt, and the work of Holineſs in the world.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Holineſs</hi> will cauſe Rulers to preferr Gods Laws before their own; and to be examples to their Subjects of obedience to God; and to deſire that all men ſhould ſtand in far greater awe of <hi>God</hi> then of <hi>them:</hi> It will make them careful to form all their Laws and Government to the pleaſing of God, and promoting mens obedience to his Laws; and to take heed that there be nothing in them injurious to Chriſt, or contrary to his Will.

                     <p>1. <hi>Holineſs</hi> effectually teacheth <hi>ſubjects</hi> to <hi>know themſelves;</hi> To know their <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>meaneſs</hi> and <hi>unworthineſs,</hi> and to know their <hi>places</hi> and their <hi>proper work.</hi> It kills that <hi>pride</hi> that

makes men think that none are ſo fit to Rule as they; and it makes them ſo humble as to think themſelves unworthy of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the meaneſt ſtation. And alſo it ſo takes them up with a higher ambition, and ſets their heart on the greater things, that they are dead to the Ambition of the world, and can eaſily leave theſe things to others: Their Kingdom is not of this world: They are taught to expect affliction and perſecution, and not to aſpire after crowns. No man can deny that this is the leſſon ſet them by their Lord, and the Covenant which they make with him when they become his Servants. Whereas the <hi>ungodly</hi> having their portion in this life, and reliſhing and minding moſt the things of the world, will ſnatch and ſcramble and turn every ſtone and do any thing within their reach for worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Holineſs</hi> teacheth <hi>ſubjects</hi> to <hi>ſee God</hi> in their <hi>Rulers,</hi> and honour and obey them as <hi>his officers,</hi> even with an honour and obedience <hi>participatively Divine;</hi> And no men can give them a <hi>higher honour</hi> then they that thus honour them on <hi>Gods account:</hi> and no men can give them ſo full and firm and conſtant <hi>obedience,</hi> as they that <hi>obey God</hi> in their Governours: No man can give them higher <hi>titles,</hi> then they that take them to be the <hi>Officers of God.</hi> Carnal men obey their Governours meerly as men that are able to do them good or hurt.

Though that people ſinned in deſiring a King, yet when they had choſen that kind of Government, and <hi>Saul</hi> was ſet over them, thoſe that went with him were ſuch [<hi>whoſe hearts God had touched: but the Children of</hi> Belial <hi>ſaid, How ſhall this man ſave us? and they despiſed him and brought him no preſents</hi>] 1 Sam. 10. 27.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Holineſs</hi> cauſeth <hi>ſubjects</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>ſubmit</hi> for <hi>conſcience ſake:</hi> They do it becauſe <hi>God himſelf</hi> hath <hi>commanded</hi> them to do it. They pay tribute, and give honour and obedience becauſe it is part of their <hi>Obedience to God,</hi> required of them in the fifth Commandment, which is the firſt with promiſe: Outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is eſpecially promiſed to them that honour their Parents and ſuperiours. And the commands and promiſes of God with the bonds of Conſcience do tie men faſter to their duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine more effectually from diſobedience then the words of men alone can do. Conſcience holdeth <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>conſtantly;</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59464:111"/>
and it holdeth as well in <hi>ſecret</hi> as in publike; ſo that if a man were ſure to do a miſchief and never be diſcovered, he would never the leſs abhor it, as being not unknown to God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. A man that feareth not God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd conſcience, will never ſtick to do a miſchief, if he may eſcape the eye and revenging hand of man: <hi>Faux</hi> will ſet fire to the train to blow up King and Parliament, if he ſee but a probability of eſcape. But he that feeleth the bonds of God upon him, dare not rebel.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Holineſs</hi> deſtroyeth <hi>Self-love</hi> which is the Spring of all <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi> and <hi>diſobedience:</hi> and teacheth a man to own no Ends or intereſts but what ſtand in <hi>due ſubodination</hi> to the <hi>honour of God</hi> and the <hi>common good;</hi> and in due <hi>coordination</hi> with the <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare</hi> of our <hi>neighbours:</hi> Whereas the <hi>ungodly</hi> are every man of them an Idol to himſelf: <hi>ſelf</hi> is the only <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> ſet up againſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countrey;</hi> And if <hi>God</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Countrey</hi> be ſerved by them, it is but in ſubſerviency to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they look to attain ſome wealth or dignity or honour by it. The <hi>ſelf-ſeeking man</hi> is faithful and truſty to no man but himſelf. And the <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> man hath no great temptation to be unfaithful.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Holineſs</hi> doth partly <hi>conſiſt</hi> of <hi>charity,</hi> and teacheth men to do as they would be done by: And how can it goe ill with any ſocieties where <hi>Love</hi> prevaileth, and men are as loth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>wrong</hi> as to <hi>be wronged,</hi> and to do hurt to others as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves!</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Holineſs</hi> brings down Gods bleſſing on each particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and maketh a people the delight of God; and brings them under the promiſe of his favour. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. What abundance of promiſes are there to the obedient? <hi>Iſa. 1. 19. Deut. 4. 30. Exod. 23. 22. Deut. 11. 27. &amp; 13. 4. &amp; 30. 2, 8, 20. Jer. 7. 23. &amp; 11. 4, 7. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Holineſs</hi> maketh men meek and patient, and teacheth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects not to make too great a matter of any injury that is done them; nor to cenſure unwarrantably the actions of their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours: nor to murmur and ſtir up diſcontents; but qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to bear all in obedience to God, and for the common good.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Holineſs</hi> diſpoſeth men to <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> and is as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59464:111"/>
much againſt <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>diviſion</hi> as healthful nature is againſt wounds and ſickneſs. <hi>Whence are wars, but from the luſts that war in your members?</hi> Jam. 4. 1. The ſervant of the Lord muſt <hi>not ſtrive:</hi> The <hi>new Command</hi> of <hi>ſpecial Love</hi> to <hi>one another,</hi> and the ſtrange forbearance, conceſſion, condeſcenſion, forgiving and loving enemies themſelves, required in the Goſpel, muſt needs do much if truly practiſed to preſerve the Peace of any nation.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Holineſs</hi> aſſureth us of ſo great a <hi>Reward</hi> to thoſe that obey their ſuperiours in things lawful, and offereth us ſo much <hi>better things</hi> upon our <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> then ever <hi>diſobedience</hi> or <hi>rebellion</hi> can attain, that hereby it muſt needs tend to the quiet and benefit of Societies. He that is bound to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be exceeding glad</hi> in his <hi>perſecution, becauſe his reward in heaven is great,</hi> hath ſmall reaſon to contrive, or <hi>fight,</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>eſcape</hi> the perſecution together with the <hi>reward,</hi> Matth. 5. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Holineſs</hi> teacheth men both to continue obedient and faithful againſt all temptations, and alſo to propagate the ſame reſolutions, and to draw all others to obedience with us. It was the excellency of Chriſts example, that he would be obedient even when he was falſly accuſed of treaſon, and charged as an uſurper of <hi>Ceſars</hi> right. If we ſhould be called ſeditious, diſobedient, rebellions, when we are moſt loyal, it muſt not move us from our loyalty at all. In all theſe ten particulars I have ſhewed, that in the nature of the thing, it is undenyable that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties: in that it engageth the <hi>ſubject</hi> as well as the Governours, in all that tendeth to their peace and wellfare.</p>
                     <p>And now you may ſee by what is ſaid, that there can be no weight in the Objection which pretendeth from the Caſe of the Waldenſes, Albigenſes, Bohemians, French, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to produce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience againſt what I am proving. <hi>Health</hi> may as truly be ſaid to be the cauſe of <hi>ſickneſſes,</hi> as <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> to be the cauſe of <hi>treachery, rebellion</hi> or diſloyalty; there being nothing in all the world except God himſelf, ſo contray to theſe as Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is.</p>
                     <p>But you will aske, Whence is it then that we have the foreſaid inſtunces? I anſwer ſometime not authority but malice and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty driveth poor Chriſtians to a ſtone, wall, and if they turn
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59464:112"/>
again when they can fly no further, accuſeth them of Rebellion; As it was with the Waldenſes, the Bohemians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometime Princes and States fall out among themſelves, and cannot agree about their Titles, and the Bounds and degrees of their Power: And then whoever the people are againſt, they are ſure from that ſide to hear the moſt opprobrious Titles, and be uſed accordingly if it be in their power. Sometime the right of Government is not eaſily or generally known: as in the contention between the houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> here: And then as one party conquereth one year, and another the next, ſo the people muſt be called Traytors and Rebells by each party that prevaileth, if they obeyed and ſerved the other party againſt them: And if they refuſe to obey and defend <hi>either</hi> of them, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by both. Sometime the Politie of Empires and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths is ſo imperfect and obſcure in the conſtitution, that the ſeveral parties that pretend to intereſt, cannot agree about their Rights, nor the Lawyers agree among themſelves: And the people cannot be thought to be wiſer then the Lawyers in the affairs of their profeſſion: If <hi>Nero</hi> and the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> had each of them commanded the Chriſtians to aid them againſt the other, it would not have been eaſie for the wiſeſt and holieſt of the Chriſtians then to know which part they ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to and aſſiſted: <hi>Paul</hi> thought not meet to decide any ſuch controverſie: He commanded every ſoul to be ſubject to the higher powers, and not reſiſt: but he tells them not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caeſar</hi> or the Senate was the higher powers in a caſe of conteſt and diviſion. Sometime a Traytor uſurpeth the Government, and Chriſtians think when they ſee him ſetled and in poſſeſſion, that, though they hate his uſurpation, yet they are bound to honour and obey him as being poſſeſſed of the Government: Thus <hi>Gregory</hi> the great too haſtily and flatteringly owned and applauded <hi>Phocas:</hi> and the Chriſtian Biſhops ordinarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themſelves to the Emperours that came in by blood and violence: Thus the Biſhops of Rome, and of other Churches in <hi>Italy</hi> and the adjacent parts, ſubmitted themſelves (I think too ſoon) as ſoon as they perceived him to be conquerour, to <hi>Theodorious:</hi> and ſo they did to other conquerours. Sometimes, as the General Councils of <hi>Baſil, Conſtance,</hi> &amp;c. determined that a Council is above the Pope, and declared the contrary to be a damnable Hereſie, and commanded the Biſhops and people
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59464:112"/>
to obey them againſt the Pope: ſo Senates and Parliaments and the Majority of the States men and Lawyers may tell the people that are unacquainted with ſuch Law-caſes, that in this or that they are bound to obey them, upon higheſt penalties, and that they ſhall receive to themſelves condemnation if they reſiſt them; and ſo may miſlead ſuch as intend nothing but to obey the higher powers for Conſcience ſake. And though the errour and commands of Councils and Parliaments excuſe not <hi>à tote</hi> an illiterate Laicke that underſtandeth not thoſe matters, yet ſurely <hi>à tanto</hi> it is ſome excuſe.</p>
                     <p>And ſometime oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 7. And ſometime impatience prevaileth with the weak to do things unwarrantable: &amp; humane paſſion blindeth, Reaſon: &amp; ſometime Temptations prevail in this as in other caſes: And ſometimes Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, that never had any true Religion, do ſhew their carnal diſpoſitions, and unmortified luſts and paſſions and pride, by their rebellion againſt their lawful Governours: and then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt bear the blame of the actions of thoſe that counterfeit Religion: and of thoſe crimes which it doth moſt prohibite and condemn.</p>
                     <p>In a word, Be the accuſation againſt any particular perſon juſt or unjuſt, nothing is more ſure and clear then that he is moſt unjuſt that will charge the Chriſtian Religion as guilty of Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any Rebellions, Conſpiracies, ſedition, diſobedience, faction or diviſions. Chriſt went before us in his own example to pay tribute to <hi>Caſar:</hi> and commanded us to give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſars:</hi> and their falſe accuſing him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him as an offender againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> did no whit move him from the duty of his ſtate of humiliation. What can be more againſt all Treaſon and perfidiouſneſs, then that holy doctrine which commandeth us the exacteſt performance of every lawful promiſe, much more of our Oaths, and duties of Allegiance? what can be more againſt Rebellions then that holy doctrine which teacheth us a life of patience and meekneſs, condemning pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge, and commanding us rather to turn the other cheek to him that ſmiteth us, and to give our coat to him that taketh away our cloak, and go two miles with him that would compell us to go one, that is, to ſuffer yet more, rather then revenge our ſelves or break peace, or order, or raiſe wars, to eſcape ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries? It is a crucified Chriſt that conquered by ſuffering, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59464:113"/>
is your example: And our Religion is but our Conformity to him in his ſufferings and his holineſs. He hath made it part of our duty to himſelf to obey Kings and Rulers, and all Superiours, not only the good, but the froward, and to take it patiently if we ſuffer for well-doing, and not to return ſo much as a reviling, diſhonouring word, or murmuring, rebellious thought. It is not fighting for our ſelves, but following him with the Croſs, and forſaking all that we have, that Chriſt hath made the work of his diſciples, and the neceſſary condition of his promiſe of ſalvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 33. There is no Maſter in all the world that ſo ſtrictly commandeth Patience and forbearance, and forgiving and Love, and Peace and ſubmiſſion to one another as Jeſus Chriſt doth: He ſets the hearts of all his ſervants on another Kingdom, and tells them they have greater things to mind then riches or honours or domination upon earth. He taketh the bone of contention from before them, and bids them leave ſuch things as theſe to the men of the world, that have their portion in this life. You may as honeſtly ſay that the Sun is the greateſt cauſe of darkneſs, as that Chriſt and holineſs are the cauſe of ſeditions, rebellions, treaſons, or perfidiouſneſs in the world. All the world ſet together hath not done ſo much as he hath done againſt them. If men threaten hanging and quartering to ſuch offences, Chriſt threatneth damnation in hell fire to them: And would you wiſh him to inflict a ſharper puniſhment, or more ſeverely to manifeſt his hatred of the crimes!</p>
                     <p>I tell you therefore if you ſhould find Rebellion and Sedition among Chriſtians, it is but as you may find corruption in the bodies of the living, which is contrary to life and health, and to be found much more among the dead. I am not here pleading for individual perſons, but for Chriſtianity and Godlineſs. If any profeſſed Chriſtians forſake the way of Patience and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and turn to Rebellion and diſloyalty, they do far forſake Religion and Godlineſs, and much more wrong and offend their heavenly maſter, then their King and Governours. Plead who will for the wickedneſs of ſuch men; for my part I will not. I am ſure Chriſt will not plead for their <hi>ſin</hi> which he condemneth. He may <hi>juſtifie</hi> them <hi>from</hi> it, upon repentance; but he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver juſtifie them <hi>for</hi> it and <hi>in</hi> it. It is not becauſe they are <hi>godly</hi> but for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> that any men have ever been guilty of rebellions, or reſiſting Lawfull powers: As Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> hath fully
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59464:113"/>
proved in his Sermon on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. Nothing more tendeth to the ruine of Rulers and people, then to hearken to the Devil and the Enemies of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that would perſwade the world into a conjunction with them in the Enmity againſt the way of Godlineſs and the faithful ſervants of the Lord, upon pretence that they are adverſaries to Governours and Government. It is a weighty truth that the foreſaid Doctor begins his Sermon with [<q>Among all the ſtratagems of the Devil, tending to the undermining of Religion, and the ſubverſion of the ſouls of men, though there cannot be any more unreaſonable, yet there was never any more unhappily ſuccesful then the creating and fomenting an Opinion in the world, that Religion is an Enemy to Government, and the bringing ſincerity and zeal in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into jealouſie and diſgrace with the Civil Powers.] It was by this Jealouſie blown into the heads of the High Prieſts and the Sanhedrim amongſt the Jews, and of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> that Chriſt himſelf was accuſed, condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on a tree: By this the Apoſtles were haled before the Governours of Provinces; forced from one City to fly to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for this they endured bonds and ſundry kinds of death. It was through this fancy that the Chriſtians for three hundred years together endured the rage of Heathen Emperours, being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented: Our Lord Chriſt was traduced as an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to the Roman Laws, and a <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> to the Religion and Laws of his Countrey.</q>] Thus and more that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. So that it is no new thing for the moſt innocent and holy and excellent perſons to ſuffer as enemies to the Government where they lived; nay it hath been the common caſe: nor is it ſtrange to hear Religion and Holineſs charged with theſe crimes which they are moſt againſt.</p>
                     <p>As for the malicious ſlanders of the Papiſts againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, as if they had promoted all their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Rebellion, they have been confuted ſufficiently by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. At this time, I ſhall only <hi>deſire the Reader that would be ſatisfied in this,</hi> and underſtand the <hi>Proteſtant doctrine in theſe points,</hi> to read Biſhop <hi>Bilſons</hi> [<hi>Difference between Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and unchriſtian Rebellion:</hi>] Eſpecially pag. 382. and from 494. to 522.

                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59464:114"/>And if he would know whether it be an Article of the very Religion of the Papiſts, that <hi>the Pope may give away the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Temporal Lords that deny Tranſubſtantiation, or hold ſuch like points which he calleth Hereſie, or that will not exterminate all that hold them out of their Dominions, and that he may diſcharge their ſubjects and vaſſals from their Allegiance:</hi> I only intreat him with his own eyes to read the Decrees of their approved general Council at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. and ſet him but believe his eye-ſight. And for their caſe and confutation, let him alſo read King <hi>James</hi> his Anſwer to <hi>Perron's</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Having thus interpoſed an Anſwer to their Objection, that ſay, <hi>Religion</hi> hath brought forth <hi>Rebellions</hi> (which I confeſs <hi>that Religion</hi> which <hi>teacheth Rebellion</hi> hath done; but the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> which <hi>condemneth it,</hi> and engageth men againſt it as aforeſaid, doth not) I now proceed to ſome other proofs, that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is the greateſt ſecurity and eſtabliſhment to Kingdoms and all Societies.</p>
                     <p>12. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> above all things engageth men to be true to their <hi>Covenants;</hi> to keep all their Oathes and Promiſes of Obedience to Kings and to other ſuperiours; and to be faithful and truſty in all their duties to one another: So horrid is the ſin of Perjury and Covenant-breaking, that God hath condemned it, not only in the holy Scriptures, but alſo in the Law of Nature. He will not bear with it in the <hi>Greateſt Princes;</hi> how then ſhall Perfidious ſubjects ſcape? What fair excuſes had <hi>Saul</hi> for his breaking the Vow and Covenant with the Gibeonites? He might have ſaid, 1. They procured it from <hi>Joſhua</hi> by a meer cheat. And therefore no benefit belonged to them from their own ſin and fraud. 2. That <hi>Joſhua</hi> not knowing <hi>who</hi> they were, <hi>ignordutis non eſt conſenſus.</hi> 3. That God had forbid to ſpare any of thoſe Nations. 4. That it was not <hi>Saul</hi> that made this Oath and Covenant, but <hi>Joſhua.</hi> 5. That <hi>Saul</hi> did it in zeal for the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet for all this in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes there was a famine in the land, for this ſin of <hi>Saul,</hi> which was not expiated till ſeven of his ſons (or poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) were hanged at the Gibeonites requeſt: And though <hi>David</hi> might well ſee that <hi>he</hi> might be cenſured as <hi>contriving</hi> all this <hi>himſelf</hi> for the extirpation of the ſine of <hi>Saul,</hi> yet would be not forbear the execution, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. And when the people murmured at <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Heads of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſparing them at
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59464:114"/>
firſt, they are anſwered with the Obligation of the inviolable Oath, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>So though <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> Captive, force could not excuſe his perjury and Covenant-breaking, but God ſeverely condemned and avenged it.</p>
                     <p>So that every Subject that hath but bound himſelf in Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Soveraign, is under ſuch an Obligation as to a true Believer is more dreadful to violate, then it is to ſuffer death.</p>
                     <p>Yea God hath written ſuch a Law againſt <hi>Perjury,</hi> even in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, that he muſt needs be <hi>afraid</hi> of it, that is not a flat Atheiſt, leſt his appeal to God, do bring the vengeance of God upon him: And in this life the perjured ordinarily meet with that Divine revenge which is the fore-runner of eternal venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: The perjured are unfit for humane Society; hated by God, and never more to be truſted by man, till ſound Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance make a change: Which made <hi>Auguſtine</hi> determine, that he that urgeth another to forſwear himſelf, is as much worſe then a murtherer, as killing the ſoul is worſe then killing the Body. Seeing then that Religion doubleth theſe ſacred bonds, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Hell-fire into the face of the perjured and perfidious, it muſt needs be a ſingular perſerver of Kingdoms and all Societies, which fall in pieces where theſe bonds are looſed; and fall into the hands of God, who is a conſuming fire, eſpecially to perjured men.</p>
                     <p>13. <hi>Moreover it is only Godlineſs that obeyeth with true Loyalty, and carryeth on all works methodically for the common Good.</hi> As he that will obey every Juſtice of Peace in all things that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, without reſpect to the Laws or will of the Soveraign Power, may be ſooner a <hi>Traytor</hi> then <hi>truly obedient;</hi> (for every Juſtice or Lord may arm him againſt his Prince) ſo he that will obey the <hi>Princes</hi> of the earth, without reſpect to the Will or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Eternal God, will be but a Traytor to God, under pretence of obeying Princes, that are but his Officers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. But the godly <hi>begin at God</hi> in their obedience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they proceed methodically, and obey men upon right grounds and in their proper places. It is not the <hi>moſt abſolute</hi> obedience to man that is the <hi>beſt.</hi> He that ſhould command men cauſeleſly to fire his Countrey, or to deſtroy the innocent, or to raviſh Virgins or mens Wives, were not to be obeyed, as <hi>Doeg</hi>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59464:115"/>
obeyed <hi>Saul;</hi> but God is firſt to be obeyed. It is he that begins, proceeds, and ends with God, that is ſure to do no wrong, nor be miſled.</p>

                     <p>15. <hi>Godlineſs engageth men in Doing good, as the very buſineſs of their lives, which is to be Rewarded with everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> So that beſides what is forced from men by Law, they are to be ſtill in the exerciſe of Charity, and to be <hi>zealous of good works;</hi> and to make it their ſtudy to do all the good they can: And therefore they are certainly the profitableſt members in any Society, that are moſt truly Godly, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 29, 30, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 38. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>16. <hi>Moreover Holineſs teacheth men to forgive wrongs, and to Love our enemies, and to let go our right, rather then to break Peace and revenge our wrongs:</hi> and to forbear even going to Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiouſly, and where our putting up injuries meerly to our ſelves, may ſuffice for the avoiding of it. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. And what contention can there be where theſe Rules are practiſed? except when the intereſt of God or others is violated; which is not in our power to remit. If you ſay, that <hi>Theſe things are good if they were practiſed:</hi> I anſwer, 1. You confeſs then that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is good: For the <hi>Rule</hi> is <hi>Good,</hi> whether it be practiſed or not. 2. I anſwer, that ſo much as any man is ſanctiſied, he doth practiſe it. And therefore if any man live not according to the Rule which he profeſſeth to live by, that is from the remnant of that ſin within him, which the wicked plead for, and for want of more of that Godlineſs which you diſtaſte. Make him more holy, and he will do all this.</p>
                     <p>17. <hi>Holineſs ſecureth every Society, and intereſteth them in the moſt impregnable defence; even in the Love and favour of the Lord; and in his many ſure and precious promiſes.</hi> He hath engaged his Almightineſs and Fidelity for ſuch, and rendreth them as the apple of his eye, and hath promiſed that he will be their defence, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 5. 11. &amp; 7. 10. &amp; 59. 9, 16, 17. &amp; 62. 2. whereas

the ungodly are under his curſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1. 6. &amp; 37. And which of theſe Societies is liker to be happy?</p>
                     <p>18. <hi>Godlineſs is the ſureſt way to furniſh every Society with all the bleſſings that are truly good for them.</hi> For they have the favour and promiſe of him that is the giver of them all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34. 10. &amp; 84. 11. &amp; 23. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. &amp; 6. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33.

                     <p>AND now I have given you all this Evidence, I dare leave it to the judgement of any man that is fit to judge, Whether it be the godly or ungodly that are the <hi>Better Magiſtrates,</hi> or <hi>Better Paſtors</hi> of the Churches, or <hi>Better Members</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or of <hi>any Society?</hi> Judge now whether the <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> are not <hi>Beſt</hi> that are <hi>moſt Godly?</hi> And whether it be the <hi>Godly</hi> or the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> that are the <hi>Troublers</hi> of the world?</p>
                     <p>And yet it hath ever been the practice of ungodly men, to charge it upon them that Fear the Lord, that all the troubles of the world are long of them. <hi>We were all quiet,</hi> ſay they, <hi>before this Religion and preciſeneſs troubled us; and this is it, that ſince it came among us, hath ſet us all together by the ears.</hi>] But if theſe men be yet reaſonable, I deſire them to conſider,</p>

Juſt like the Sodomites, [<hi>Theſe preciſe fellows, ſay they, will neede be our Judges, and we muſt be ruled by them; before they came among us we had none of this ado;</hi>] But did not God, think you, decide the controverſie aright? He firſt took <hi>Lot</hi> and his family

away, that the Sodomites might be <hi>troubled</hi> with that <hi>preciſe</hi> and <hi>buſie fellow</hi> no more; and then he ſent fire from Heaven on <hi>Sodom,</hi> and conſumed them all, <hi>making them an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire, Jude</hi> 7. Or as it is fully ſet forth by the Holy Ghoſt. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9. [<hi>Turning the Cities of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>into aſhes, he condemned them with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, making them an example to thoſe that after ſhould live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:</hi> (Mark this) <hi>And delivered juſt</hi> Lot, <hi>vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day with their unlawful deeds) The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of Judgement to be puniſhed.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And now who is it that was troubleſom, and the cauſe of evil?

                     <p>2. And conſider I pray you, <hi>What a Quietneſs it is that you have, before you are troubled by the Godly?</hi> It is a <hi>Quietneſs in the high way to Hell:</hi> You had the priviledge of damning your ſouls without diſturbance from theſe preciſe controllers. Hath not Chriſt told us, that the Devil is thus like <hi>a ſtrong man armed, that while he keepeth his Palace, his goods are in Peace: but when a ſtronger then he ſhall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and divideth the spoils.] Luke</hi> 11. 21, 22. The hearts and the Nations that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by Chriſt, are the Devils Garriſons and poſſeſſions: Do
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59464:117"/>
you think that it is beſt that he poſſeſs them ſtill in Peace? Or that the Preachers of Chriſt, that plant his Ordinance againſt them, and batter them, till they are forced to yield, are therefore buſie troubleſom fellows? What is it for, but for your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that are <hi>Satans captives at his will? 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 25, 26.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>And might you not on this ground alſo account Chriſt himſelf the troubler of the world, as much, and a thouſand times more then us?</hi> For <hi>be</hi> doth more to diſturb men in their ſins then any of we: and <hi>be</hi> doth more for Holineſs then all the world beſides. And in this ſenſe he confeſſeth and fore-tells us, that, <hi>he came not to ſend Peace, but diviſion into the world,</hi> into Towns, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Families, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 51, 52, 53. If we can have no Peace with you, unleſs we will diſobey our Lord, and ſerve the Devil and the fleſh, and damn our own ſouls, and ſuffer you to do the like, then keep your Peace among your ſelves; we will none of that Peace: we have no mind to buy your friendſhip and good words at ſuch a rate! If <hi>your peace</hi> will ſtand with <hi>our peace with God,</hi> and <hi>peace of Conſcience,</hi> we will gladly accept of it: If it will not, we can be without it. Your ſouls are like ſores that may not be ſearched, or a broken bone that muſt not be ſet, for fear of hurting you: You are like men that muſt have that which would kill them; or like children that will cry if they be but taken out of their dung, or kept from fire, or from knives. If we do but croſs you in the way to Hell, we <hi>trouble</hi> you, and we break the peace? Yea, and if we will not caſt away our ſouls everlaſtingly for company? And is this the caſe? Is this the breaking of your Peace? The Lord will ſhortly be a Righteous Judge between you and us, and tell you, who it was that was the Troubler of the Towns and Countries, and of the world.</p>

                     <p>Why Sirs, What is it that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> doth, that it ſhould be taken for the <hi>Troubler</hi> of the world, when <hi>ungodlineſs</hi> is taken for your peace? Is it our perſwading or hindring you from ſin
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59464:117"/>
that <hi>troubleth</hi> you? And will not the everlaſting fruit of it trouble you more? Then even ſay, that waſhing you, or ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your houſes, or curing your ſores, or ſickneſs, or perſwading you not to kill your ſelves, is a <hi>troubling</hi> of you! Or is it, (as the Lord hath told us it will be, <hi>Matth. 5. 10, 11. John 15. 18, 19. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 4, 5.) becauſe we are not ſuch as you, and will not do as you do, and be of your opinion, and forſake our Lord to keep you company? Is it not with good reaſon? When we know you cannot ſave us harmleſs: and will not anſwer for us before the Lord? We <hi>know</hi> that every man muſt anſwer for himſelf, and therefore we durſt not truſt you, if you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe us to bring us off: It is beſt for you to ſtudy better how to anſwer for <hi>your ſelves.</hi> But if you are reſolved on it, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly you <hi>will be,</hi> and that you will venture on Hell to ſcape a holy life, why ſhould not you give us leave to pitty you, and to forbear your folly, and to ſave our ſelves? Will it do you any harm that <hi>others</hi> ſhould be ſaved? Or that <hi>others</hi> ſhould be Godly? Your <hi>own</hi> ſanctification indeed cannot ſtand with your luſts and fleſhly pleaſures: but <hi>another</hi> mans may. It will take none of your vain-glory, or wealth, or ſenſual delights from <hi>you,</hi> that <hi>another</hi> man is ſanctified, or devoted unto God. And therefore be not angry with us, if we obey the Holy Ghoſt, that calleth to us, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. [<hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward generation.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>O but</hi> (ſaith the ungodly crew) <hi>it was never a good world ſince there was ſo much Religion, and preaching, and preciſeneſs, and ſo much ado about ſerving God! It was a better world, when we had but a ſhort Service read on Sundaies, and played, and merrily talkt together the reſt of the day! There was more Love and good neighbourhood then amongſt men then there is now: There was not then ſo much deceit, and conſening, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and covetouſneſs in the world: There was more peace, and plenty, and a better world it was then now.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Matters of peace and plenty change often in the ſame age. And certainly you have as little hinderance now, from being as good as you have a mind to be, as ever your fore-fathers had. Two things I have to ſay to your Objection.</p>
                     <p>1. If this be true that the <hi>world is ſo bad, which part is it of the world that you mean? Is it all, or ſome?</hi> Not <hi>all</hi> ſure; that were too horrible cenſoriouſneſs to ſay. Then God would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

deſtroy the world. <hi>Sodome</hi> had <hi>one Lot,</hi> and his family in it Well? it is <hi>but ſome</hi> then that are ſo bad. And which part is it? Is it the <hi>Godly,</hi> or the <hi>Ungodly?</hi> If <hi>Godlineſs</hi> be naught, then <hi>Heaven</hi> is naught, where there is <hi>nothing elſe;</hi> And then take it not ill to be ſhut out? If it be the <hi>Ungodly</hi> that are naught, thats it that I am ſaying. It is time then to <hi>leave</hi> it, and to turn to God. Is it not <hi>you your ſelves</hi> that make the complaint that are the men that make the world ſo <hi>bad?</hi> Is is not you that are ſo Covetous and worldly that you have nothing for the poor, and no time to ſpare for the work that you were made for? nor ſcarce any room, to think or ſpeak of the life to come? Is it not <hi>you that</hi> have ſo <hi>little Charity</hi> that you even <hi>hate</hi> men for <hi>Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>ſerving God,</hi> and ſeeking diligently to ſave their ſouls? Its true, that there was never <hi>greater wickedneſs</hi> in the world then ſince there hath been ſo much Preaching. But <hi>What is that wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>in whom?</hi> It is the <hi>deſpiſing and diſobeying</hi> the calls of God; and the hating and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of a holy life. Thoſe that are <hi>ſaved</hi> by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, may ſay that it was a happy meſſageunto them: but thoſe that <hi>ſlight</hi> it, and willfully ſin in the openeſt light, may well ſay that it is a bad world with them: and worſe it is, and will be for ever, if they be not converted, then if they had never heard the Goſpel: It is you, and ſuch as you that deſpiſe the mercies of the Lord, that make it a bad world; and then you impudently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it, and charge it on them that will not be as bad as your ſelves: and take away the candle and ſhut the windows, that the light may not trouble you.</p>
                     <p>2. Well! but ſay you the <hi>world was better when there was leſs preaching, and leſs ado about the ſerving of God, and our ſalvation. I do not believe you,</hi> and I will tell you <hi>why,</hi> yea, <hi>Why I am certain that your words are falſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Becauſe you contradict the Lord.</hi> God ſaith thoſe <hi>times are beſt</hi> when there is moſt of the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and moſt <hi>helps</hi> for our <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and when the people are moſt Holy. The increaſe of Light and Holineſs is a principal part of the Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of the Promiſes to the Goſpel Church, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa. 9. 2. &amp; 36. 26. &amp; 42. 6. &amp; 60. 3. Mat. 4. 16. Luk. 2. 32. Joh.</hi> 3. 19, 20. The word of God is the greateſt bleſſing under heaven: together with a heart to obey and practiſe it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 28.

of God and keep it.] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 3. &amp; 119. 1, 2. &amp; 1. 1, 2. God himſelf pronounceth them bleſſed that meditate day and night in his Law, and that make it their whole delight; and becauſe of the increaſe of Light and Holineſs extolleth the times of the Goſpel far above thoſe of the Law, affirming the leaſt in this Kingdom of God to be greater as to the honour and priviledge of his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the Prophets, or <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Matth. 11. 11, 12. And would you wiſh me to believe ſuch ignorant men as you, before the God of Heaven that contradicteth you?</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>I will not believe you,</hi> becauſe <hi>your objection is nothing but a Blaſphemous accuſation of the Living God.</hi> If it were true that Preaching is bad, it is Chriſt then that is bad that doth command it. But I am ſure that Chriſt is not bad: and that ſuch as Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him, do it to their coſt. It is he that hath laid a <hi>Neceſſity on us,</hi> and <hi>woe be unto us if we preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 16. and that chargeth us <hi>to feed the flock of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2. Yea the ſpirit chargeth us <hi>before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom, that we preach the word and be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi>] If any one be to be blamed for all this preaching and ſtir for heaven, it is Chriſt that chargeth it ſo ſtrictly upon us. And if thou dare lay the <hi>blame</hi> upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſpeak out, and ſtand to it at judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>3. I know it is falſe that you ſay, that the world is the worſe for all this preachig and Godlineſs, becauſe <hi>it is againſt the very office of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Chriſt was a diligent preacher himſelf, and dare you accuſe him for it? He came into the world to bring us the Light of heavenly Truth: and dare you ſay that it were better be without it. It is the work of the Holy Ghoſt to illuminate and ſanctifie men, and do you think that he doth us hurt? Chriſt dyed <hi>to waſh and purifie by the word</hi> and Spirit, the Church which is his Body, that he <hi>might preſent it ſpotleſs to the Father,</hi> Eph. 5. 26. 27. And dareſt thou ſay that Chriſt came to do us harm?

And yet will you ſay that it was a better world when there was leſs of this? O ſelf-condemning Hypocrites!

                     <p>5. Moreover, <hi>you ſpeak againſt the inward feeling and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain experience of all true Chriſtians in the world.</hi> They all have taſted and found that excellencie in the holy ways and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lord, that they value them above all the world.

With <hi>Solomon</hi> they ſay that <hi>all the things that we can deſire are not to be compared to them,</hi> Prov. 3. 15. &amp; 8. 11. And with <hi>Job</hi> they value the word of God <hi>above their neceſſary food,</hi> Job. 23. 12. And with <hi>Paul</hi> they <hi>count all things Loſs aud dung in compariſon of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 7, 8. They know that it is a thouſand times better with them, ſince God converted them to a holy life then it was before, as well as you know that you are better in your health, then you were in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Try whether you can make men that ever were among thoſe where plague and war and famine raigned, to believe that [it was never a good world, ſince this plague and war and famine ceaſed.] You may as ſoon make wiſe men believe this, as make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced godly men, to believe that it is worſe with them for their turning to the Lord, and living, holy, heavenly lives. You can never by all your doating and ſelf-conceited prating, make thoſe believe whom God hath <hi>ſanctified,</hi> that they were in a <hi>better caſe before,</hi> when they were the ſlaves of Satan, and ſerved ſin, &amp; were under the wrath and curſe of God.

                     <p>6. And we cannot believe you, when you ſpeak evil of a holy courſe, becauſe <hi>your words are againſt all Religion, and common reaſon; and much more, deſtructive of the Chriſtian faith.</hi> If God be not to be Loved with all our hearts, and ſerved with our greateſt care, then he is not <hi>God:</hi> or then there is no ſuch thing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59464:120"/>
as <hi>Religion</hi> to be regarded. A God that is worſe then the Creature, is no God. If we muſt not <hi>ſeek firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof</hi> (Matth. 6. 33.) as Chriſt hath commanded, then it is in vain to ſeek it at all. If there be no <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> let us lay by <hi>all Religion.</hi> But if <hi>there be,</hi> that man that thinks it not worth his <hi>greateſt care and diligence</hi> to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> doth forſeit the reputation of his reaſon with his ſoul. Will you believe that man that ſaith he believeth that there is an Everlaſting Glory to be ſought, and made ſure of in this life of our pilgrimage and warfare, and yet thinks it not worth our ſeeking for above all, and worthy all our coſt and labour? He ſpeaks a groſs and blockiſh contradiction. A Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no better then Earth, is no Heaven. A Heaven that is not worthy the labour of a holy life, is no Heaven. And a God that is not worthy of all that we can do, is no God. Either plainly ſay that you are Pagans and worſe, and believe not any life but this: Or elſe live as Chriſtians, if you will be called <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſay not that you believe there is a <hi>Hell,</hi> if you think a <hi>Holy life</hi> too dear to ſcape it.</p>
                     <p>7. Yea this is not all, but <hi>your words do tend to Brutiſhneſs it ſelf. Pagans</hi> did believe (for the moſt part) a <hi>life after this.</hi> And <hi>Julian</hi> that Apoſtate Infidel himſelf doth preſcribe to all his Idols Prieſts a very <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>Religious life,</hi> according to the <hi>Religion</hi> which he owned; and profeſſeth that all care and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and piety ſhould be uſed to pleaſe God, and obtain the happineſs to come. And ſhall men called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> take the very <hi>Infidels</hi> for <hi>Puritanes,</hi> and be worſe then <hi>Heathens?</hi> If we have not another life to look after, then what are we but <hi>beaſts that periſh?</hi> If you think that you <hi>die</hi> like <hi>beaſts, call</hi> your ſelves <hi>beaſts,</hi> and never more own the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>men.</hi> If you <hi>are not beaſts</hi> but <hi>men,</hi> that have you ſouls to <hi>ſave</hi> or <hi>loſe,</hi> to be happy or miſerable for ever. And is it not worth all our care &amp; labour to look after them?</p>
                     <p>8. Another reaſon why I will never believe you, that the world was better when there was leſs preaching and Religion, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you <hi>ſpeak againſt the very end and nature of preaching and Religion.</hi> For the word of God is written and preached to this <hi>very end,</hi> to make <hi>men better.</hi> And is that the way to undoe the world, to perſwade them to amend! O Impudent malignant tongues! What doth the word of God ſpeak againſt but <hi>ſin!</hi> Doth it anywhere ſpeak againſt any thing that is <hi>Good?</hi> or doth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59464:120"/>
it anywhere command you any thing that is <hi>bad?</hi> Let the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt enemy of God upon earth, ſay ſo, and prove it if he can. I here in defiance of the Devil, and all his inſtruments and ſervants, challenge them in their bittereſt malice, to ſay the worſt they can of the Goſpel, or of true Religion, and prove that ever it encouraged men to ſin, or that ever any was a loſer by it! O wonderful! Muſt the God of heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite ſuch Laws againſt all evil, condemning it, and threatning damnation for it: and yet will theſe wretches have the faces to ſay that it is long of the <hi>Scripture</hi> or of <hi>Religion</hi> that the world is <hi>Evil?</hi> What! Will preaching <hi>againſt your wickedneſs</hi> make you <hi>wicked?</hi> If it do, be it known to the faces of you, that it is <hi>you,</hi> and not <hi>preaching</hi> that ſhall be one day found to be the cauſe, and be condemned for it. Muſt Princes and Parliaments make Laws to hang thieves and murderers! and when they have done, will you ſay it is long of <hi>them</hi> and their Laws that men are <hi>robbed</hi> and <hi>murdered?</hi> Why this is not yet ſo impudently unjuſt as you deal with God. For they threaten but hanging, and he threatneth everlaſting damnation againſt ſin; and executeth it on all the unconverted, as ſure as he threatneth it. And would you have him yet do more to teſtifie his diſlike of ſin? Tell me, thou that blaſphemeſt the holy commands of thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Wouldſt thou have him do more then <hi>everlaſtingly to damn unconverted ſinners,</hi> to prove that he is no <hi>friend</hi> or <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>ſin?</hi> what ſhould he do more? Is there a greater plague then Hell to threaten? Or wouldſt thou have him do more to ſhew how much he loveth Goodneſs, then to <hi>command</hi> it, and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> men daily to it, and to promiſe <hi>Everlaſting Glory</hi> for their <hi>Reward?</hi> Is there any <hi>greater Reward</hi> to be promiſed? I tell thee blaſphemer, to the Juſtifying of my Lord, that all the world hath never done the thouſandth part againſt mens faults, as God hath done. Never were there ſtricter Laws againſt them, then his Laws. And never more terrible executions. And yet wilt thou ſay, that its long of God, or Scripture, or Religion, that the world is naught? If thou ſtay a little longer impenitently in thy blaſphemy, till death have but given thee the mortal ſtroak, (and its hard at hand) thou ſhalt then be anſwered in another manner, and God will eaſily juſtifie himſelf, and ſtop all ſuch vile and arrogant months, and confute thee with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vengeance. Remember that thou waſt forewarned.</p>

                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:59464:121"/>9. Yea furthermore, you <hi>are confuted and ſhamed by your own complaints.</hi> What is it that you quarrel with the Law of God for? is it not becauſe it is ſo <hi>ſtrict, and forbiddeth ſin,</hi> and <hi>threatneth damnation for it?</hi> Is it not becauſe it requireth ſo much <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and telleth you that none of the unconverted ungodly ſhall be ſaved? And what is it that you quarrel with the <hi>godly</hi> for? Is it not for ſerving God, and becauſe they will not be as bad as others? And yet the ſame tongues dare blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Laws of God, and ſay, the <hi>world is the worſe for them!</hi> And the ſame tongue dares revile the <hi>godly</hi> as the cauſe that the world is ſo bad! What ſhould one ſay to ſuch unreaſonable men, that will at the ſame time murmur at the Holy word and wayes of God, becauſe they contradict the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and threaten them with Hell fire becauſe they <hi>repent not,</hi> and yet ſay it is long of this <hi>very word,</hi> and the preaching and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in a holy life, that the world <hi>grows worſe!</hi> O impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mouths! that at once revile the ſervants of Chriſt, becauſe they will not be <hi>as bad</hi> as others, and yet ſay that its <hi>they</hi> that make the world <hi>ſo bad.</hi> God will very ſhortly ſtop ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable mouths.</p>
                     <p>10. And if <hi>your words were true, then it would follow that all Gods greateſt Mercies are worth nothing, yea, that they are a hurt to us, and curſes rather then bleſſings.</hi> What is the <hi>Gospel worth,</hi> if the reading, and preaching, and practiſing of it, do make the world worſe, and only trouble men? What are all <hi>Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances worth,</hi> if this be the fruit of them? And why hath he appointed Paſtors and Teachers for his Church, if this be all the good they do? Nay what is <hi>Chriſt himſelf worth</hi> to the world, if thoſe are the worſt men that moſt obey him, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy his word, and diligently ſeek him! O unworthy ſouls! is this all your thanks to God for a Chriſt when you are loſt by ſin? and for the Goſpel that offereth you everlaſting life? and for the Miniſtry of your Paſtors that would teach you the way of life? May we not take up the Prophets exclamation, Iſa. 1. 2. <hi>Hear O heavens, and give ear O earth: I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me: The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſters crib: but this people doth not know the Lord, nor Conſider.</hi>] Your beaſt doth not take his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender to be <hi>naught</hi> for him, and rather chooſe to be without it. And you are <hi>worſe then beaſts</hi> in your dealing with the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59464:121"/>
Lord: and when he hath provided you a Chriſt, a Goſpel, Teachers, and holy Ordinances, even the preciouſeſt things in the world, you unthankfully refuſe them, yea and reproach them; and take them to be naught for you, and ſay that it is long of <hi>them</hi> that the world is ſo bad! O horrid ingratitude! when miſerable ſouls are in the captivity of ſin and Satan, and within a few ſteps of everlaſting fire, the God of Mercy ſends his Son, his Word, and Miniſters, to help them out, and ſet them free, and ſave them from Hell before it be too late; and what entertainment have they! They are reviled by theſe wretches as if they came to make them worſe, and do them a miſchief, and not to ſave them! Righteous is the Lord that condemneth ſuch as would not be ſaved, and as took ſalvation for an injury. And juſt were God, if he ſhould take away the Goſpel, and his Miniſters and his people, from ſo unthankful and unworthy a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration as this that are weary of them, and ſay they are the <hi>troublers of the world,</hi> and think that they do them more hurt then Good; and as the <hi>Gadarens</hi> by Chriſt, <hi>deſire him to depart out of their coaſts, Matth.</hi> 8. 34. Be content a while, unworthy ſouls! You ſhall not long be troubled with a Chriſt, or with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or with Preaching, or with Praying, or with the company of theſe preciſe people, that you ſo much diſlike. Sleep on but a few nights more, and paſs on but a few dayes further, and you ſhall come to a place before you look for it, where you ſhall never have their company more, and where you ſhall be out of the <hi>reach</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and of <hi>Hope.</hi> And in the mean time, were it not for the ſakes of thoſe whom God will convert and ſave, this <hi>troubleſome Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Holy people</hi> ſhould be taken from you, and given to a people that will be more thankful and more fruitful, becauſe <hi>you put it from you and have judged your ſelves unworthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, Acts</hi> 13. 46. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 41. No thanks to you that <hi>England</hi> is not like the Indians, and as miſerable as you would have it.</p>
                     <p>11. And why ſhould we believe you when <hi>we ſee that you judge clean contrarily for your bodies, then you do for your ſouls?</hi> I have never heard any of you ſay, [<hi>It was never good world ſince our land was fruitfull, and ſince ſo much corn came to the the market; It was a better world when men had nothing but roots to feed on.</hi>] And yet would you be believed, when you ſay that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59464:122"/>
it was better when men had not ſo much of the Scripture, and of Chriſt and holineſs, the food, the life, the health of ſouls?</p>
                     <p>12. And I the leſs believe you, becauſe I find that <hi>this hath been the common ſpeech of others in all former ages.</hi> They that lived in the dayes of your fathers, ſaid ſo of the former times [<hi>It was formerly a better world then now.</hi>] And if you had lived in thoſe dayes of your <hi>fathers fore-fathers,</hi> you would have heard <hi>them</hi> ſay the ſame. Its common with men to <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>evil</hi> thats <hi>preſent,</hi> and to praiſe the days that are paſt, whoſe evil they felt not, or have forgotten.

                     <p>13. And little cauſe have we to believe you, when <hi>we have preſent experience that your words are falſe. We ſee that thoſe are the beſt, that are moſt Godly.</hi> He is blind that ſeeth not an exceeding difference betwixt them and ſuch <hi>as you</hi> that ſpeak againſt them. Do not we <hi>ſee</hi> that <hi>they</hi> are <hi>ſober,</hi> when ſome of <hi>you</hi> are <hi>drunken?</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> are ſeeking <hi>heaven</hi> when you are ſeeking the <hi>world?</hi> and that they are providing for their <hi>ſouls</hi> and <hi>pleaſing God,</hi> and imployed in the moſt ſweet and heavenly works, while you are pampering the fleſh, or making proviſion to ſatisfie its luſts? Do we not hear <hi>their ſpeeches</hi> are of God, and their ſalvation, and things that edifie, while you curſe or ſwear, or talk filthily, or idly and unprofitably like dreaming or diſtracted men? And yet would you make us believe that you are <hi>as good</hi> as they, and that Religion makes men <hi>worſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you ſay, that <hi>for all this they are ſecretly as bad as others.</hi> Fooliſh malice! If it be <hi>ſecret,</hi> how do you <hi>know it?</hi> If you <hi>know it,</hi> how is it <hi>ſecret?</hi> and its marvail that you do not make it known! Is it not eaſie to ſay ſo by a <hi>Job,</hi> or a <hi>Samuel,</hi> or by Chriſt himſelf, if <hi>ſaying ſo</hi> may ſerve turn, and a wicked tongue may paſs for proof? You may ſay that in ſecret I commit all the ſins imaginable: and how can I diſprove you, when I have no witneſs, but only by deſiring you to prove it if you can? But O happy are the ſervants of the Lord, that are even <hi>in ſecret</hi> alwayes in the preſence of their Judge, who will bear witneſs for them, and juſtifie them againſt malignant tongues!</p>

                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59464:122"/>But you ſay, that <hi>they are as covetous as other men, though they are more Religious.</hi> But this is as ſhameful a falſhood as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Do we not ſee the contrary in the open fruits? <hi>Covetous men</hi> are the forwardeſt to call others <hi>Covetous,</hi> becauſe they would have no body hinder or croſs them in their Covetous deſires or deſigns. And then they are ſaying, [<hi>O ſuch a profeſſor uſed me thus, and ſuch a one did thus</hi>]; and uſually they partially relate the caſe, as their own Covetous hearts encline them paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to judge it. And perhaps they may meet with a worldly hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite that ſeemeth Religious; which is no more to the diſgrace of Religion, then <hi>Cham</hi> was in the Family of <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Abſolom</hi> in the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> in the Family of Chriſt. Do not <hi>you</hi> call your ſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> your ſelves? And yet <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is never the <hi>worſe,</hi> becauſe you <hi>are wicked</hi> that profeſs it.

                     <p>But you ſay, that <hi>in former times there was more Love among neighbours then is now: Then there was more familiarity and kindneſs, and leſs hatred, and malice, and contention, then now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For my part, I know of none: Nor but of <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>Pariſh</hi> (that is turned from us) which is a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ignorant, harmleſs man, that turned <hi>Anabaptiſt.</hi> For as for the <hi>Apoſtate Infidels</hi> that joyn <hi>with you</hi> that are <hi>ungodly,</hi> we have nothing to do with them, but lament their miſery.</p>
                     <p>14. Another thing that hindreth our Belief of you, is <hi>that we ſee that it is only ignorant or wicked men that are of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and ſay that the <hi>world is the worſe for Godlineſs,</hi> or the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> Not a man ſaith ſo that <hi>knoweth what he ſaith,</hi> and that ever felt the power and ſweetneſs of the Goſpel upon his ſoul: But only thoſe that are blinded by the world, and ſerve the fleſh, and are drowned in luſt, and know not what they ſpeak againſt. And ſhall we regard the judgement of ſuch men?</p>
                     <p>15. And moreover, when you ſay that the world was better when there was leſs Godlineſs and Teaching, <hi>you contradict all hiſtory, and therefore are not to be believed.</hi> You know not well what is <hi>before you:</hi> much leſs do you know what hath been in your fore-fathers dayes. Be it known to you, we have as full ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to <hi>know that,</hi> as you have. Many and many a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume have I read, concerning the ſtate of the world <hi>before us,</hi> which tell us of far greater wickedneſs in our fore-fathers daies, then are in theſe. If you will not believe me, I will ſhew it to any of you, that can read and underſtand, at any time when you

will come to me: I will ſhew you the <hi>words</hi> of the Chroniclers, and Hiſtorians of thoſe ages, that make more lamentable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the vices of thoſe times, and tell us of far more evil then, and of a far greater ſcarcity of good, then can be truly ſpoken concerning us. And are you that <hi>never ſaw</hi> thoſe daies, to be believed before them that <hi>ſaw them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. And I am ſure alſo that you ſpeak falſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, <hi>becauſe you make the moſt barbarous Heathens to be moſt happy, and the worſt of men to be the beſt.</hi> If it be <hi>beſt</hi> where there is leaſt Religion, and leaſt Teaching, or meddling with holy things; then are the naked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians the beſt, and the Cannibals that live on the fleſh of men. Theſe be they that are leaſt troubled with Preaching and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if <hi>you think</hi> that theſe miſerable ſouls <hi>are beſt</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeſt,</hi> I pray you go to them, and be happy with them. And by my conſent the Magiſtrate ſhall promote your happineſs, and ſend you thither.</p>
                     <p>17. And would you have us believe you, when <hi>you contradict your ſelves?</hi> Out of your own mouthes will we ſilence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you. It is Chriſt that teacheth us to be Holy. And <hi>do you not pretend your ſelves to believe in Chriſt?</hi> That which you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as a troubleſom or needleſs thing, is nothing but <hi>ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf.</hi> And do you not ſay your ſelves that you are <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> Do not you profeſs the Articles of the Chriſtian Belief? And what do we but practice that which <hi>you profeſs?</hi> We do but <hi>obey</hi> that <hi>God</hi> whom <hi>you</hi> ſay you <hi>believe in,</hi> as the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and all things. We do but love the Lord our Saviour, whom you ſay you <hi>believe in as your Saviour.</hi> We do but obey the Holy-Ghoſt that ſanctifieth all that God will ſave, whom you alſo profeſs to believe in your ſelves. We practiſe that <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> which you deride, and yet profeſs that you <hi>believe.</hi> We ſeek after the remiſſion of ſin, and that life everlaſting, which you take on you to believe your ſelves. And will you profeſs to <hi>Believe</hi> theſe things, and yet ſay they are <hi>naught,</hi> or that it was never a good world ſince <hi>they</hi> were <hi>regarded</hi> and <hi>practiſed?</hi> And do you not profeſs to take the ten Commandments for the Law of God, which all men ſhould obey? And what do we but endeavour to obey them? All that which you hate as too much preciſeneſs, is nothing but the obeying of theſe ten Commandments. And O that we could do it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! And do you not uſe in the ſaying of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> to

You pray that you may not <hi>be led into Temptation,</hi> but <hi>delivered from evil!</hi> and yet you run into temptation, and take that <hi>Evil</hi> to be <hi>Good.</hi> How oft have I heard men, when the Commandments have been repeated, which require us to <hi>take the Lord only for our God,</hi> and <hi>not to take his Name in vain,</hi> and to <hi>Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day,</hi> to joyn to it as their prayer, [<hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and encline our hearts to keep this Law</hi>] and when they come home, revile thoſe people that are willing to <hi>keep it,</hi> and that will not <hi>take Gods Name in vain,</hi> and forbear the <hi>keeping holy of his day,</hi> as they do themſelves. Either give over profeſſing the Chriſtian Belief, and uſing the Lords Prayer, and praying that you may <hi>keep the Commandments of God,</hi> or elſe give over <hi>reviling</hi> thoſe that <hi>do it.</hi> Either ſay plainly that you are <hi>Heathens</hi> and no <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> or elſe never ſay, that a <hi>Chriſtian Life</hi> is <hi>hurtful</hi> to the <hi>world,</hi> nor make it the matter of your reproach.</p>
                     <p>18.

If he had <hi>hired</hi> you, and <hi>written down</hi> every word which he would have you ſpeak, you could not more punctually obey him. Do you plead <hi>againſt Holineſs,</hi> and for a <hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>ungodly life?</hi> Do you <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe</hi> the <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>juſtifie</hi> the <hi>wicked?

                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:59464:124"/>
the <hi>Devil himſelf</hi> ſpeaketh better then you: as in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 17. he ſaith, [<hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation</hi>] Theſe are <hi>better words</hi> then yours: But when he is left to himſelf, and ſpeaketh <hi>of his own,</hi> he ſpeaketh juſt as you do: and ſhall we believe you when the Devil ſets you on, and you ſpeak the words of the lying ſpirit?</p>
                     <p>19. And I the leſs believe you, when you ſay that the <hi>world is the worſe</hi> for <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Religiouſneſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>I know from whence this comes. You take that to be the beſt, that is the worſt; and that to be the worſt, that is indeed the beſt.</hi> You judge after the fleſh, and take thoſe for the beſt times when you have moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and may ſin with leaſt contradiction and moleſtation, and be leaſt troubled in your ſenſual courſe. Theſe are <hi>your good daies,</hi> which wiſe men know to be <hi>your ſlavery</hi> and miſery. It is never a <hi>good world</hi> with you, when your conſciences are troubled, and your ſores are lanced, and Satan cannot keep his garriſon in peace; and when you cannot be permitted to drink, and ſwear, and game, and revell without controll. And if this be your <hi>good world,</hi> I had rather have a priſon or a pair of ſtocks <hi>with Chriſt and the Goſpel</hi> which you deſpiſe, and with the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>hopes</hi> of the <hi>world to come,</hi> then to have your <hi>good world,</hi> which is but thee <hi>quieteſt paſſage</hi> to <hi>damnation.</hi> You are not yet to be believed: ſtay till you ſee the end, and what comes of it, and then tell us which was the <hi>good world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. Laſtly, if all this will not ſerve, I will ſilence you and ſhame you, if you have any ſhame left. If <hi>Religion</hi> and ſo much ſerving of God do make the world worſe, and thoſe be the worſt times where there is moſt of theſe, <hi>then Heaven would be worſe then Earth or Hell, even the worſt place in all the world.</hi> For no place hath ſo much <hi>Holineſs</hi> as <hi>Heaven.</hi> Nowhere is there ſo much ado about the Praiſe and Service of God, as there is in <hi>Heaven. There</hi> they do <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but that which you revile, and that in <hi>higheſt fervour</hi> and <hi>perfection.

                     <p>I Have proved to you that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>beſt for Common wealths,</hi> and given you many General undenyable evidences, to prove that it is <hi>Beſt for all men in particular:</hi> I ſhall now come to the <hi>particular evidences,</hi> and ſhew you <hi>wherein</hi> it is that it is <hi>Beſt</hi> for <hi>all men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are <hi>three</hi> ſorts of <hi>Good</hi> that men have to look after. The firſt is the ſecurity of their <hi>Life and Being;</hi> the ſecond is their <hi>moral well-being;</hi> and the third is, their <hi>Natural well-being.</hi> This laſt alſo is divided into three branches, and conſiſteth in our <hi>Profit,</hi> our <hi>Honour,</hi> and our <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that here are <hi>five</hi> ſeveral <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to be conſidered of; and you will find that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>Beſt,</hi> beyond all compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in each reſpect. 1. In reſpect of <hi>Safety.</hi> 2. In point of <hi>Honeſty.</hi> 3. In point of <hi>Gain.</hi> 4. In point of <hi>Honour.</hi> And, 5. In point of Pleaſure or Delight. If I prove not every one of theſe, then tell me, I promiſed more then I could perform: But if I do prove them, I look that you that Read it, ſhould promiſe preſently to come in to God, and a Holy life, and faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
                     <p>1. And that <hi>HOLINESS IS THE SAFEST WAY,</hi> I prove thus. 1. That man is in a <hi>ſafer</hi> ſtate that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of Satan, then he that is in his bondage,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59464:125"/>
and taken captive by him at his will. But all the unſanctified are in this captivity, and all the ſanctified are delivered out of it; as the Scripture moſt expreſly tells us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2. 3 [<hi>And you hath be quickened, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prince of the Power of the air, the Spirit that now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the children of diſobedience: among whom we alſo bad our converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind,</hi> &amp;c.] So 2 Tim. 2. 25, 26. [<hi>In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God erad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi>] And Acts 26. 17, 18. [<hi>I ſend thee to open their eyes, and turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>] And Col. 1. 13. [<hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>] Satan is the <hi>Ruler</hi> and the <hi>Jaylor</hi> of the ungodly, that leadeth them to ſin, and ſo to deſtruction, and keepeth them for torments at the day of wrath. And is he <hi>ſafe</hi> that is in the Devils power? If he ſhould <hi>appear to thee,</hi> and <hi>lay hold of thee,</hi> thou wouldſt not think that thou were <hi>ſafe.</hi> But his <hi>poſſeſſion of thy ſoul</hi> is far more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thou doſt <hi>not believe</hi> that thou art in his power: But thy <hi>blindneſs</hi> ſheweth it; and thy <hi>enmity</hi> to the way of Holineſs ſheweth it; and thy <hi>ungodly life</hi> doth fully ſhew it; and the Scripture affirmeth it of all ſuch: and what need there any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof? But the <hi>ſanctified</hi> are all <hi>dilivered</hi> from this ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and though the Devil may rage againſt them, he ſhall not prevail.</p>
                     <p>2.

to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, that walk not after the fleſh but after the spirit</hi>] Abundance more ſuch paſſages of holy Scripture do aſſure us that all the <hi>unſanctified</hi> are <hi>unpardoned,</hi> and all the <hi>ſanctified</hi> are <hi>Juſtified,</hi> and delivered from the Curſe.

                     <p>Judge now by theſe plain expreſſions form the Lord, who it is that is in the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſtate, the godly or the ungodly.

Why man! if God be againſt thee, thou art <hi>no where ſafe?</hi> not in the ſtrongeſt Caſtle! not in the greateſt Army! not in the higheſt dignity! not in the merryeſt company! Thou knoweſt not but a Commiſſion is gone out for death to ſtrike thee in thy next recreation, or fit of mirth? How knoweſt thou but death is ready to ſtrike, while thou art eating, or drinking, or talking, or ſleeping? Thou haſt no ſecurity from an angry God. Till he be reconciled, thou art nowhere ſafe! This may be thy fatal day or night for ought thou knoweſt. And if once the mortal blow be ſtruck, and thy ſoul be taken from thy body unrenewed, O man, where then wilt thou appear!

                     <p>But to the ſoul that hath God for his ſecurity, what can be dangerous? or what condition (while he keeps cloſe to God) can be unſafe? <hi>The Father that gave us unto Chriſt, is greater then all, and no man can take us out of his hands,</hi> Joh. 10. 28, 29.

                     <p>But this is not their greateſt cruelty: They are enemies to their <hi>own ſalvation:</hi> They will run into Hell in deſpight of Chriſt and all the Preachers in the world.

                     </p>
                     <p>But for the <hi>Godly,</hi> it is their deſire, their care, their work to ſave themſelves, and further the ſalvation of all others. O how they long to hear of the Converſion of Towns and Countries! and how glad are they when they hear it! Not for any worldly commodity to themſelves, but becauſe they rejoyce at the good of others. And what would they not do to promote it, which they could do?</p>
                     <p>6. Do you think that a <hi>perfidious unfaithful</hi> man, or a <hi>faithful</hi> man that will not be hired to break his word, is the <hi>honeſter</hi> man? Sure this is no hard queſtion neither. A Knight of the Poſt, that will ſay and unſay, ſwear and forſwear, and will betray his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friend for a groat, is taken by few for an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him that will rather die then lye or be unfaithful. Why nothing is more plain, then that all you that are ungodly, are treacherous to the Lord himſelf: You are <hi>perfidious</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers: You owe him your ſelves wholly on the grounds that I before expreſſed: and yet you are unfaithful to him.

You bound your ſelves to him in your Baptiſm, and many a time ſince, by a ſolemn Vow or Covenant: but you live in the treacherous breach of it continually. You Covenanted to take <hi>the Lord for your God;</hi> and yet you will not ſeek him, nor be Ruled by him. You Covenanted to <hi>take Jeſus for your ſaviour,</hi> and yet will not be ſaved by him from your ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. You Covenanted to <hi>take the Holy-Ghoſt for your Sanctifier,</hi> to purifie your hearts and lives; and yet you reſiſt his holy motions, and hate his ſanctifying word and work, and ſome of you will mock at Sanctification and the Spirit. And can the ſoul of man be guilty of greater unfaithfulneſs or treachery? You Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forſake the fleſh, the world, and the Devil: and now you ſerve them more then Chriſt, and think your time is better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed for them, then in the ſervice of the Lord!

                     <p>But now it is the care of <hi>godly</hi> men to <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>Covenants</hi> they have made with God. All that which you reproach them for as too much preciſeneſs, is but the performance of their Baptiſmal Vow. And if you be againſt the <hi>keeping</hi> our Covenants with God, ſhould you not be againſt the making them? Are you not aſhamed to be ſo forward to engage your children to God in Baptiſm, and when you have done, would have them he ungodly, and break the Vow they make?

They ſet not Gods mercy againſt his Truth, nor the Merits of Chriſt againſt his Covenant. They know that God is better acquainted with the ways and effects of his own mercies then we are. And therefore though they hope to be ſaved by Gods mercy, it is by his <hi>ſanctifying mercy,</hi> and not to be ſaved <hi>without ſanctification,</hi> that is, without ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf and the neceſſary means. They know that it is abundant mercy to be ſaved in a way of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and deſire no other ſaving Mercy.

And certainly he that Loveth his Riches, or Honours, or filthy ſins, better then God and Heaven it ſelf, muſt needs be thought to preferr them before his neereſt Friends, or the common good. And is that an <hi>Honeſt</hi> man that would rather caſt off Father or Mother then caſt off his filthy ſins? and that would rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his chiefeſt friend, then forſake his vices? and would ſell

I think you would none of you ſay that this were an <hi>Honeſt</hi> man, that would not leave ſo ſmall a matter for the life of his friend, or for the preſervation of the Common wealth: And can you expect that he ſhould prefer any friend before God and his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

We are members of that well-tempered body; where all the members are obliged and diſpoſed to have the <hi>ſame care one for another,</hi> that if <hi>one ſuffer all ſuffer, and if one be honoured all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25, 26. As weak as Chriſtians are, and as worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in your eyes, one of their hearty ſpiritual prayers, and one word of their holy ſavoury conference, doth profit us more, then all your Treaſures will ever profit you. While the <hi>Divine nature</hi> is in them, ſomewhat Divine will proceed from their mouthes, and be ſeen in their lives, which is worth more then all the Riches of the world. And O how fruitful are the holy Ordinances which we partake of, both in the Churches Communion, and alone in our retirements! A poor Chriſtian can get more in a Sermon which you ſleep under, or deride, then you will get by your trades or livings while you live. He findeth greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in one Chapter of the Bible, or in one good Book, then you can get out of all your lands or labours. The beſt of your livings will not yield you ſo much commodity in ſeven years, nor in ſeven thouſand years, if you could ſo long keep them, as a believing ſoul can get from God in one hours prayer, even in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, where he is not by man obſerved. You do not believe this, that are ungodly: I know you do not heartily believe it; for elſe you would try it, and not continue in your ungodlineſs. But they that try it, know it to be true. Or elſe what makes them continue in it, and live upon their holy Communion with God

and his ſervants, more reſolvedly then you do on your lands and labours. Somewhat you may conjecture they find in holy duty, that makes them ſo inſtant in it as they are.</p>
                     <p>7. Another part of our <hi>commodity</hi> by <hi>Holineſs,</hi> is, <hi>the Promiſe and Aſſurance of the Love of God and of our ſalvation; and the Peace of Conſcience that followeth hereupon.</hi> All true Believers have <hi>objective certainty:</hi> that is, the <hi>thing is certain in itſelf,</hi> whether they <hi>perceive</hi> it or not. And they may have <hi>ſubjective</hi> or <hi>Actual certainty in themſelves,</hi> if they do their parts. And is not a <hi>certain Title</hi> to a <hi>Lordſhip</hi> or a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a greater Treaſure then the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of a <hi>ſtraw?</hi> Much more is Gods Promiſe of Everlaſting Glory, a greater Treaſure then all your wealth. As Heaven is infinitely better then earth, ſo the Promiſe of God is the <hi>beſt ſecurity.</hi> Though we <hi>be not</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and do not yet <hi>ſee</hi> the face of God, yet have we a <hi>Promiſe</hi> that ſpeedily we <hi>ſhall be there,</hi> and <hi>ſhall ſee</hi> that which they ſee, and enjoy all that which they enjoy. The pooreſt Chriſtian hath all <hi>that in Promiſe</hi> under the hand of God himſelf, which <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Glorified Saints</hi> have in <hi>poſſeſſion.</hi> They can ſhew you a better Title to Heaven, though they are unworthy in themſelves, then any of you can ſhew to your lands or houſes, in your Deeds or Leaſes. As poor and ſimple as that Godly man is whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, he is an <hi>Heir of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>a fellow-Heir with Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. &amp; 11. 9. When we had <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy-Ghoſt, and were juſtified by grace, we were made the Heirs of eternal life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hope</hi> that is given us by the Goſpel, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 7. And God that hath given them thoſe [<hi>Better things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſalvation</hi>] is <hi>not unrighteous to forget their work and labour of love, if they do but ſhew the ſame diligence to the full aſſurance of hope unto the end, and be not ſloathful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi>] Heb. 6. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>For this cauſe was Chriſt the Mediator of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by means of death, for the redemption of the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called may receive the Promiſe of the eternal inheritance.</hi> Heb. 9. 15. And <hi>we know that he is faithful that hath promiſed.</hi> And if your Bills, and Bonds, and Deeds, and Leaſes, be part of your Riches, we ſhall much more take the <hi>Promiſe of God,</hi> for our everlaſting happineſs in Heaven, to be far greater Riches.</p>

                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:59464:142"/>8. And yet we may put this among our <hi>Riches,</hi> or at leaſt as the <hi>Over-plus</hi> given us by God, that we have <hi>better advantage, even for the matters of this world, then the ungodly have.</hi> For we have a <hi>Promiſe</hi> that we ſhall lack nothing that <hi>is good for us, Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. and ſo have not they. We have warrant to <hi>eaſt all our care on God,</hi> who by promiſe is engaged to <hi>care for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. We are commanded to be (anxiouſly) <hi>careful for nothing, but in all things to make known our requeſts to God,</hi> as little children that care not for themſelves, but go to their father for what they want: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. It is enough for us whatever we want, that <hi>our heavenly Father knoweth that we want it, Matth.</hi> 6. 32. who hath charged us to disburden our minds of theſe vexatious cares, and to <hi>ſeek firſt his Kingdom and the Righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> and promiſed us that <hi>other things ſhall be added to us, Mat.</hi> 6. 33. We have alſo a promiſe that <hi>all things ſhall work together for our good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And therefore we ſhall have more from the things of this life, then the ungodly have: Yea more by the <hi>want of them,</hi> then they by <hi>the poſſeſſion.</hi> For if they do us good in our graces and communion with God, and in the matter of our ſalvation, they help us to that which is of far higher value then themſelves. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> to a true Believer, is better then <hi>Riches</hi> to the ungodly that deſtroyeth himſelf by them, when the Believer is helped by his <hi>poverty.</hi> Impriſonment to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> was better then liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their perſecutors. And thus in the <hi>fruits</hi> and ſaving <hi>benefits, all things are ours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. We have the <hi>Love of God</hi> with what we poſſeſs, be it more or leſs, when the wicked have his wrath with it. And who would have their Riches on ſuch terms?</p>
                     <p>9. Another part of the <hi>Gain</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is, that it <hi>puts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Readineſs to die, and a fitneſs to appear before the Lord.</hi> Though <hi>all</hi> the Godly have not ſo <hi>great a readineſs</hi> as to <hi>deſire</hi> to be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſſolved,</hi> yet <hi>all of them</hi> are in a <hi>ſafe condition,</hi> and are ſo far ready, that death ſhall paſs them into a bleſſed ſtate. <hi>For we know that if our earthly houſe of this Taberna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And then how glad would you be to change Portions with the holy ſervants of the Lord, whom you now deſpiſe! When once you hear, [<hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall they require thy ſoul! and whoſe then are all thoſe things that thou haſt provided?</hi>] <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. then in a moment you will change your minds, and cry out of the world as nothing worth, and wiſh you had buſied your hearts and hands in laying up a <hi>better treaſure.</hi> This is one difference, O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It will put an end to all his troubles, and fears, and griefs: and it will put an end to all thy proſperity, and to all thy mirth, and hope, for ever. A godly man <hi>dare</hi> die; or if he ignorantly fear it, yet ſhall it be the end of all his <hi>fears:</hi> but thou <hi>dareſt not die,</hi> and yet thou <hi>muſt:</hi> or if thou ignorantly hope of a happineſs after it, yet will it nevertheleſs end all thy hopes.

What! is a little fleſhly eaſe or mirth? a little meat, and drink, and pleaſure? a little more money, or ſpace of ground to uſe then your neighbours have; are theſe the things that you will change for Heaven, and preſer before the Lord that made you? O poor miſerable ſinners! Are you not told that you have <hi>your good things here?</hi> but what will you have hereafter when this is gone? <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 25. When your wealth is gone, and your mirth is gone, your ſouls are immortal, and therefore your miſery and horrour will continue, and never be gone. As the wealth of the godly is <hi>within them,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> the reach of their enemies, and ſurer then yours, ſo is it the more durable, even everlaſting: When all your Riches are upon the wing, even ready to be gone, and leave you in ſorrow, when you are moſt highly valuing them, you have it now, but it is gone to morrow.

                     <p>I thought not meet to paſs by this neceſſary reproof of the contempt of Holineſs, which this Land hath been ſo guilty of, and which hath undone ſo many ſouls, and made ſuch deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the Land.

                     <p>1. The <hi>Holy</hi> ſervants of the Lord have the moſt <hi>Honourable Maſter</hi> in all the world. This only is ſufficient to weigh down all the Honours of the world, if it were ten thouſand worlds. When the builders of the Temple were asked their names, by the Officers of King <hi>Darius, Ezra</hi> 5. 10, 11. their anſwer was [<hi>We are the ſervants of the God of Heaven and Earth.</hi>] No King on Earth, no Angel in Heaven hath a more <hi>honourable</hi> Maſter. To be the higheſt Officer of the greateſt Prince, is a Title as much more baſe then this, as man is baſer then the Infinite God.

Yet now they are dead, you are deſirous to keep Holy dayes in an honourable memorial of them: and Kings and Princes reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their names.

Its ſaid of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great (who himſelf was Greater by his Holineſs then his Victories) that he was wont to reverence the Biſhops that had been ſufferers for Chriſt, and kiſſed the place where the eye abode that one of them had loſt for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels ſake. The Chriſtian Princes that ruled the world, were wont to Honour the pooreſt mortified retired ſervants of Chriſt, that had caſt off the world; as perceiving that he is more Honourable that contemneth it, then he that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.

But the Deſign and daily buſineſs of the Godly is for everlaſting Glory. Heb. 11. 10. <hi>They look for a City that hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi>] verſ. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>They confeſs themſelves ſtrangers and pilgrims on earth, thereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they ſeek a Countrey.

To Rule a Kingdom is a Nobler deſign then to play with children for pins or points. But to ſeek the Everlaſting Kingdom is far above all the higheſt deſigns that are terminated upon earth. If Everlaſting Glory with God in Heaven, be a nobler ſtate then a worldly life, then muſt the ſeeking it be a nobler deſign. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth you the difference very pathetically, Phil. 3. 18, 19, 20. [<hi>For many walk (of whom I told you often, and now tell you weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that they are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt; Whoſe end is destruction, whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things: But our Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>] that is, we live as Citizens of the heavenly Jeruſalem, and not as thoſe that are here at home. It is <hi>Heaven</hi> that ſanctified perſons mind; that they ſtudy and care for, and labour and live for in the world. And therefore, though in their <hi>Natural capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> they are but as other men, yet in their Moral and Relative capacity, I think I may ſay without Hyperbole, that they are much more advanced above the dignity of the great unſanctified Princes upon earth, then Reaſon, and learning, and manly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns advance a man above a beaſt. It is the <hi>Nobleneſs</hi> and <hi>baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the end that doth <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>abaſe</hi> the agent: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none are truly.

The firſt thoughts of a Godly man when he awaketh, and the laſt when he lyeth down (if he obſerve his Rule) are uſually for Heaven. When you are converſing with worldly men, about theſe common worldly things, they are in prayer or holy meditation converſing with God, about the matters of his ſervice and their ſalvation. Their hearts are toward him: their thoughts are on him: They are devoted to him: Their daily buſineſs is to ſerve him.

And he that hath the face to ſay, that Prayer, Praiſe, Thanksgiving, Meditation, holy conference and other works of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, are not a more Honourable employment then the ſordid drudgery of the world, muſt ſay alſo that the life of a worldling is more Honourable then the life of the holy Angels and the heavenly hoſt. They are obeying and praiſing God, and living in the ſenſe of his deareſt love, while you are ſinning and ſcraping in this Earth. And can you believe that your life is more Honourable then theirs? If not; you muſt confeſs, that the Godly that come neareſt the work of Angels, do live a more Honourable life then you. When Chriſt called <hi>Peter</hi> to leave his fiſhing and follow him and be his ſervant, he tells him that he will make him a <hi>fiſher of men:</hi> as intimating that it was a more honourable work to <hi>catch ſouls</hi> by the Goſpel, and win them to God and to ſalva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O how wonderful is the Love of God to his unworthy ſervants, in their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Remember it, when thou art ſcorning at the ſervants of the Lord, or ſpeaking againſt them, that thoſe poor, thoſe weak deſpiſed Chriſtians, that thou art vilifying, have their <hi>Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the face of God their Father in the Heavens: Take heed therefore that you deſpiſe not the leaſt of theſe.</hi> It is the warning of

Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. The ſame bleſſed ſpirits that attend the Lord, and ſee his face in bliſsful Glory, do attend and guard the meaneſt of the godly here on earth.

                     <p>9. And it is the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Godly,</hi> that they that are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt <hi>Honourable,</hi> do <hi>Honour</hi> them. To be magnified by a fool, or wicked flatterer, is ſmall Honour: but to be magnified by the beſt and wiſeſt men, this is true Honour. We ſay that <hi>Honour</hi> is in him that giveth it, and not in him that receiveth. But it is God himſelf that Honoureth his Saints: It is he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all theſe great and wonderous things of them which I have hitherto recited. Search the Texts which I have alledged, and try whether it be not he. And ſurely to have the God of Heaven to applaud a man, and put Honour upon him, and ſo great Honour, is more then if all the world had done it. Yet we may add, (if any thing could be conſiderable that is added unto the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of God) that all his ſervants, the wiſeſt, and the beſt, even his holy Angels, are of the ſame mind, and honour the godly in conformity to their Lord.</p>
                     <p>And here Chriſtian, I require thee from the Lord, to conſider the greatneſs of thy ſin and folly, when thou art too deſirous of the applauſe of men, eſpecially of the blind ungodly world; and when thou makeſt a great matter of their contempt or ſcorn, or of their ſlanderous cenſures. What! is the approbation of the eternal God ſo ſmall a matter in thy eyes, that the ſcorn of a fool can weigh it down, or move the ballance with thee? If a feather were put into the ſcales againſt a mountain, or the whole earth, it ſhould weigh as much as the eſteem or diſ-eſteem of men, their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honouring thee, or diſhonouring thee, ſhould weigh againſt the eſteem of God, and the honour or diſhonour that he puts upon thee, (as to any regard of the thing it ſelf; though as it reflecteth on God, thou maiſt regard it.) He is the wiſe man that God calls wiſe: and he is the fool that God calls fool: (and that is every one that <hi>layeth up riches for himſelf, and is not rich towards God, Luke</hi> 12. 20, 21.) He is the Happy man that God calls Happy; and he is a miſerable man that God counts miſerable: and who thoſe are, you may ſee in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1. and many Scriptures before-cited. Hear the words (and you that are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, lay up the bleſſed promiſe) of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 12. 26.

[<hi>If any man ſerve me, him will my Father Honour.</hi>] And who cares then for the diſhonours of all the wicked of the world? Our <hi>tryed faith as preciouſer then Gold, will be found unto praiſe, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.] 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 7. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. We muſt learn therefore to imitate our Lord, <hi>John</hi> 5. 41. and <hi>not to receive our Honour from men;</hi> and not to imitate the wicked, verſ. 44. <hi>that receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God.</hi> There is enough for us in Gods approbation. And yet all his ſervants do imitate their Lord; and his Judgement is their Judgement; and whom he honoureth, them do they honour; Angels, and Saints, and all that enter into the Tabernacle of the Lord, do <hi>contemn the vile, and honour them that fear the Lord, Pſalm</hi> 15. 4. And though no mans Judgement or Praiſe be valuable in compariſon of the Lords; yet the Honour and Praiſe that is given by the wiſe and Godly, is more then a thouſand times as much from ignorant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. If the Athenian Orator regarded the cenſure of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> more then of all the reſt of his auditors, we have cauſe to judge he Elogies of experienced holy men a greater honour then of thouſands of the wicked, &amp; greater then all their contempt or ſcorn is able to weigh down. The applauſe of the wicked is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a diſhonour in wiſe mens eyes. Was it not <hi>Balaams</hi> chiefeſt <hi>honour</hi> to hear from <hi>Balak, [I thought to promote thee to great Honours, but the Lord hath kept thee back from Honour.] Numb.</hi> 24. 11. The Honour that God <hi>keepeth a man from,</hi> is no Honour: but it is an Honour to be kept from ſuch Honour by the Lord: innocent poverty is incomparably more Honourable then Riches by iniquity, which is the greateſt ſhame.</p>
                     <p>10. Laſtly it is <hi>unſpeakable everlaſting Honour that holineſs doth tend unto, and which holy men ſhall enjoy with God.</hi> The very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Godly man to his everlaſting Glory, is an Honour ten thouſand times ſurpaſſing the Honour of all the Kingdoms of the world. If you did but know that one of your poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould certainly be a King, would you not preſently honour him, even in his rags? You may know that the Saints ſhall raign with Chriſt, as ſure as if an Angel from heaven had told you ſo, and more; and therefore how ſhould a Saint be honoured? If God had but legibly marked out ſome among you for ſalvation, and written in their fore-heads, [<hi>This man ſhall be ſaved</hi>] would not all the Pariſh reverence that man?

mind, and the Love of God, and ſelf-denyal, and holy obedience, are Heaven-marks infallible, as true as the Goſpel, and written by the ſame hand as the Goſpel was, I mean by the Spirit of God himſelf: If a voice from Heaven ſhould ſpeak now of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Congregation, and ſay, [<hi>This man ſhall raign in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever</hi>] would it not be an Honour above all your worldly Honours? Why Holineſs is Gods Image, and the Spirit is the earneſt of our inheritance, and beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the ſons of God, and we have the promiſe, and ſeals, and oath of God for our confirmed certainty; yea and the Knowledge of God in Chriſt is the beginning of eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. and what would we have more? The preſence of Chriſt in a little of his Glory upon the Mount, tranſported the three Diſciples: And the glympſe of the Glory of God which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw, did make his face ſhine that the Iſraelites could not behold it. The approaches of the Saints to God in holy Worſhip here on earth, are exceeding Honourable, becauſe they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of heaven, and it is upward that they look: 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 27. [<hi>Glory and Honour are in his preſence: ſtrength and gladneſs are in his place.</hi>] The ſoul that is beholding God by faith, and converſing with the Heavenly inhabitants, is quite above all earthly things: and as Angels are more honourable then men, and Heaven then Earth, ſo are Believers that converſe in Heaven with Angels, yea with Chriſt himſelf by faith, more honourable then terreſtrial carnal men.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>great Honour</hi> is behind; yet near at hand; when the promiſed Crown is ſet upon their heads: O mark the Honour that is promiſed them by the Lord of truth.

                        <p>9.

Riches and Honours, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dignity, I ſee people ordinarily proud of. And I ſee many Proud of <hi>Counterfeit Graces,</hi> that have none that is <hi>ſincere</hi> (as far as may be perceived by others) to be proud of.

                        <p>10. Laſtly conſider, what abundance of Means the Lord hath adjoyned as Antidotes with his ſervants Honours to keep them from being puffed up with Pride; and then tell me whether you dare charge God with errour or want of wiſdom in this thing.</p>
                        <p>1. The nature and life of Holineſs conſiſteth in the ſouls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring home to <hi>God,</hi> and adhering to him, and walking as before him. And there is not a more powerful means in the world, to keep <hi>Humble</hi> the ſoul, then the <hi>Knowledge of God.</hi> O when a poor ſinner hath but any lively apprehenſions of the Greatneſs, and Glory of the Lord, it amazeth him, and levelleth him with the duſt, and abaſeth him in his own eſteem, and maketh him ſay with Job 40. 4, 5. [<hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</hi>] &amp; 4, 5, 6. [<hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor my ſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes</hi>] One glympſe of God were enough to humble any ſoul that truly knoweth him.

that our God is a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28, 29. It is God that he prayeth to, that he meditateth on, and he praiſeth, and hath ſtill to do with. And therefore no wonder if he walk ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with ſo holy and great a God.</p>
                        <p>2. The ſin and miſery that once they were in, while they knew not God, will do much to keep humble a gracious ſoul, as long as they live. Though God ſo forget our ſins as to forgive them, yet we can ſcarce forgive our ſelves, or at leaſt can never forget them. Though <hi>he ſee</hi> no fin in his ſervants, as he ſeeth it in the world, nor ſo as to hate and condemn them for it; yet <hi>they ſee</hi> that once they were as bad as the world, and were children of wrath as well as others; They condemn themſelves when God doth juſtifie them; and ſet their ſins before their faces, which God doth caſt behind his back. O thoſe dark, thoſe ungrateful, and thoſe perilous dayes, will never be forgotten by the renewed ſoul. The thoughts of them ſhall ever keep us humble. When we look on the wicked miſerable world, to think that ſuch were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us, though mercy have waſhed, and ſanctified, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us.</p>
                        <p>3. Moreover, God hath ſo contrived the way of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhall have all by a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and by <hi>freeſt Grace,</hi> and none ſhall be juſtified by the works of the Law, nor by any merit of his own; but <hi>Boaſting is excluded by the Law of faith, Rom.</hi> 3. 19, 27, 28. and we ſhall <hi>have nothing but what we receive</hi> beſides and contrary to our deſert.</p>
                        <p>4. And alas too much <hi>corruption</hi> ſtill remaineth in us: We have <hi>fleſh that fighteth againſt the ſpirit, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>We know but in part, and Love God but in part,</hi> and ſerve him with ſuch conſtant weakneſs, that theſe things are uſually ſuch hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling matters to a gracious ſoul, that were it not for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, they would be unable to look up.

                        <p>5. And too often do their corruptions get advantage of them, and produce ſome <hi>actual</hi> ſin, of thought, word or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

They have all this <hi>treaſure but is earthen veſſels,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Their ſouls are here ſo poorly lodged in corruptible Tabernacles of earth, and ſo meanly cloathed with frail, diſeaſed, mortal fleſh, that it is madneſs to be proud.</p>
                        <p>7. And the <hi>many and great afflictions of the godly,</hi> are medicines that are purpoſely given them by their Phyſicion to cure Pride, and keep them humble. Why elſe muſt their ſufferings be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? and why muſt they daily bear the Croſs? but that they may be conformed to the image of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>8. And to the ſame end it is that God doth let looſe upon them <hi>ſo many enemies.</hi> All Satans temptations, and the worlds allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vexations, and all their diſappointments here, and all the ſcorns and mocks of the ungodly, and the cenſures and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of wicked tongues, and often bitter perſeſcutions, what are they but the bitter medicines of God (permitted and ordered by him, though canſed by the Devil and wicked men) to ſave the ſervants of the Lord, from the ſin and danger of being lifted up? Do you ſay that their <hi>Honour</hi> will make them <hi>proud?</hi> Why <hi>you</hi> that thus oppoſe them and deſpiſe them, are <hi>

When God ſeeth his ſervants in danger of being lifted up above meaſure, he oft ſendeth a meſſenger of Satan (who may be an Executioner of Gods chaſtiſements) to buffet them, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.) Sometimes by ſlanders, ſometime by reproaches, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by impriſonments or greater ſufferings, and ſometimes by horrid troubleſom temptations.</p>
                        <p>9. The <hi>very foreſight of death it ſelf is a humbling means:</hi> and the laſt enemy Death, is yet unconquered, and our Bodies muſt corrupt in duſt and darkneſs, and be kept in the grave as common earth, till the Resurrection, that the ſoul may not grow proud that hath ſuch a body.</p>
                        <p>11. And the <hi>Day of Judgement</hi> is ſo deſcribed to us in the Scripture, as tends to keep the ſoul in <hi>awe</hi> and in <hi>Humility.</hi> To think of <hi>ſuch a day,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a reckoning,</hi> before <hi>ſuch a God,</hi> me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                           <pb n="264" facs="tcp:59464:161"/>11. And our <hi>Abſolution and Glorification</hi> at that day, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us now but <hi>conditionally</hi> (though God will ſee that the condition be performed by all that he will ſave.) And therefore the poor ſoul is oft ſo far to <hi>ſeek</hi> about the <hi>certain ſincerity</hi> of his own Faith and Repentance, that moſt of the godly are kept in <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings</hi> to the death. Yea and <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal</hi> are <hi>part</hi> of <hi>this Condition:</hi> And all their Honour and Glory with Chriſt is promiſed to the <hi>Humble</hi> only: <hi>Humility</hi> is commanded them in the Precept: <hi>Humility</hi> is it that they are exhorted to by the Miniſters: And <hi>Pride</hi> is threatened with everlaſting wrath, and deſcribed as the Devils image. So that Holineſs hath all the advantages againſt Pride that can be here expected.</p>
                        <p>12. To conclude, the Godly know that as they have nothing but <hi>from God,</hi> ſo they have nothing but <hi>for God:</hi> ſo that their own <hi>Honour</hi> is <hi>for him,</hi> more then <hi>for themſelves;</hi> and it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to their <hi>Holineſs,</hi> to make <hi>God their end,</hi> and ſet <hi>him higheſt,</hi> and referr all to his Pleaſure and Glory. So that you ſee now that we <hi>may Honour them that fear the Lord, (Pſalm</hi> 15. 4.) without being guilty of making <hi>them proud,</hi> and that we muſt not deny them the Honour that God hath given them as their due, for fear of their being proud of it. Though this, as all things elſe, muſt be prudently managed to particular perſons, according to their various ſtates.</p>
                        <p>And therefore let me here warn all you that profeſs the fear of God: Take heed leſt you be <hi>proud</hi> of any thing that God hath <hi>Honoured</hi> you with: For if you be, you ſee what an Army of Reaſons and Means you ſin againſt; and conſequently how great your ſin will be. And your conſciences and the world ſhall be forced to juſtifie God and his Holy wayes, and to prove againſt you, that it was not long of them that you were proud: and that none in the world was more againſt it then God and Holineſs: and that it was not becauſe you were ſo Religious, but becauſe you were no more Religious. And if Pride of Knowledge, Gifts, or whatſoever, be <hi>unmortified</hi> in you, it will certainly prove that <hi>you are none of the ſanctified;</hi> when your <hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Sanctity</hi> will never prove that <hi>Sanctity</hi> was a cauſe or confederate in your ſin.</p>

                        <p>AND now I have ſhewed you the <hi>Honour of Godlineſs,</hi> let us briefly, (and but briefly) conſider of <hi>your Honour</hi> that reject it, and ſee then whether the godly or ungodly are <hi>more Honourable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Ungodly men have the <hi>Baſeſt Maſter</hi> in the world. Would you know who? Let Chriſt be Judge, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. [<hi>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father you will do.</hi>] 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. They are <hi>taken captive by the Devil at his will;</hi> that is, to do his will: It is <hi>he</hi> that ſtirreth you up to filthy talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſpeak againſt Godlineſs, to curſe and ſwear, and you <hi>do his will.</hi> His will is, that you ſhould neglect a holy life, and you <hi>do his will.</hi> His will is, that you live not after the ſpirit, but after the fleſh, and you <hi>do his will.</hi> O poor ſouls! Do you think it is only Witches that <hi>expreſly</hi> Covenant with him, that are his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſervants! Alas, it is <hi>you alſo,</hi> if <hi>you do his will.</hi> For (if you will believe either God or common reaſon) [<hi>to whom you yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants you are to whom you obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs.</hi>] <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. The godly themſelves <hi>were the ſervants of ſin,</hi> till they <hi>obeyed from the heart the doctrine of the Lord,</hi> v. 17. And are you not come to fair preferment, to be the Devils drudges! Though he ſhould cloath your Bodies with Purple and fine linnen, and feed you ſumptuouſly every day, yet indeed you are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the caſe of that miſerable man may tell you, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. It is the greateſt Baſeneſs to have ſo Baſe a Maſter.</p>
                        <p>2. And it is but an ignoble <hi>Baſe de ſign</hi> that the ungodly carry on in the world. What is it but to provide for, and pleaſe their fleſh? It aimeth at nothing beyond this life. And a beaſt can eat, and drink, and ſleep, and play, and ſatisfie his luſt, as much as they. A ſwine can carry a mouth full of ſtraw to his lodging, and a bird can build a neſt for her young ones. And what do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men more in the world! whether Gentlemen or Beggars, the flattered Gallants or the poor day-labourers, if they be not ſuch as firſt ſeek Heaven, and live to God, what do they but make a pudder in the world, about a little dirt or ſmoak? and find themſelves ſomewhat to do that is <hi>next</hi> to <hi>nothing,</hi> inſtead of that for which they were created; and buſie themſelves about <hi>nothing</hi> till their time is <hi>gone,</hi> and the night is come when none
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59464:162"/>
can work? If you would judge of a mans <hi>Deſigns, fore-ſee</hi> his <hi>Attainments.</hi> If you can tell what <hi>End</hi> it is that they come to, you may know how to judge of their <hi>intentions</hi> and their <hi>courſe.</hi> Their corpſes you know, have no greater a Happineſs, (after a few fooliſh merry hours) then to lie in the earth as filth or duſt. You can ſee no <hi>Honour</hi> attained <hi>there.</hi> It is a child indeed that thinks a guilded <hi>Monument</hi> over a rotten carkaſe, is any great matter of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Benefit</hi> to it. And if you look after the ſoul, (by the proſpective of the Word of God) alas, it goeth to far greater diſhonour. And is this it that worldlings make ſuch a ſtir for?</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>work</hi> alſo that they are <hi>employed</hi> in, is like the Deſign. <hi>Sin,</hi> which is the <hi>Baſeſt</hi> thing in the world, is their employment. The work of a Scullion, or the baſeſt honeſt trade you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, is a thouſand times leſs diſhonourable, then <hi>ſin:</hi> Yet flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Gallants believe not this, when they can pleaſe their fleſh without loſing the teputation of worthy Gentlemen! Nor will our common ungodly people be perſwaded of it, that are more aſhamed to be found praying then ſinning, and to be called a <hi>Puritane</hi> then a <hi>Good-fellow</hi> or a <hi>Swearer:</hi> and that think they are as good men as others, when up to the ears in the drudgery of the Devil: As if the filth of ſin were no diſhonour to them, which nothing but the Spirit and blood of Chriſt is able to waſh out. Theſe are the men that <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth with weeping, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. that <hi>mind earthly things, whoſe God is their belly, and who glory in their ſhame.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Moreover, it is a <hi>Baſe diſpoſition</hi> that ungodly men are poſſeſſed with. Though their <hi>Natures</hi> are eſſentially noble as being the work of God, and capable of moſt glorious things; yet have they made them <hi>Diſpoſitively Vile:</hi> They are fleſhly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, earthly-minded, ignorant of Heavenly things, not ſavouring the things of the Spirit, but like the Serpent, crawling on earth, and feeding on the duſt Graſs is ſweeter to a horſe then junkets; and a little money or vain-glory is ſweeter to a fleſhly mind then God and Glory, and all the treaſures of Saints and Angels. A ſwine never thinks of God or Heaven, but of his draffe and ſtie: Eaſe, and good chear, and money, and the flattery of men, are the God and the Heaven of ſenſual men. And are not theſe men of Baſe diſhonourable ſpirits? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy men! might you have an Everlaſting life, and will you
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59464:162"/>
preferre a few dayes fleſhly pleaſure? As ſurely as you may know the Baſenſs of a ſwine or dog by what they feed upon, ſo ſurely may you know the baſeneſs of a carnal mind, by the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its deſires and delights.</p>
                        <p>5. It is alſo a <hi>Baſe Society</hi> that ungodly men are members of. They are in the <hi>Kingdom of darkneſs, Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. and are <hi>dead in ſin, in which they walk according to the courſe of the world, according to the Prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now walketh in the children of diſobedience, among whom they have their converſations,</hi> Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Devils</hi> are their <hi>inviſible</hi> companions, and <hi>wicked men</hi> their <hi>viſible:</hi> but they have none of the preſence and favour of the Lord, nor any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him in the ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>6. The <hi>greateſt Diſhonour</hi> of the ungodly is, that the God of Heaven refuſeth to Honour them: yea he <hi>deſpiſeth them:</hi> yea he diſhonoureth them with moſt contemptuous titles. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God knoweth what he ſaith of them; and it is impoſſible that he ſhould do them wrong. Yet doth he call them the <hi>ſeed of the Serpent,</hi> that ſtand at enmity with <hi>his flock, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. he calls them <hi>his enemies,</hi> and accordingly will uſe them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. He calls them <hi>Dogs and Swine,</hi> and the <hi>Children of the Devil, John</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. They diſhonoured and deſpiſed him, and he will diſhonour and deſpiſe them, and hath reſolved that their very names ſhall <hi>rot, Prov.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
                        <p>7. But it is the <hi>Everlaſting ſhame</hi> that will tell us what was the <hi>Honour</hi> of the ungodly. When Chriſt ſhall be aſhamed of them before his Father and the Heavenly Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 38. and ſhall tell them that he never knew them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 23. When all their former pomp and ſplendour, will be turned into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſhame and ſorrows, then where is the Honour of the ungodly world? Where then are their flatterers? Who boweth to them, and calleth them <hi>Right Honourable</hi> and <hi>Right Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> any more? Where now are their ſumptuous houſes and attendance? Now they have other kind of ſervitours; and other language, and other uſage then they had on earth. And the poor wretches that ſtormed at a faithful Miniſter for fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling theſe woeful changes to them, and ſpeaking ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of them, as to tell them of their ſin, are at laſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59464:163"/>
an hundred fold worſe of <hi>themſelves,</hi> then ever <hi>we</hi> did ſay againſt them. Then they ſhall need none to call them <hi>fools,</hi> and <hi>vile,</hi> and <hi>wretches,</hi> but their own Conſciences, that will ſpeak it out, and ſpeak it again ten thouſand times, and never be bribed to forbear. O how baſe a deſpicable Generation will the ungodly then be (that now ſpeak ſo ſtoutly and look ſo high) when God ſhall everlaſtingly frown them into contempt and miſery, and the glorified Saints ſhall look down upon them without compaſſion, even praſing the Juſtice that for ever doth torment them! Then let the Kings and Nobles of the earth maintain their antient Honours if they can: Or let them take comfort in the remembrance of their former dreams: and try whether this will be to them inſtead of a drop of water.</p>
                        <p>Well, Sirs, I have faithfully told you from the Word of God, of the <hi>Honour</hi> of the Godly, and the <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> of the ungodly, that you may be reſolved, which is the Better part.

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Holineſs the moſt Pleaſant Way.</head>
                     <p>I Have proved beyond all reaſonable contradiction that Holineſs is the <hi>Safe,</hi> the <hi>Honeſt,</hi> the <hi>Profitable</hi> and the <hi>Honourable</hi> ſtate and courſe: But my hardeſt task is yet to be done; and that is, to prove it the moſt <hi>Pleaſant</hi> way. And the <hi>difficulty</hi> of this is not at all from the <hi>matter,</hi> but from the <hi>perſons</hi> with whom I have to do. For nothing is <hi>Pleaſant</hi> unto men, but what is <hi>ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to their <hi>natures,</hi> and apprehended by them to be for their good, or in it ſelf more excellent then their good. That is <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> to one man that is <hi>loathſom</hi> to another. As the <hi>food</hi> and <hi>converſe</hi> is <hi>delightful</hi> to a <hi>beaſt,</hi> that is <hi>loathſom</hi> and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad as death to <hi>man:</hi> So one mans <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is anothers <hi>Pain.</hi> Even about the common matters of this life, variety of complexions, educations, cuſtoms, diſpoſitions, doth cauſe a variety of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the difference between the ſanctified and unſanctified, the ſpiritual and the carnal mind, doth cauſe a greater contrariety. If therefore the errour of wicked minds, or the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of your ſouls, do make the <hi>Beſt</hi> things ſeem the <hi>worſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſweeteſt</hi> things to ſeem moſt <hi>Bitter,</hi> this is no confutation of my Argument, that proves the way of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> moſt <hi>Pleaſant.</hi> If I would prove that wine is pleaſanter then Vinegar, or <hi>Bread</hi> then <hi>dirt</hi> or <hi>aſhes,</hi> I mean not to appeal to the <hi>appetites</hi> of the <hi>ſick;</hi> It is the <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>healthful</hi> that muſt be judges. If a man will ſuffer his mind to be poſſeſſed with prejudice and baſe thoughts of God himſelf, no wonder if he cannot love him, nor take any delight in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if men have a malignant enmity to Godlineſs, no reaſon will perſwade them that it is moſt pleaſant, but what perſwades them from that enmity. No Reaſon will perſwade a ſloathful perſon that Labour is better then ſleep and idleneſs; no Reaſon will perſwade a drunkard, glutton, or voluptuous wretch, that abſtinence and continence are the ſweeteſt life. Could we change their Hearts, we ſhould change their Pleaſures. Such as men are, ſuch are their delights But the thing that I undertake, is, to manifeſt to <hi>any competent diſcerner,</hi> that <hi>Holineſs is the moſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59464:164"/>
Pleaſant courſe;</hi> and that all the Pleaſures of the Earth are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Pleaſures which the Godly find in God, and in a Holy life: and if any be not of this mind, it is becauſe his ſouls diſeaſes have made him an incompetent judge. And that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> is the Pleaſant State of life, will appear to you, 1. From the Nature of the thing it ſelf. 2. From the encouragements and helps with which it is attended. 3. From the effects and fruits.</p>
                     <p>I. The <hi>Nature</hi> of Holineſs is to be found, 1. In the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 2. In the will and affections, and 3. In the Practice of mens lives. And in all theſe I ſhall ſhew you that it is the moſt <hi>Delightful courſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Knowledge</hi> in it ſelf is a <hi>pleaſant</hi> thing to humane nature. <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the blindneſs of the ſoul. It is not ſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> for the <hi>eye to behold</hi> the ſun, as for the <hi>mind</hi> of man to diſcern the truth. To <hi>Know Good and Evil,</hi> had never been the matter of ſo ſtrong a <hi>Temptation to Adam,</hi> if <hi>Knowledge</hi> had not been very <hi>deſirable</hi> to innocent nature. How hard do many even ungodly perſons ſtudy to <hi>know</hi> the myſteries of <hi>Nature?</hi> And nothing hath more ſtrongly tempted ſome wretches to witchcraft or contracts with the <hi>Devil,</hi> then a deſire of <hi>knowing unrevealed</hi> things, which by his means they have hoped to attain. A <hi>ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> man hath far more <hi>natural valuable Delight,</hi> in his reading and ſuccesful ſtudies, then a <hi>voluptuous Epicure</hi> hath in his <hi>ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Delights.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is a <hi>ſpecial kind</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> that Holineſs doth (initially) conſiſt in, which tranſcendeth in true Pleaſure all the common wiſdom of the worid: For</p>
                     <p>1. How <hi>Pleaſant</hi> a thing muſt it needs be <hi>to know things of ſo high a Nature?</hi> To know the Almighty, Living God: to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his wiſdom, goodneſs and power, in his glorious works, to be led to him by all the Creatures, and hear of him by every Providence, and find his Holy Bleſſed Name in every leaf of his ſacred word, how ſweet and pleaſant a thing is this! To know the Divine Nature, Perſons, Attributes, and Will, to know the myſtery of the Incarnation, of the perſon, natures, undertaking, performance of the bleſſed Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, to know his birth, his life, temptations, conqueſts, his righteouſneſs, his holy doctrine and example, the Law and promiſe, the Law of Nature, and the Covenant of Grace, the ſufferings, Reſurrection, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

glorification and interceſſion of our Lord: to know his Kingdom, Laws, and Government, and his Judgement, with his Rewards and puniſhments; to know the ſanctifying works of the Holy Ghoſt, by which we are prepared for everlaſting life; and to know that life (though but by faith) for which we are here prepared, how high and pleaſant a thing is this! If it be pleaſant to know the courſe of nature, in thoſe higher parts that are above the vulgar reach, what is it to know the <hi>God of Nature,</hi> and the true <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Nature?</hi> What high things doth the pooreſt Chriſtian know? He knoweth the things that are inviſible.</p>
                     <p>Think not that <hi>faith</hi> is ſo void of <hi>Evidence</hi> as not to deſerve the name of <hi>Knowledge: We Know</hi> the things which we do <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

                           </gap> Labour is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58. Many ſuch paſſages of Scripture tell us, that <hi>Faith</hi> is a certain <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and that <hi>Inviſible things revealed by God,</hi> are <hi>certainly known.</hi> We <hi>know</hi> what <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are <hi>now do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the higheſt heavens: for <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>told</hi> us. We <hi>know</hi> the moſt high and glorious things revealed by God, which we never ſaw. And is not the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of <hi>ſuch knowledge</hi> greater then the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of all the wealth, the honour and ſenſual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this world! I durſt almoſt refer the caſe to one of you that are moſt befooled by your own ſenſuality. If you could go tomorrow and meet with a <hi>ſoul from Heaven,</hi> or with an <hi>Angel,</hi> that could tell you what <hi>becomes of ſouls,</hi> and what is done in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, Would you not rather goe to ſuch a conference, then go as far to a drinking, or a bowling, or ſome ſuch recreation? I think you would, if it were but to ſatisfie your <hi>curioſity</hi> and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59464:165"/>
                        <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>Knowing.</hi> Why then ſhould not the ſervants of Chriſt more Delight, in the reading and hearing the words of Chriſt, that came from the boſome of the Father, that hath <hi>ſeen God,</hi> and <hi>is with God,</hi> and <hi>is God himſelf,</hi> that telleth them more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the Inviſible things then any Saints or Angels can tell them? Why ſhould not this, I ſay be ſweeter to them, then all the fleſhly pleaſures in the world? O that I could know more of God, and more of the myſtery of Redemption, even of an obedient, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, glorified Chriſt; and more of the inviſible world, and of the bleſſed ſtate of ſouls, on condition I left all the Pleaſures of this world, to ſenſual men! O that I had more clear and firm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of theſe tranſcendent glorious things! How eaſily could I ſpare the Pleaſures of the fleſh, and leave thoſe husks to ſwine to feed on? O could my Soul get nearer God, and be more irradiated with his heavenly beams, my mind would need no other recreation, and I ſhould as little reliſh carnal Pleaſures, as carnal minds do reliſh the heavenly delights. As earthly things are poor and low, ſo is the knowledge of them. As things ſpiritual and heavenly are High and Glorious, myſterious and profound, the knowledge of them is accordingly Delighful [<hi>And without controverſie great is the myſtery of Godlineſs; God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1.

                     <p>2. The <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>things to Come</hi> is ſpecially deſired, and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> containeth that <hi>Faith</hi> which knoweth things <hi>to come.</hi> How glad would men be to be told what ſhall beſall them to the laſt hour of their lives? The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> Joh. 4. called out her neighbours with admiration to ſee Chriſt, as one that had told her all <hi>that ſhee had done:</hi> But if he had told her all that ever ſhe <hi>would do,</hi> for the time to come, and all that ever ſhould befall her, it might have aſtoniſhed her much more. Believers know what <hi>hath been</hi> even before the world was made, and <hi>how</hi> it <hi>was made,</hi> and what hath been <hi>ſince then,</hi> and they know <hi>what will be</hi> to <hi>all</hi> eternity. A true <hi>Believer</hi> knows from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59464:165"/>
                        <hi>whither</hi> mens <hi>Souls go</hi> after death, and how their <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall be raiſed again, and how Chriſt will come to Judge the world, and who ſhall then be juſtified, and who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and what ſhall be the caſe of the <hi>godly</hi> and the <hi>ungodly</hi> to all eternity. And is it not more <hi>pleaſant</hi> to know theſe things, then to poſſeſs all the vain delights of the earth? Can the <hi>fleſh</hi> afford you any thing ſo delightful?</p>
                     <p>3. Eſpecially, it is deſireable and <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to <hi>Know</hi> thoſe things that <hi>moſt concern us:</hi> Needleſs ſpeculations and curioſities we can ſpare: There is a Knowledge that brings more pain then pleaſure; Yea there is a Knowledge that will torment. But to know our <hi>own</hi> affairs, our <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt neceſſary</hi> affairs; to know our threatened miſery to <hi>prevent</hi> it, and to know our offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Happineſs to <hi>obtain</hi> it; to know our <hi>Portion,</hi> our <hi>Honour,</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> what can be more <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to the mind of man! <hi>Other</hi> mens matters we can paſs by: But to Know ſuch things concerning our <hi>own ſouls,</hi> as what we muſt <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do</hi> for ever, and what courſe we muſt take to be everlaſtingly happy, muſt needs be a feaſt to the mind of a wiſe man. Ask but a ſoul that is haunted with temptations to unbelif, whether any thing would be more welcome to him, then the clear and ſatisfying apprehenſions of a lively faith? Ask one that lyeth in tears or groans, through the feeling of their ſin, and the fears of the wrath of God, and doubtings of his love, whether the ſatisfying Knowledge of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and reconciliation, and divine acceptance, would not be more pleaſant to them, then any of your merriments can be to you? Ask that poor ſoul that hath loſt the apprehenſion of his Evidences of grace, and walks in darkneſs, and hath no light, that ſeeks, and cryes, and perceives no hearing, whether the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Evidences, the aſſurance that his Prayers are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the light of Gods countenance ſhining on him, would not be <hi>Better</hi> to him then any Recreation, or any Pleaſure the earth affords. Ask any man at the hour of death, that is not a block, Whether <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his <hi>ſalvation</hi> would not be <hi>Better</hi> and more <hi>Pleaſnt</hi> to him, then all the luſt, or ſport, or honours of the world.</p>
                     <p>4. The Knowledge of the <hi>Beſt</hi> and <hi>Joyfulleſt</hi> matters, muſt be the <hi>Beſt</hi> and <hi>Pleaſanteſt</hi> Knowledge. And nothing can be <hi>Better</hi> then <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> Nothing can be <hi>ſweeter</hi> then <hi>ſalvation;</hi> and therefore this muſt be the <hi>ſweeteſt Knowledge.</hi> I had rather have
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59464:166"/>
the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of one hours clear and lively Knowledge of <hi>my ſalvation,</hi> and of the ſpecial Love of God, then to be exalted above the greateſt Prince, and to have all the Pleaſures that my ſenſes can deſire. The Delights of the fleſh are baſe and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, and nothing to the ſpiritual Heavenly Delights of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind.</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>manner</hi> of our Holy Knowledge, maketh it more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. 1: It is a <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> Knowledge. It is not a [<hi>may be</hi>], or bare <hi>poſſibility:</hi> It is not, <hi>It is poſſible there may be a Heaven and Happineſs hereafter:</hi> But it is <hi>as true</hi> as the <hi>Word of God</hi> is true: We have his <hi>own hand,</hi> and <hi>ſeal,</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> for it: Even his <hi>precious promiſes,</hi> and <hi>oath,</hi> confirmed by <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and fulfilled-prophecy, and bearing his own image and ſuperſcription, and ſhining to us by its own light: We have in our hearts the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which is <hi>Gods earneſt,</hi> by which we are <hi>ſealed</hi> up to the day of our final full redemption. And if the ſoul yet ſtagger at the promiſe of God through the remnants of unbelief, that ſhall not make the promiſe of God of none effect; but his foundation ſhall ſtill ſtand ſure: His word ſhall not paſs till all be fulfilled, though heaven and earth ſhall paſs away. A meſſage by one that were ſent to us from the dead, were not more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the Word of God. And this <hi>Certainty</hi> of Holy Faith and Knowledge is a very great contentment to the ſoul. When the Glory of the Saints is a thing as ſure as if we ſaw it with our eyes, and as ſure as theſe things which we daily ſee; it is a great pleaſure to the ſoul, when it can but apprehend this <hi>joyful Certainty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And that there is a certain <hi>eaſineſs</hi> and <hi>plainneſs</hi> in the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> points of faith, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of Revelation, doth add much to <hi>Faith's, Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> The points that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> lie on, are not left ſo obſcure as might perplex us, leſt we did not know the meaning of them. But they are ſo <hi>plain,</hi> that he that runs may read them; and the ſimple, that are but honeſt-hearted, may certainly underſtand them: Which <hi>quiets,</hi> and <hi>pleaſeth,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfies</hi> the mind.</p>
                     <p>3. And yet there is an <hi>exciting Difficulty</hi> in <hi>many</hi> things that are offered to our Knowledge, which doth but make our holy ſtudies the more delightful. If the Word of God were <hi>ſo plain</hi> and <hi>obvious to all,</hi> that it might be all underſtood at the <hi>firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the <hi>plainneſs</hi> would bring our <hi>Sacred</hi> Knowledge into <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:59464:166"/>
as being an eaſie common thing. Things common and eaſily got, are little ſet by: But when the <hi>plainneſs</hi> is ſuch as may <hi>prevent our deſpair</hi> and <hi>diſſatisfaction,</hi> and yet the <hi>Difficulty</hi> ſuch, that it may <hi>hold us in ſtudy, and prevent our contempt,</hi> it makes the moſt delightful Knowledge. It is Pleaſant to find ſome daily <hi>addition</hi> to our Light, and to be on the <hi>gaining</hi> and <hi>thriving</hi> hand, and this upon our diligent ſearch: <hi>Succeſſes</hi> are as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as a preſent fulneſs of ſupplies: The daily bleſſing of God upon our ſtudies, and humble learning, addeth to our delight. So that all this ſet together, may ſhew you how pleaſant a thing it is to have the Knowledge of a Saint.</p>
                     <p>Eſpecially if you add that he hath an <hi>Exporimental,</hi> and ſo a <hi>ſweeter Knowledge,</hi> then the moſt learned men have that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. He hath <hi>taſted</hi> that the Lord is gracious, and he hath <hi>taſted</hi> the ſweetneſs of his Love, and of all the Riches of his Grace in Chriſt, and of his full and precious promiſes, and of the inward powerful workings of his ſpirit. His experimental Knowledge is the moſt Delightful Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>The Pleaſure of Natural Knowledge is great, but the Pleaſure of ſaving Knowledge is much greater. I do not believe that ever any of the Ambitious troublers of the world, that let go Heaven that they may Rule on Earth, have half the Pleaſure in their Greatneſs and uſurped Dignities, as an <hi>honeſt Student</hi> hath in his <hi>Books,</hi> and ſtudious exerciſes and ſucceſſes: But if you compare the Pleaſures of their Greatneſs and Commands, with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a <hi>true Believing ſoul,</hi> in his life of Faith, and ſweet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of his Heavenly Inheritance, I muſt plainly tell you that we diſdain the compariſon. Again I ſay, that if you will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Drunkards, the Fornicators, or the Ambitious or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous mans delight, with the ſolace that I find in my <hi>retired ſtudies,</hi> even about <hi>natural common</hi> things, I diſdain the compariſon: But if you compare their <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> with that little, alas too little, pleaſure that I find in the believing thoughts of Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, I do not only diſdain your compariſon, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it.</p>
                     <p>Were I minded to be long, I would ſhew you from theſe twelve particular Inſtances, the abundant Pleaſure of Holy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>1. What a Pleaſant thing is it to know the Lord, the Eternal God, in his bleſſed Attributes! The dimmeſt glimmering Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59464:167"/>
of God, is better then the cleareſt Knowledge of all the myſteries of nature.</p>
                     <p>2. How Pleaſant is it to know the works of his Creation? How, and why, and when he made the world, and all that is therein?</p>
                     <p>3. How Pleaſant is it to know the bleſſed Son of God, and to behold the face of his Fathers Love that is revealed in him as his fulleſt Image?</p>
                     <p>4. How Pleaſant is it to know the Law and Goſpel: the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Method: the litteral and ſpiritual ſenſe: to ſee there the mind and will of God: and to ſee our Charter for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance; and read the Precepts, and the Promiſes, and the Examples of the faith and patience of the Saints?</p>
                     <p>5. How Pleaſant is it to know the Heavenly operations of the Holy Ghoſt, and the nature and action of his ſeveral Graces, and the uſes of every one of them to our ſouls; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to find them in our ſelves, and to be skilled in uſing them?</p>
                     <p>6. How Pleaſant is it to know the nature and frame of the Church of Chriſt which is his Body, and to know the difference and uſe of the ſeveral members? To underſtand the office of the Miniſtry, and why Chriſt hath ſet them in the Church, and how much love he hath manifeſted therein: that they ſhould preach to us, and offer us Reconciliation in <hi>his name and ſtead,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. and <hi>marry us unto Chriſt</hi> in Baptiſm, receiving us <hi>in his name</hi> into the Church and holy Covenant: and that in <hi>his name</hi> and <hi>ſtead</hi> they ſhould deliver us his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>abſolve</hi> the <hi>penitent</hi> ſinner from his ſins, and deliver him a ſealed pardon, and receive the returning humbled ſoul into the Church of Chriſt and Communion of the Saints!</p>
                     <p>7. How Pleaſant is it to know the nature and uſe of all Chriſts Ordinances: The excellencies of his Holy Word: the uſe of Baptiſm, and the refreſhing, ſtrengthening uſe of the Supper of the Lord: the uſe and benefit of Holy prayer, and praiſes, and thankſgiving, and Church-order, and all parts of the Communion of the Saints!</p>
                     <p>8. Yea there is a holy <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in knowing our very <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>folly.</hi> When God bringeth a ſinner to himſelf, though his <hi>ſin</hi> be <hi>odious</hi> to him, yet to know the ſin is <hi>Pleaſant;</hi> and therefore he prayeth that God would ſhew him the bottom of his heart, and the moſt ſecret or odious of his ſins.</p>

                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59464:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>9. And it is <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to a Chriſtian to <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Duty.</hi> It very much quieteth and delighteth his mind, when he can but <hi>know what is the will of God:</hi> When the way of Duty is plain before him, how chearfully can he go on, whatever meet him? and how eaſie doth it make his labour and his ſuffering?</p>
                     <p>10. Yea it is <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to a <hi>Believer</hi> to underſtand his very <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> Though the <hi>Danger</hi> it ſelf be dreadful to him, yet to <hi>know</hi> it, that he may avoid it, is his deſire and his delight.</p>
                     <p>11. And how <hi>Pleaſant</hi> is it to underſtand all the <hi>Helps, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> that God hath provided for us in our way? and how many more are for us, then againſt us?</p>
                     <p>12. But above all, how <hi>Pleaſant</hi> is it to <hi>know</hi> by faith, the life that we muſt live with God for ever? and what he will do for us to all eternity, in the performance of his holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>I do but briefly name theſe Inſtances of Delightful Knowledge, which are ſweeter to the holy ſoul then all the Pleaſures of ſin to the ungodly. Do you think that any of you hath ſuch ſolid Pleaſure in your ſins, as <hi>David</hi> had in the Law of God, when he meditated in it with ſuch delight, and ſaith, <hi>How ſweet is it to my mouth? even ſweeter then the honey and the hony-comb.</hi> Surely you dare not compare with him in Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>2. Another part of <hi>Holineſs</hi> that is <hi>Pleaſant</hi> in the Nature of it, is that which is ſubjected in the <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>affections.</hi> And here is the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> of its ſweetneſs and delights.</p>
                     <p>1. The very <hi>compliance</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> with the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and its Conformity to his Law, doth carry a quieting Pleaſure in it. That ſoul is <hi>happyeſt</hi> that is <hi>neareſt God,</hi> and <hi>likeſt to him;</hi> and that ſoul may well be fulleſt of <hi>Delight,</hi> that is moſt <hi>Happy:</hi> And that ſoul is <hi>neareſt</hi> and <hi>likeſt unto God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Will</hi> is moſt conformed to <hi>his Will:</hi> The <hi>trouble</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> is its <hi>unſettledneſs,</hi> when it is not bottomed on the Will of God: When we <hi>feel</hi> that <hi>Gods Will</hi> doth <hi>Rule and ſatisfie</hi> us, and that we would fain be what he would have us be, and <hi>reſt</hi> in his <hi>Diſpoſing Will,</hi> as well as <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>Commanding Will,</hi> this gives abundant Pleaſure and quietneſs to the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>2. The holy workings of <hi>Charity</hi> in the ſoul, are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pleaſant.</hi> All the acts of <hi>Love to God and man</hi> are very ſweet. This is the holy work, that is its own wages.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59464:168"/>
had rather be employed in it with ſenſe and vigour, then to be Lord of all the earth. O could I but be taken up with the <hi>Love of God,</hi> how eaſily could I ſpare the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of the <hi>fleſh?</hi> Might I but ſee the Lovelineſs of my dear Creator, with a clearer view; and ſee his glory in his noble works; Might I but ſee and feel that ſaving Love which he hath manifeſted in the Redeemer, till my ſoul were raviſhed and filled with his Love, how little ſhould I care who had the Pleaſures of this deceitful world! Had I more of that bleſſed ſpirit of Adoption, and more of thoſe filial affections to my heavenly Father, which his unutterable Love beſpeaks; and were I more ſenſible of his abundant mercy, and did my ſoul but breath and long after him more earneſtly, I would pitty the miſerable Tyrants of the world, that are worſe then Beggars while they domineer, and taſt not of that Kingdom of Love and Pleaſure that dwelleth in my breaſt. All the Pleaſures of the world, are the laughing of a mad man, or the ſports of a child, or the dreams of a ſick man, in compariſon of the Pleaſures of the Love of God.</p>
                     <p>2. And the <hi>Love of Holineſs,</hi> the <hi>Image of God</hi> hath, its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> And ſo hath the Love of the Holy ſervants of the Lord. There is a ſweetneſs in the ſoul in its goings out after any Holy object, in ſpiritual Love. Yea more, our very <hi>common Love of men,</hi> and our <hi>Love of Enemies,</hi> hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of pleaſure, far better then the ſenſual Pleaſure of the ungodly. To feel ſo much of the operations of grace, and to anſwer our holy pattern, in Loving them that hate us, doth give much eaſe and pleaſure to the mind. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Love to God and man, and that for his ſake, are the exceeding Pleaſure of a gracious ſoul.</p>
                     <p>And here by the way, you may take notice of one reaſon why Hypocrites and ungodly men find no ſuch ſweetneſs in the exerciſes of Religion; Becauſe they let alone the <hi>inward Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant work of Love,</hi> which is the ſoul and life of <hi>Outward</hi> duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This <hi>inward work</hi> is the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> work: while they are ſtrangers unto this, their outward duties will be but a toll, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <p>There is a <hi>Pleaſure</hi> even in <hi>Holy Deſires:</hi> When a Chriſtian feeleth his heart enlarged, in longing after the wellfare of the Church and the good of others. Though the abſence of the thing deſired be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59464:168"/>
(which is an act of Love) is pleaſant to us. If the <hi>Luſtfu</hi> have a pleaſure in their <hi>vile Deſires,</hi> and the <hi>Ambitious</hi> and the <hi>Covetous</hi> have a <hi>pleaſure</hi> in their <hi>vain and deluſory deſires,</hi> the wiſe well-guided deſires of a true believer muſt needs be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                     <p>4. Eſpecially when <hi>Deſire</hi> is accompanied with <hi>Hope.</hi> All the Pleaſures of this world, are far ſhort of affording that Reſt and quiet to the ſoul, as the <hi>Hope</hi> of Glory doth to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. O happy ſoul that is acquainted by experience, with the lively Hopes of the everlaſting Happineſs! It is not the Hope of corruptible Riches, nor of a fading inheritance, but of the Crown that ſadeth not, and of the precious, certain, dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſure! It is not a Hope in the promiſe of a deceitful man, but in the word of the everliving God! The ſoul that hath this Anchor, needs not be toſſed with thoſe fears and cares and anxieties of mind, that worldly men are ſubject to. This Hope will never make them aſhamed. If a man were in a conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſentenced to Death, would not the Hopes of Life, upon certain Grounds, be pleaſanter to him, then ſport, or mirth, or luſtful objects, or any ſuch preſent ſenſitive delights? Much more if with the hopes of <hi>Life,</hi> he had the hopes of all the <hi>felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of Life, and of the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of all theſe? O may I but be enabled by faith to lift up the eye of my ſoul to God, and view the everlaſting manſions and by hope to take poſſeſſion of them, and ſay, All this is mine in Title, even upon the Promiſe of the faithful God! what greater Pleaſure can my ſoul poſſeſs, till it enter on the full Poſſeſſion of thoſe eternal Pleaſures! O poor deluded worldly men! What is the Pleaſure of your wealth to this? O brutiſh ſinners! what is the Pleaſure of your mirth and jollity, your meat and drink, your pride and bravery, your luſt and filthineſs in compariſon of this! O poor Ambitious dreaming men, that make ſuch a ſtir for the Honour and Greatneſs of this world! What is the Pleaſure of your Idol-honour, and ſhort vainglory in compariſon of this! while you <hi>have it,</hi> you have no Hope of <hi>Keeping</hi> it: you are troubled with the thought of leaving it: Had we no higher Hopes then yours, how miſerable ſhould we be?</p>
                     <p>5. The <hi>Truſt and repoſe</hi> of the ſoul on God, which is another part of the life of grace, is exceeding <hi>Pleaſant</hi> and <hi>quieting</hi> to the ſoul. To find that we ſtand upon a <hi>Rock,</hi> and that under us
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59464:169"/>
                        <hi>are the everlaſting arms,</hi> and that we have ſo full ſecurity for our ſalvation, as the promiſe and Oath of the immutable God, what a <hi>ſtay,</hi> what a <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is this to the Believer? The troubles of the godly are moſt from the remnants of their unbelief: The more they believe, the more they are comforted and eſtabliſhed: The life of faith is a Pleaſant life. Faith could not conquer ſo many enemies, and carry us through ſo much ſuffering and diſtreſs, as you find in that cloud of teſtimonies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. if it were not a very comfortable work. Even we that ſee not the ſalvation ready to be revealed, may yet greatly rejoyce, for all the manifold temptations, that for a ſeaſon make us ſubject to ſome heavyneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6. And we <hi>that ſee not Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet <hi>Believing can love him and rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> v. 8. <hi>The God of Hope</hi> doth ſometimes <hi>fill his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with all Joy and peace in believing, and makes them even abound in Hope through the Power of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15. 13.</p>
                     <p>6. Yea <hi>Joy</hi> is it ſelf a part of the <hi>Holy</hi> qualification of the Saints, and of the renewed ſtate that grace hath brought them into. <hi>For the Kingdom of God conſiſteth as in Righteouſneſs, ſo in Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. Believers <hi>receive not the ſpirit of bondage again to fear,</hi> that is, they are not under the bondage of the Law, nor have the <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>ſtate of mind</hi> which is ſuited to thoſe Legal impoſitions and terrible commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but they <hi>have received the ſpirit of Adoption by which they cry Abba father,</hi> that is, As they are brought under a more gracious diſpenſation, and a better Covenant and promiſes, and God is revealed to them in the Goſpel as a Reconciled Father through his ſon, ſo doth he treat them more gently as reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led children, and the ſpirit which anſwereth this gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and is given us thereupon, doth qualifie us with a child-like diſpoſition, and cauſe us with boldneſs, Love and confidence, to call God Father, and fly to him for ſuccour and ſupply, in all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And how Pleaſant it muſt be to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, to have this ſpirit of Adoption, this childlike Love and confidence, and freedom with the Lord, methinks you might conjecture, though its ſenſibly known by them only that enjoy it, Gal. 5. 22. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is Love, Joy, Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

attend the Goſpel, yet is it ordinarily <hi>in the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 6. The Holy Ghoſt is the Comforter of true Believers: And if he have taken it upon him as his work, he will ſurely do it, in the degree and ſeaſon fitteſt for them. And if <hi>Joy</hi> it ſelf be part of the ſtate of Grace and Holineſs, you may ſee that it is the moſt delightful Pleaſant courſe.</p>
                     <p>7. Yea that we may have a <hi>Pleaſant</hi> and comfortable life, the Lord hath <hi>forbidden</hi> our diſtracting <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubts,</hi> and our inordinate <hi>ſorrows;</hi> and commanded us <hi>to caſt our care on him,</hi> and promiſed <hi>to care for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. and he hath bid us <hi>be careful for nothing, but in all things make our wants known to him,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. And can there be a courſe of life more Pleaſant then that which doſt conſiſt in faith, and Love, and hope, and Joy, thats built on God, and animated by him, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth inordinate cares and ſorrows, as health doth ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? where it is <hi>unlawful</hi> to be <hi>miſerable</hi> and to grieve our ſelves, and no <hi>ſorrow</hi> is allowed us, but that which tendeth to our joy; where it is made our work to <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, yea always to Rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4. 4. A ſervant or tradeſman will judge of the pleaſure of his life by his work. If his work be a drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his life is tedious and filled with grief: If his work be Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, his life is Pleaſant. Judge then by this of a Holy life. Is it care, and fear, and anguiſh of mind that God commandeth you? no: it is theſe that he forbiddeth. [<hi>Care not: Fear not</hi>] are his injunctions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 41. 10. Do you fear <hi>Reproach?</hi> Why, you do it contrary to the will of God, who biddeth you, [<hi>Fear not the reproach of men,</hi> Iſa. 51. 7.] Do you fear the power and rage of enemies? Why it is contrary to your Religion ſo to do: God biddeth you, <hi>Fear them not,</hi> Iſa. 43. 5, 13, 14. &amp; 44. 2, 8. Do you fear <hi>perſecution</hi> or <hi>death</hi> from the hands of cruel vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? why it is contrary to the will of God that you do ſo, Matth. 10. 26, 28, 31. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body,</hi> &amp;c.] O bleſſed life! where all that is againſt us is forbidden: and all that is truly Joyous and delightful, and neceſſary to make us happy, is commanded us, and made our duty: which is contrary to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, as life to death, and as light to darkneſs. Come hither poor deluded ſinners that fly from care, and fear and ſorrow: If you will but give up your ſelves to Chriſt, you ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all theſe, except ſuch as is neceſſary to your joy.

Perhaps there may be ſome of you that think <hi>it is but labour loſt, and that you could better ſpend thoſe hours, and that God regardeth not our prayers, and that indeed we ſpeed never the better for them, and therefore you have no pleaſure in them.</hi>] And no wonder! If you are Atheiſts and believe not that there is a God, you cannot love him, or rejoyce in him. If you believe not his Promiſes, how ſhould they give you any comfort! If you believe not that he regardeth Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, no wonder if you have no heart to pray: They that ſay <hi>It is in vain to ſerve the Lord, and it is no profit to us to keep his ordinances,</hi> Mal. 3. 14.

If you did believe your friend to be your enemy, you would have ſmall pleaſure in him: Miſ-conceits may eaſily make you loath the things that are moſt delightful. The thoughts of Heaven it ſelf yield little Pleaſure to them that believe not that there is a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or what it is. The Light is not pleaſant to the blind: nor any object of our taſt or ſmel to thoſe that have loſt theſe ſenſes. Is muſick unpleaſant, becauſe it delighteth not the deaf? For ſhame do not charge the ſweet and bleſſed ways of God with that which is the fruit of your <hi>own corruption.</hi> If your lungs be rotten, you may be out of breath with ſpeaking the moſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful words,</hi> or walking in the moſt <hi>pleaſant fields</hi> or <hi>gardens;</hi> But the cauſe of the wearineſs is <hi>within</hi> you. If you have the hearts of Infidels, or graceleſs ſtupid worldly ſinners, you are ſo unfit to approach the moſt Holy God in holy prayer, that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not if you go to it as a Bear to the ſtake, as an Ox to the yoke, or as an offender to the ſtocks; For the God that you pray to, is a <hi>bater</hi> of all the <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> and a <hi>conſuming fire;</hi> and therefore no wonder if his terrours ſhould meet you and leave you but little delight in prayer (Though its wonder that they do not follow you, and meet you in all your ways, and leave you <hi>leſs delight</hi> in the <hi>omiſſion</hi> of it) But if you had the <hi>hearts</hi> of <hi>believing holy men,</hi> and had <hi>taſted</hi> in prayer what <hi>they</hi> have taſted, and had their experience of the ſucceſs, you would then be eaſily perſwaded that prayer is neither a <hi>Vain</hi> nor an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſnt</hi> work. Surely it is not unpleaſant to a burdened ſoul to diſ-burden it ſelf before the Lord: nor to a ſinner that hath felt the weight, the ſmart, the ſting of ſin, to cry for mercy, and healing to him that is able and willing to ſhew mercy; nor i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

it unpleaſant for him that knows the worth of grace and glory, to lie upon his knees in begging them of the Lord. All thoſe that have felt how good it is to draw near to God, had rather have leave to pray in hope, then to pleaſe their ſenſes with any delights that earth affordeth. There is force in Prayer (through the grace that hath appointed and doth accompany it) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure comfort to the diſtreſſed mind, and ſafety to them that are in danger, relief to them that are in want, and ſtrength to them that are in weakneſs. Prayer is good for all things that are good; and good againſt all things that are evil. It is good againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, dangers, enemies and ſin: It is good againſt ſorrows, fears, and cares: yea againſt povery, ſhame and ſickneſs. For the God that Prayer goes to, and makes uſe of, is ſufficient againſt all, and our only help. Turn away now from God if you dare, and caſt off earneſt conſtant Prayer, as if it were a tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant thing! but be ſure the time is coming when thou, even thou that thus deſpiſeſt it, wilt betake thy ſelf to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and cry Lord, Lord, when it is too late, or when anguiſh and terrour ſeiſe upon thee. Sickneſs, and death, and the terrours of the Lord will <hi>teach</hi> thee to pray, as <hi>uſeleſs</hi> and <hi>tedious</hi> as now you think it: Yea and <hi>teach</hi> you to do it <hi>earneſtly,</hi> that now put off all with a few frozen heartleſs words. But O it is <hi>ſeaſonable believing prayer</hi> that is <hi>comfortable:</hi> It is the prayer of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> that is <hi>pleaſant:</hi> but the prayer of too late repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Hell, and the prayer of deſpair and horrour, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not procure a drop of water, afford no pleaſure, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure no relief.</p>

myſteries and treaſures of <hi>mercy</hi> are here-preſented to us in a Sacrament! Here we have Communion with a Reconciled God, and are brought into his preſence by the great Reconciler. Here we have Communion with our bleſſed Redeemer, as Crucified, and Glorified, and offered to us, as our quickning, preſerving, ſtrengthening Head: Here we have Communion with the Holy Ghoſt, applying to our ſouls the benefits of Redemption, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the Son, and communicating light, and life, and ſtrength from him unto us: increaſing and actuating his graces in us. Here we have Communion with the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>ſanctified people,</hi> the heris of life: When the Miniſter of Chriſt by his Commiſſion <hi>Repreſenteth a Crucified Chriſt to our eyes,</hi> by the Bread and Wine appointed to this uſe, we ſee Chriſt Crucified as it were before us; and our Faith layeth hold on him, and we perceive the Truth of the Remedy; and build our ſouls upon this Rock. When the ſame Miniſter by Chriſts Commiſſion, doth <hi>offer us his Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Benefits,</hi> it is as firm and valid to us, as if the mouth of Chriſt himſelf had offered them: And when our ſouls <hi>Receive</hi> him, by that Faith which the Holy Ghoſt exciteth in us, the participation is as true as that of our bodies receiving the Bread and Wine which repreſent him. O do but ask a drooping ſoul, that mourns under the fears of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, how he would value a voice from Heaven, to tell him that all his ſins are pardoned, and that he is dear to God, and judge by his anſwer, what is contained and offered in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Ask him how he would take it, if Chriſt ſhould ſpeak thoſe words himſelf to him, which he hath given his Miniſter Commiſſion in his name to ſpeak! [<hi>Take, eat, this is my Body, which is broken for you</hi>] It is the <hi>ſame Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ſame pardon,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> that is offered us by the <hi>Meſſengers of Chriſt,</hi> and which he <hi>perſonally offered himſelf</hi> to his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> When you muſt all appear at the Barr of God, O what would you not give for a <hi>ſealed pardon,</hi> which in a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is given freely now, to the believing ſoul! Judge now by this, whether it be a <hi>Joyous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance!</hi> When the pooreſt Chriſtian this day receiveth, that which the greateſt Prince that is ungodly, would then give all the world for it he had it. For want of that pardon, Chriſtian, which thou muſt now receive, many thouſands will tremble at the bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59464:175"/>
burden of any ſtrong corruption, how he would value the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and quickning grace of the Holy Ghoſt, that would break his bonds, and give him light and life and ſtrength; and by his anſwer judge of the value of a Sacrament. We have here the greateſt mercies in the world, brought <hi>down</hi> to us in <hi>ſenſible Repreſentations,</hi> that they might be very neer us, and the means might be ſuited to the frailty and infirmity of our preſent ſtate.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>ſealed meſſage</hi> of <hi>Gods Reconciliation</hi> with us, and a <hi>ſealed pardon</hi> of all our <hi>ſins,</hi> and a <hi>ſealed grant</hi> of <hi>Everlaſting life,</hi> be not more <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>deſirable</hi> to your thoughts, then all that earth and fleſh can yield you, it is becauſe your are alive to ſin, and dead to God, and want that ſpiritual ſence and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, by which you might be competent judges. If God, if Chriſt, if grace, if the foretaſts of glory can afford no pleaſure to the ſoul, then <hi>Heaven it ſelf</hi> would not be pleaſant. But if <hi>theſe</hi> are ſweet, the Sacrament is ſweet that doth convey them.</p>
                     <p>Well, poor ſtubborn carnal ſinners! you have been invited to this feaſt as well as others! we are ſent to call you, and even compel you to come in (though upon the terms and in the way of Chriſt!) but you have no great liſt; but ſomewhat elſe doth pleaſe you better! And will it prove better indeed to you at the end? Well, take your own choice! If an Alehouſe be better then the Table of the Lord; if your merry companions do pleaſe you better then the Communion of the Saints, or if you cannot ſubmit to the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> of the family of Chriſt, that you may partake of his proviſion, you may follow your own corrupt deſires, and ſee whither they will lead you! But here it is that I ſhall <hi>chooſe my pleaſures</hi> till I reach the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures. And though in this low communion of imperfect Saints, we ſee but in a glaſs, and have but ſome ſmall imperfect Saſts of the glorious things which Hope expecteth; yet this is more then all that earth and fleſh can yield: and it is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pleaſure that by theſe is revealed, ſealed, and Repreſented. Sacraments can <hi>aſſure</hi> us of <hi>perfect</hi> joys, though they <hi>give</hi> us but little joy in hand.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But if Sacraments be ſo pleaſant, why then</hi> (ſaith a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate ſoul,) <hi>have I found no more pleaſure or comfort in them? Anſw.</hi> Even in the ſoul thats made alive by Grace, diſeaſes may

much corrupt the appetite, and make the ſweeteſt thing ſeem bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Are not Sacraments ſweet to you? and do you not delight in the communion of God and of his Saints? I will not ſay much to you, leſt it ſeem degreſtive, but briefly ask you theſe few Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>1. Are the thoughts <hi>of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven ſweet</hi> to you? If they be, me thinks the Ordinances ſhould be ſweet! If they be not, its no wonder that you ſét light by Sacraments, if you can ſet light by Chriſt and heaven it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Is not ſin grown ſweet to you?</hi> If it be, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances will not be ſweet: no nor unleſs your ſins grow <hi>bitter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. 3. Doth not the <hi>world</hi> grow ſweet to you, and your condition or expectations, and your thriving ſtate, more pleſant to you then heretofore? If ſo, no wonder if Sacraments and all ſpiritual things, do loſe their ſweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 4. Have you been faithful in your preparation, by free confeſſion, true humiliation, ſtrong reſolution, hungring and thriſting after Chriſt, and all this furthered by diligent ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? An unprepared ſoul muſt blame it ſelf, if it find not the ſweetneſs of the Ordinance. The holy appetite and reliſh, that is neceſſary to your Delight, muſt be ſtirred up much in your Preparations.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 5. Are you careful and conſcionable, humble and holy in <hi>your lives?</hi> If you neglect God in your <hi>ordinary converſations,</hi> and walk not with him on other daies, you are unlike to meet him comfortably here. And if you are ſlight and careleſs in your ordinary duties, you will find here that God took notice of it.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 6. Do you faithfully endeavour to exerciſe Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Love and all Sacramental Graces in the uſe of the ordinances? You come not to a <hi>meer receiving</hi> but to a <hi>Work</hi> Have your ſouls been adorned with the wedding garment? and do you come hither for a meeting with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Do you ſee him by faith, and take all that is here Repreſented to you, as if you had ſeen the things themſelves! Do you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that your Lord is coming, and do you lift up your heads in the expectation of your Redemption, and do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him till he come? An idle loytering in Gods work is not the way to find the ſweetneſs of it.</p>

                        <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus Strom. l. 1. init.</hi> gives it as a Reaſon why <hi>every one took his own part of the Bread of the Sacrament</hi> in <hi>thoſe times,</hi> becauſe man being a <hi>free agent muſt be the chooſer or refuſer of his own happineſs:</hi> The Papiſts on the contrary do but gape, and the Prieſt doth pop the bread into their mouths (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt perſwaded them that it is not bread.) Do you not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive the ſpiritual benefits, juſt as the Papiſts do receive the Bread? as if you had nothing to do but <hi>gape?</hi> As if your <hi>preſence</hi> here were as much as is to be expected from you for your edification! How can you <hi>taſt</hi> the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> that is offered, when you do not <hi>exerciſe your ſpiritual ſenſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. 7. Do you exerciſe <hi>faith,</hi> as well as <hi>feeling,</hi> in judging of the benefit of Sacraments? Pardon, and Juſtification, and Title to Salvation are benefits which in <hi>themſelves</hi> you <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feel.</hi> It is by <hi>Believing the promiſe</hi> that you muſt know them. If God have promiſed a bleſſing on his Ordinance, it is ſure to the faithful ſoul as if we felt it, though perhaps we may ſeem long without it. <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf which is the principal end of Ordinances, will not be attained in this life: and yet the Ordinace is not in vain.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 8. Have you the <hi>true underſtanding</hi> of the <hi>uſe of Sacraments?</hi> of the abundant Love that is <hi>here</hi> ſet forth? and the freeneſs and fulneſs of the Promiſe here ſealed? If not, no wonder if you taſte not the ſweetneſs, when you know not how to break the ſhell, that you may feed on the kernel of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 9. Have you not <hi>troubled</hi> your <hi>own ſouls,</hi> and <hi>muddyed</hi> your comforts by <hi>cauſeleſs doubts</hi> and <hi>ignorant ſcruples,</hi> about the <hi>geſtures,</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>perſons that you</hi> joyned with, or ſome ſuch circumſtances as theſe? If ſo, no marvel if you loſe the comfort.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 10. Or at leaſt, have you not been negligent in the <hi>review</hi> and after <hi>improving</hi> of the Ordinances? and have you not thought that all was done when you had received? Any one of theſe miſcarriages may make this pleaſant duty <hi>bitter,</hi> or at leaſt deprive you of the moſt of the delight. But if your hearts be ſuted to the work, and you deprive not your ſelves of the offered conſolation, you ſhall find that God deals bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with you, and will feaſt you even with Angels food.</p>

                     <p>1. It is the conference of <hi>deareſt friends:</hi> the <hi>ſpecial Love</hi> that all the Godly have to one another, doth exceedingly ſweeten their communion.

Their conference proceedeth from the <hi>ſpirit of grace,</hi> and therefore is <hi>gracious,</hi> ſavouring of that <hi>ſpirit:</hi> and all the breathings and manifeſtations of that bleſſed ſpirit, are very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to thoſe that have the ſpirit themſelves, and ſo can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſpiritual things.</p>
                     <p>3 Their conference is about the <hi>higheſt,</hi> the <hi>moſt neceſſary,</hi> the <hi>moſt excellent</hi> things: About the moſt Bleſſed <hi>God</hi> and his ſeveral <hi>Attributes;</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſing-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> about the wonderful myſteries of <hi>Redemption,</hi> the <hi>perſon, life</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> his <hi>Offices</hi> and the <hi>performance</hi> of them, on earth, and in Heaven, in his <hi>Humiliation</hi> and his <hi>Exaltation;</hi> and of the ſweet <hi>Relations</hi> that we and all his Church do ſtand in, to Chriſt our <hi>Head,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer;</hi> as alſo about the gracious workings of the Holy Ghoſt, in firſt begetting and increaſe of holineſs; To open to each other the powerful workings of that Grace that hath raiſed them above all the creatures, and brought them to a contempt of earthly glory, and ſet their hearts on the inviſible God, and on eternal things, that hath renewed them in the inner man, and made them hate the things they loved, and mortified their oldeſt ſtrongeſt ſins, and quickned them in the exerciſe of every grace; all this is edifying ſweet diſcourſe to gracious ſouls.</p>

Yea when they complain of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, it is with our complaints, and they tell us of that which we are troubled with our ſelves; and we perceive that we are not ſingular in our troubles, but that our caſe is the caſe of other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord.</p>

And it is the more pleaſant to converſe with the Godly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſpeak not by <hi>hearſay only,</hi> but by <hi>experience:</hi> They tell us of the diſcoveries that illuminating grace hath made to their own ſouls; and of the many evils they have been ſaved from; and the communion they have had with God, and the prayers which he hath heard, and the many and great deliverances he hath granted them; They relate their conflicts with temptations,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59464:179"/>
and their conqueſts; their ſtrivings againſt their ancient luſts, and how they have overcome them; and the ſweet refreſhings which their ſouls have had in the exerciſe of Love, and faith, and hope! They can dive into the Ocean of mercy, and ſpeak of the abundant kindneſs of the Lord, and earneſtly awaken and invite each other to praiſe him for his Goodneſs, and to declare his wonderous works for the children of men; They can direct each other in their difficulties, and encourage each other in holy ways, and ſtrengthen one another in holy reſolutions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one another with the ſame comforts that they themſelves have been comforted with by the Lord! And may not our hearts rejoyce and burn within us, while we diſcourſe of ſuch <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things</hi> as theſe, in ſuch a <hi>ſerious, experimental, edifying manner?</hi> They can diſcourſe together of their meeting before the throne of Chriſt, and of the bleſſed converſe which they ſhall have in Heaven, with the Lord himſelf, and with the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and <hi>where</hi> they ſhall be, and <hi>what</hi> they ſhall <hi>do,</hi> to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the preſence of God where is fulneſs of joy, and before him where are the eternal pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>O Chriſtians, did not your graces languiſh by your own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and your ſouls grow out of reliſh with theſe ſpiritual and moſt excellent things, your ſpeeches of them would be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury; you would be more frequent, lively, and cheerful in your diſcourſe of holy things; and then your converſe would be more edifying and delightful to each other. We ſhew ſo little of <hi>Grace</hi> in our conference, that makes it to be but little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from other mens; And (which is the commoneſt caſe, and very doleful) we moſt of us remain ſo ignorant and imprudent, that we <hi>marr</hi> holy conference by our mixtures of <hi>unwiſe</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſgrace it to others by our <hi>injudicious weakneſs:</hi> This is the bane of Chriſtian diſcourſe; even the want of <hi>holy skill</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and of underſtanding to ſpeak of the things of God, according to their tranſcendent worth and weight, as much (and more) then the want of <hi>zeal.</hi> But if we could diſcourſe of theſe holy matters <hi>aright,</hi> with <hi>wiſdom</hi> and with <hi>ſeriouſneſs,</hi> how <hi>ſweet,</hi> how <hi>fruitful</hi> would the company of holy perſons be! We ſhould be ſtill among them, as in the family of God, and ſhould hear that which our ſouls do moſt defire to hear; and we ſhould preach to one another the riches of grace in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar diſcourſe; and ſouls might be converted by the conference

of Believers, and not all left to the publike miniſtry: Every man would be a helper to his neighbour. <hi>For the tongue of the juſt is as choice ſilver, though the heart of the wicked is little worth: the lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for want of wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 10. 20, 21. <hi>The lips of the wiſe diſperſe knowledge,</hi> Prov. 15. 7. <hi>Righteous lips are the delight of Kings,</hi> Prov. 16. 13. <hi>and the ſweetneſs of the lips increaſeth learning,</hi> v. 21. <hi>The lips of Knowledge are a precious Jewel,</hi> Prov. 20. 15. <hi>A mans belly ſhall be ſatisfied with the fruit of his mouth, and with the increaſe of his lips ſhall he be filled,</hi> Prov. 18. 20. <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom, and his tongue talketh of judgement; the Law of his God is in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 37. 30, 31.</p>
                     <p>Tell me I beſeech you, you that can be ſo merry in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or in any vain and idle company, why ſhould you think that it is not to us a far ſweeter thing to talk of holy edifying matters, then it is to you to talk of vanity? Is the <hi>ſubject</hi> of <hi>your</hi> diſcourſe more <hi>fit to delight</hi> a man of <hi>wiſdom!</hi> Do you talk of <hi>better things</hi> then <hi>God,</hi> or of <hi>higher things</hi> then <hi>Heaven?</hi> or of things that nearlyer concern you, then the matters of everlaſting conſequence?</p>
                     <p>When I have heard ſuch people talking and laughing, as if they had been the merryeſt people in the world, I have ſometimes hearkened to their diſcourſe, to hear what talk it was that made them ſo merry; and it hath been nothing but impertinency and folly, like a mans talking in his ſleep; enough to make a mans head ake to hear them: I ſhould be quickly <hi>tired</hi> with <hi>their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights:</hi> The blowing of the <hi>wind,</hi> or the <hi>falling</hi> of the <hi>rain,</hi> or as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, the <hi>crackling of thorns in the fire,</hi> hath <hi>as much</hi> in it to <hi>pleaſe my ear,</hi> and <hi>much leſs</hi> to <hi>diſpleaſe it,</hi> then ſuch mens diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Go to a company of <hi>merry fellows,</hi> as you take them, and to a company of <hi>ſerious, godly, prudent people,</hi> and ſecretly <hi>write down all the words</hi> that you hear from both companies; and read them over together when you come home, and tell me which is the <hi>pleaſanter diſcourſe.</hi> What a hodg-podge of non-ſenſe, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, levity, immodeſty, worldlineſs, pride, and folly ſhall you find in <hi>one;</hi> and what ſavoury, neceſſary, edifying, encouraging and comforting ſpeeches will you find you have gathered from the other!</p>
                     <p>It is far pleaſanter to be among the ſinging birds, the bleating

ſheep, yea the chattering daws, then theſe idle, prating, fooliſh companions. For with the <hi>former</hi> you ſhall have ſome <hi>natural good,</hi> without any mixture of <hi>ſinful evil:</hi> But in foolſh, prating company, what ſhall you perceive, but how <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>depraved,</hi> how ſinners are beſide themſelves, how Satan doth befool them, and how God is forgotten while he is preſent with them, and they are laughing in the Devils chains, and at the very brink of death and hell! And can a man be merry to hear ſuch mirth as this? It is a ſad ſpectacle to ſee men <hi>laugh in Bedlam:</hi> but much more to ſee them merry in the fetters of <hi>their ſin,</hi> and under the threatnings and wrath of God. Were you but men of right com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed minds, I durſt referre it to your ſelves, whether holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and diſcourſe be not like to be be much <hi>pleaſanter</hi> then yours.</p>
                     <p>Do you think that the diſcourſe of <hi>Learned men,</hi> about Arts and Sciences, Hiſtory and the like, is not more <hi>pleaſant</hi> then your <hi>idle talk?</hi> Much more is the <hi>holy diſcourſe of Saints</hi> about the things of their ſalvation. Whether do you think the company and diſcourſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or of your <hi>merry companions,</hi> ſhould be the more delightful? Can you fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſhame ſay, that the <hi>later</hi> were the <hi>beſt?</hi> Why, you know that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> had no ſuch <hi>idle talk</hi> as yours. It was <hi>holy things</hi> that they diſcourſed of.</p>
                     <p>Can you for ſhame ſay that you Love God above all, and yet have more pleaſure in prating over a pot of Ale, then in ſpeaking reverently of God? Or would you be believed when you ſay, that your hearts are ſet on Heaven, when you have more delight in talking of any earthly trifle? Well! I ſhall leave it to your conſciences, and to the judgement of any that will ſpeak with Reaſon, whether the holy converſe and conference of the godly, be not in it ſelf a more <hi>Delightful</hi> thing, then all the merriments, the dotages and fooleries of the ungodly. If you think not ſo, it is becauſe your reliſh and appetite is depraved, the Devil hath deluded you, and ſin bereaved you of your wits.</p>
                     <p>2. I have told you of the <hi>Pleaſantneſs</hi> of the <hi>Duties of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which are to be performed more directly <hi>toward God?</hi> Let us now conſider of the reſt <hi>of a Chriſtian life:</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in our <hi>duties</hi> to be performed <hi>towards men:</hi> And theſe are all comprehended in the works of <hi>Charity</hi> and of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59464:180"/>1. And certainly the works of <hi>Charity</hi> are <hi>Delightful.</hi> There is not a pleaſanter work in the world then to <hi>do good.</hi> Even <hi>proud men</hi> find a great delight in the <hi>Reputation</hi> or <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>doing good:</hi> that they may be <hi>accounted</hi> the <hi>great Benefactors of the world,</hi> that is, to be as <hi>earthly gods</hi> among their neighbours, and as the Sun is to the lower world, that all may be below them, and live by their influence. This is the top of that proſperiity that ſinful ambition doth aſpire to. And if the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Well-doing</hi> be ſo pleaſant to the <hi>Proud,</hi> the Conſcience of the thing it ſelf ſhould be more pleaſant to the upright. <hi>Open bounty</hi> is the <hi>hypocrites glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> But to do good in <hi>ſecret</hi> is the <hi>believers pleaſure;</hi> for their <hi>Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward them openly:</hi> Yea the very delight of doing good, and eſpecially a great or publike good, a ſpiritual and everlaſting good, is a reward unto it ſelf. It is the ſpeech of Chriſt recited by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 35. that <hi>it is more bleſſed to give then to receive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many things concurring that make it very <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to <hi>do good.</hi> It proceeds from the power of <hi>Love:</hi> and the exerciſe of Love is pleaſant. And Love makes our Brethren to be to us as our ſelves, and conſequently their welfare is as our own, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth us as if our ſelves received, all that they receive. And what abundant pleaſure then hath a Believer? When ſo many thouſand of his brethren, do receive ſo many thouſand benefits daily from God himſelf: and all theſe are to the Chriſtian, through the union and power of Love, as if he had received them all himſelf. But eſpecially when he himſelf is the inſtrument of conveyance. The poor have comfort in <hi>receiving</hi> of relief; but nothing in compariſon of <hi>his that gives it,</hi> if it be done for the <hi>ſake of Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of heart. A poor man receiveth from the giver perhaps but an outward ſmall commodity: But the upright giver receiveth from God, the ſenſe of his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and peace of conſcience, with the promiſe of an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recompence: A mite, or a cup of cold water, given to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the name of a Prophet, or to a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall certainly be rewarded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40, 41, 42.</p>
                     <p>A true Believer is <hi>Covetous</hi> to <hi>do good,</hi> as others are to <hi>receive it:</hi> and ſtudyeth for opportunities of laying out his gifts and wealth for God, as others ſtudy to gather it for themſelves. As a worldling ſtudyeth for a good bargain, that he may grow rich; a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59464:181"/>
true Believer ſtudyeth for opportunities to lay out that he hath for God, and to improve his Maſters ſtock to the beſt advantage. The Covetous doth not more long to get more, then Believers do to be rid of that they have, in the way and on the terms, as may do moſt good, and be beſt accepted: And they are even afraid leſt opportunities of doing good ſhould over-ſlip them, and the ſeed-time ſhould paſs by: A Believer knows that, as his life and ſoul, ſo his worldly riches, are nowhere ſure but in the hand of God: And therefore if they can procure his ſecurity, and get him to receive it, and return it them in Heaven with the promiſed advantage, they have then ſecured it indeed: All is loſt that God hath not, in one way or other: and all is ſecured that he hath, and for which we have his promiſe. This is <hi>laying it up in heaven, Matth.</hi> 6. 21. While <hi>we keep it,</hi> we cannot ſecure it from thieves: When we have diſpoſed of it according to the Will of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the warrant of his promiſe, it is then in <hi>his Cuſtody,</hi> and then it is ſafe: Neither ruſt or moath can then corrupt it, nor the ſtrongeſt thieves break through and ſteal. To be Good, and do Good, is to be likeſt unto God; and therefore muſt needs be the ſweeteſt life.</p>
                     <p>2. Works of <hi>Juſtice</hi> alſo have their <hi>pleaſure:</hi> For they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Juſtice of God himſelf, from whom they do proceed. That which is moſt <hi>Pleaſant to God,</hi> ſhould be moſt <hi>Pleaſant</hi> unto <hi>us.</hi> And as he hath bid us, <hi>not forget to do good and to communicate, becauſe with ſuch ſacrifice he is well pleaſed,</hi> Heb. 13. 16. ſo he hath told us that he <hi>delighteth in the exerciſe of loving-kindneſs, judgement, and righteouſneſs in the earth,</hi> Jer. 9. 24. <hi>He hath ſhewed us, what is good: and what doth he require of us, but to do juſtly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with our God?</hi> Mich. 6. 8. And therefore he commandeth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 6. [<hi>Turn thou to thy God: Keep Mercy and Judgement: and wait on thy God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>] Private juſtice between man and man, and family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice between parents and children, maſters and ſervants, and Political juſtice between the Magiſtrates and the people, do all maintain the order of the world, and procure both publike and private peace. It is ſelfiſhneſs and injuſtice, tyrannie, oppreſſion, diſobedience and rebellion, that procure the miſeries of the world: But Righteouſneſs is ſafe and ſweet.</p>
                     <p>2. You have heard of the Pleaſure of <hi>Holy Actions,</hi> both <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> and <hi>External:</hi> The truth is evident alſo from the <hi>Objects</hi>
                        <pb n="303" facs="tcp:59464:181"/>
of theſe <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>matter from which</hi> a believer may derive his <hi>Pleaſures.</hi> And O what an Ocean of delight is here before us! Were our powers, capacities and acts but anſwerable to the <hi>Objects,</hi> we ſhould preſently have the Joyes of heaven.</p>
                     <p>1. A Believer hath the <hi>ever bleſſed God himſelf</hi> to derive his comforts from. He hath his Nature and Attributes to be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: He hath his near Relations to afford him comfort; and this is more then to have all the world. It is a God of Infinite Power, and Woſdom, and Goodneſs, that we believe in, that we Love, and Worſhip, and Obey. It is alſo a Father Reconciled to us, that hath taken us in Covenant to him as his people, through Jeſus Chriſt. And where ſhall we find comfort if not in God? It is in vain to look for that from any creature, that is not to be found in him. Poor worldlings! you have nothing that is worth the having, but the crumms that fall from the childrens table. God is our Portion, and the world is yours: and yet you have leſs even in this world then we. You have the ſhadow, and we have the ſubſtance: You have the ſhell, and we the kernell: You have the ſtraw and chaff, and true believers have the corn: Your comforts are ſhaken with every ſtorm; and toſt up and down by the Juſtice of God, or the Pride of man: But God that is our Portion is unchangeable: Yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever: We have <hi>a Kingdom that cannot be moved, Heb.</hi> 12. 28. Perſecutors cannot take our God from us, nor can any thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from his Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36. They may ſeparate us from our houſes, from our Countries, from our friends, from our riches, our liberties, our lives, from our Books, our company and Ordinances, but not from God, who is our great Delight. In poverty, in perſecution, in ſickneſs, and at death, we have ſtill our intereſt in God: A Chriſtian is never in ſo low a ſtate, but he hath a God to whom he may go for comfort, who is more to him then your ſweeteſt pleaſures. Is it not a pleaſure to have ſuch a God as can cure all diſeaſes, ſupply all wants, overcome all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, deliver in all dangers, and hath promiſed that he will do it ſo far as is for our good! If he want water that hath the Sea, or he want land that hath all the earth, or he want light that hath the Sun, yet doth he not need to want delight that hath the Lord to be his God, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e do but keep in the pathes of grace. And are you yet unreſolved, whether Godlineſs be the moſt Pleaſant Life? Take all your pleaſures, and make your beſt of them, may
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59464:182"/>
I but have the Lord to be my God, and I hope I ſhall never deſire to change with you.</p>
                     <p>2. A Holy life is therefore <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> becauſe we have a <hi>full ſufficient Saviour,</hi> from whom we may daily fetch delight. The E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ernal Son of God is become the Healer of our wounds, our Peace-maker with the Father, the Conquerour of our enemies, the Ranſom for our ſins, the Captain of our ſalvation, the Head of his Church, and the Treaſure of all our Hopes and Joyes! Sin and miſery are the works of Satan, which Chriſt came into the world to deſtroy. If Hypocrites can ſteal a little Peace to their Conſciences, from a falſe conceit that they have a part in Chriſt, what comfort may it be to the true Believer, that hath a ſure and real intereſt in him! That is the ſad and miſerable life, when you are out of Chriſt, and ſtrangers to his Covenant, and cannot ſay his benefits are yours, but you are yet in your ſins, without his righteouſneſs: But when we have a ſpecial intereſt in him, the foundation of our everlaſting joy is laid, and the heart of ſin and miſery is broken: What fear or ſorrow can you name, that I may not fetch a ſufficient remedy againſt from Chriſt? What can the Prince of darkneſs ſay to our diſcomfort, which we may not anſwer by Arguments from Chriſt? By this judge of the Comfort of a Holy life. If the Godly over-look the Grounds of Joy, that are laid in Chriſt, and live in a miſtaken ſorrow, that is not for want of Reaſons and warrant to rejoyce, but for want of a right diſcerning of thoſe Reaſons. But what have you that are ungodly, to anſwer againſt all the terrours of the Law? or to anſwer againſt all the accuſations of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? or to comfort you againſt the remembrance of your approaching miſery? While you have no part in Chriſt, you have no right to comfort. One thought of Chriſt to a believing ſoul, may afford more <hi>Delight</hi> then ever you will find in a ſinful life.</p>
                     <p>3. Moreover, we have the <hi>Holy spirit of Chriſt,</hi> that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely given us to be our <hi>Comforter:</hi> And if that be not a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant life that is managed by ſuch a Guide, and that be not likeſt to be a joyful ſoul, that is poſſeſt by the Spirit of joy it ſelf, there is no joy then on earth to be expected. Hath God promiſed his Spirit to <hi>comfort you</hi> that are <hi>wicked in your ſin?</hi> No, it is the malicious deceiving ſpirit that is <hi>your Comforter:</hi> that by his comforts he might keep you from ſolid, ſpiritual, everlaſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59464:182"/>
But the Repenting, Believing ſoul that is united unto Chriſt, and hath already had the <hi>ſpirit</hi> for his <hi>converſion,</hi> it is he that hath the promiſe of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> for his <hi>conſolation.</hi> And if that be not the moſt comfortable life, where the God of Heaven becomes the <hi>comforter,</hi> we cannot then know the effect by the cauſe. If <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf will <hi>quicken;</hi> if <hi>light</hi> it ſelf will <hi>illuminate;</hi> the <hi>comforting spirit</hi> will certainly <hi>comfort,</hi> in the degree and ſeaſon as God ſeeth meet, and the ſoul is fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                     <p>4. Moreover, we have the <hi>whole treaſurie of the Goſpel</hi> to go to for our Delight. And little doth the ſenſual unbelieving ſoul know what ſweetneſs, what ſupporting pleaſures may be from thence derived. I had rather have the holy word of God to go to for contents, then the treaſures of the rich, or the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ſenſual, or the flatteries and vain glory of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man: All that the world doth make ſuch a pudder about, which they ride and run for, which they ſo much glory in, will never afford them ſo much Content, as one Scripture promiſe will do to a truly faithful ſoul. I muſt profeſs before Angels and men, that I had rather have one Promiſe of the Love of God, and the life to come, which is contained in the holy Scriptures, then to have all the riches, pleaſures, and honours of this world. My God, this was my Covenant with thee, and to this I ſtand. O bleſſed be the Lord, that hath provided us ſuch a Magazine of Delight as is this heavenly ſacred Book! The Precepts appoint us a pleaſant work: The ſtricteſt prohibitions do but reſtrain us from our own calamities, and keep out of our hands the knife by which we would cut our fingers: The ſevereſt threatnings do but deterre us from running into the conſuming fire; and hedge about the devouring gulf, leſt we ſhould fooliſhly caſt our ſelves therein. And theſe are the bittereſt parts of that holy word. But when we read the promiſes of a Saviour, and the wonderful hiſtory of his Incarnation, and of his holy ſelf-denying life, his conqueſts, miracles, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, interceſſion, and his promiſe to return; when we read of the foundation which he hath laid, and the building which he intends to finiſh, of his rich abundant promiſes to his choſen, what proviſion do we find for our abundant joys! No ſtrait can be ſo great, no preſſure ſo grievous, no enemies ſo ſtrong, but we have full conſolation offered us in the promiſes, againſt them all. We have promiſes of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59464:183"/>
the pardon of all our ſins, and promiſes of heaven it self; and what can we have more! we have promiſes ſuited to every ſtate, both proſperity and adverſity. What do we need which we have not a promiſe of? And the word of God is no deceit. What but a promiſe can comfort them that are ſhort of the poſſeſſion? May I not have more joy in <hi>ſickneſs with a promiſe,</hi> then the <hi>ungodly without a promiſe</hi> in their <hi>health?</hi> A <hi>promiſe</hi> in <hi>priſon</hi> ſets a man as at <hi>liberty!</hi> A <hi>promiſe</hi> in <hi>Poverty</hi> is more then <hi>riches.</hi> A <hi>promiſe</hi> at <hi>death</hi> is better then life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What I have a <hi>promiſe of,</hi> I may be ſure of: but what you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs without a promiſe, you may loſe (and your ſouls and hopes with it) this night. There is no condition on earth ſo hard to a man that hath intereſt in the promiſes, in which he may not have plentiful relief. We live by <hi>faith,</hi> and not by <hi>ſenſe;</hi> And we reckon more on that as ours, which we <hi>hope</hi> for, then which we do <hi>poſſeſs.</hi> We are ſure that there is no true felicity on earth; It then we have a promiſe of Heaven, when Infidels lie down in the duſt with deſperation, have we not a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life then they?</p>
                     <p>5. Moreover we have <hi>Heaven it ſelf</hi> to fetch our comfort from. Not <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>ſight,</hi> or in <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> but <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and ſeen by faith. And if <hi>Heaven</hi> will not afford us pleaſure, whence ſhall we expect it? Even <hi>ſenſual men</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as well in what they <hi>ſee not,</hi> if they are <hi>aſſured</hi> it is <hi>theirs,</hi> as in what they <hi>ſee:</hi> And why then may not Believers do ſo much more? A worldling when he <hi>ſeeth not</hi> his money in his cheſt, or at uſe, or his lands and cattel that are far from him, can yet rejoyce in them, as if he <hi>ſaw them:</hi> And ſhould not we rejoyce in the certain Hopes of Heaven though yet we ſee it not? when I am pained in ſickneſs, and role in reſtleſs wearineſs of my fleſh, if then I can ſay [<hi>I ſhall be in Heaven,</hi>] may it not be the inward rejoycing of my ſoul? <hi>You</hi> know where <hi>you are,</hi> but you know not where you <hi>ſhall be.</hi> The <hi>Believer</hi> knoweth where <hi>he ſhall be,</hi> as <hi>truly</hi> as he knoweth where <hi>he</hi> is (unleſs it be one that by his frailty hath not reacht unto <hi>aſſurance;</hi> who yet hath reached unto <hi>Hope.</hi>) What great matter is it if I lay in greateſt pain, if I can ſay [<hi>I ſhall have everlaſting eaſe in Heaven</hi>] Or if I lay in priſon, or in ſordid poverty, and can ſay [<hi>I ſhall ſhortly be with Chriſt.</hi>] Or if I had loſt the love of all men, and could ſay [<hi>that I ſhall everlaſtingly enjoy the Love of God?</hi>]</p>

                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:59464:183"/>Moſt of your comforts do come in by the way of your <hi>thoughts.</hi> And what <hi>Thoughts</hi> ſhould ſo rejoyce the ſoul as the thoughts of our abode with Chriſt for ever? If a day in the Courts of God be ſo delightful, what is ten thouſand millions of ages in the Court of Glory? and all then as freſh as at the firſt day? <hi>There</hi> it is that our ſin will be put off: Our carnal enmity laid by: our temptations will be over: our enemies will all have done: our fears and ſorrows will be at an end; Our deſires will be accompliſhed: Our differences be reconciled: Our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity perfected, and our expectations fully ſatisfied, and Hope turned into full fruition. O may I but be able with ſtronger faith, and fuller confidence to ſay [<hi>that Heaven is mine, and when this tabernacle is diſſolved, I ſhall be with Chriſt,</hi>] my life and my death will be delightful, and I need not complain for want of pleaſure.

                     </p>
                     <p>1. And do you think that <hi>ſin</hi> is ſo <hi>lovely</hi> a thing that a man cannot <hi>live merrily</hi> without it? <hi>ſin</hi> is the breach of the Laws of God, and the injury of the Heavenly Majeſty, and the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his hot diſpleaſure, and the poiſon and ſickneſs of the ſoul.

It is <hi>for your Pleaſure,</hi> that <hi>this pleaſure</hi> is forbidden you. The <hi>ſweeeneſs</hi> of the poyſon of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> will be ſoon gone, when the gripings of the tormented Conſcience do remain. You will forbear the moſt <hi>delightful fruits</hi> or <hi>drinks,</hi> if your Phyſicion tell you they will hazzard your <hi>life,</hi> or torment you afterward. <hi>You</hi> are ſhort-ſighted, and ſhort-witted, and look but to the <hi>preſent reliſh</hi> of things, and <hi>chooſe them</hi> if you <hi>taſte</hi> them <hi>ſweet;</hi> but <hi>God</hi> looks to your <hi>everlaſting pleaſures.</hi> So that you may well reckon it among the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of a <hi>holy life,</hi> that you have ſuch <hi>preſervatives</hi> againſt the <hi>greateſt ſorrows:</hi> and that you are kept from the <hi>pleaſures</hi> that will be <hi>bitterneſs</hi> in the latter end.</p>
                     <p>Yea <hi>at the preſent</hi> hath not <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> more <hi>trouble</hi> attending it then <hi>ſobriety!</hi> Reckon up the conſuming of mens <hi>eſtates,</hi> the <hi>troubles</hi> of their <hi>families,</hi> the <hi>ſickneſſes</hi> of their <hi>bodies,</hi> the <hi>ſhame</hi>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:59464:184"/>
and <hi>contempt</hi> that it bringeth on them <hi>here,</hi> and the <hi>wounds</hi> of their <hi>conſciences,</hi> and tell me whether it were not <hi>more pleaſure</hi> to <hi>forbear</hi> thoſe cups then to drink them. And hath not <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> more <hi>trouble</hi> attending it then <hi>temperance!</hi> By that time the <hi>charge</hi> be paid, the <hi>ſickneſs</hi> that <hi>fulneſs</hi> breedeth be endured, the <hi>phyſicion</hi> paid, and all the effects of gluttony overcome, you will find that the <hi>pleaſure</hi> was little to the pain. The like I may ſay of <hi>Uncleanneſs, worldlineſs, paſſion, pride,</hi> and all other ſins that uſually bring a puniſhment with them.</p>
                     <p>2. And then for <hi>Caſtigatory ſufferings,</hi> it is not <hi>Godlineſs</hi> that is the cauſe of them (as ſufferings.) <hi>Sin</hi> leſs, and <hi>ſuffer</hi> leſs. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not God, and he will ſpare the rod. Do you <hi>hurt your ſelves</hi> like careleſs children, and then <hi>blame God</hi> for bidding you, [<hi>Take heed?</hi>] God doth not puniſh men <hi>for Holineſs,</hi> and well doing. It is for <hi>want of Holineſs</hi> that you are puniſhed. I think therefore that it is part of the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of a <hi>Holy life,</hi> that it keeps men out of the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>puniſhment.</hi> You <hi>muſt</hi> have <hi>pain,</hi> and unpleaſant phyſick, when once you have taken a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet of ſenſual delight, and made your ſelves ſick with too much of the creature. Holineſs would have <hi>prevented</hi> this: And when <hi>thats too late,</hi> it would <hi>cure</hi> it by the cheapeſt means that your health will bear. Is it not then unreaſonable when you have <hi>troubled your ſelves,</hi> to blame your phyſicion for <hi>troubling you</hi> in order to a cure?</p>
                     <p>3. And for thoſe ſufferings that are <hi>principally for Chriſt,</hi> con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. That they are alſo <hi>originally from ſin,</hi> and therefore you may know what to blame for the bitter part. Though the Time, and place, and <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of your ſufferings may proceed from the gracious providence of your Lord; yet that ſuppoſeth that ſin had brought you into a <hi>ſtate of ſuffering in general</hi> before; which Chriſt did not preſently and plenarily remit and take off, but diſpoſeth of them by his wiſdom, as may make moſt for his Glory and your good. 2. And will you grudge at a little <hi>tranſitory pain,</hi> that is <hi>uſually</hi> requited with <hi>comforts</hi> in <hi>this life,</hi> and rewarded with <hi>pleaſures unſpeakable</hi> hereafter! You grudge not to caſt away your ſeed in hope of an increaſe at harveſt; nor do you murmur at your daily labour if it be but bleſſed with ſucceſs. And will you grudge to paſs through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to glory, and to fow in tears that you may reap in joy? It is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59464:185"/>
but few that ſuffer Martyrdom, or any great matter for the cauſe of Chriſt, eſpecially in our dayes: And thoſe few have uſually more joy then ſorrow. If you knew the <hi>joyes</hi> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> you would never ſo ſhrink at the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> And for a few mocks and ſcorns of fooliſh men, it is ſcarcely worth the name of a <hi>ſuffering:</hi> Nor is it ſo much as wicked men ſuffer in their ſin. As Godlineſs is a ſhame among the fooliſh wicked men; ſo wickedneſs is a ſhame among all that are pious, wiſe and ſober. And why ſhould not the ſhame of ſin be more loathed then the undeſerved ſhame of honeſty? Alas, all this is nothing to the ſorrows of the ungodly. A little of the vinegar of affliction will make us reliſh our proſperity the better, and through our frailtie is become a <hi>neceſſary ſauce</hi> to that luſcious ſtate that we are ſo apt to ſurfet on! Do you not ſee what lamentable work proſperity, victories, honour, and worldly wealth and power have made in the world? and ſhall we grudge at that neceſſary moderate affliction that ſaveth us from the like overthrows? O how few are able to withſtand the temptations of great or long proſperity! Experience of the frequent, woful falls of proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, that ſeemed once as firm as any, hath made me fear when I hear of the exaltation of my friends, and the leſs to grieve for their adverſity or my own. Holineſs therefore is the moſt pleaſant way, notwithſtanding the afflictions that do attend it: And if God will give me an <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> (of Faith, and Love, and a Heavenly mind) though it be with an <hi>increaſe</hi> of my <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,</hi> I hope I ſhall take it as an <hi>incereaſe</hi> of my <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and give him the praiſe of ſo merciful a diſpenſation. And thus I have proved to you from the Nature of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that it is the moſt <hi>Pleaſant</hi> way.</p>
                     <div n="2" type="section">
                        <p>II. I Should next ſhew you the <hi>Delights</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> from the <hi>Helps and Concomitants</hi> that promote our <hi>pleaſure.</hi> But becauſe I am afraid of lengthening my diſcourſe too much, I ſhall only name a few things of many.</p>
                        <p>1. God being <hi>our God in Covenant,</hi> his Love is to the holy ſoul, as the Sun is to our bodies, to illuminate, warm, revive, and comfort them; and did not ſin cauſe ſome ecclipſes, or raiſe ſome clouds, or ſhut the windows, we ſhould rejoyce continually, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59464:185"/>
find how ſweet a thing it is, being juſtified by faith, to have <hi>peace with God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. We are <hi>in Covenant with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who intercedeth for our <hi>peace with God.</hi> And the Father <hi>alwayes heareth</hi> his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>John</hi> 11. 42. And therefore that meaſure of comfort which he ſeeth ſuitable to our preſent ſtate, we ſhall be ſure of. <hi>Who ſhall condemn us? when it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 34. <hi>We have a great high-Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens, even Jeſus the Son of God; one that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and was in all points tempted like as we are, but without ſin;</hi> and therefore through him we may <hi>come boldly to the throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</hi>] Heb. 4. 14, 15, 16. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting words hath he ſpoken to us in the Goſpel? and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable relations hath he put us into? He calleth us <hi>his friends,</hi> if we <hi>do his Commandments,</hi> as if <hi>ſervanes</hi> were too low a title, <hi>John</hi> 15. 14, 15. <hi>Peace he leaveth with us: his Peace he giveth to us; not as the world giveth: commanding us that we let not our hearts be troubled or afraid,</hi> Joh. 14. 27. To thoſe that <hi>Love him,</hi> he hath promiſed his <hi>Fathers Love,</hi> and that they will <hi>come to him, and make their abode with him.</hi> John 14. 23. <hi>If any man ſerve him, let him follow him; and where Chriſt is, there ſhall his ſervant be; if any man ſerve Chriſt, him will the Father honour,</hi> John 12. 26.</p>
                        <p>3. That we might have ſure Conſolation, the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> is given to be <hi>our Comforter:</hi> and we are <hi>in Covenant</hi> with <hi>him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> who ſurely will perform his Covenants.</p>
                        <p>4. The ſervants of Chriſt have his <hi>holy image,</hi> the <hi>mark</hi> of his children, which is the in-dwelling Evidence of his Love, to <hi>aſſure them</hi> of their happineſs.</p>
                        <p>5. They have manifold <hi>experience</hi> of the kindneſs of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in hearing their prayers, and helping them in their ſtraits, and delivering them in their diſtreſſes.</p>
                        <p>6. They have alſo the help of the <hi>Experience of others,</hi> even of all the godly with whom they do converſe, who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them with their comforts, and tell them how good they have found the Lord.</p>
                        <p>7. They have <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> appointed by office to be the <hi>helpers of their Faith</hi> and <hi>Jey:</hi> to be the <hi>meſſengers of glad
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59464:186"/>
tidings</hi> to them, and to tell them from God of the pardon of their ſins, and of his favour to them in Chriſt: and to heal the broken-hearted, and preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, <hi>&amp;c. Luke</hi> 4. 18. To have a deputed <hi>Officer</hi> of Chriſt to <hi>abſolve the penitent,</hi> and <hi>deliver them pardon</hi> in the <hi>name of Chriſt,</hi> and to pray for them, and direct them, and reſolve their doubts, and ſhew them the promiſes that may ſupport them, and help to profligate their temptations, muſt needs be much to the <hi>comfort</hi> of believers: As the care of a father is the comfort of the child; and the care of the Phyſicion is a comfort to the ſick.</p>
                        <p>8. They have all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> ſuited to their comfort: the Word read, preached and meditated on: the Sacraments and the publike praiſes of God, and Communion of the Saints (of which before.)</p>
                        <p>9. They have <hi>multitudes</hi> of <hi>Mercies</hi> ſtill about them, and every day renewed on them, to feed their comforts.</p>
                        <p>10. They have a promiſe that <hi>all things ſhall work together for their good;</hi> and ſo that all their <hi>afflictions themſelves</hi> ſhall be their <hi>commodities,</hi> and <hi>death it ſelf</hi> ſhall be <hi>their gain,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. Phil. 1. 21. and all their <hi>enemies</hi> ſhall be ſubdued by Chriſt the Prince of their ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>So that from this much you may ſee, that for <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> there is no life that hath the advantages that a holy life hath. <hi>As for the ungodly, they are not ſo; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away,</hi> Pſalm 1. 4. Theſe <hi>pleaſures</hi> grow not in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked way, nor do ſuch <hi>ſtrangers</hi> know Believers joyes.</p>

                     <div n="3" type="section">
                        <p>III. LAſtly, I ſhould alſo have ſhewed you the Pleaſure of Holineſs by the <hi>Effects:</hi> But here alſo to avoid prolixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I will but name a few.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Holineſs is Pleaſing to God himſelf;</hi> and therefore it muſt needs be <hi>pleaſant</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> that have it: For it is their <hi>end</hi> and chiefeſt <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to <hi>pleaſe God.</hi> They know that this is the <hi>end</hi> for which they were Created, Redeemed, and renewed: and therefore that is the moſt <hi>Pleaſant life</hi> to them, in which they find that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>beſt Pleaſed.</hi> And therefore <hi>they labour, that whether preſent or abſent, they may be accepted of him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 9. They
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59464:186"/>
are <hi>an holy Prieſt-hood, to offer up spiritual ſacrifice, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Holineſs</hi> muſt needs be <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to the ſoul, becauſe it is the <hi>ſpiritual health of the ſoul,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> and certain <hi>evidence</hi> of its ſafety. And <hi>Health</hi> is a conſtant ſenſible delight: And to <hi>know</hi> that our ſouls have <hi>ſcapt</hi> the <hi>danger</hi> of the wrath of God, and everlaſting miſery, muſt needs be a greater Pleaſure then any the <hi>matters</hi> of this world can afford. One ſerious thought of the ſalvation, which Holineſs is the earneſt of, may give that true contentment to the ſoul, that all the wealth and glory of the world can never give.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Holineſs removeth fears and troubles,</hi> and therefore muſt needs be a <hi>Pleaſant</hi> ſtate. It removeth the fears of the wrath of God, and of damnation: and the fears of all deſtructive evils: It tends to heal the wounded ſoul, and pacific the clamorous conſcience, and abate all worldly and groundleſs ſorrows; for which the wicked have no true cure.</p>
                        <p>4. Holineſs is the <hi>deſtruction of ſin:</hi> and ſin is the cauſe of all calamities: and therefore Holineſs muſt needs be Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>Holineſs doth conſiſt in rejoycing Graces,</hi> that are exceeding pleaſant in the exerciſe; as Faith, Hope, Love, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea it conſiſteth in Joy it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17.</p>
                        <p>6. It fits the ſoul for Communion with God, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Delights; and it brings us near him, and acquaints us with him as a God of Love: and therefore muſt needs be a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtate.</p>
                        <p>7. You ſee by experience, that when once men have tryed a Holy life, they think they can never <hi>have enough</hi> of it: The more Holy they are, the more Holy they would be. He that hath <hi>moſt,</hi> would fain have <hi>more:</hi> And the weakeſt deſireth no leſs then to be <hi>perfect.</hi> And do you think men that have tryed it, would ſo long after <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> if it were not <hi>pleaſant?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Judge alſo by the <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> of the godly, who <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs,</hi> and make it the principal buſineſs of their lives: Would they make all this ado for <hi>nothing?</hi> Or for that which is a matter of no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Judge alſo by the <hi>delights</hi> which they voluntarily <hi>forſake,</hi> when they let go all their ſinful pleaſures, and renounce all the glory of

                        <p>8. You ſee alſo that the truly Godly, when once they have tryed a holy life, will never go back again to their <hi>former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> but loath the very remembrance of them: It is not all the honours, and riches, and pleaſures in the world, that can hire them to forſake a holy life. Sure therefore they find it the moſt pleaſant courſe; if not in ſenſible delights, yet at leaſt in eaſing their conſciences, and ſecuring their minds from the terrours that ſinful pleaſures would produce. If they found that Godlineſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not their expectation, they have leiſure enough, and temptations too many, to turn back into the ſtate from whence they came. But how would they abhorr ſuch a motion as this?</p>
                        <p>9. If Holineſs were not a Pleaſant thing, it could not help us to bear up under all afflictions, nor make us rejoyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it doth. That which can ſweeten gall and wormwood, muſt needs be very ſweet it ſelf.

                        <p>10. Laſtly, if Holineſs were not pleaſant, it could not make Death it ſelf ſo eaſie, nor take off its terrours, nor cauſe the Martyrs to ſuffer ſo joyfully for Chriſt: Death is the King of terrours, and ſo bitter a cup, that it muſt needs be a pleaſant thing indeed, that can ſweeten it.</p>

What is it that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth them, but a dream of honour, or the good will and word of mortal men, or a brutiſh ſportfulneſſe, or the pleaſing of the itch of luſt, or the proviſion that they have laid up for the fleſh?

The treaſures of a Kingdom excell not the treaſure of a childs pin-box the thouſandth part ſo much as Heaven excells the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ungodly. Judge therefore by the <hi>matter</hi> that feeds their pleaſure, which of the two is the more pleaſant life: to ſport in their own ſhame, and laugh at the brink of miſery, with the ungodly; or to delight our ſelves in the Love of God, and rejoyce in the aſſured hope of Glory with the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?</p>
                        <p>2. The Delights of <hi>Holineſs</hi> are the <hi>moſt rational, well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſure delights.</hi> They are not deluſory, nor grounded on miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes or fancies. They are warranted by the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>certainty</hi> of his <hi>promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of his counſels, and the <hi>ſure Reward</hi> prepared for his Saints. None but a lying malicious Devil, or his inſtruments that participate of his nature, or a blind, corrupted, partial fleſh, will ever go about to queſtion the foundations of our faith and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. The hopes and comforts that are built upon this Rock, will never fall, nor make us aſhamed.</p>
                        <p>But the ungodly rejoyce in their own deluſions: It is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and errour that they are beholden to for their mirth. They laugh in their ſleep, or as mad men in their diſtraction. Did they know that Satan rejoyceth in their joyes; and that an offended God is alwayes preſent, and how poor a matter it is that they rejoyce in, it would marr their mirth. If they ſaw the Hell that they are near, or well-conſidered where they ſtand, and what a caſe their ſouls are in, they would have little liſt to play or laugh. If they knew aright the ſhortneſs of their pleaſures, and the length of their ſorrows, and in what a doleful caſe their wealth and fleſhly delights will leave them, it would turn their laughter into mourning and lamentation. So that they rejoyce but (as a ſick man in a phrenſie, or as a fool upon ſome good news to him that is <hi>falſe;</hi>) upon <hi>meer miſtake.</hi>

                        <p>But it is far otherwiſe with ſenſual delights: As they are <hi>ſinful,</hi> they are <hi>wholly evil:</hi> As they are <hi>natural,</hi> feeding upon the creature alone, they are as <hi>it</hi> is, a mixture of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> Every creature hath its unſuitableneſs and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which it <hi>diſturbeth</hi> even where it <hi>pleaſeth,</hi> and <hi>troubleth</hi> where it <hi>comforteth,</hi> and <hi>fruſtrateth</hi> and <hi>diſappointeth</hi> more then it <hi>ſatisfieth.</hi> The more we <hi>Love it,</hi> uſually the more we <hi>ſuffer</hi> by it.

If they prove <hi>unkind,</hi> it is more grievous then the unkindneſs of many others: If they prove <hi>faithful,</hi> how deeply do we ſuffer with them in all their ſufferings? <hi>Their wants</hi> do pinch us as our own: <hi>Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> are our ſhame: <hi>Their loſſes</hi> take as much from <hi>us:</hi> Their ſickneſs paineth us: Their death half killeth us: And he that is ſo <hi>happy</hi> as to have <hi>many ſuch friends,</hi> is ſo <hi>unhappy</hi> as to have more burdens, fears and griefs to ſuffer, and more deaths to die then other men. But eſpecially to <hi>ungodly men,</hi> theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts are uncomfortable, becauſe <hi>they</hi> have none of the Divine delights that are the <hi>kernel</hi> and the <hi>spirits,</hi> but take up with the <hi>ſhell</hi> or <hi>husk:</hi> And becauſe their mirth is mixt with their own miſery, which conſcience ſometime gripes them for with ſuch deep remorſe as cools their comforts: And ſome <hi>thoughts</hi> of the <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of their pleaſures will be ſtepping in, and ending them before their time: So that the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of <hi>worldly things</hi> ſurpaſſeth the <hi>delight.</hi>

                        <p>4. The <hi>Delights of Holineſs</hi> are <hi>Deep and Solid,</hi> and therefore do <hi>ſtabliſh and corroborate</hi> the <hi>Hearts.</hi> But <hi>ſenſual delights</hi> are like childrens laughter: they are <hi>ſlight,</hi> and <hi>outſide,</hi> and <hi>flitting</hi> and <hi>vain:</hi> As children laugh in one breath, and cry in the next; ſo worldly joys are followed at the heels by ſorrows; For they lie not deep, and fortifie not the heart againſt diſtreſſes, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of faith and holineſs do.</p>
                        <p>5. The <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> are the <hi>gift of God,</hi> and <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> of by him; commanded by his word, and promoted by his promiſes and mercies, and are but the fruits of his Everlaſting

                        <p>But the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ungodly</hi> worldly men are partly <hi>forbidden</hi> and condemned by God, and partly <hi>contradicted</hi> and <hi>confounded,</hi> by his terrible <hi>threatnings,</hi> and the diſcovery of his wrath. <hi>There is no Peace ſaith the Lord, to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 48. 22. &amp; 57. 21. God doth diſown and proteſt againſt their peace. If they will keep it, and make it good, it muſt be againſt his will.

Hear what God ſaith to them in their greateſt pleaſures, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howle for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you: Your riches are corrupted and your garments moath-eaten: Your gold and ſilver is cankred, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eate your fleſh as it were fire: yee have heaped treaſure toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the laſt days:—Yee have lived in pleaſure on earth, and been wanton: Yee have nouriſhed your hearts as in a day of ſlaughter</hi>—] A man would think it ſhould either <hi>Turn them,</hi> or <hi>Torment them,</hi> and fill their hearts with continual horrour, to ſind God thus ſolemnly proteſting againſt their peace, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing them to woe and ſorrows.</p>
                        <p>6. The <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>Godly</hi> are <hi>clean and noble, and honeſt and honourable.</hi> They delight in things of greateſt worth, for which they had their <hi>Natures,</hi> their <hi>Time</hi> and all. But the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſinners</hi> are <hi>baſe and filthy:</hi> They Delight as ſwine in wallowing in the mire: and as the dog to eat his own Vomit, 2. <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 22. They delight to wrong the God that made them, and by whom they live, and to croſs the ends of their lives and mercies; and to <hi>drive away</hi> all <hi>true delights,</hi> and to undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This is the matter of <hi>their</hi> delight.</p>
                        <p>7. The <hi>Devil is a great enemy to the Delights</hi> of Holineſs; which is a ſign that they are excellent. He doth what he can to keep men from the <hi>Holy State,</hi> leſt they ſhould meet with the <hi>Happineſs</hi> that attends it. And if he prevail not <hi>in this</hi> his <hi>chief</hi> deſign, he doth what he can to fill up the lives of believers with <hi>calamities.</hi> All the enemies that he can raiſe up againſt them, ſhall by temptations, ſcorns or injuries, aſſault their comforts; All the ſtorms that he can raiſe ſhall be ſure to fall upon them.

                        <p>8. The <hi>Delights of Holineſs do make us better;</hi> They are ſo far from diſordering the mind, and leading us to ſin, that they compoſe and purifie the mind, and make ſin much more odious to us, then before. No man hates ſin ſo much as he that hath ſeen the pleaſed face of God, and taſted moſt the ſweetneſs of his grace, and tryed the pleaſant paths of life. And therefore it is, that when a believer comes from fervent prayers, or from heavenly conference or meditation, or from hearing the bleſſed word of life, laid open plainly, and applyed powerfully to his ſoul, he would then abhor a temptation to ſenſual delights, if they were ſet before him. Till we loſe the <hi>reliſh</hi> of <hi>Holy things,</hi> and ſuffer our <hi>Delight</hi> in <hi>God</hi> to fade, we are ſeldome taken in the ſnares of any <hi>fleſhly vanities.

Storms may ariſe that may affright us: but how quickly will they all be over? [<hi>Come my people</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 20.) <hi>enter into thy chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee: hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment, untill the indignation be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>And as the momentany ſorrow of the Godly is forgotten in everlaſting Joy, ſo the Joy of the wicked is but for a moment, and is drowned in everlaſting ſorrows. <hi>Job</hi> 20. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. [<hi>Knoweſt thou not this of old, ſince man was placed upon earth, That the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, and the Joy of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is but for a moment? Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet he ſhall periſh for ever like his own dung: They which have ſeen him ſhall ſay, Where is he? He ſhall flie away as a dream, and ſhall not be found: Yea he ſhall be chaſed away as a viſion of the night: the eye alſo which ſaw him, ſhall ſee him no more; neither ſhall his place any more behold him.</hi>] <hi>Job</hi> 21. 12, 13.

                        <p>It would grieve a conſiderate believer to look on a worldly ſenſual gallant, in the midſt of his vain-glory, or any unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in his mirth and pleaſure, and to think where that man will ſhortly be, and how the caſe will be altered with him, and where his ſport and mirth will leave him. As it would ſadden our hearts to <hi>ſee</hi> one of them ſtruck dead in the place, or to ſee the Devil fetch them away, and ſpoil the game; ſo ſhould it grieve us to <hi>fore-ſee</hi> the ſtroak of <hi>death,</hi> and the condemnation of their ſouls to everlaſting miſery. And can that man much value the pleaſure of ungodly men, that doth <hi>fore-ſee this end?</hi> Would you not laugh at him that were a Prince but for a day, and muſt be the ſcorn of the world to morrow? or that would chooſe one day of mirth and pleaſure, though he knew it would fill the reſt of his life with pain and miſery? If folly and ſtupidity were any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it were a wonder that ungodly men can be merry, when their conſciences tell them that they are not ſure to ſtay one hour out of Hell; nor to hold on their mirth till the end of the game: But while they are ſaying, [<hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, eat, drink and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>] they may ſuddenly be told from God, [<hi>Thou fool, this

As the tender flowers and Roſes of the Spring, do fall before the nipping Froſts, and will not live in Winter ſtorms; no more will your fading mirth endure the frowns of God, the face of death, nor ſcarce a <hi>ſerious fore-thought</hi> of the day that you are near. And ſuch matter of horrour is <hi>continually before you,</hi> while you are under the wrath and curſe of God, in a carnal unregenerate ſtate, that you are beholden to folly, ſecurity and ſtupidity for that <hi>eaſe</hi> which hindreth your <hi>everlaſting eaſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that all things conſidered, I muſt ſeriouſly profeſs, that (however the ungodly have ſome pleaſant dreams, and may live a while in careleſneſs and ſtupidity, or fleere in the face, while the beginning of hell is in their conſciences, yet) I muſt judge, that a life of Faith and Holineſs are unſpeakably ſweet, if it were but for this, that they <hi>ſave the Conſcience</hi> from the gripes, and fears, and terrible thoughts, that either ſometime feed on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, or are ready to devour their mirth and them. So ſad and frightful a thing it is, to be unſanctified, and in a ſtate of ſin, that it is an high commendation of the <hi>delights of Holineſs,</hi> that they ſo much <hi>deliver us</hi> from thoſe grievous terrours, and are ſo powerful an Antidote to preſerve the heart from the wickeds pangs and deſperation. Believe it, when <hi>conſcience, death,</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> are the meſſengers to declare your endleſs ſorrows, you will then wiſh, and ten thouſand times wiſh, that you had ſome of the Faith and Holineſs of the Saints, to be a Cordial to your ſinking hearts; and then you would take it as a matter of unſpeakable joy, to be found in ſuch a ſtate as you now count ſad and melancholy. Ask but a <hi>dying man,</hi> whether <hi>fleſhly pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Godlineſs</hi> be the <hi>ſweeter thing? Now</hi> when the deluſions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity are gone, which do men moſt reliſh? and which is it that they would own? By the conſent of all the wiſe men in the world, I may well conclude, that a <hi>Holy life</hi> is <hi>incomparably</hi> the <hi>moſt pleaſant.</hi>

But ſo far as they feel the healthfulneſs of their ſouls, and are conſcious of their ſincerity and upright converſations, they have greater comfort then the world can afford them.</p>
                        <p>4. You muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe Chriſtians that by <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions</hi> are <hi>unacquainted with their own felicity,</hi> and thoſe that better <hi>underſtand their ſtate.</hi> If a man be never ſo holy, and <hi>know it not,</hi> but by temptations is brought to doubt, whether he be not yet in his unſanctified ſtate, no wonder if this man be grieved with theſe fears. But his grief is not becauſe he is <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> but becauſe he is afraid leſt he be <hi>unſanctified.</hi> And this ſhews that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is moſt lovely in his eyes: or elſe why ſhould he be ſo much troubled, when he doth but doubt whether he be Holy or not? If a Rich man by a falſe report ſhould believe that he is rob'd of his goods and treaſure, or that his houſes are burnt, when it is not ſo, he will mourn or be troubled till he know the truth. And will any be ſo fooliſh as to conclude from thence, that Riches are more uncomfortable then beggery? Had you not rather be rich, though for a time you know it not, then to live in certain continual want? If a man that is in <hi>health,</hi> be perſwaded by miſtake that he is in a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> he will be <hi>troubled</hi> by his <hi>miſtake:</hi> But will you thence conclude that <hi>ſickneſs</hi> is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable then <hi>health?</hi> Is it not better to have <hi>health</hi> with thoſe <hi>miſtaken fears,</hi> then to live in <hi>ſickneſs?</hi> Methinks you ſhould rather argue on the contrary ſide, [How ſweet is Health, when the <hi>fear</hi> of loſing it is ſo troubleſom? and how bitter is ſickneſs and death, when the <hi>very fear</hi> of them is ſo grievous?] And ſo you ſhould ſay, [How ſweet is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> when it is ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thoſe that have it, ſo much as to <hi>fear</hi> leſt they have it not? and How miſerable a life is it to be <hi>ungodly,</hi> when it is ſo grievous to the ſervants of Chriſt, even once to <hi>fear</hi> leſt they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly?]</p>

                        <p>5.

They are better that <hi>have a promiſe</hi> of life and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not,</hi> then they that <hi>have none.</hi> But thoſe that know the freeneſs and fulneſs of the promiſe, and ſtudy with all Saints to comprehend what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and heighth, and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18, 19.) do uſe to walk more comfortably according to the riches of that grace wich they do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs.</p>
                        <p>6. Conſider alſo, that moſt of theſe complaining Chriſtians are <hi>glad</hi> that they are in <hi>any meaſure</hi> got out of their former ſtate, and therefore apprehend their cauſe to be <hi>better</hi> then it was <hi>before:</hi> Or elſe they would turn back to the ſtate that <hi>they</hi> were in; which they would not do for all the world.

Yea while they are <hi>troubled</hi> becauſe they doubt of their ſincerity and ſalvation, they are more ſuſtained and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with that <hi>little diſcerning</hi> which they have of their <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> and with their <hi>hopes</hi> of the everlaſting love of God, then they could by all your ſinful pleaſures. Try the moſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected mournful Chriſtian,</hi> whether he would <hi>change ſtates</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> with the beſt and greateſt of the ungodly. The ſoul of man is ſo active and comprehenſive, that it can at once both <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and mourn.</hi> While they mourn for ſin, and feel affliction, believers can have ſome rejoycing taſte of Everlaſting Life.</p>
                        <p>8.

                        <p>9. The Joy of a believer is intimate and ſolid, as I ſaid before, according to the object of it, and not like the fleering of a fool, or the laughter of a child, or the ſenſual mirth that <hi>Solomon</hi> called <hi>Madneſs.</hi> And therefore it is not ſo <hi>diſcernable</hi> to others as carnal mirth is. And therefore you think that the ſervants of Chriſt are void of pleaſure when they have <hi>much more</hi> then <hi>you.</hi> It is little ridiculous accidents and toys that make men <hi>laugh;</hi> but <hi>great things</hi> give us an <hi>inward ſweet content</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> which ſcorns to ſhew it ſelf by <hi>laughter.</hi> And what can be a fitter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſuch <hi>great content,</hi> then to be a member of Chriſt, and an heir of heaven?</p>
                        <p>10. Moreover, this ſorrow of the Godly is but <hi>medicinal,</hi> and a preparative to their <hi>after-Joys:</hi> It doth but work out the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin, which would marr their comforts, and drive them to Chriſt, and fit them to value him, and taſt the ſweetneſs of his love and grace.</p>
                        <p>11. And as it is not the <hi>ſtate and life</hi> of a Chriſtian, but his <hi>faſting days,</hi> or time of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> ſo the <hi>comforts</hi> of the godly ordinarily do far <hi>exceed</hi> their <hi>ſorrows,</hi> at leaſt in <hi>weight,</hi> if not in paſſionate ſenſe. They have their hours of ſweet acceſs to God, and of heavenly meditation, and delightful remembrance of the experiences of his love, and peruſal of his promiſes, and communion with his people; and of the exerciſe of faith, and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59464:196"/>
hope, and love. And with thoſe Chriſtians that have attained ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> theſe <hi>comforting graces</hi> are predominant: and their life is more in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Praiſe,</hi> then in vexatious fears and ſorrows: And it <hi>ſhould be</hi> ſo with all believers: Love is the Heart of the new creature. It is a life of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> that Chriſt calls all his people to; and forbids them all unneceſſary doubts and ſorrows; and keepeth them up ſo ſtrictly from <hi>ſin,</hi> that he may prevent their <hi>ſorrows.</hi> And if you will judge whether <hi>Holineſs</hi> be a pleaſant courſe, you muſt goe to the <hi>preſcript,</hi> and conſider the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of Holineſs, and look at thoſe that live according to the mercies of the Goſpel; and not look at the dejections and ſorrows of thoſe that grieve themſelves by ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the way of Holineſs: as if you would judge that Health is unpleaſant, becauſe you hear a ſick man groan. And yet even theſe weak and mournful Chriſtians uſually have more joy then you. The very <hi>preſervation</hi> of their ſouls from that <hi>deſpair</hi> which ſin would caſt them into if they had not a Chriſt to fly to, and the little taſts of mercy which they have felt, and the revivings that they find between their ſorrows, and the hopes they have of better days, are enough to weigh down all your pleaſures and all their own ſorrows.</p>
                        <p>12. Laſtly, conſider that <hi>this</hi> is not the <hi>life of perfect Joy,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſome ſorrows</hi> will be intermixt. <hi>Comfort</hi> will not be perfect till <hi>Holineſs</hi> be perfect; and till we arrive at the place of <hi>perfect joy.</hi> Whats wanting <hi>now</hi> while we live in a troubleſome malignant world, ſhall ſhortly be made up in the <hi>Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when we have admittance into our <hi>Maſters joy.</hi> And then all the world ſhall be eaſily convinced, whether <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>duty,</hi> a <hi>fleſhly</hi> or or Holy life, hath the greater <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>

And doth not Chriſt command his ſervants alſo to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce?</hi> and <hi>again Rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>always to rejoyce?</hi> Phil. 3. 1. &amp; 4. 4. 1 Theſ. 5. 16. Doth he not command them to live in the moſt delightful works of <hi>Love and Joy</hi> and thankful mention of his mercies? I tell you, if Chriſtians did but live as God requireth them, and by his plenteous mercies doth encourage them to live, they would be the wonder of the world for their exceeding joy; they would triumph as men that are entering into reſt, and make the miſerable ungodly Princes and great ones of the world obſerve their low contemptible condition, and ſee by the comforts of believers, that there are far higher joys then theirs to be attained. Did Chriſtians live as God would have them, according to their dignity and ſelicity, they would make the world admire the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and hopes and comforts that do ſo tranſport them; They would be ſo taken up in the Love and praiſe of their Redeemer, that they would ſcarce have leiſure to obſerve whether they be rich or poor, or to regard the honours or diſhonours of the world. Theſe little things would ſcarce find room in their affection, they would be taken up ſo much with God. If they were ſore with ſcourging, and their feet were in the ſtocks, they would there ſing forth the praiſe of him that hath aſſured them of deliverance and everlaſting joy, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. They would rejoyce in poverty, in diſgrace, in pain, and nothing would be able to overcome their joy. They would pitty the tyrants and ſenſual Epicures that have no ſweeter pleaſures then thoſe that the fleſh and this deceitful world affords. O the joy that believers would have in their ſecret prayers! in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditations! in their holy conference! in their reading of the promiſes! and much more in their publike praiſes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, if they did but follow more fully the conduct of that ſpirit that hath undertaken to be their Comforter! What makes believers ſlight this world, and take all your pleaſures to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their entertainment or regard, but that they have had a taſte of ſweeter things, and by faith are overgrown theſe childiſh vanities? If God and his favour be better then ſuch worms as we; and the heavenly Glory be better then theſe tranſitory toyes, you may well conceive that the believers joy, that is fed by theſe, muſt be greater, (at leaſt in worth and weight) then all the pleaſures of this ſublunary world. If therefore you

                        <p>1. How <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> is the heart that can find more <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in <hi>ſin</hi> than <hi>holineſs?</hi> Is the <hi>creature pleaſant</hi> to thee, and <hi>God unpleaſant?</hi> What a ſhame is this to thy <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and thy <hi>Will?</hi> It proclaimeth thy pernicious <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Impiety.</hi> If thou hadſt no more wit then to be <hi>Pleaſed</hi> more with ſtones then gold, with dung then meat, with ſhameful nakedneſs then cloathing, thou wouldſt not be judged wiſe enough to be left to thy own diſpoſe and government. But the folly which thou doſt manifeſt, is unſpeakably greater. <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is not ſo much worſe then <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> is not ſo much worſe then <hi>Life;</hi> as <hi>ſin</hi> is worſe than <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> than <hi>God.</hi> And is the <hi>Worſt</hi> more <hi>Pleaſant</hi> to thee then the <hi>Beſt?</hi> It is a <hi>fool</hi> indeed, to whom

                           <hi>it is a ſport to do miſchief, Prov.</hi> 10. 23. and ſo <hi>great a miſchief as ſin is:</hi> and yet hath <hi>no delight</hi> in underſtanding, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is not ſeemly for ſuch fools, Prov.</hi> 19. 10.</p>
                        <p>And how <hi>wicked</hi> is that <hi>Heart</hi> as well as <hi>Blind,</hi> that is ſo <hi>averſe</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Holineſs?</hi> Doth not this ſhew thee, 1. The abſence of <hi>Gods</hi> holy image, 2. And the preſence of Satans image upon thy ſoul?</p>
                        <p>Nothing doth more certainly prove what a man is, then the <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>diſplacency</hi> of his <hi>Heart.</hi> If you know what it is in your ſelves or others, that <hi>pleaſeth</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſeth</hi> moſt, you may certainly know whether you have the ſpirit and grace of Chriſt or not. This is the <hi>durable infallible Evidence,</hi> which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhall never be able to invalidate, and which the weakeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians can ſcarce tell how to deny in themſelves: Could they be <hi>more Holy,</hi> it would <hi>pleaſe them better</hi> then to be <hi>more rich:</hi> Could they <hi>believe more,</hi> and <hi>Love God more,</hi> and <hi>truſt him more,</hi> and <hi>obey him better,</hi> it would <hi>pleaſe</hi> them more then if you gave them all the honours of the world: They are never ſo <hi>well pleaſed</hi> with their <hi>own hearts,</hi> as when they find them <hi>neareſt Heaven,</hi> and have <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> and impreſs of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and ſenſe of his preſence. They are never ſo well <hi>pleaſed</hi> with their <hi>lives,</hi> as when they are moſt holy and fruitful, and may fullyeſt be called <hi>A walking with God.</hi> They are never ſo much diſpleaſed with themſelves, as when they find <hi>leaſt of God</hi> upon their hearts, and are moſt <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>undiſpoſed</hi> to holy Communion with him. They are never ſo much <hi>weary of themſelves,</hi> as when their lives are leaſt fruitful, holy and exact. And this is a <hi>certain Evidence</hi> of their ſincerty: For it ſhews <hi>what they Love,</hi> and what it is that hath their <hi>Hearts</hi> or <hi>Wills.</hi> And it is the <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> that is the <hi>man,</hi> in Gods account. God takes a man to <hi>be</hi> what he ſincerely <hi>would be.</hi> As <hi>he is,</hi> ſo he <hi>Loveth</hi> and <hi>Willeth:</hi> and as he <hi>Loveth</hi> and <hi>Willeth,</hi> ſuch <hi>he is.</hi> His <hi>complacency</hi> or <hi>diſplacency</hi> are the <hi>immediate ſure</hi> diſcoveries of his <hi>bent</hi> or <hi>inclination:</hi> This <hi>certain Evidence</hi> poor doubting ſouls ſhould have oft recourſe to, and improve.</p>
                        <p>And on the contrary, it is as ſure an Evidence of your miſery, when you <hi>ſavour not the things of the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7. and when it <hi>pleaſeth</hi> you more to be <hi>great,</hi> then to be <hi>good;</hi> to be <hi>rich,</hi> then to be <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>righteous;</hi> to ſerve your <hi>luſts,</hi> then to ſerve the Lord: When you ſet more by the <hi>applauſe</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> then

                        <p>Didſt thou <hi>know</hi> God as Faith doth know him, his <hi>Loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> would be <hi>better</hi> to thee <hi>then life it ſelf, Pſalm</hi> 63. 3. If thou didſt <hi>Love him</hi> (as it is like thou wilt pretend thou doſt) it would be meat and drink to thee, to enjoy his Love, and do his Will. And if thou <hi>know</hi> him not by <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>cleaveſt</hi> to him by unfeigned <hi>Love,</hi> how canſt thou pretend to have his Image?</p>
                        <p>How would you judge of that mans heart, that were no better affected to his friend, to his parents, or children, or other relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then you manifeſt your ſelves to be to God? If he can take <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in the company of his wife or children, but is glad when he is far from them, in the company of ſtrangers, or harlots, or prodigals, would you not ſay this man had a baſe unmanly diſpoſition? Expreſs but ſuch an inclination in plain words, and try how honeſt ſober men will judge of them. Much more would it be odious to Chriſtian ears, if you ſhould tell God plainly, [We can find no pleaſure in thee, or in thy holy wayes; thy Word and Service are unſavoury and weariſom unto us: We had rather be talking or buſied about the matters of the world: We have far more pleaſure in recreations and ſenſual accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, then in remembring thee and thy Kingdom, and then we find in the life that is called holy.] Would not ſuch <hi>words</hi> as <hi>theſe</hi> be called <hi>impious,</hi> by every Chriſtian that ſhould hear them? And is not that an <hi>impious heart</hi> then, which ſpeaketh thus, or is thus affected, and that an <hi>impious life</hi> that manifeſteth it? though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling lips are aſhamed to profeſs it?</p>
                        <p>If God be not moſt to be loved and delighted in, then any thing

or all things elſe, he is not God. If Heaven and Holineſs be not ſweeter then all the pleaſures of earth and ſin, let them have no more ſuch honourable names. Let <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> then be called <hi>Heaven;</hi> but wo to them that have no better.</p>
                        <p>2. What <hi>monſtrous ingratitude</hi> is that man guilty of, that when <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>provided,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>purchaſed</hi> ſuch high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and freely tendred them to unworthy ſinners, will ſay, I find no pleaſure in them, and take them for no delights at all? When the Lord beheld thee wallowing in thy filth, and laughing in thy miſery, and making a ſport of thine own perdition, he pittied thee, and provided and offered to thee the moſt noble and excellent delights, that thy nature is capable of enjoying: And wilt thou caſt them back unthankfully in his face, and ſay, They are unpleaſant tedious things? If your child did ſo by his meat or cloathes, yea or a beggar at your door did ſo by his alms, you would think it proved his great unworthyneſs: If he throw away the beſt you can give him, and ſay, [It is naught, there is no ſweetneſs in it] would you not think it fit that <hi>want</hi> ſhould help to mend his <hi>relliſh,</hi> and cure his ingratitude? And will you do ſo your ſelves by Chriſt and Holineſs, and ſay as thoſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>What a wearineſs is it?</hi> Take heed leſt you provoke the Lord to caſt you into a ſtate in which you ſhall have more cauſe to be aweary. If you are weary of reading, and praying, and hearing, and other holy exerciſes, and weary of heart-ſearching, penitent meditations, will you not be <hi>wearyer</hi> of <hi>Hell-fire,</hi> and of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous reviews of this your folly, and of the endleſs, eaſeleſs, remedileſs ſenſe of the wrath of God, and gripes of your own ſelf-tormenting conſciences!

                        <p>3. <hi>Will you have any pleaſure at all, or will you have none?</hi> If <hi>any, in what</hi> then will you place it, and <hi>whence</hi> will you expect it, if not from God in a holy life? If <hi>God</hi> be thy <hi>trouble,</hi> what then is fit to be thy <hi>delight?</hi> Dareſt thou ſay in thy heart or with thy tongue, that ſin and ſenſuality is better?

In the works of Nature, (and ſometimes of Art) the <hi>outſide</hi> is ſo far from ſhewing you the excellencies, that it is but a comely vaile to <hi>hide</hi> them.

But yet they live ſo far below the ſweet delights which they might partake of, and ſo far below the proviſions of their Fathers houſe, and the riches of the Goſpel, that they have cauſe to <hi>lament</hi> their <hi>exceſſive lamentations,</hi> and more cauſe to <hi>reform</hi> this ſad diſtemper, and no cauſe to indulge it, as uſually ſuch do. And though with the moſt of them ſome natural paſſions and weakneſſes, and ſome melancholy diſtempers are ſo much the cauſe, as may much excuſe them, yet becauſe it is an evil which <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>diſowned,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt be the <hi>means,</hi> where people have the <hi>free uſe</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> I ſhall lay down ſome of the great inconveniences of this ſad diſtemper, and beſeech thoſe that tender the honour of God, and would do that which is moſt pleaſing to him, and love not their own calamity, that they will ſoberly conſider of what I ſay, and labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their minds accordingly.</p>
                        <p>1. I deſire the dejected Chriſtian to conſider, <hi>that by his heavy and uncomfortable life, he ſeemeth to the world to accuſe God and his ſervice,</hi> as <hi>if he</hi> openly called him a rigorous, hard, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable maſter, and his work a ſad unpleaſant thing. I know this is not your thoughts: I know it is <hi>your ſelves</hi> and not <hi>God</hi> and his ſervice that offendeth you; and that you walk not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily becauſe you <hi>are holy,</hi> but becauſe you <hi>fear</hi> you <hi>are not</hi> holy, and becauſe you are <hi>no more holy:</hi> I know it is not <hi>of grace,</hi> but <hi>for grace</hi> that you complain. But do you not give too great <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to ignorant ſpectators to judge otherwiſe? If you ſee a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant alwayes ſad, that was wont to be merry while he ſerved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maſter, will you not think that he hath a maſter that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth him? If you ſee a woman live in continual heavyneſs ever ſince ſhe was marryed, that lived merrily before, will you not think that ſhe hath met with an unpleaſing match? You are <hi>born</hi> and <hi>new born</hi> for Gods honour: and will you thus <hi>diſhonour</hi>
                           <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59464:206"/>
him before the world? What do you (in their eyes) but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe him by your very countenance and carriage, while you walk before him in ſo much heavineſs! The child that ſtill cryes when you put on his <hi>ſhoes,</hi> doth ſignifie that they <hi>pinch</hi> him: and he diſpraiſeth his <hi>meat</hi> that makes a <hi>ſower face</hi> at it: And he diſpraiſeth his <hi>friend,</hi> that is alway ſad and troubled in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany! He that ſhould <hi>ſay</hi> of God [<hi>Thou art bad, or cruel and unmerciful</hi>] ſhould blaſpheme. And ſo would he that ſaith of Holineſs [<hi>It is a bad, unpleaſant, hurtful ſtate.</hi>] How then dare you <hi>do</hi> that which is ſo <hi>like</hi> to ſuch blaſpheming? when you ſhould abſtain from all appearance of evil? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22. Canſt thou find in thy heart thus to diſhonour and wrong the God whom thou ſo much eſteemeſt, and the grace which thou ſo much deſireſt? For a wicked man that is far from God, to go heavily or roar in the horrour of his ſoul, is a ſhame to his <hi>ſin,</hi> but no <hi>diſhonour</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> But for <hi>you</hi> that are near him, in relation, engagement, and attendance, to walk ſo heavily, reflects on him to whom you are Related, and from whom you look for your Reward.</p>
                        <p>2. Conſider alſo, <hi>What a lamentable hinderance you are hereby to the converſion and ſalvation of ſouls?</hi> Your countenances and ſad complainings do affright men from the ſervice of the Lord, and as it were call to them, to keep off and fly from the way that you find ſo grievous. You gratifie Satan, the enemy of Chriſt, and Holineſs, and ſouls, and become his inſtruments (though againſt your wills) to <hi>affright</hi> men from the way of life. As the Papiſts keep their deluded Proſelytes abroad from <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> by giving them odious deſcriptions of the Proteſtants, as if they were Hereticks, proud, frantick, mad, and ſcarcely men, and when they burn them, they adorn them with pictures of the Devil; even ſo doth Satan keep poor ſouls from entertaining Chriſt and Truth, and entering the holy pathes, by making them believe that the ſervants of Chriſt are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of diſtempered melancholy ſouls, and that Godlineſs is the way to make men mad; and that he that will ſet his heart on Heaven, muſt never look more for a merry comfortable life on earth. Hence comes the proverb of the Malignant Formaliſts and Prophane, that <hi>A Puritane is a Proteſtant frightened out of his wits.</hi> And will you <hi>confirm</hi> this ſlander of the Devil and his inſtruments? Will you entice men to believe him? Will you
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59464:207"/>
make your ſelves ſuch pictures of unhappineſs? and wear ſuch a Vizor of calamity and miſery, as ſhall frighten all that look on you and obſerve you, and diſcourage them from the way which they ſee accompanyed with ſo much ſorrow? As you hang up <hi>dead crows</hi> in your <hi>field</hi> to <hi>frighten</hi> the reſt from the <hi>Corn,</hi> and as <hi>murderers</hi> are hanged in irons to terrifie all that ſee them from that crime, or as the heads of Traytors are ſet up to the ſame end, as proclaiming to all paſſengers, [<hi>Thus muſt you be uſed if you will do as they:</hi>] Juſt ſo would Satan fill you with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and overwhelm you with grief, and diſtract you with cauſeleſs doubts and fears, that you may appear to the world a miſerable ſort of people; and then all that look on you will be afraid of Godlineſs, and think they ſee it as it were written in your fore-heads, [<hi>Such drooping pittiful creatures muſt all be, that will lead ſo preciſe and heavenly a life.</hi>] Do you think your carnal neighbours and acquaintance will not be deterred from a holy life, when they ſee that ſince you turned to it, you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but complain, and droop, and mourn, as if you were worſe then you were before? And was it not enough that you hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their converſion <hi>before,</hi> when you were in your ignorance and ſin, by your wicked examples and encouragements, but you muſt hinder it <hi>ſtill</hi> by your dejected diſcouraging countenances and converſations? Yea perhaps your later exceſſive troubles may do <hi>more</hi> to hinder their converſion, then your perſwaſions and examples did before. And can you find in your hearts to lay ſuch a ſtombling block as this in the way of your miſerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to keep them from ſalvation? Will it not grieve you to think that you ſhould have ſo great a hand in mens damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even ſince you are returned to God your ſelves? I know by your ſorrows and complaints, that the perdition of a ſoul is no ſmall matter in your eyes: O therefore take heed of that which may procure it. The uſe that Satan would have you make of <hi>theſe very words</hi> is, to go away with more dejection, and to ſay, [<hi>What a wretch am I? even unmeet to live, that by my griefs am not only miſerable my ſelf, but alſo hinder the ſalvation of others:</hi>] And thus he would draw thee to grieve over all thy <hi>griefs</hi> again, and becauſe thou haſt <hi>exceeded</hi> in thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, to be <hi>more exceſſive:</hi> and ſo to add one ſin unto another; and to <hi>do more,</hi> becauſe you have done <hi>too much:</hi>

                        <p>But on the other ſide, if thou couldſt live a heavenly joyful life, that the glory of thy hopes might appear in thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thy conference and converſation, how many might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be drawn to Chriſt, and cauſed to think well of the ways of God? Did the Godly but exceed the reſt of the world, in <hi>holy joy</hi> and <hi>cheerfulneſs</hi> of mind, as much as they exceed them in happineſs and in the <hi>cauſes</hi> of true joy, what an honour would it be to Chriſt and holineſs? and what an attractive to win the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant to embrace the motions of ſalvation? How eaſily would they let go their ſinful pleaſures, their gluttony, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and filthineſs, and gaming, if they did but ſee by the <hi>carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> of believers, that they were like to exchange them for <hi>much greater joys?</hi> You cannot expect that ignorant men, that never tryed a holy life, and have a natural enmity againſt it, ſhould ſee the excellency of it immediately in it ſelf; But they will judge of Religion by the perſons that profeſs it: <hi>That</hi> ſhall ſeem to them the beſt Religion, that hath the beſt and happieſt profeſſors: And thoſe ſeem to them the happieſt and beſt, that have the greateſt comforts, and conquer moſt the troubles of their minds. You can expect no other, but that countrey people, that know not the nature of medicines themſelves, ſhould judge of them by the ſucceſs, and think that he followeth the beſt advice, who is moſt healthful, and of longeſt life. And ſo will the ignorant judge of the holy doctrine and commands of God, by the lives of thoſe that ſeem to follow them. O therefore behave your ſelves in the Church of God, as thoſe that remember, that they live in the preſence of a world of men, whoſe happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery hath much dependance on your lives. If you were <hi>debating</hi> the caſe with a ſenſual wretch, would you not <hi>tell him</hi> that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a ſtate of greater pleaſure then his ſin? <hi>Tell him</hi> ſo then by your <hi>example</hi> as well as by your <hi>words:</hi> Let him <hi>ſee</hi> as well as <hi>hear</hi> of the confidence and comforts of true believers. Were Chriſtianity <hi>exemplified</hi> in the lives of Chriſtians, how excellent a ſtate would it appear? were we but ſuch as the holy doctrine

and Chriſtian pattern requireth us to be, even the blind malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous world would be forced to admire the attainments of the Saints: Though they might hate them, yet they would admire them. Were we ſuch as <hi>Stephen,</hi> that was full of faith and of the Holy Ghoſt, and could ſtedfaſtly look up to heaven by faith, and ſee there the Glory of the living God, and Jeſus ſtanding at his right hand, till we were raiſed to his boldneſs in defence of the truth, and his quiet ſubmiſſion to the greateſt ſufferings, the world would not then be able to reſiſt the wiſdom and ſpirit by which we ſpeak, but the faces of believers would ſometime ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the terrour of their perſecutors, as the faces of Angels; as <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5, 10, 15. &amp; 7. 51, 55, 56, 60. They are high and glorious things that are aſſured to us in the promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.

Even as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himſelf when he ſaw the Miraculous guift of the Holy Ghoſt, would fain have bought that guift with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; ſo men that are yet carnal, in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of their iniquities, will yet ſee a deſirable excellency in the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, and wiſh they were partakers of ſuch joys, though yet they are unacquainted with the way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>

He that ſhall be <hi>ſhortly</hi> ſo <hi>full of joy,</hi> ſhould not be <hi>empty now</hi> when he remembreth what he muſt ſhortly be. Doth it beſeem him now to dwell in grief, and refuſe conſolation, that muſt in a few dayes be ſwallowed up with Joy? If thou that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt here in heavineſs, wert aſſured that ſhortly thou ſhouldſt be with Chriſt, and made a bleſſed companion of Angels, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of thy Maſters joy, a joy that hath no bounds or end, would not thy Conſcience then tell thee, that thou greatly wrongeſt ſuch abundant mercy, in that thou art no more affected with it? and that thy want of joy doth expreſs thy too much want of thankfulneſs. Doſt thou ſit there like a child of God, and like an heir of Heaven, and a co-heire with Chriſt? (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 17.) Doth that ſorrowful heart, and that dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance become one that muſt live with Chriſt for ever, in ſuch reſplendent glory as thou muſt do? and that hath but a few more dayes to live, till thou take poſſeſſion of theſe endleſs joyes? The Lord pardon and heal our unbelief. Did Faith more effectually play its part, as it is the evidence of things not ſeen, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the veil, and ſhew us, though but in a glaſs, the glory which we muſt ſee with open face, it would be wine to our hearts, and oyl to our countenances, and make our poverty, ſickneſs and death, more comfortable then the wealth, and health, and life of the ungodly.</p>
                        <p>I know you will ſay ſtill, that you <hi>could rejoyce if you were ſure all this were yours: but when you rather think you have no part in it, it can be but ſmall comfort to you.</hi>

I am <hi>ſure</hi> they <hi>are</hi> yours, or <hi>may be if you will:</hi> and nothing but your continued refuſal can deprive you of them. For this is the very tenor of the promiſe: And if you will not have Chriſt and his offered benefits, why do you ſo diſſemble as to take on you to mourn becauſe you have them not? But if you are <hi>willing,</hi> they are yours.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this account you will <hi>never</hi> rejoyce till you come to Heaven; for you will never be free from ſin and ſuffering till then. Nay it ſeems you would have no man elſe rejoyce, and ſo would baniſh all comfort from the world: For there is <hi>no man</hi> without ſin and ſuffering.</p>
                        <p>But what can there be of any weight to prohibit a ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever from ſeaſonable ſpiritual rejoycing? Have you <hi>ſin?</hi> It is not groſs and reigning ſin: And ſinful infirmities, the beſt of the Saints on earth have had.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59464:211"/>
and ſhall live in everlaſting reſt, where affliction ſhall be known no more. Is it poſſible for that man that hath the love of God, and ſhall have heaven for ever, to have any ſufferings that ſhould weigh down <hi>theſe,</hi> and be matter to him of greater ſorrow then this of joy? Can you imagine that there is more evil in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and ſufferings, then there is good in God, and happineſs in Heaven? Is it reaſon and equity that you ſhould look at <hi>ſin</hi> only, and not at <hi>grace?</hi> and at what you <hi>want only,</hi> and not at what you <hi>have received?</hi> Seeing you have more cauſe of joy then ſorrow, ſhould you not diſtribute your affections propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably as there is cauſe? I diſſwade you not from <hi>ſeaſonable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſorrows:</hi> But ſhould not <hi>your joy</hi> be <hi>much greater,</hi> as long as the cauſe of it is much greater?</p>
                        <p>4. And here I would intreate you to conſider well of the <hi>tenour of Gods commands concerning this matter in the Goſpel, and of the examples of the Saints there left on record:</hi> And then tell me, <hi>which courſe it is that God is beſt pleaſed with.</hi> Your <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> or your <hi>dejected</hi> courſe of life: I find that though I <hi>pitty</hi> the <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> yet I had rather my ſelf have a <hi>chearful,</hi> then a <hi>drooping, grieving, troubled</hi> companion and friend: Becauſe I deſire one ſuitable to my ſelf in the ſtate I <hi>would</hi> be in; and I <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in the <hi>welfare,</hi> and not in the diſtreſs and miſery of my friend. And ſurely God that is Love it ſelf, and hath created Joy in man to be his Happineſs, and hath placed ſo much of miſery in <hi>ſorrow,</hi> can never be ſo delighted in our <hi>diſtreſs</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> as in our <hi>content</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi> As he hath ſworn that he takes no pleaſure in the <hi>death of the wicked,</hi> but rather that they <hi>repent and live;</hi> ſo we may boldly conclude that he takes <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in the <hi>anguiſh</hi> and <hi>dejectedneſs</hi> of his children, but rather that they walk in Love and chearful Obedience before him. But his Word will fully and plainly tell you, what temper it is that is moſt pleaſing to him. It is a <hi>light and eaſie burden</hi> that Chriſt doth call us to bear; and it is his office to <hi>eaſe us</hi> and <hi>give us reſt</hi> that <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> with <hi>burdens</hi> of our own. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29.

                        <p>And take notice throughout all the Scripture, whether you find the ſervants of God ſo much complaining of their want of aſſurance, and of their frequent doubtings of their own ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and his love. I think you will find this a very rare thing in the ancient Saints. They were ſenſible of <hi>ſin</hi> as well as we; and they were as ſenſible of Gods afflicting hand, and oft (as <hi>Job, David, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c.) complained under it, perhaps with ſome exceſs, and too much queſtioning Gods favour to them as if he had forſaken them. But (beſides and without any ſuch affliction) to live in ordinary trouble of mind through the doubting of their ſincerity, and of Gods ſpecial love, and to be exerciſed in the complaining and diſconſolate way as now abundance of Chriſtians are, this I find little of the Scripture Saints. The reaſon was not becauſe <hi>they</hi> had <hi>more holineſs</hi> and <hi>leſs ſin</hi> than many that <hi>now</hi> are thus <hi>caſt down:</hi> For the Goſpel
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59464:213"/>
time excelleth theirs in <hi>degrees of grace;</hi> and I think the <hi>greater care</hi> that Chriſtians have of their hearts, and of inward recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and communion with God, and their <hi>fuller</hi> apprehenſions of the <hi>life to come,</hi> and ſo of their <hi>greateſt hopes and dangers,</hi> is one great cauſe. But yet there are worſe concurring cauſes. The Love of God, and his readineſs to ſhew mercy, ſhould not be more queſtioned now, when it is ſo abundantly revealed by Chriſt, then it was in times of darker revelation. The ſervants of God did formerly conceive, that nothing but <hi>ſin</hi> could make man miſerable; and therefore when they had <hi>ſinned,</hi> they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>continuing doubts</hi> and fears, they bent their <hi>reſolutions</hi> againſt their <hi>ſins;</hi> and having <hi>caſt away</hi> their <hi>groſs and wilful ſins,</hi> and <hi>continuing</hi> the <hi>conflict</hi> againſt their <hi>unavoidable infirmities,</hi> which they <hi>hated,</hi> they knew that the door of mercy was ſtill open to them; and that <hi>if any man ſin, we have an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father, who is the propitiation.</hi> The time that is now ſpent in <hi>doubting</hi> and complaining, and asking How ſhall I know that I ſincerely repent, was then ſpent in <hi>Repenting,</hi> and <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and uſing the means that God hath appointed for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering</hi> of ſin; and then truſting to his grace and Covenant in the blood of Chriſt for pardon. And it would be <hi>better</hi> with us if we did thus. Judge now by all theſe Scriptures, and by the courſe of former Saints, how God would have you behave your ſelves. Do you not read an hundred times of their <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>thanks,</hi> and <hi>praiſing God,</hi> and calling upon others to praiſe him, for once that they perplexedly queſtion their ſincerity?</p>

                        <p>5.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Your reſemblance of the Saints in Heaven, muſt be <hi>propertionable</hi> in <hi>all the parts.</hi> You muſt labour firſt to be as like them as you can in <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and then in <hi>Joy.</hi> If you could be as far from <hi>ſin</hi> as they, you need not mourn at all.

                        <p>2. And it is ſuch a regular contrition, conſiſting in humble thoughts of our ſelves, and tending to reſtore us from our falls and ſorrows, unto our <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> which God delighteth in: And it is ſuch mourners as theſe, and ſuch as ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake from men, that Chriſt pronounceth bleſſed: But the inordinate troubles of the ſoul, that exclude a holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, though he pardon, yet he never doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage.</p>

                           <hi>Fears,</hi> and this will not prove an upright heart. But when once we <hi>Believe Everlaſting Glory,</hi> and <hi>Love Chriſt as our Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Father as our Father</hi> and <hi>felicity,</hi> and <hi>Love a holy frame of heart and life,</hi> as the image of God and that which pleaſeth him, then our obedience will be chearful and delightful, unleſs <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> we trouble our ſelves by our own miſtakes. If you can truly make God and his will and ſervice your <hi>Delight,</hi> you may be ſure you <hi>Love him,</hi> and are <hi>beloved by him,</hi> as being paſt the ſtate of ſlaviſh fear.</p>
                        <p>2. And I have ſhewed you that <hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is it ſelf <hi>one part</hi> of that grace in which Gods Kingdom doth conſiſt; Though not ſuch a part as a Chriſtian cannot poſſibly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,

And when all theſe are laid aſide, how poor and lean a ſervice is it, that is left you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him?

                        <p>7. Are you not aſhamed to ſee the ſervants of the Devil and the world ſo jocund, and your ſelves ſo ſad that ſerve the Lord? Will you go mourning ſo inordinately to <hi>Heaven,</hi> when <hi>others</hi> go ſo merrily to <hi>Hell?</hi> Will you credit Satan and Sin ſo much, as to perſwade men by your practice, that ſin affordeth more pleaſure and content then Holineſs?</p>
                        <p>8. You <hi>could live merrily your ſelves before your Converſion, while you ſerved ſin:</hi> And will you <hi>walk ſo dejectedly now</hi> you have <hi>repented of it?</hi> As if you had changed for the <hi>worſe,</hi> or would make <hi>men think ſo?</hi> I know you would not for all the world be what you were before your change. Why then do you live as if you were more miſerable then before?</p>

                           <pb n="372" facs="tcp:59464:215"/>9. You <hi>would be loth ſo long to reſiſt the ſanctifying work of the Spirit:</hi> And why ſhould you not be loth to <hi>reſiſt its comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work?</hi> It is the <hi>ſame Holy Ghoſt</hi> that you reſiſt in both: Nay you dare not ſo open your mouthes for <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and plead <hi>againſt Sanctification it ſelf,</hi> as you open them on the behalf of your <hi>ſinful doubtings,</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> for your <hi>immoderate dejections.</hi> If you ſhould, how vile would you appear?</p>
                        <p>10. Laſtly conſider, that <hi>God will lay ſufferings enow upon you for your ſins,</hi> and ſuffer <hi>wicked men</hi> to <hi>lay enow on you for well doing,</hi> and you need not lay <hi>more</hi> upon <hi>your ſelves.</hi> You have need to uſe all means for <hi>ſtrength</hi> to bear the burdens that you <hi>muſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo: and it is <hi>the joy of the Lord,</hi> and the hopes of Glory that are your <hi>ſtrength.</hi> And will you caſt away the only ſupports of your ſoul, and ſink when the day of ſuffering comes? How will you bear poverty, or reproach, or injuries? how will you meet approaching death, if you feed your doubts of your ſalvation and of the Love of God in Chriſt, which muſt corroborate you? O weaken not your ſouls that are too weak already: Weaken not your ſouls that have ſo much to do and ſuffer: and that of ſo great neceſſity and importance. While you complain of your weakneſs, encreaſe it not by unbelieving uncomfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Gratifie not the Devil and wicked malicious men ſo far, as to inflict on your ſelves a greater calamity then all their malice and power could inflict. It is a madneſs in them that will <hi>pleaſe</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> to the <hi>diſpleaſing of God,</hi> though the <hi>pleaſing of their own fleſh</hi> be it that moveth them to it. But for a man to <hi>pleaſe</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſe God,</hi> even when he <hi>diſpleaſeth his own fleſh</hi> by it alſo, and bringeth nothing but <hi>ſorrow</hi> to <hi>himſelf</hi> by it, this is in ſome reſpects more unreaſonable then madneſs it ſelf. Many caſt away their ſouls for <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> and carnal accommodations; but who would do it for <hi>poverty, ſickneſs,</hi> or <hi>diſgrace?</hi> So though many undo their ſouls for fleſhly pleaſures and delights; yet he is a ſtrange man indeed that will offend God even for <hi>ſelf-tormenting grief</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi> O therefore dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as you have let go all your ſenſual pleaſures for the pleaſing of your Lord, do not let go the pleaſures of his love, for which you have let go all. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in his people, even in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy, and the meek he will beautifie with ſalvation, Pſalm</hi> 147. 11. It is meet therefore
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59464:215"/>
that his people take pleaſure in the Lord: that the <hi>Saints be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in glory; that they ſing aloud upon their beds, and that the high praiſes of God be in their mouthes, Pſalm</hi> 149. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                        <p>O let not the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> be thought to be like the <hi>evil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> that vexed <hi>Saul,</hi> that filled his mind with melancholy anguiſh and confuſion: It is the evil ſpirit that renteth and tormenteth thoſe that it poſſeſſeth; though the ſpirit of God doth <hi>humble,</hi> and by ordinate ſorrow prepare for joy: But its proper work is to <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> and to <hi>comfort,</hi> and to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> the Believer with <hi>Peace</hi> that <hi>paſſeth underſtanding.</hi> As it is a greater ſign of the operation of the Spirit of Chriſt, to reſtore the lapſed by a <hi>ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and to <hi>bear one anothers burdens,</hi> and exerciſe tenderneſs, compaſſion and charity, then to <hi>cenſure</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> and call for <hi>fire from heaven:</hi> So even <hi>at home</hi> (though there we are allowed to be more rigid and cenſorious) it is a more ſure and ſatisfactory diſcovery of the Spirit of Grace within us, if we are raiſed to a ſweet <hi>delight</hi> in God, and quieted in his <hi>Love,</hi> and carryed out in chearful obedience, thankfully acknowledging the grace that we have received, and waiting in the uſe of means for more, then if we are only <hi>turmoiled</hi> and <hi>troubled</hi> in our minds, and toſſed up and down with <hi>unprofitable griefs</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> that <hi>abate our Love to God,</hi> and our holy joyes. It is the <hi>ſtill voice</hi> that doth moſt fully acquaint us that it is Chriſt the Prince of Peace that speaketh to us: Though at firſt when he findeth a ſinner in a ſtate of enmity and rebellion, he often uſeth to thunder and lighten, and call to him as to <hi>Saul, [Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>] Wilt thou <hi>kick againſt the pricks?</hi> Wilt thou fight againſt heaven? Or canſt thou bear the wrath of God Almighty? Yet to the <hi>humbled penitent</hi> ſoul, there is none in all the world ſo tender as Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb of God, the Churches husband, that cheriſheth them as his own fleſh. O that you did but know the greatneſs and tenderneſs of his love to you, while you lie trembling under the unjuſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his wrath! It would then ſo tranſport you with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing delights, that the world would ſee that the Saints of the moſt High have higher Pleaſures then the world afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

I therefore deſire and require you to practiſe theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Direct. 1. Make it your firſt and principal buſineſs to attain the fulleſt fixed knowledge of God in his Attributes, and Covenant-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to you.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>1. Study him in his <hi>Attributes.</hi> If <hi>infinite Goodneſs</hi> take not up the ſoul with Love and with Delight, it is becauſe it is <hi>not known.</hi> Where there is all things that the ſoul of man deſires to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt felicity and content, and yet <hi>contentment</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> is <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> it muſt needs be ignorance and diſtance that is the cauſe. If the Sun ſeem not light to you, it is becauſe you have not eye-ſight, or <hi>look</hi> not on the light. If you find <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in the moſt <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant food,</hi> it is becauſe your <hi>appetites</hi> are diſeaſed, or you do not taſte it. If your moſt ſuitable and moſt affectionate friend ſeem not <hi>amiable</hi> to you, it is becauſe you <hi>know not</hi> his ſuitableneſs and love. So if the <hi>eternal God,</hi> that is infinitely powerful, wiſe and good, moſt perfect and moſt ſuitable to your higheſt affections, do not poſſeſs you with abundant Pleaſures and Delights of Love, it is becauſe you are <hi>unacquainted</hi> with him. Study then his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perfections: and be much with him in ſecret prayer and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, where the retired ſoul having feweſt avocations, is fitteſt for the moſt near familiar converſe. And ſtill <hi>remember</hi> that it is <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf that you have to do with. For <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Love.</hi> It is the fountain of all delights and pleaſures that you draw near to. It is a <hi>cold</hi> heart indeed that <hi>fire</hi> it ſelf cannot warm: and a <hi>dead</hi> heart indeed that <hi>life</hi> it ſelf cannot revive: Conceive of God <hi>as God,</hi> and you will <hi>delight</hi> in him: Abhort all unworthy diminutive
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59464:216"/>
thoughts of him: Set up his Love and Goodneſs in your eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as infinitely above all the creatures. Believe it, the Love of your deareſt friends, is an inconſiderable <hi>drop</hi> to the Ocean of his Love. Think not of him as <hi>cruel,</hi> or an <hi>enemy,</hi> if you would <hi>love him,</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> in him. <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> are never <hi>forced</hi> by <hi>bare commands</hi> and <hi>threatnings,</hi> but drawn forth <hi>magnetically</hi> by <hi>attractive Goodneſs.</hi> Were not God moſt amiable, and friendly, and deſirable to us, it is not ſaying, [<hi>Love me, or I will damn thee,</hi>] that would ever have cauſed man to love him; but rather to <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> and fly from him. Think but of Gods <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> as you do of his <hi>Power,</hi> and then you will find that there are <hi>rivers of pleaſure in his preſence, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy at his right hand,</hi> the fore-taſtes whereof are the only delights that can quiet the troubled thirſty ſoul.</p>
                        <p>2. And if you ſay, [<hi>What is all this to me, any more then to the ungodly world, on whom the wrath of God abideth?</hi>] I anſwer, Thou art in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, and he is <hi>thine</hi> in the <hi>Covenant Relations,</hi> even thy <hi>Reconciled Father, thy Saviour and thy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier.</hi> No husband is ſo inviolably bound to a wife, nor will ſo faithfully anſwer his Relation, as the bleſſed Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier unto thee. Didſt thou well know and conſider, what it is to have God himſelf to be thine in Covenant, to all theſe uſes, and to all the ends that thou canſt reaſonably deſire, it would fill up thy ſoul with ſatisfying delights.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing that thou wanteſt, but what belongs to God to give thee, in one of theſe three great relations. And ſooner ſhall the day be turned into night, and the frame of nature be diſſolved, then God will violate his Covenant of Grace. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 20, 21. [<hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, If you can break my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of the night, and that there ſhould not be day and night in their ſeaſon: then may alſo my Covenant be broken,</hi> &amp;c.] Iſa. 54. 4. 5, &amp;c. [<hi>Fear not; for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For thy Maker is thy Husband: (the Lord of Hoſts is his name) and thy Redeemer, the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called: For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forſaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when when thou waſt refuſed, ſaith thy God: For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee: In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Nay if any other ſhould aſſault you, be ſo far from taking them for your duty or religion, as to reſiſt them, and lament them as your ſin. That is true and ſaving Humiliation, 1. which makes you vile in your own eyes, and loath your ſelves for ſin. 2. And maketh you more deſirous to be delivered and cleanſed from your ſin, than to live in it, how ſweet or gainful ſoever it may ſeem, and 3. which maketh you ſet more by a Saviour to deliver you, than by all the pleaſures, riches, and honours of the world. What ever want of <hi>Grief</hi> or <hi>tears</hi> you find, if you have <hi>theſe ſigns,</hi> your Repentance and <hi>humiliation</hi> is ſincere. Do not therefore refuſe your <hi>Peace</hi> becauſe you have not greater <hi>ſorrows;</hi> nor diſturb your ſouls by ſtrugling for exceſſive ſorrow: Take not part with them, but do your beſt to caſt them out, if they are ſuch as would <hi>deſtroy your Love and Joy,</hi> and drive you from Chriſt, and hinder your Thanſgivings. Know that the <hi>Life</hi> of your Religion conſiſteth in the <hi>Holy Love of God</hi> and of his Image and ſervants and holy ways. <hi>Love</hi> is your duty and your <hi>felicity</hi> and reward: Therefore let all tend to the exerciſe of <hi>Love,</hi> and value moſt thoſe means which moſt promote it; and think your ſelves beſt when you abound moſt in <hi>Love;</hi> and not when you are overwhelmed with thoſe <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Griefs</hi> which hinder Love.
