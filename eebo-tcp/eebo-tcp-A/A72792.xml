            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the right honourable the Lords of his Maieſties moſt honourable priuy Councell, hauing taken care to reforme many abuſes that haue of late crept into this City and places adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the exceſſiue number of Tauernes, and the eractions v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the immoderate prices of all ſorts of prouiſions in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries and Hoſteries: and finding that the ſaid abuſe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in nothing more than in the exceſſiue rates of Poultry of all ſorts, being ſo vnreaſonably enhaunſed by Poulterers and Higlers, that it is not onely an intolerable grieuance to his Maieſties Subiects, but the inconuenience thereof doth alſo deepely reflect vpon his Maieſties houſhold. Haue ſignified the expreſſe Command of his Maieſty That the Lord Mayor and his brethren, the Aldermen, ſhould enter into ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that particular grieuance, as a thing altogether vnſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſhould ſet ſuch prices as they ſhould conceiue to be fit for all ſmall Acates and other prouiſions, and to ſet vp the ſame in publike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tables to the end that both Buyer and Seller may take notice thereof: and alſo ſhould vary them from time to time as they ſhall finde iuſt cauſe. In obedience whereunto, the ſaid Lord Mayor, by the aduice of the ſaid Aldermen, for remedy and reformation thereof, hath, vpon mature deliberation, ſet ſuch rates and prices as ſeeme meete and reaſonable to be giuen and paid for all ſorts of Poultry and other ſmall Acates, to be ſold within this City and Liberties thereof, and hath commanded the ſame rates to be publiſhed and ſet vp in Tables, to the end and intent that all and euery perſon and perſons may thereby haue cleare knowledge and vnderſtanding what the Poulterers and all other perſon and perſons ought iuſtly to demand or take of them for their Poultry, vended as aforeſaid. Streightly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and commanding euery of the ſaid Poulterers and others, as aforeſaid, that they or any of them do not at any time or times hereafter demand, require or take any more or greater price for their ſaid Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than is aſſeſſed and rated as aforeſaid: And that no manner of perſon or perſons doe in any wiſe pay more than after the ſame rates. And alſo, that euery perſon do obey and keep aſwell the ſaid prices, as all other prices that ſhall from time to time hereafter be ſet and appointed by the ſaid Lord Mayor for any prouiſion of Victuall whatſoeuer, vpon pain of ſuch puniſhment to be inflicted vpon the Tranſgreſſors, as according to the lawes, and their deſerts ſhall bee thought meete and requiſite. Prouided alwayes, that all manner of perſons may from time to time buy Poultry at leſſer and lower prices, as they can furniſh themſelues.</p>
