            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and hope you are willing in respect of
your syncere piety, to convince our errours by
the light of Gods word, if any where we erre
out of the way. Secondly, that this testimony of
Christian faith, if you also fynd it to agree with
the word of truth, may by you be approved, eyther
in silence or by writing, as you shal think best.</p>
            <p>It may be, we shal be thought very bold, that
being despised of all, yet doubted not to sollicite
you so many and so great learned men. But
this we did, partly at the request of others to
whom we would not deny it; partly with desire

to have the truth through your help more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
&amp; furder spread abroad; partly constrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our exile &amp; other calamities almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;

            <p>IT may seem strange vnto thee (Christian

to forsake their native country, &amp; live
in exile, especially in these dayes when the
Gospel seemeth to have free passage &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

exile ben hardly thought of by many, and

as heretickes, or Schismatickes at the least.
Yea some (and such as worst might) have
sought the increase of our afflictions, even
here also if they could: which thing they
have both secretly and openly attempted.
This hath Sathan added vnto all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

end our lives by violent death or most
miserable imprisonment, as many of our
brethren before vs have done. For so great
is the malice and power of those Romysh
Priests, that they persecute vnto death such

Christians as they cast into their noysome
prysons, can seldome or never get out
(except with shipwrack of conscience) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they be caryed forth vpon the Bere.
Neyther is there any care taken for their
relief in this case: but being cast into pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
there they are deteyned without any
alloweance of meat or money for their
mayntenance, be their want and poverty
never so great. If they have any thing of
their own, there they are driven to spend
it vp: if they have nothing, there they
are left by the Prelates to feed on the
ayre. And that they may more readily
be sterved, or weakened in the truth, they
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly shut vp in close pryson, their
frends &amp; acquayntance being not suffred

and their Instruments: whose hard

vnderstand (gentle Reader) as many of
vs haue felt and to this day yet feel, it
would make thy hart to bleed, considering
their vnmercyfull and barbarous dealing.
And how many soules haue perished in
their prisons through miserable vsage, how
many have ben put to death, and how many
banished, though we could to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
infamy relate to all the world, yet wil
we not blaze abroad their acts (for we

submit our selves, no not for a moment.

his <hi>lawes, Priesthood, Hierarchie, &amp; traditions,</hi>
which the Lord never allowed, &amp; which
never entred into his heart: yea which he
hath so severely forbidden, with fearfull
judgments threatned vnto all that shal so
do.</p>
            <p>But because we have ben very grievously
