            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeek not the patronage of any one in eſteem of the world; no <hi>courting</hi> Lord,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5. Chap. 1 4. Rom. 8.17. Luke 12.32.

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of my appearing in this matter ſo publikely is onely and alone the glory of God, the love I bear to Religion, and the benifit of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That which occaſioned my ſetting upon this work, was partly the importunity of ſome <hi>friends,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114823:3"/>
who greatly deſired it, together with an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that lay upon me to do it, for the ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion (in this point) of ſome friends in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>But the firſt and primary occaſion did ariſe as followeth; you may remember that I was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially caſt amongſt you at <hi>Cranbrook</hi> at your generall Aſſembling there <hi>July</hi> 21. 1652. where you did appoint me with ſome others, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give ſatisfaction touching ſome points in Religion that were queſtioned by ſome; to which end and purpoſe we did meet on the ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the ſame moneth at <hi>Yalding</hi> about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which when we were aſſembled, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, this fell in as the matter moſt in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>viz. falling from Grace:</hi> whereupon there was two <hi>Poſitions</hi> ſtated, the one by me, and the other by the other party: the poſition ſtated by me was, <hi>That Believers in Christ may fall away.</hi> The poſition ſtated by them was, <hi>That Juſtified perſons cannot fall totally nor finally from the grace of union with the Lord Jeſus:</hi> the proof was taken on their part in order to their affirmation: they framed thirteen Arguments, eight of which were anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time, but night coming on we brake up, with this concluſion, <hi>that I ſhould anſwer them in writing and give the reaſons of my concluſion</hi>: which I have endeavoured to do in this following Treatiſe, to the end that it might extend to the ſatisfaction of all who are doubtfull in it, and for the confirmation of thoſe who have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it: let it therefore intreat your loving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
<pb facs="tcp:114823:3"/>
and ſerious peruſall, weigh it in the ballance of the Sanctuarie, if it prove weighty and ſatisfactory give God the glory. I had not been ſo forward but for theſe two reaſons, firſt, becauſe I ſee few write touching this point. Secondly, becauſe I judge it is a point very uſefull for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to be acquainted with, that they may know by what they ſtand <hi>viz.</hi> faith, and what need they have, eſpecially in theſe perilous times, to keep cloſe unto God, in that way that he hath taught by his Son, ſure it is, that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire we ſhould ſo doe: we ſee daily how many there are that do turn their backs upon the way of God, yea and tread his Son under foot, <hi>and hath counted the bloud of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite unto the Spirit of grace.</hi> What may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that many ſo do, is it not as much in this as any one thing, <hi>that they ſuppoſe they cannot fall</hi>? and by that means grow careleſſe and ſecure, high minded and the like, being puffed up with conceitedneſſe touching their own parts, ſtrength and opinions, and ſo grow heedleſſe, and ſlight the means, denying Ordinances, the word, yea, and Chriſt himſelf at laſt, as too too many have done in this age, I believe ſome not unknown to you: for I cannot ſee but that the doctrine of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to fall</hi> doth lead to the taking away of the very power of Religion, and godlineſſe, yea and Church-government and diſcipline: for what ſhall we need any more religion then to get into Chriſt, if nothing, when we are once in
<pb facs="tcp:114823:4"/>
him, can ſeperate us from him, no not <hi>ſin,</hi> as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; what ſhall we need to walk under the ſtrict rule of Diſcipline if that doctrine be true?</p>
            <p>But I hope you <hi>have otherwiſe learned Chriſt</hi>: therefore my dear Brethren <hi>be ſteadfast, unmova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord, for your labour is not in vain in the Lord, hold faſt that you have, that no man take your crown: now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepheard of the ſheep, though the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfit in every good work to doe his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever, amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is the hearty deſire of your brother in the faith of our dear and precious Lord, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth himſelf willing to ſerve you and all the Churches of Chriſt, in all ſervices of love,</p>

            <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20. of <hi>Acts</hi> calleth the Elders of the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> together <hi>v.</hi> 17. and in the 28. <hi>v.</hi> he exhorteth them to take heed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to all the Flock <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here the choſen or Elect Elders, choſen of God and purchaſed by his blood <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. are commanded to take heed to themſelves, and to the Flock: why what is the matter? why after <hi>Pauls</hi> departure ſhall grievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wolves enter in not ſparing the Flock, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114823:6"/>
of their own ſelves men ſhall ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them, therefore they muſt watch, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30, 31. or elſe they may be deceived or drawn away: therefore Chriſt ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>beware of falſe Prophets &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 7 15. yea and <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle 3.17. exhorteth them that have like precious faith, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.1. to beware ſaying, <hi>leaſt ye alſo being led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſſe:</hi> Juſtified perſons may fall, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by falſe Prophets, elſe how uſeleſſe were theſe ſayings of Chriſt and his ſervants unto us in theſe and many more places of Scripture? this premiſed. Now to the Argument; and firſt let me inquire whether by the Elect is intended ſuch as <hi>Paul,</hi> who had fought a good fight, who had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his courſe, who kept the faith? it ſuch, I grant an impoſſibility of being ſeduced by falſe Prophets. But if by Elect be meant ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> in his warfare. The Minor propoſition is denied, <hi>viz.</hi> that they cannot fall away nor be ſeduced: for <hi>Paul</hi> having kept the faith, could ſay, <hi>hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 4.8. But in his warfare he ſaith other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>I therefore ſo run not as uncertainly: ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, least that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſtaway,</hi> 1 Cor. 26, 27. thus much to the Argument: now to the text from whence the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is drawn, I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſuch as keep the faith are the Elect, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114823:7"/>
ſhall not be deceived by falſe Prophets and falſe Chriſts, although they ſhould come with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe in them that periſh, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. thoſe that doe wickedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Covenant, ſhall be corrupt by flatteries: but the people that know their God, ſhall be ſtrong, and do exploits. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.32. They that give diligence to make their calling and election ſure, in ſo doing ſhall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the word Elect is ſometimes meant Iſrael after the fleſh; for they are called the choſen of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. yet notwithſtanding becauſe of unbelief they were cut off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. yet not for ever; for he is able to graffe them in again <hi>v.</hi> 23. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 24. God will not forget the Covenant made with them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 31. to 34. There ſhall come a deliverer out of Syon that ſhal turn ungodlineſſe from <hi>Jacob, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 11.26. though as concerning the Goſpel they are enemies for your ſakes; yet as touching the election they are beloved for the Fathers ſake, <hi>v.</hi> 28. although they are now deceived, yet then it ſhall be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to deceive them; for they ſhal ſee him whom they have pierced and mourn, <hi>&amp;c. Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by Elect ſometimes is meant Jeſus Chriſt, for he is the very Elect: behold ſaith God my ſervant, mine elect in whom my ſoul delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42.1. he is the chief corner ſtone, Elect, precious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 2.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.42. he ſaith the Lord ſhall not fail nor be diſcouraged, <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114823:7"/>
42.4. he is the beloved <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6 neither falſe Prophets, nor falſe Chriſts ſhall deceive him, it is impoſſible, for the Lord hath ſaid he ſhall not fail nor be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>Now if by the Elect be meant either ſuch as keep the faith, or Iſrael as to their future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Chriſt; I grant an impoſſibility of their being deceived: but if by elect it be the ſence of the Opponent that believers in their warfaring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate cannot fall, and that to be the ſence of this text, it is a thing I want proof of, which till I have I muſt deny as beforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument is taken from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love of God towards his people <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Arg. <hi>Though there is unconstancy in the creature, yet in the firſt of</hi> Pet. 1.5. <hi>We are kept by the power of God: and least that keeping ſhould be for a little while, he tells you it is an inheritance that fadeth not away, Rom.</hi> 8.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſtrength of this Argument lyeth in two particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods unchangeableneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in believers being kept by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore to the unchangeableneſſe of God, I grant that he changeth not, and yet it doth not follow but juſtified perſons may fall totally and finally, For</p>
            <p>Union and ſalvation are conditional.</p>
            <p>Firſt their entrance into it is conditional; he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mark</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114823:8"/>
16.16. being juſtifyed by faith &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. if by faith they are juſtifyed then not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, he that believeth not is condemned <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay we are juſtified before in Gods account.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, then we were his people in his account alſo, without or before believing, which to ſay were to contradict the Scripture 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. which in time paſt were not a people, yet are now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, which were not under mercy, but now have obtained mercy <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.23. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia</hi> were in Chriſt before him <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith if we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſſe we ly and do not the truth 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. and again, He that ſaith he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a lyar and the truth is not in him <hi>ch.</hi> 7.4. by all which appears that we are not the juſtifyed ones, neither have we union with Chriſt, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and doing his commandements, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are continued in union with Chriſt on condition of believing and perſevering in the doing the will of God and not without: this the word of God doth teach us in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>For we are made partakers of Chriſt: [<hi>mark</hi>] if we hold faſt the beginning of our confidence ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt to the end <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114823:8"/>
that Chriſt hath reconciled them in the body of his fleſh through death to preſent them holy, and unblameably and unreprovable in his ſight, if ye continue in the faith, grounded and ſettled, and be not mov'd away from the hope of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which ye have heard <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21.22.23. mark, they then ſhall be preſented holy, unreprovable, unblameable: upon what terms? why if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue &amp;c. and ſo ſaith the Spirit unto the Angells of the Church in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give the Crown of life <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. and ſo unto the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations, verſe 25, 26.27. he that overcometh the ſame ſhall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white raiment, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confeſſe his name before my father, and before his holy Angels, cha. 2 5. our Lord Chriſt ſaith in the fifteenth of <hi>John</hi> the ſecond, every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: ſome branches in Chriſt may become fruitleſſe and ſo taken away by the Father; ſo the Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> ſaith, that which beareth thornes and bryers is rejected and is nigh unto curſing <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8.</p>
            <p>By this which hath been ſaid it appears that we have no union with Chriſt but by believing and doing the will of God, and that union with Chriſt is continued by perſevering in doing the will of God and not otherwiſe: God having promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eternal life upon no other terms. Now this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered we may plainly ſee that although perſons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114823:9"/>
which have union with Chriſt may fall from it by not holding faſt unto the end: yet God never the more changeable becauſe juſtification, union and ſalvation, are conditionall, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: God hath bound himſelf (as I may ſay) to give life to overcomming Saints: but if any man draw back his ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. he hath promiſed his bleſſing unto fruitfull branches in Chriſt: but fruitleſſe ones he will take away <hi>John</hi> 15.2.3.</p>
            <p>So much to the Argument. Now to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures alleged.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. the ſuppoſed ſtrength which is in this text, lyeth in theſe words, <hi>No weapon formed againſt them ſhall proſper.</hi> Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine now, who it ſhall not proſper againſt: why ſaith the Lord, this is the heritage of the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: now the Lords ſervants are they that ſtill overcome, againſt whom no weapon ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; not they that fight for a time and are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at laſt; let not him that girdeth on his armor, boaſt himſelf as he that putteth it off, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.11. in ſerving the Lord, we have a promiſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, who is it that will harm you if you be followers of that which is good 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. ſo that this doth not prove but that believers may fall and ſo ceaſe to be what they were, and God not engaged in promiſe unto them, for he ſaith <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. but when the righteous man turneth away from his righteouſneſſe and committeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and doth according to all the abomination
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114823:9"/>
that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live, all his righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in his treſpaſſe that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned, in them he ſhall dy &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, this is a promiſe made unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of, and concerning their being eſtabliſhed in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe after their ſcattering and rejection for their not receiving Chriſt; for it relates to Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Covenant with them, in which Covenant they ſhall all be taught of God, ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 13. and all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the peace of thy children (but not a promiſe made to any in the time of their warfare without the condition of ſtanding faſt, taking heed, overcoming, and the like, for otherwiſe there be weapons, <hi>viz</hi> the firy darts of Satan, and the like may and do proſper againſt many, and we no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the contrary) which proves that God one day will look upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though now toſſed and afflicted, and turn ungodlyneſſe from <hi>Jacob,</hi> in which day, or at which time, no weapon formed againſt him ſhall proſper, for the Lord will aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly eſtabliſh <hi>Iſrael</hi> a people before him, therfore this text doth not ſo much as ſeem to prove the thing it is brought for.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place alleged is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1. they that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot be moved, but abideth for ever, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I grant as before that perſons that truſt in the Lord, ſhall be (as Mount <hi>Sion)</hi> unmovable, ſo long as they continue truſting in him: but ſome that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114823:10"/>
truſt in the Lord may let go their confidence, as hath been ſhewed: yea ſome have ſo done <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 12.13. thus ſaith the Lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity: and are become vain: be aſtoniſhed oh ye heavens at this: and be horribly afraid, be ye very deſolate ſaith the Lord, for my people have committed two evills, they have forſaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out <hi>Ciſterns,</hi> broken <hi>Cisterns</hi> that will hold no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The laſt place is <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.1.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of which place lyeth in theſe words, I will be a God of all the Families of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and they ſhall be my people.</p>
            <p>We muſt have reſpect in this place to two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt to the perſons <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly to the time when, that is after thoſe daies, or the daies comming <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.31. <hi>Heb..</hi> 10 which is the time God will make a covenant with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the performance of which Covenant God will eſtabliſh Iſrael in righteouſneſs, although now they are ſeperated from him they are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cut off, but they ſhall be grafted in again, and then ſhall they be his people, and he will be their God, and he will make an everlaſting covenant with them; that he will never turn away from them to do them good; but he will put his fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32., and let not any ſay, that although it be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114823:10"/>
not yet performed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet it is performed to believers.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, then believers may not teach every man his neighbour, ſaying, know the Lord, for the covenant ſaith, they ſhall not teach them after thoſe daies, ſo, they ſhall not depart from him after thoſe daies, for then he will write his law in their hearts, they ſhall all know the Lord from the leaſt unto the greateſt of them: And moreover believers now may fall, as hath been ſhewed, which the ſpirit hath likewiſe expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that in the latter daies men ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits &amp; doctrines of devils 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. but then they ſhall not; and therefore thoſe daies there ſpoken of are not yet come.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Scriptures which are here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: or rather the ſuppoſed ſtrength in them tending to the proof of the affirmation, is taken away and removed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, Gods keeping Juſtifyed perſons by his power: the places alledged is 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30.</p>
            <p>Unto which place in <hi>Peter</hi> I thus anſwer, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle takes an occaſion to bleſſe God, for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant mercy by which they were begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, in the fourth verſe he tells them to what they were begotten, <hi>viz.</hi> to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, and undefiled, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerved in the heavens, for you <hi>ver</hi> 5. who are kept by the power of God through
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114823:11"/>
faith to ſalvation; mark I pray, here are two things conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the inheritance is for thoſe who are kept by the power of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly the power God keepeth, or beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by, it is not a forcible or compulſive power, as ſome ſuppoſeth, but the powerful means that he uſeth as to both: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. but we preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jewes a ſtumbling ſtone, and unto the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſſe, but unto them that are called both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> we preach (for ſo it is impli'd) Chriſt the power of God &amp; the wiſdom of God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 23, 24. hence it is (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with inticing words of mens wiſdome: but in the demonſtration of the ſpirit, and power chap. 2.4. the word of God is powerful &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. hence it is ſaid, we are begotten with the word <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18 being born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain not of corruptible ſeed, but by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. ſo that the word or Goſpel, is the powerful means by which we are begotten to a lively hope: ſo likewiſe is it the powerfull means by which they that are begotten are kept, and ſo are ſaid to be kept by his power: for it is the word by which they muſt grow, as new born babes deſiring the ſincere milk of the word that they may grow thereby 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. all Scripture is given by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114823:11"/>
reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe [mark] that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6.17, this powerful word the Scripture ſaith is of this tendancy, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the man of God, <hi>Paul</hi> therefore labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word <hi>Col.</hi> 28.29. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. and again, thy word is a lamp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my feet, and a light unto my pathes <hi>ver.</hi> 105. thus you ſee what it is by which we are kept, <hi>viz.</hi> his word, it is Gods power, or powerful means by which he keeps thoſe that are kept. Now there is an inheritance reſerved in the heavens for them that are kept by this word (by his power) and do not turn from his commandments, as ſome do 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 19.20.26. who ſo deſpiſeth the word ſhall be deſtroyed, he that feareth the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſhall be rewarded <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.13. therefore as the fire devoureth the ſtubble, and the flame conſumeth the chaff, ſo their root ſhall be rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their bloſſome ſall go up as duſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have caſt away the law of the Lord of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled againſt his people &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.24.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. men that deſpiſe the word, diſpiſe the power of God. as hath been ſhewed, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is through faith, this power keepes us, as <hi>Peter</hi> there ſaith 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. but ſome do not mix the word with faith, and ſo are not kept by the power of God, for it is through faith, and not without faith &amp;c, now they that fall from the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114823:12"/>
faith, (as hath been ſhewed ſome do) are not kept by the power of God (for unto us was the word preached as well as unto them; but the word preached, did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.) and ſo conſequently they may fall from the grace of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord Jeſus, buy diſpiſing the growing word 1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 2.2. which is the power of God, by which he keepeth men through faith to ſalvation &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third Argument followeth.</p>
            <p>Arg. 3. <hi>The ſame perſons that are predesſtinated, the ſame are called, they that are called, the ſame are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, the ſame that are justified the ſame are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, therefore called perſons cannot fall away becauſe they ſhall be glorifyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us firſt (for anſwer to this Argument) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the text with the coherence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. in the twenty ninth verſe, the ſpirit of God ſaith, whom he did foreknow he did alſo predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein take notice of two things,</p>
            <p>Firſt Gods foreknowledge,</p>
            <p>Secondly, what they that are foreknown are predeſtinated unto.</p>
            <p>Let us examine whether God doth not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know all men, yea ſure no man nor no thing can be hid from his eyes: ſhall we conclude then that all men are predeſtinated, no, but rather that God did foreknow ſome men in Chriſt, by or through faith, and obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.2. <hi>Theſſ,</hi> 2.13. <hi>Eph,</hi> 1.4. and theſe that are ſo known or foreknown in Chriſt by believing, he doth approve of, for ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114823:12"/>
is the knowledge of God to be underſtood, if not he muſt of neceſſity be concluded, to foreknow all men even the wicked, with this foreknowledge mentioned in this text, and then it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that all men are predeſtinated (which will not be granted) for thoſe he doth foreknow, in the ſenſe of this text, even all of them he predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
            <p>Again Chriſt at the laſt day is ſaid not to know ſome <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.25. <hi>and then will I profeſſe unto them I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> what did not Chriſt know them? what he that made them, not know them? <hi>John</hi> 1.7. O no! he knew them not, they were workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he did not know them, i. e. he did not approve of them, nor their works, therfore faith he, depart from me, by this we may ſee who God foreknoweth, they are believers, workers of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. and who he did never know (ſo as to approve of them) even workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>Believers then are the foreknown of God, in the ſence of this text, and no others, as for others he knoweth not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.25. now whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate, <hi>viz.</hi> believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be conformable to the image of Chriſt <hi>Ephs</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. moreover whom he did prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, them he alſo called to this conformity to Chriſts image, therefore ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, firſt ch. and fifteenth ver. <hi>but as he that hath called you is holy, ſo be you holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, I therefore the priſoner of the Lord beſeech
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114823:13"/>
you that ye walk worthy of the vocation where with you are called, &amp;c</hi> chap. 1.4. <hi>for God hath not called us</hi> (viz. believers) <hi>to uncleanneſſe: but to holineſſe</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.7.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe that are the called according to Gods purpoſe (that is ſuch as walk worthy of his calling by making their calling and election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.) he alſo juſtifies, and them he alſo glorifies: that is, ſuch as indure to the end they ſhall be ſaved, and glorified, yea and they only, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But ſaith the Argument, <hi>Called perſons cannot fall away, becauſe they ſhall be glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure this concluſion is to large, if by called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be meant all called perſons: for the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 22.18. ſome that are called comes ſhort of glory, for want of walking worthy of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for ſome turn the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe; and ſome that are righteous or juſtified may be condemned, for their non-continuance in the workes of righteouſneſſe, as appears <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21 therefore all that are called are not glorified: but ſuch onely who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and immortality, eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. So much for that argument. Now to the fourth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>Arg.</hi> Is ſtated thus: <hi>In the</hi> 4. John 14. <hi>he tels us it is a living fountain that can never be dryed up. Grace as it is a creature, might doe as others might doe; but becauſe the fountain doth ſtrive to maintain the ſtreams, therefore it cannot be dried up. Therefore &amp;c,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114823:13"/>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> How little this is to the purpoſe may be eaſily ſeen, for our controverſie is not about the fountain, whether that may be dryed, or no: but whether believers may not fal away from their fountain, unleſſe it be concluded that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz</hi> believers be the fountain, which cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Chriſt is that fountain <note place="margin">Jer. 2.5. Zack. 13.1.</note> my people, ſaith the Lord, have committed two evils, they, have forſaken me the fountain of living water, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the text alleged ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water which I ſhall give him ſhall never thirst,</hi>

            <p>But ſaith the Argument, <hi>The fountain striveth to maintain the ſtreams, therefore it cannot be dryed up &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Wells may become dry that once had water in them by forſaking the fountain.</hi> And thus in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſſolved alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Arg. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note>The fift Argument is ſtated upon the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lord Jeſus as appears in the 17. of <hi>John</hi> he making prayers that his father would keep them; and Chriſt was heard in the prayer that was made: therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of this Argument lyeth in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was heard in the prayer that he made.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>Which is granted, and yet I deny that believers cannot fall totally for this reaſon.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Chriſt in his prayers hath reſpect to ſomething or other, and doth not pray abſolutely or poſitively that ſo it muſt be, and no otherwiſe, as for example.</p>
            <p>Chriſt prayed that the cup ſhould paſſe from him, but he prayed as having reſpect to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114823:14"/>
will, not my will, but thy will: now if we ſhould conclude, that his prayer was poſſitive, that ſo it muſt be, then he was not heard; for the Cup did not paſſe from him: but he praying with reſpect and ſubmiſſion to his fathers will, he was heard, inaſmuch as the Will of God concerning him was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt prayed for the world, that they might know him: Now,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.21 23.</note> if Chriſts prayer had been abſolute, without reſpect to this or that, then they muſt know him, and believe in him, which to doe is life eternall. verſ. 3. Chriſt therefore in his prayer had reſpect to the meanes, by which they ſhould come to know him, which if the means were uſed by them, the end might be effected in them; for the meanes was of this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and every way correſpondent, as to the bringing them even all the world to the knowledg of Chriſt: in which Chriſt was heard: for ſuch meanes God hath afforded the world, that would accompliſh the end, did they not put it from them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt prayed that the <hi>Jewes</hi> who crucified him ſhould be forgiven.<note place="margin">Luke 23.24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now, It Chriſt here had been abſolute and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, <hi>viz.</hi> it muſt be ſo without reſpect to this or that, then it ſhould have been ſo; <hi>viz.</hi> they ſhould be forgiven, and then they could not have been cut off, for not receiving Chriſt, becauſe their ſinne was forgiven: Chriſt therefore in this prayer muſt be underſtood to have reſpect to the way, in which forgiveneſs was promiſed unto

them,<note place="margin">Act. 2.39.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> repentance, faith and baptiſme; in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, they, to wit, ſo many as did repent of their ſheding the innocent blood, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly baptized, did receive forgiveneſs, as Chriſt had prayed they ſhould; but as for the reſt, all the blood that was ſhed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.35.</note> unto the blood of <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſhall be upon them, yea, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood of Chriſt alſo, which they deſired might be on them and their Children.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27.25.</note>Now to come cloſe to the argument, Chriſt prayeth for his Diſciples, that they ſhould be kept from the evill of the world, in which he is heard. I grant, conſidering his prayer (as before) to have reſpect to their abiding in him, by keeping his commandements; for, he ſaith. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14.15.16.</note> 
               <hi>and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with you forever:</hi> Chriſt in this prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not abſolute, that is to ſay, they are my Diſciples, thou haſt given them me, and now I pray thee to keep them although they doe not keep my Commandements; but this prayer is with reſpect to their abiding in him, which if they doe (as ſome have not done that were in him) they have the benefit of his prayer, but if otherwiſe, they have no benefit thereof, no more then they that doe never believe in him, have the benefit of his interceſſion, but are cut off as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull branches from the Vine: therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding Chriſt doth pray for them, it doth not follow but that believers may fall totally and finally.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:114823:15"/>
               <hi>If neither ſinne, nor ſuffering can ſeperate us from the Lord, then nothing can ſeperate us,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore nothing can. Only Firſt, we grant that the Saints of God may fall away from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace, from the ſtrength of faith, to a weake faith, to ſome meaſure of hardneſſe of heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we grant they may fall from the com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the Spirit, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.2.8.12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From common gifts of the Spirit, as a Spirit of government as <hi>Saul</hi> did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Argument hath a large latitude,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and muſt in part be denyd <hi>viz.</hi> ſin unrepented of may ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, unfruitfulneſſe and ſuch like, hath a cutting off following it. Therefore upon examination, we ſhall find that this will not prove the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſuppoſe, that it will not be owned that <hi>Paul</hi> doth intend here denying Chriſt, or any ſinne unrepented of, for that may ſeperate <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.12 Mat. 10.33.</note> 
               <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him, if we deny him, he will alſo deny us:</hi> [yea we] I <hi>Paul</hi> and thou <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> if we deny him, he will alſo deny us; for ſo he himſelf ſaid, <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 12.8. chap. 9 26.

               <hi>But whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Apoſtle doth not ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.39.</note> that ſin ſhall not ſeperate, and therefore the argument is ſtretched beyond what the Text will prove, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think the 33. ver. had been more pertinent to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114823:16"/>
the busineſs, where the Apoſtle makes this holy challenge, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? &amp;c.</hi> Now to know who are the Elect of God will be the ſolution of this matter (for which I refer you to my anſwer to the firſt argument) thoſe that are called according to Gods purpoſe, ver. 28. who they are ſee my anſwer to the third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? they that make their Calling and Election ſure, by adding to their faith, virtue, &amp;c. <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to their charge, it is God that justifies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, Who ſhall ſeperate them that ſo do? no thing, nor no man can <note n="b)" place="margin">Joh. 10.28.</note> no nor none of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> tribulation or diſtreſs, or perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or famine, or nakedneſs, or perill, or ſword, nay, in all theſe things, they are more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, through him that loved them; but this doth not prove, but that perſons in Chriſt may fal and be ſeperated from Chriſt, by denying Chriſt, although none of theſe can, if they be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them, to forſake and deny him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the queſtion is, whether perſons in Chriſt may hot be overcome by theſe?</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now leaſt they ſhould complain that their temptations were great, and ſo if they did fall they were ſomething excuſable, he tels them, that there hath no temptation taken them, but ſuch as was common to man, and therefore they muſt look to it: and beſides, <hi>God is faithfull who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear: but will with the temptation alſo make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to eſcape,</hi> that you may be able to bear it; <hi>wherefore</hi> (ſeeing it is ſo) <hi>my deerly beloved flee from Idolatry</hi>: for if you do not, God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw you as he did them.</p>
            <p>Thus may you ſee that this text is far from proving that Saints cannot fall: but doth plainly prove they may.

be overcome by ſuffering, if they did not take heed unto themſelves: or elſe needleſſe were theſe ſayings; for if they could not be deceived and ſo fall, they had no need to take heed? where there is no danger there needs no caution: theſe Scriptures with many others of like import, may be croſſed out of our Bibles if there be no danger of falling from the faith; Chriſt tels his Diſciples that they are the <hi>Salt of the earth,</hi>

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:114823:25"/>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> fore-telleth, that many ſhall be deceived, and drawn away by men ſpeaking perverſe things,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.5.</note> and made merchandize of by falſe teachers,<note place="margin">Act. 10.29.30. 2 Pet. 2.1, 2 3.-1.1-3.17.

               <p>The third reaſon is, becauſe ſome have fallen <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> away from the faith, <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy to war a good warfare, holding faith and a good conſcience,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.15 17.18. 1 Tim. 5.15.

               <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>that faith they fell from was not a true faith but a ſeeming faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer if that were ſo, <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Hemeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> great wrong, for he delivered them to Satan, now if they did but ſeem to have faith, but had no true faith, then when they fell they were better then when they ſtood, becauſe when they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114823:26"/>
ſtood they ſeemed to be what they were not, but when they fell they appeared to be what indeed they were, now if <hi>Paul</hi> delivered them to Satan for falling from a ſeeming faith, he ſurely did them wrong, <hi>viz.</hi> they were delivered to Satan for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling plainly, which they did when they fell, but were diſſemblers when they ſtood at the beſt, if they had but a ſeeming faith, which is none, &amp; how they could make ſhipwrack of that they never had is a paradox to me.</p>
               <p>Again, it was a true faith, no ſeeming faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which they made ſhipwrack of, the ſame he exhorts Timothy to hold, <hi>holding faith and a good conſcience, which ſome having put away,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the ſame faith the one muſt hold (which cannot be denyed but it was a true faith) that the other put away: which if the ſame, it muſt needs be as true, therefore no ſeeming faith.</p>
               <p>Again, they that fall from the faith, are ſaid to depart from the living God: now it is contrary to all reaſon to ſay, they do depart from him, who never were with him: and that which brings perſons to God can be no ſeeming faith but a true faith, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. therefore that faith that is fallen from in departing from the living God, muſt be a true faith.</p>
               <p>Again, that faith which is accompanied with a good conſcience is a true faith.</p>
               <p>But the faith which <hi>Hemeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> made ſhipwrack of was accompanied with a good conſcience (<hi>holding faith and a good conſcience which ſome having put away, viz.</hi> faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.)</p>
