            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I haue not yet bin seauen daies heere, and yet I see
that grieues my very soule: my Daughters, my Ladies
I must say now, make lust, labour for their maintenance, &amp;
this foolish natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil sel their goods, their lands, nay their
very soules for nights delights and momentarie sportes,
<pb facs="tcp:17788:10"/>
which like to lightning appeares, and vanisheth ere one
can say tis come: but then repentance sticks close. There
was a fellow with one of my Ladies this morning, and the
poore slaue has but seauen shillings a weeke boord wages,
and yet he has giuen sixe on't for a bit of extraordinarye
flesh, well: God giue him the grace to pray, for a must fast.
I askd the hot slaue why a did not marrie since a could not
bridle his lust? and a tolde me a had rather fal into the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
mercy, then the worldes beggery; well, I see it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denide, mercinarie women are necessarie members:
they plucke downe the pride of the flesh, yet are not proud
themselues, for thei'le be as familiar with the men as with
the Master: they doe as many good deedes as some Fryers
that puts one to pennance for his sinnes, they put twentie
to paines: he out of charitie sends one to the Hospital once
a yeare, they send twentie to the Surgions once a month.
Say he bids men repent, they make a'm repent, yet for all
this some will call a'm damn'd Puncks: well, if they bee
damn'd, theile not be damn'd <hi>gratis</hi> like your yong cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie
Gentlemen, nor in hugger mugger like your Citizens
wife with her Prentise. They can practise without an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseer:
they scorne to haue a Suburbian Baw'd lend am a
Taffaty gown, &amp; they (like your common Players) let men
come in for two pence a peece, and yet themselues to haue
but the tenth penny, like the tenth Pigge, yet faith
the trade is a good trade: They for sweare not themselues,
in commendation of their wares, as your common Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
doe, swearing they cannot afford it at the price. They
are no prouerb breakers: beware the buyer say they, you
shall haue enough for your money, if halfe will not serue
your turne take the whole, measure by your own yard, you
shal haue Winchester measure. I was somewhat bold with
one of their Ladiships this morning, &amp; askt her why wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
went to the generating sport al the yere, since beastes
themselues went too't but once? And she answered me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

good for themselues, and so had not beasts: but soft, here

both in partes and in apparell, and your Gallants are the
Actors: for hee that yesterday played the Gentleman,
nowe playes the Begger; shee that played the Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-woman,
nowe playes the Queane; hee that played
the married-man, nowe playes the Cuckolde; and
shee that played the Ladie, nowe playes the Painter.
Then for their apparell, they haue change too: for shee
that wore the Petticote, now weares the Breech; hee that
wore the Coxcombe, now weares the feather; the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that wore the long Sworde, nowe weares the short
Hanger; and hee that could scarce get Veluet for his
Cape, has nowe linde his Cloake throughout with
it.</p>
