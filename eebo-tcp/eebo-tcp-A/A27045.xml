            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor were there need of <hi>any writings,</hi> if men would not renounce their common senses. We cannot hope or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, by any writings, to bring any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie to a plainer, better <hi>issue,</hi> then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it by the judgement of the common senses of all the world: and yet this doth not end the controversies between us and the Papists; whether <hi>Bread</hi> be <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> be <hi>Wine,</hi> when they are seen, felt, tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But some writings are usefull to awake men to the use of <hi>Reason,</hi> and to help them to improve their other helps. And, as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Multum egerunt qui ante nos suerunt; sed non peregerunt: suscipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi tamen sunt</hi>] Though I thought I had said enough before in three or four former writings, yet the weight of the Question here debated, and the common use thats made of it by the Papists, have perswaded me, that this also will be usefull to the Church.</p>
                  <p>And I must confess the moderation and ingenuity of the Gentleman that I contend with, did not only tempt me into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking at the first, but also did incline my thoughts to a publication; there being here no stinking breath to annoy and drive away the Reader. I have learned by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that its only prudent, charitable, self-denying, humble men, that are fit to be engaged in controversies. We bring fire to Gun-powder, when we deal with proud malignant wretches, (such as I have lately had to do with,) that have souls so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, and consciences so seared, as that they seem to make malicious lies, their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and delight. Some think that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with such, is a <hi>needfull,</hi> though an

                     <hi>unsavoury</hi> work: I confess, a Lyar is not to be encouraged, nor our just reputation to be prodigally cast away, or contemptuously neglected. <hi>Duo sunt necessaria,</hi> saith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, Conscientia &amp; fama: Conscientia propter Deum; fama propter proximum.</hi> But for our <hi>selves, Gods approbation is enough</hi>; and for <hi>others,</hi> if <hi>Duty</hi> satisfie them not, <hi>contending</hi> will not.</p>

Pride and Malice hearken not to Reason: Apologies will not cure the envy of a <hi>Cain,</hi> or the pride of a <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> or the hypocrisie and persecuting fury of a Pharisee.

us, <hi>Litura tamen extat.</hi> A soul that knows the evil of sin, and seeth by faith the dreadfull Majesty, and the judgement to which he must stand or fall, is taken up with greater cares, then the defence of his reputation with men; except as Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or the good of souls may be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
                  <p>Another thing that encouraged me to this engagement was, that my Antagonist seemed exceeding desirous of a close syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistical way of arguing, which put me in hope of a speedier and better issue, then with wordy wandring Sophisters I could expect. I never liked, either the feasts that consist of sawce and ceremony with little meat; or the bawling rooks, that will not receive a bit without a troublesome noise.</p>

                  <p>Nor the prodigal covetousness that turns the Cock when none requireth it; and plucks up the flood-gates, and sets the mill a going when there is no grist; <hi>&amp; omnia vult dicere, &amp; nihil audire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When words are too cheap, it either proves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61117:5"/>
them worthless, or makes them so esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>sentence</hi> of an <hi>Orator,</hi> and the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry syllables</hi> of a <hi>Disputant</hi> should be short.

Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of speech, and <hi>sermonem habere rebus parem,</hi> do <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>make</hi> our speeches valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Truth would be adorned, but not covered: attended, but not crowded; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, but not buried in an heap of words. Arguments are like money, that is valuable according to the mettal and the weight, and not according to the number of pieces, or curiosity of the stamp.</p>
                  <p>And a third thing that made me the willinger to this task, was; that the assaults of Juglers, that thought to catch me under the names and mask of <hi>Seekers, Behmenists,</hi> and such other sects, had pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sessed me with so much indignation and distaste, that I was glad to meet with a bare-fac't Papist, that was not ashamed of his Religion, but would profess himself to be what he is. I could never hear that the Papists won so many, and so considerable persons this threescore years, by open deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I have cause to think they have won by fraud under the vizor of Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sectaries, within a few years past. I fear no Papists, but Protestant Papists, that come to Church, and take the oaths of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Allegiance, as many did the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement but a while ago; or that wear some other vizor of dissimulation. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie is nowhere so odious as in Religion, where men have to do with a heart search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and deal in matters of everlasting consequence. He hath no Religion, that thinks it his duty to <hi>lie</hi> for his Religion. For he hath no Religion that believeth not in God. And he that believeth him to be a Lover of Lies, believeth not that he is God. <hi>Verba (inq.

                  </p>
                  <p>Three Questions about Popery have put the world to much dispute. Qu. 1. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the right and safe Religion?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether it may be tolerated?</hi> 3. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be our duty to enter into reconciliation and communion with the Papist,</hi> (though not subjection) <hi>and on what terms?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first I have debated in this and divers other writings, (viz. <hi>three Disputations,</hi> called <hi>the safe Religion, a Key for Catholikes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a winding-sheet for Popery, and the true Catholike, and Catholike Church discribed.</hi>) It is one of the reproaches of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ever it could be corrupted into so sensless, unreasonable, impious, uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing as Popery: And one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of misery, in the world, that any save one that <hi>Inguinis &amp; capitis quae sunt discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina nescit,</hi> should be fully, and seriously a Papist.</p>
                  <p>But four things I find are the pillars of their Church, and propagates their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions: 1. One is the love of themselves and of the world in unsanctified hearts: which makes them be of the Religion of their Rulers; and resolve to be of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that shall undo them in the world:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61117:6"/>
And therefore to escape reproach, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and death, they will do any thing, and as they speak, will <hi>trust God with their souls, rather then men with their bodies</hi>: The meaning is, they will rather venture on the wrath of God, then of man; and save their bodies, then their souls; and secure this life (as long as they can) then life everlasting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another is <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education,</hi> possessing men with blinding stupifying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, together with a <hi>contempt</hi> of truth and happiness, that keepeth sluggish souls from that diligent search and tryal that is necessary to a conquest of that temptation, and to a saving entertainment of the truth. And the name and reverence of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, emboldeneth them against the name and reverence of God. <hi>Adeò à teneris assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escere multum est.</hi> Saith <hi>Seneca, Inter causas malorum est quod vivimus ad exempla, nec ratione componimur, sed consuetudine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducimur. Quod si pauci facerent, nolumus imitari; quum plures facere caeperunt, quasi honestius fit, quia frequentius sequimur, &amp; recti apud nos locum tenet error, ubi publicus factus est.</hi> Not what <hi>God saith,</hi> but what <hi>man doth,</hi> is made the rule of this humane apish kind of Religion. And so the Tyrant Custom ruleth them: <hi>Et gravissimum est

imperium consuetudinis,</hi> Senec. <hi>Educatio &amp; disciplina mores facit: &amp; id sapit unusquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quod didicit</hi>: Id.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another cause is superstitious fears which the false doctrins of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>no salvation out of their Church,</hi> &amp;c. have cast into mens minds. The Priests rule their subjects, as one of their Captains ruled the <hi>Thracians,</hi> by making ladders, and making them believe he would climb up to <hi>Iuno</hi> to complain of them.</p>

But holy water will not wash out their spots. God judgeth not as the Pope or Mass Priest. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for such things</hi> (as <hi>fornication, uncleanness, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, foolish talking,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>cometh the wrath of God on the children of disobedience,</hi> Eph. 5.3, 5, 6. For all the flatteries of indulgences, and pardons, and the name of <hi>Venial sin,</hi> yet conscience hath not pardoned all that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Pope. And,

In the mean time, I shall only say as <hi>Seneca, Nemo ex imprudentibus est qui relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui sibi debeat</hi>: especially men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their <hi>senses</hi> and <hi>reason</hi>

And for the third question, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> I have spoken to it, and offered the terms in other writings (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally my <hi>Key for Catholikes</hi>) I only add now, that the <hi>Peace-makers</hi> no doubt <hi>are blessed; and if it be possible, as much as in us lyeth,</hi> we must <hi>live peaceably with all men.</hi> But for the <hi>terms,</hi> we cannot possibly meet every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted party half way in their sins and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that we may be friends. Let us hold to the <hi>immutable sufficient Rule, indited by the Holy Ghost,</hi> and judge of all that swerve from it, according to the degree of their deviation, and unite in the ancient simplicity of Doctrine, Worship, and Government, and lay our unity only on things necessary: For whosoever deviseth any other Rule and terms of unity then these, shall never attain it, but raise up a new Sect, and encrease our wounds. I am as much for unity as ever was <hi>Cassander, Erasmus, Grotius,</hi> or any of the Reconcilers: But I am certain that to subscribe to the <hi>Trent</hi> Decrees and Creed, and to turn Papist, or Semi-Papist, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of any sin for peace, is not the way. Let some plead for all the Greek corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and some for the Popes supremacy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated

                  <p>But of the terms of <hi>Catholike Vnity,</hi> I have spoken, as in the forecited papers, so in a <hi>Pacificatory Letter of the Worcestershire Ministers to Mr.</hi> J. Dury: and if God will, shall do it yet more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when they come to the Decision, they are not ashamed to see after so many hundred years pretentions, that the World is but <hi>basfled</hi> with the empty name of <hi>a Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,</hi> and that Difficulties are no less Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties still, and Controversies are nowhere so voluminous as with them.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61117:10"/>
of the Picture which they have drawn, which is, of an Harlot shewing her nakedness, and committing her lewdness in the open Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in the sight of the Sún. They openly proclaim their shame against the light of all the acknowledged Principles in the World, their own or others, and in opposition to all, or almost all that is commendable among men. The charge seems high, but (in a few words) take the proof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They confess the Scripture to be the Word of God: and yet when we would appeal to that as the Rule of Faith and Life, or as a divine Revelation, in our Disputes, they fly off, and tell us of its obscurity, and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of a Iudge. If they meet with a <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> they seem for a while to be zealous for the Scripture: But tell them that <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28.</hi> doth call it <hi>Bread</hi> after the Consecration, no less than three times in the three next Verses, and then Scripture is non-sense to them till the Pope make sense of it. It is one of their principal labours against us, to argue against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures sufficiency to this use. By no means can we prevail with them to stand to the Decision of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They excessively cry up the <hi>Church,</hi> and appeal to its Decision: and therefore we might
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61117:10"/>
hope, that here if anywhere, we might have some hold of them. But when it comes to the Point, they not only disown the judgement of the Church, but impudently call <hi>Christ's</hi> Spouse a Strumpet, and cut off (in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable imagination) two or three parts of the universal <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi> The judgement of the Churches in <hi>Armenia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Syria,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and many more besides the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> is against their <hi>Popes</hi> universal <hi>Vicarship</hi> or <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and many of their Errours that depend thereon: And yet their judgement is not regarded by this Faction. And if a third or fourth part (such as it is) of the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> may cry up themselves as the Church to be appealed to, and condemn the far greater part, why may not a tenth or a twentieth part do the like? Why may not the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the <hi>Novatians,</hi> or the <hi>Greeks</hi> (much more) do so as well as <hi>Papists?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They cry up <hi>Tradition.</hi> And when we ask them, How we shall know it, and where it is to be found, they tell us, principally in the profession and practice of the present Church. And yet when two or three parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church profess that Tradition is against the <hi>Papal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monarchy,</hi> and other Points
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61117:11"/>
depending on it, they cast Tradition behind their backs.</p>

                     <hi>4.</hi> They cry up the <hi>Fathers:</hi> and when we bring their judgements against the substance of Popery, they sometime vilifie or accuse them as erroneous, and sometime tell us, that Fathers as well as Scripture must be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise understood, than their <hi>Church</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.</p>

                     <hi>5.</hi> They plead for an appeal to <hi>Councils;</hi> and (though we easily prove that none of them were universal, yet such as they were) they call them all <hi>Reprobate,</hi> which were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by their Pope, let the number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops there be never so great. And those that were approved, if they speak against them, they reject also, either with lying shifts denying the approbation, or saying, the acts are not <hi>de fide,</hi> or not <hi>conciliariter facta,</hi> or the sense must be given by their present Church, or one such contemptible shift or other.</p>

And at <hi>Rome</hi> the Cardinals are the Pope, while he

that hath the name is oft made light of. And how infallible he is judged by the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> how <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is commonly known.</p>

                     <hi>7.</hi> But all this is nothing to their renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>humanity,</hi> even of the <hi>common senses and reason of the world.</hi> When the matter is brought to the Decision of their eyes, and taste, and feeling, whether <hi>Bread</hi> be <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> be <hi>Wine;</hi> and yet all <hi>Italy, Spain, Austria, Bravaria, &amp;c.</hi> cannot resolve it; yea, generally (unless some latent <hi>Protestant</hi>) do pass their judgement against their senses, &amp; the senses of all sound men in the World; &amp; that not in a matter beyond the reach of sense (as whether <hi>Christ</hi> be there spiritually) but in a matter belonging to sense, if any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it, as whether <hi>Bread be Bread, &amp;c.</hi> Kings and Nobles, Prelates and Priests, do all give their judgement, that all their senses are deceived. And is it possible for these men then <hi>to know any thing?</hi> or any controversie between us and them to be decided? If we say that the Sun is light, or that the Pope is a man, and Scripture legible, or that there are the Writings of Councils and Fathers extant in the World, they may as well concur in a denyal of all this, or any thing else that sense should
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61117:12"/>
judge of. If they tell us that Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth them to contradict all their senses in this point; I answer,</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> And how know they that there is such a Scripture, if all their senses be so fallible? If the certainty of sense be not supposed, a little learning or wit might satisfie them, that Faith can have no certainty. But is it not a most dreadful judgement of God, that Princes and Nations, Learned men, and some that in their way are conscientious, should be given over to so much inhumanity, and to make a Religion of this brutishness, (and worse) and to persecute those with Fire and Sword, that are not so far forsaken by God, and by their reason? and that they should so solicitously labour the perversion of States and Kingdoms for the promoting of stupidity or stark madness?</p>

                  <p>THough the Papists have seemed to be the most discountenanced party under the late Usurpers, and to have no interest or power, yet I have still found, that those sped worst from men, that were most against them; and that I never wrote any book against them, but it brought a sharper storm upon me, then any thing that I wrote against any other Sect that was more visibly in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And yet it was not openly professed to be for my opposition to Popery, but on some other account: and though the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the taste of the waters, might be known yet it self and secret conducts were all underground and undiscernable. The Jesuits that are the spring of these and greater things then these, are latent, and their motion is not seen, while we see the motions which are caused by their secret force. So that by this means its only those few inquisitive discerning persons, that can see a cause in its effect, that find them out: and those few are unable to make full proof, even of the things they know; and thereby
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61117:15"/>
are prohibited from appearing openly in the cause, lest coming short in legal proof, they leave the guilty triumphing over the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as calumniators. For the last book that I wrote against them (<hi>My Key for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi>) the Parliament-house it self, and all the land did ring of my accusations; and the menaces were so high, that my intended ruine was the common talk. And I know their indignation is not abated. My crime is, that their zeal to proselyte me, hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with some of their secrets, and let me know what the Jesuits are doing, and how great a party that are masked under the name of <hi>Seekers, Familists,</hi> &amp;c. they have in the land. I have therefore Reader, this double request to thee: First, arm thy self diligently against Popery, if thou would'st preserve thy Religion and thy soul. Whatever Sects assault thee openly, suspect and avoid the disease that is endeavouring with greatest advantages to be Epidemical. To this end, be well studied in the writings that have opened their vanity and shame: I hope, what I have written on that subject, will not be useless to them that are not at leisure to read the larger volumes.

                  <p>But there is no salvation to be had out of that Congregation of Christians, which is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no salvation to be had out of that Congregation of Christians which acknowledges S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawful suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> ever to have been since the Ascension of Christ; and <hi>now</hi> to be by the Institution of Christ their chief Head and Governour on earth in matters belonging to the soul next under Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is clear; For all Christians agree in this, that to be saved, it is necessary to be in the true Church of Christ; that only being his mystical Body, Spouse and Mother of the faithful, to which must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all those who ever have been, are, or shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>The Major I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever Congregation of Christians as <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, hath been alwaies visible since the time of Christ, either under persecution, or in peace and flourishing.</p>
                  <p>But no Congregation of Christians hath been alwaies visible since the time of Christ,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61117:22"/>
either under persecution or in peace and flourishing, save that only which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his lawful successors the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever to have been since the Ascension of Christ; and <hi>now</hi> to be by Christs Institution, their chief Head and Governour on earth, in matters belonging to the soul next under Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> whatsoever Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his lawful suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever to have been since the Ascension of Christ; and <hi>now</hi> to be by Christs Institution their chief Head and Governour on earth, in matters belonging to the soul, next under Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Major is proved thus.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever Congregation of Christians hath alwaies had visible Pastors and People united, hath alwaies been visible, either under persecution, or in peace and flourishing.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoever, Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, hath alwaies had visible Pastors and People <hi>united.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> whatsoever Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, hath alwaies been visible, either under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61117:23"/>
or in peace and flourishing.</p>
                  <p>The Major of this last Sylogism is evident, for seeing a visible Church is nothing but a visible Pastor and people <hi>united</hi>: where there have alwaies been visible Pastors and people <hi>united,</hi> there hath alwaies been a visible Church.</p>
                  <p>The Minor I prove from <hi>Ephesians,</hi> cap. 4. ver. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where S. <hi>Paul</hi> saies, that Christ had Instituted, that there should be Pastors and Teachers in the Church for the work of the Ministry, and preserving the people under their respective charges from being carried away with every wind of doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which evidently shews, those Pastors must be visible, seeing the work of the Ministry, which Preaching, and Administration of Sacraments, and Governing their flocks, are all external and <hi>visible</hi> actions. And this shews likewise, that those Pastors and People must be <hi>alwaies visible,</hi> because they are to continue from Christs Ascension, untill we all meet together in the unity of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be before the day of judgement.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it be said (as some say) that this promise of Christ is only conditional, since to put it to be so without evident
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61117:23"/>
Reason, giveth scope to every one at his pleasure, to make every other promise of Christ to be conditional. And so we shall be certain of nothing that Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, neither that shall alwaies be a visible or invisible Church, nor any Church at all; no nor of Judgement, nor of Eternal life, or of the Resurrection of the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for one may say with as much ground, as this is said, that some conditions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in all those promises, which being not fulfilled, hinders the execution of them.</p>
                  <p>There remains only, to prove the Minor of the second Sylogism, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Christians hath been alwaies visible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> save that which acknowledges S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his lawful successors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be their chief Head and Governour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> next under Christ.</p>
                  <p>This Minor I prove, by obliging the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerers to nominate any Congregation of Christians, which alwaies till this present time, since Christ, hath been <hi>visible,</hi> either under persecution, or in peace and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, save that only which acknowledges S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut supra.</hi>

                        <p>WHoever you are, a serious debate with so sober a Disputant, is to me an exceeding acceptable employment: I shall not, I hope, give you any cause to say, that I decline any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or halk your strength, or transgress the part of a Respondent. But because, <hi>1.</hi> You have not (as you ought to have done) explained the terms of your Thesis. <hi>2.</hi> And have made your Propositions so long. <hi>3.</hi> And have so cunningly lapped up your fallacies; your Respondent is necessitated to be the larger in distinction and explication.

men the Iudges of our dispute: because you know that to the unlearned a bare <hi>Nego</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth nothing; but when such have read your Arguments at length, they will expect as plain and large a confutation, or judge you to be in the right for speaking most.</p>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>TO your Argument. 1. Your conclusion containeth not your Thesis, or Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And so you give up your cause the first step, and make a new one. It should have contained your Question in terms, and it doth not so much as contain it in the plain sense: so much difference is there between [Assemblies of Christians united, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and [Congregation of Christians] and between [Salvation or the Church, never was in any other then those Assemblies] and [no Salvation out of that Congregation]; as I shall shew you: besides other differences which you may see.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad Majorem. Resp.</hi> 1. By [Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] you mean, either the whole Catholike Church united in Christ, or some particular Congregation, which is but part of that whole. In the latter sense, your Subject hath a false supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that a part is the whole, and your Minor will be false.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61117:25"/>
And your [whatsoever Congregation of Christians] seems to distinguish that from some other excluded Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that is not part of the Catholike Church, which is a supposing the chief part of the Question granted you, which we deny. We know no universal Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians but one, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all particular Congregations and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the univocally deserve that name.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Either you mean that [this whole Congregation or true Church acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] the Popes Soveraignty, or else [that some part of it doth acknowledge it.] The former I deny, and challenge any man living to prove: If it be [part only] that you mean, then either [the greater part] or [the lesser]: that it is the greater, I as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently almost deny: for it is against the common knowledge of men acquainted with the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you mean [the lesser part] you shall see anon that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys your cause.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Either you speak <hi>de Ecclesia quae talis,</hi> or <hi>de Ecclesia qua talis:</hi> and mean that this [acknowledgement] is essential to it, or at least an inseparable property, or else that it is separable accident. The latter will do you no good: the former I deny. In
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61117:26"/>
summ: I grant that a small corrupt part of the Catholike Church doth <hi>now</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Pope to be Christs Vicar, (or the Vice-christ); but I deny, 1. That the whole doth so (which is your great cause.) 2. Or the major part. 3. Or any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation through all ages (though if they had, it would do you no good.) 4. Or that it is done by any upon just ground, but is their corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad minorem. Resp.</hi> 1. If you mean any [part] of the Universal Church by [that Congregation which is now the true Church] I deny your Minor: If [the whole] I grant it. 2. You say [all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians agree] in it, <hi>&amp;c. Resp.</hi> I think all Protestants, or near all, do: but <hi>Franciscus à sancta Clara</hi> hath copiously told us (in <hi>Artic. Anglic.</hi>) that most of your own Doctors are for the salvation of Infidels; and then either you take Infidels for your Church members, or your Doctors for no Christians, or you play not fair play to tell us so gross an untruth, that <hi>all Christians</hi> are agreed in it.</p>
                  <p>To your conclusion. <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. Either you mean that [there is no Salvation to be had out of that Universal Church, whose part (a minor corrupt part) acknowledgeth the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61117:26"/>
Popes Soveraignty] or else [that there is no Salvation to be had out of that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church which wholly acknowledgeth it] or else [that there is no Salvation to be had out of that part of the Universal Church which acknowledgeth it.] In the first sense I grant your conclusion (if really you are part of the Church.) There is no Salvation to be had out of Christs Universal Church, of which you are small corrupted part. In the second sense I told you we deny the supposition in the subject. In the third sense I deny the sequel; <hi>non sequitur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your Major Proposition being false <hi>de Ecclesia universali,</hi> the conclusion must be false <hi>de parte ista,</hi> as excluding the rest.</p>
                  <p>But to the unskilful or unwary reader your conclusion seemeth to import, that [the being in such a Church which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Popes Soveraignty, as it is such a Church, is necessary to Salvation] and so [that the persons acknowledgement is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.] But it is a <hi>fallacia accidentis</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly lapt up, that is the life of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported cause. That part of the Universal Church doth hold to the Popes Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is <hi>per accidens</hi>; and could you prove that the whole Church doth so (which you are unlike to do) I would say the like. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61117:27"/>
that your fallacy may the better appear; I give you some examples of such like sophisms.</p>
                  <p>[Whatsoever Nation is the true Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> is proud and cruel against Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: But there is no protection there due to any that are not of that Kingdom: therefore there is no protection due to any that are not proud and cruel.] Or [what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Nation is the true Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> acknowledgeth the Pope: but no protection is due from the Governours to any that are not of that Kingdom: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no protection is due to any that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not the Pope.] Or [what ever Nation is the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the daies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was for the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi>: but there was no right of Inheritance for any that were not of that Nation: therefore there was no right of Inheritance for any that was not for the Earl of <hi>Tyrone.</hi>] Or suppose that you could have proved it of all the Church. If you had lived four hundred years after Christ, you might as well have argued thus. [Whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, is against kneeling in Adoration on the Lords daies. But there is no Salvation to be had out of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61117:27"/>
that Congregation of Christians, which is now the true Church of Christ: therefore there is no Salvation to be had out of that Congregation which is against kneeling on the Lords day. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But yet, 1. There was Salvation to be had <hi>in</hi> that <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without being of that opinion. 2. And there is now Salvation to be had in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation that is not of that opinion, as you will confess.</p>
                  <p>Or [whatsoever Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, doth hold the Canticles and the Epistle to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to be Canonical Scripture, (and so have done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But there is no Salvation to be had out of the true Church: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no Salvation to be had out of that Congregation which holdeth the Canticles and Epistle to <hi>Philemon</hi> to be Canonical Scripture.] But yet, 1. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be had in that Church without holding it. 2. and its possible hereafter a Church may deny those two books, and yet you will think Salvation not thereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. This is but to shew your fallacy from a <hi>corrupt accident,</hi> and indeed but of a part of the Church, and a small part.</p>
                  <p>Now to your proof of the Major. <hi>Resp. ad Major.</hi> The present <hi>matter</hi> of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61117:28"/>
Church was not visible in the last Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for we were not then born: but the same form of the Church was then existent in a visible <hi>Matter,</hi> and their Profession was visible or audible, though their faith it self was invisible. I will do more then you shall do, in maintaining the constant visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Chruch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad minorem.</hi> 1. If you mean that no Congregation hath been alwaies visible [but that Universal Church whose lesser corrupt part acknowledges] the Popes Soveraignty, I grant it. For besides [the whole containing all Christians as the parts] there can be no other. If you mean [save that part which acknowledgeth] you contradict your self, because a part imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth other parts. If you mean [save that Universal Church, all whose members (or the most) acknowledge it], there is no such subject existent. 2. I distinguish of <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>: Its one thing to be a visible Church, that is, visible in its essentials; and another thing to be visible <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> as to some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable accident. [The Universal Church was ever visible; because their Profession of Christianity was so, and the persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing: But [the acknowledgement of the Vice-christ] was not alwaies visible, no not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61117:28"/>
in any part, much less in the whole. And if it had, it was but a separable accident (if your disease be not incurable) that was visible: and therefore, 1. It was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, nor a proper mark of the Church. 2. Nor can it be so for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>I need to say no more to your conclusion. Your Argument is no better then this, [whatsoever Congregation of Christians is <hi>now</hi> the true Church of Christ, hath been alwaies visible since the time of Christ: But no Congregation of Christians hath been so visible, save only that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the Greeks, which hath a Colledge of Cardinals to choose the Popes, which denieth the cup to the laity, which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the reading of Scripture in a known tongue without license, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore whatsoever Congregation of Christians is now the true Church of Christ, hath all these]; 1. In a corrupt part it hath. 2. But it had not alwaies. 3. And may be cured hereafter.</p>
                  <p>To your proof of the Major: 1. I grant your Major.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ad minorem.</hi> 1. Either you mean [Universal Pastors] each one, or someone having charge and Government of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61117:29"/>
[whole Church,] or you mean, [unfixed Pastors having an indefinite charge of Preaching and Guiding when they come and have particular calls and opportunities] or you mean [the fixed Pastors of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches] In the first sense your Minor is false, the Catholike Church was never so united to any Universal Head but Christ: no one of the Apostles governed the rest &amp; the whole Church, much less any since their time. In the second sense, I grant that the Church hath ever had Pastors since the Ascension. In the third sense, I grant that some parts or other of the Catholike Church, have ever had fixed Pastors of Congregations since the first settling of such Pastors. But any one particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation may cease to have such Pastors, and may cease it self: and <hi>Rome</hi> hath been long without any true Pastors; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was then no such visible Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If by [Congregation] you mean not the Universal Church, but [a part], or if you mean it of [all the parts of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church] I deny your Minor: Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Christians, and particular persons have been and may be without any Pastors, to whom they are united or subject. The Indians that died in the faith while <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61117:29"/>
and <hi>Edesius</hi> were there preaching, before they had any Pastor, were yet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and saved: If a Lay-man Convert one, or a thousand, (and you will say that he may baptize them) and they die before they can have a Pastor, or ever hear of any to whom they owe subjection, they are nevertheless saved, as members of the Church; And if all the Pastors in a Nation were murdered or banished, the people would not cease to be Christians and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. Much less if the Pope were dead or deposed, or a vacancy befell his seat, would all the Catholike Church be annihilated, or cease.</p>
                  <p>To your Confirmation of the Major [that a visible Church is nothing but a Visible Pastor, and people united] I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: 1. Its true of the universal Church, as united in Christ, the great Pastor, but not as united in a Vice-Christ or humane head. 2. It is true of a particular Political or organized Church, as united to their proper Pastors 3. But it is not true of every Community of Christians who are a part of the Universal Church. A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny converted to Christ, are members of the Universal Church, (though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of a Pope at Rome) before
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61117:30"/>
they are United to Pastors of their own.</p>
                  <p>The Proof of the Minor from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. I grant as aforesaid: The text proveth that Pastors the Church shall have: I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the vain objection [of Conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the promise] which you mention. But it proves not, 1. That the Church shall have an Universal Monarch or Vice-Christ, under Christ. 2. Nor that every member of the Universal Church, shall certainly be a member of a particular Church, or ever see the face of a Pastor, or be subject to him.</p>
                  <p>You say next [There remains only to prove the Minor of the second Syllogism, <hi>viz.</hi> that no Congregation of Christians hath been alwaies visible but that which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This is the great point which all lyeth on: The rest hath been all nothing, but a cunning shooing horn to this. Prove this, and prove all: Prove not this, and you have lost your time.</p>
                  <p>You say [The Minor I prove, by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the answerers to nominate any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Christians which alwaies till this present time since Christ hath been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible — save that only which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And have I waited all this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61117:30"/>
while for this? You prove it by obliging me to prove the contrary. Ridiculous! <hi>sed quo jure?</hi> 1. Your undertaken form of arguing obligeth you to prove your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: You cannot cast your Respondent upon proving and so arguing, and doing the Opponents part. 2. And in your Postscript you presently forbid it me; You require me to hold to a <hi>Concedo, Nego, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingno, Omitto, Transeat</hi>; threatning that else you will take it for an <hi>Effugium.</hi> And I pray you tell me in your next, to which of these doth the nomination or proof of such a Church as you describe belong? Plainly, you first slip away when you should prove your Minor, and then oblige me to prove the Contrary, and then tell me, if I attempt it, you'l take it for an <hi>Effugium.</hi> A good cause needs not such dealing as this: which me thinks you should be loth a learned man should hear of. 3. Your interest also in the <hi>Matter</hi> (as well as your office as Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) doth oblige you to the proof. For though you make a Negative of it, you may put it in other terms at your pleasure. It is your main work to prove [that All the members of the Universal Church have in all ages held the Popes Soveraignty or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Head-ship.] Or [the whole Visible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61117:31"/>
Church hath held it] Prove this, and I will be a Papist; you have my promise. You affirm, and you must prove. Prove a Catholike Church, at least that in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part was of that mind: (though that would be nothing to prove the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rest.) If you are an impartial enquirer after truth, fly not when you come to the setting too. I give you this further evident reason why you cannot oblige me to what you here impose; 1. Because you require me to prove the Visibility of a Church which <hi>held not</hi> your point of Papacy; and so put an unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able task upon me, about a <hi>Negative:</hi> or else, I must prove that they held the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, before your opinion was started: And it is the Catholike Church that we are disputing about; so that I must prove this <hi>Negative</hi> of the Catholike Church. 2. It is you that lay the great stress of Necessity on your Affirmative, more then we do on the Negative; you say that no man can be saved without your Affirmative [that the Pope is the universal Head and Governor] But we say not that no man can be saved that holdeth not our <hi>Negative,</hi> [that he is not the Vice-Christ] For one that hath the plague or leprosie may live. Therefore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61117:31"/>
it is you that must prove that <hi>all</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church was still of your mind. 3. And it is an Accident, and but an Accident of a small<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r corrupted part of the Catholike Church that you would oblige me to prove the <hi>Negation</hi> of; and therefore it is utterly needless to my proof of a Visible Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. For I will without it prove to you a successive Visibility of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, from the Visibility of its Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or Constitutive parts (of which your Pope is none.) I will prove a successive visible Church that hath still professed faith in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and been united to the Universal Head, and had particular Pastors, some fixed, some unfixed, and held all essential to a Christian. And proving this, I have proved the Church of which I am a member. To prove that <hi>England</hi> hath been so long a Kingdom, requireth no more but to prove the two Essential parts, King and Subjects, to have so long continued united. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not that I prove that if ever either <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d,</hi> or <hi>opposed</hi> a Vice-King. This is our plain case. If a man have a botch on one of his hands; it is not needful in order to my proving him a man heretofore, that I prove he was born and bred without it: so
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61117:32"/>
be it I prove that he was born a man, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth. Nor is it needfull that I prove the other hand alwaies to have been free, in order to prove it a member of the body: It sufficeth that I prove it to have been still <hi>a hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do therefore desire you to perform your work, and prove that [no Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation hath been still visible, but such as yours] or that [the whole Catholike Church hath ever since the ascention held a Humane Universal Governour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ,] or else I shall take it as a giving up your cause as indefensible. And observe, if you shall prove only that <hi>a part</hi> of the Catholike Church still held this (which you can never do) then, 1. You will make the Contrary opinion as Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with salvation as yours. For the rest of the Catholike Church is savable. 2. And then you will allow me to turn your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against your self as much as it is against us (and so cast it away.) <hi>e. g.</hi> [what ever Congregation of Christians is now the true Church of Christ, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Visible: But no Congregation of Christians hath been alwaies Visible, but that which <hi>quoad partem</hi> denyeth the Popes universal Headship; therefore whatever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61117:32"/>
Congregation of Christians is the true Church, denyeth the Popes universal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>Well! but for all this (supposing you will do your part) I will fail you in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that's reasonable, which I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. A Catholike Church in all ages that was against the Pope, in every member of it, I hope I cannot shew you; because I hope that you are members, though corrupt. But you shall have more then a particular Congregation, or a hundred.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. At this present, two or three parts of the Catholike Church is known to be against your Universal Monarchy. The Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides the Protestants. 2. In the last age there were as many or more. 3. In the former ages till <hi>An. D.</hi> 1000. there were neer as many, or rather many more. For more be saln off the <hi>Tenduè, Nubia,</hi> and other parts then the Protestants that came in. 4. About the year 600. there were many more, incomparably; and I think then, but at least of 400. years after Christ I never yet saw valid proof of one Papist in all the world, that is, one that was for the Popes Universal Monarchy or Vice-Christ-ship. So that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61117:33"/>
                     <hi>most</hi> of the Catholike Church (about three parts to one) hath been against you to this day; and all against you for many hundred years. Could I name but a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against you, I should think I had done nothing; much less if I cited a few men in an age. 5. And all those of <hi>Ethiopia, India,</hi> &amp;c. that are without the verge and awe of the Ancient Roman Empire, never so much as gave the Pope that Primacy of dignity, which those within the Empire gave him, when he was chief, as the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> is of the Earls of <hi>England</hi> that governeth none of them, and as the Lord Chancellor may be the chief judge, that hath no power <hi>in alieno foro</hi>: or as the Eldest Justice is chief in the County and on the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nch, that ruleth not the rest. Mistake not this Primacy for Monarchy, nor the Romane Empire for the world, and you can say nothing.</p>
                  <p>At present, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I give you suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof of this succession. As you use to say that the present Church best knew the Judgement of the former age, and so on to the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, and so Tradition beareth you out: I turn this unresistibly against you. The far greatest part of Christians in the world that now are in possession of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61117:33"/>
the doctrine contrary to your Monarchy, tell us that they had it from their Fathers, and so on. And as in Councils, so with the Church Real, the Major part (three to one) is more to be credited then the Minor part; especially when it is a visible self-advancement that the Minor part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth on. 6. And were not this enough, I might add, that your western Church it self in its Representative Body at <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> hath determined that not the Pope but a General Council is the chief Governor under Christ; and that this ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h been still the judgement of the Church, and that its Heresie in whoever that hold the Contrary. 7. And no man can prove that one half or tenth part of your people ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed Papists are of your opinion: For they are not called to profess it by words: and their obedience is partly forced, and partly upon other principles; some obeying the Pope as their western Patriarch of chief dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and some and most doing all for their own peace and safety: Their outward acts will prove no more.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir, I have told you what Church of which we are members, hath been visible; yea and what part of it hath oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Vice-Christ of <hi>Rome.</hi> This I delayed

                        <p>To your Answer to my first Syllogism.</p>
                        <p>He who distinguishes Logically the terms of any proposition, must not apply
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61117:35"/>
his distinction to some one part of the <hi>term</hi> only, but to the whole <hi>term,</hi> as it stands in the proposition distinguished. Now in my proposition I affirm, that the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians I speak of there, is such a Congregation, <hi>that it is the true Church of Christ,</hi> that is, (as all know) the whole Catholike Church: and you distinguish thus, That I either mean <hi>by Congregation</hi> the whole Catholike Church, or only some part of it as, if one should say, <hi>Whatsoever Congregation of men is the Common-wealth of England,</hi> and another in answer to it should distinguish, either by <hi>Congregation of men</hi> you mean the whole Common-wealth, or some part of it, when all men know, that by <hi>the Common-wealth of England</hi> must be meant the whole Common-wealth: for no part of it is the Common-wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again you distinguish, that some things are Essentials, or Necessaries, and others Accidents, which are acknowledged or practised in the Church. Now to apply this distinction to my Proposition, you must distinguish that which I say is acknowledged to have been <hi>ever</hi> in the Church by <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of Christ, either to be meant of an Essential, or an Accident; when all the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61117:36"/>
world knows that whatsoever is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to <hi>have have been ever in the Church by Christs Institution,</hi> cannot be meant of <hi>any Accidental thing,</hi> but of a <hi>necessary, unchangeable</hi> and <hi>Essential</hi> thing, in Christs true Church. If one should advance this proposition, Whatsoever Congregation is the true Church of Christ, acknowledges the Eucharist ever to have been <hi>by Christs Institution</hi> a proper Sacrament of the new Law: and another should distinguish (as you do my proposition) This may be meant <hi>either of an Essential or Accidental thing to Christs true Church</hi>: Seeing whatsoever is acknowledged to have been alwaies in Christs Church and instituted by Christ, cannot be acknowledged but as <hi>necessary and essential</hi> to his Church. If therefore my <hi>Major,</hi> as the terms lie expressed in it, be true, it should have been granted: if false, it should have been denyed. But no Logick allows that it should be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into such different members, whereof one is expresly excluded in the very terms of the proposition. These distinctions therefore, though learned and substantial in themselves, yet were they here unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and too illogical to ground an answer in forme (as you ground yours) still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

I say <hi>no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> which is an universal negative; and when I say, none, Saye <hi>that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which acknowledges Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the term <hi>Congregation</hi> supposes for the same whole Catholike Church mentioned in my
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61117:37"/>
former Syllogism, but expresses it under a general term of Congregation <hi>in confuso</hi>; as I express <hi>Homo,</hi> when I say he is <hi>Animal,</hi> a <hi>man,</hi> when I say he is a <hi>living creature,</hi> but only <hi>generically,</hi> or <hi>in confuso.</hi> Now should I have intended determinately either the whole Catholike Church, or any part of it, I should have made an inept Syllogism, which would have run thus. Whatsoever true Church of Christ is now the true Church of Christ, hath been always visible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But no true Church of Christ hath been alwaies visible, save the true Church of Christ, which acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> whatsoever true Churh of Christ is now the true Church, acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. which would have been <hi>idem per idem</hi>; for every one knows, that the true Church of Christ, is now the true Church of Christ. But speaking, as I do in abstractive and generical terms, I avoid this absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and frame a true Syllogism.</p>
                        <p>Now my meaning in this <hi>Minor</hi> could be no other then this, which my words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; That the Congregation, that is, <hi>the whole Congregation</hi> acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and is visible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not any part, great or small of it. For when I say, the Parliament of these Nations doth, or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61117:37"/>
hath enacted a Statute, who would demand of me, whether I meant the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or some determinate part of it? You should therefore have denyed, not thus distinguished my <hi>Minor</hi> quite against the express words of it. What you say again of Essentials and Accidents, is already refuted; and by that also your Syllogism, brought by way of instance. For your proposition doth not say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledges those things were <hi>alwaies done,</hi> and that by <hi>Christs Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as my proposition says she acknowledges Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors.</p>

I answer, that the term <hi>Pastours</hi> (as before <hi>Congregation</hi>) signifies determinately no one of these, but generically and <hi>in confuse</hi> all; and so abstracts from each of them in particular, as the word <hi>Animal</hi> abstracts from <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>brutum.</hi> Neither can I mean some parts of the Church only had Pastors; for I say, <hi>whatsoever Congregation of Christians is now the true Church of Christ, hath alwaies had visible Pastors and People united.</hi> Now <hi>the Church</hi> is not a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61117:38"/>
part but the whole Church, that is, both the whole body of the Church, and all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches the parts of it. And hence is solved your argument of the Indians, of people converted by lay-men, when parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pastors are dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For those were subjects of the chief Bishop alone, till some inferiour Pastors were sent to them. For when they were taught the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the explication of that Article, <hi>I believe the Holy Catholike Church,</hi> they were also taught, that they being people of Christs Church, must subject themselves to their lawful Pastors, this being a part of the Christian doctrine. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. who though absent in body, may yet be present in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with them, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.</p>
                        <p>Your Answer to the confirmation of my <hi>Major</hi> seems strange. For I speak of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> Pastors, and you say tis true of an <hi>Invisible</hi> Pastor, that is, Christ our Saviour, who is now in heaven, <hi>invisible</hi> to men on earth. The rest is a repetition of what is immediately before answered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. proves not only that some particular Churches, or parts of the whole Church, must alwaies have Pastors, but that the whole Church it self must have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61117:38"/>
Pastors, and every particular Church in it; for it speaks of that Church which is <hi>the Body of Christ</hi>; which can be no less then the whole Church. For no particular Church alone is his mystical Body, but only a part of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. is not directly alledged to prove an universal Monarch, (as you say) but to prove an uninterrupted continuance of visible Pastors; that being only affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proposition, which I prove by it. 2. This is already Answered.</p>
                        <p>I stand to the judgement of any true Logitian, nay or expert Lawyer, or rational person, whether a Negative proposition be to be proved otherwise then by obliging him who denies it, to give an instance to infringe it. Should you say, <hi>no man hath right to my Benefice and Function in my parish, save my self,</hi> and another should deny what you said; would not you, or any rational man in your case, answer him, that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying your proposition he affirmed that some other had right to them, and to make good that affirmation was obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce who that was: which till he did, you still remained the sole just possessour of your Benefice as before; and every one will judge, that he had no reason to deny your
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61117:39"/>
assertion, when he brought no proof against it. This is our case.</p>
                        <p>The Contradiction, which you would draw from this, against my <hi>Nego, Concedo,</hi> &amp;c. exacted from the Respondent, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, follows not. For that prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is to be understood, that the Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of himself, without scope given him by the opponent, was not to use any other forms in Answering; But if the opponent should require that the respondent give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or instances, or proofs, of what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that then the Respondent is to proceed to them. And this is most ordinary in all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Disputations, where strict form is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and known to every yong Logitian. Instances therefore demanded by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, were not excluded, but only such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions out of form, as should proceed from the respondent, with out being exacted by the opponent.</p>
                        <p>You say, though I make a Negative of it, I may put it in other terms at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But the question is not what I may do, but what I did: I required not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to an Argument, which I may frame, but to that which I had then framed, which was expressed in a negative proposition.</p>
                        <p>You tell me if I prove the Popes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61117:39"/>
Supremacy, you will be a Papist: And I tell you, I have proved it by this very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, That either <hi>He</hi> hath that suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or some other Church; denying that he hath alwaies had it, hath been alwaies visible; and that Church I require should be named, if any such be, and whilest you refuse to name that Church (as here you do) you neither answer the Argument, nor become a Papist.</p>
                        <p>You say <hi>I affirm,</hi> and <hi>I must prove.</hi> I say in the proposition, about which we now speak, I affirm not, and so must not prove; and you by denying it, must affirm, and so must prove.</p>
                        <p>You prove it is not your part here to prove, because the Popes supremacy could not be denyed, before it was affirmed; and you must be obliged to prove that denyal. I oblige you not to prove a continued visible Church formally and expresly denying it, but that it was of such a Constitution as was inconsistent with any such supremacy, or could and did subsist without it; which is an Affirmative.</p>
                        <p>You affirm, that because I say you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved if you deny that Supremacy, and you say that I may be saved though I hold it, therefore you are not bound to prove what I reprove, but I to prove my negative proposition. But this would prove
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61117:40"/>
as well, that a Mahumetan is not bound to prove his religion to you, but you to prove yours to him, because you say he cannot be saved being a Mahumetan; and he says, that you may be saved being a Christian. See you not, that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proof in Logicall form depends not of the first position, or <hi>Thesis,</hi> but must be drawn from the immediate proposition, affirmative or negative, which is or ought to be proposed?</p>
                        <p>To what you say of an Accident and a corrupt part, I have already answered.</p>
                        <p>To what you say of a vice-king, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessary to the Constitution of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but a king and subjects only, is true, if a vice-king be not instituted by the Full power of an Absolute Authority over that kingdom, to be an ingredient into the essence of the Kingdom, in the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: But if so constituted, it will be essential; now my proposition saith, and my Argument proves, that <hi>by the Absolute Authority of Christ, Saint</hi> Peter <hi>and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors were instituted Governors in Christs place of his whole visible Church</hi>; and whatsoever Government Christ institutes of his Church, must be essential to his Church. You see now the Disparity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61117:40"/>You insist to have me prove a Negative; and I insist to have you prove that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, which you fall into by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Negative, and leave it to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whose exaction is the more conform to reason, and logical form.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>if I prove not here,</hi> say you, <hi>the whole Catholike Churches holding ever the Popes Supremacy, you shall take it as a give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my cause.</hi> I tell you again, that I have proved it by this very Argument, by force of Syllogistical form: and it is not reasonable to judge that I have given up my cause, if I prove not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what I have already proved.</p>
                        <p>Your taking upon you the part of an opponent now is, you know, out of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; when that is yours, mine shall be the Respondent.</p>
                        <p>AT length you give fair attempt to satisfie your obligation, and to return such an instance as I demanded of you. But you are too free by much in your offer. I demand one Congregation, and you promise to produce more then an hundred. But as they abound in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, so are they deficient in the quality
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61117:41"/>
which I require. I demand, <hi>that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer nominate any Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which alwayes till this present time since Christ hath been visible,</hi> &amp;c. and you tell me of more then an hundred Congregations, besides that which acknowledges Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. whereof <hi>not any one</hi> hath been all that designed time visible: which is as if I had demanded an Answerer to nominate any Family of Gentry, which hath succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively continued ever since <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour till this present time; and he who undertakes to satisfie my demand, should nominate more then a hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, whereof not so much as one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued half that time. You nominate first <hi>all these present, the Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians, besides the Protestants.</hi> These you begin with. Now to satisfie my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, you must assert, that these, whom you first name, are both one Congregation, and have been visible ever since Christs time. This you do not in the pursute of your Allegations. For <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate none at all, but tell me, that <hi>in the last age there were as many or more.</hi> What were these <hi>as many or more</hi>? were they the same which you nominated first, or others? I required some determinate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61117:41"/>
to be nominated all the while, and you tell me of <hi>as many or more,</hi> but say not of what determinate congregation they were. In your <hi>Num.</hi> 3. you tell me, in the former ages, till one thousand, there <hi>were neer as many, or rather many more.</hi> A fair account! But in the mean time you nominate none, much less prosecute you those with whom you begun. <hi>Num.</hi> 4. You say, in the year six hundred there <hi>were many more incomparably.</hi> What <hi>many</hi>? what <hi>more</hi>? were they the same which you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the beginning, and made one Congregation with them? or were they quite different Congregations? what am I the wiser by your saying <hi>many more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably,</hi> when you tell me not what, or who they were? Then you say, <hi>But at least for four hundred years after Christ, I never yet saw valid proof of one Papist in all the world, that is, one that was for the Popes universal Monarchy, or vice-Christship.</hi> What then? are there no proofs in the world, but what you have seen? or may not many of those proofs be valid which you have seen, though you esteem them not so? and can you think it reasonable, upon your single <hi>not-seeing,</hi> or <hi>not-judging</hi> only, to conclude absolutely, as you here do, <hi>that all have been
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61117:42"/>
against us for many hundred years</hi>? In your <hi>Num.</hi> 5. You name <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> as having been without the limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whom you deny to have acknowledged any supremacy of power and authority above all other Bishops. You might have done well to have cited at least one antient Author for this Assertion. Were those primitive Christians of another kind of Church-order and Government, then were those under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire <note n="*" place="margin">But how far from truth this is, appears from St. <hi>Leo,</hi> in his Sermons <hi>de natali suo,</hi> where he saies, <hi>Sedes Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Petri, quicquid non possidet almis, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligione te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>; and by this, <hi>that the Abyssines of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>were under the Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria <hi>antiently, which Patriarch was under the Authority of the Romane Bishop, as we shall presently see.</hi>
                           </note>? When the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were yet Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, had not the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy over all other Bishops through the whole Church? and did those Heathen Emperors give it him? How came St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in time of the Heathen Empire to request <hi>Stephen</hi> the Pope to punish and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> as we shall see hereafter? Had he that authority (think you) from an Heathen Emperour? See now how little your Allegations are to the purpose, where you nominate any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Congregations to satisfie my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61117:42"/>I had no reason to demand of you different congregations, of all sorts and Sects opposing the Supremacy, to have been shewn visible in all ages. I was not so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as not to know, that the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Valentinians, Gnosticks, Manichees, Montanists, Arians, Donatists, Nestorians, Eutychians, Pelagians, Iconoclasts, Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians, Waldensians, Albigenses, Wicleffists, Hussits, Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> &amp;c. each following others had some kind of visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, divided and distracted each to his own respective age, from our time to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, in joyning their heads and hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against the Popes Supremacy. But because these could not be called <hi>one suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Congregation of Christians,</hi> being all together by the ears amongst themselves; I should not have thought it a demand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming a Scholar, to have required such a visibility as this. Seeing therefore all you determinately nominate, are as much different as these; pardon me, if I take it not for any satisfaction at all to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or acquittance of your obligation. Bring me a visible succession of any <hi>one</hi> Congregation of Christians, of the same belief, profession, and communion, for the designed time, opposing that Supremacy,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61117:43"/>
and you will have satisfied: but till that be done, I leave it to any equal judgement, whether my demand be satisfied or no. You answer to this, That all those, who are nominated by you, are <hi>parts of the Catholike Church, and so one Congregation.</hi> But Sir, give me leave to tell you, that in your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, you put both the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and your selves, to be parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church: and yet sure you account them not one Congregation of Christians, seeing by separation one from another they are made two: or if you account them <hi>one,</hi> why did you separate your selves, and still remain separate from communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? why possessed you your selves of the Bishopricks and Cures of your own Prelates and Pastors, they yet living in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time? and drew both your selves and their other subjects from all subjection to them, and communion with them? Is this disunion, think you, fit to make one and the same Congregation of you and them? is not charity, subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obedience to the same state and government required as well to make one Congregation of Christians, as it is required to make one Congregation of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths men? Though therefore you do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61117:43"/>
them all parts of the Catholike Church, yet you cannot make them in your principles <hi>one Congregation</hi> of Christians. Secondly, your position is not true; the particulars named by you neither are, nor can be parts of the Catholike Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you make <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> parts of the Catholike Church: which were either to deny them to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schismaticks; or to affirm, that Hereticks and Schismaticks, separating themselves from the communion of the Catholike Church, notwithstanding that separation, do continue parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. For who knows not that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to this day are <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Rosse</hi> his view of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>p.</hi> 99. 489, 492, &amp;c. Where he saies that they cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the eighth day, they use Mosaical ceremonies. They mention not the council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> because (saies he) they are Eutychians and Jacobites, and confesses that their Patriarch is in subjection to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp;c. See more of the Chofti, Jacobites, Maronites, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 493, 494. where he confesses that many of them are now subject to the Pope, and have renounced their old errors.</note> 
                           <hi>Eutychian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. And a great part of those Greeks and Armenians, who deny the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, are infected with the Heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and all of them profess generally all those points of faith with us against you, wherein you differ from us; and deny to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61117:44"/>
communicate with you, or to esteem you other then Hereticks and Schismaticks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you both agree with them in those differences of faith, and subject your selves to the obedience of the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> as to the chief Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all Christian Churches next under Christ; and consequently as much a vice-Christ, in your account, as the Pope can be conceived to be. See, if you please, <hi>Hieremias</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> his Answer to the Lutherans, especially in the beginning and end of the book; <hi>Acta Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logorum Wittebergensium,</hi> &amp;c. and Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn Sands,</hi> of this subject, in his Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 232, 233, 242, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Either therefore you must make the Eutychians and Nestorians no Hereticks, and so contradict the Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which condemned them as such; and the consent of all Orthodox Christians, who ever since esteemed them no others; or you must make condemned Hereticks parts of the Catholick Church, against all antiquity and Christianity. And for those Greeks neer <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who are not infected with Nestorianism and Eutychianism, yet in the Procession of the Holy Ghost, against
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61117:44"/>
both us and you, they must be thought to maintain manifest Heresie; it being a point in a fundamental matter of faith, the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and the difference betwixt those Greeks and the Western Church, now for many hundred of years, and in many General Councils esteemed and defined to be real and great; yea so great, that the Greeks left the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon that difference alone, and ever esteemed the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his party to have fallen from the true faith,<note place="margin">See <hi>Nilus</hi> on this subject.</note> and lost his ancient authority by that sole pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed error; and the Latins alwaies esteemed the Greeks to be in a damnable error, in maintaining the contrary to the doctrine of the Western or <hi>Roman</hi> Church in that particular. And yet sure they understood what they held, and how far they differed one from another, much better then some Novel writers of yours, who prest by force of Argument, have no other way left them to maintain a perpetual visibility, then by extenuating that difference of <hi>Procession</hi> betwixt the Greek and Latin Church, which so many ages before Protestancy sprung up, was esteemed a main fundamental error by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both parts, caused the Greeks to abandon all subjection and Communion to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61117:45"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi>; made them so divided the one from the other, that they held each other Hereticks, Schismaticks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of the true faith, as they continue still to do to this day, and yet you will have them both to be parts of the Catholike Church.</p>
                        <p>But when you have made the best you can of these Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians, Protestants, whom you first name, you neither have deduced, nor can deduce them successively in all ages till Christ, <hi>as a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Congregation of Christians, from that which holds the Popes Supremacy</hi>; which was my proposition. For in the year 1500. those who became the first Protestants, were not a Congregation different from those who held that supremacy; nor in the year 500. were the Greeks a visible Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>different from it</hi>; nor in the year 300. were the Nestorians; nor in the year 200. the Eutychians <hi>a different Congregation from those who held the said Supremacy</hi>: But in those respective years, those who first begun those Heresies, were involved within that Congregation, which held it, as a part of it, and assenting therein with it: who after in their several ages and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings fell off from it, as dead branches from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61117:45"/>
the tree; that, still remaining what it ever was, and <hi>only</hi> continuing in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall visibility of succession.</p>
                        <p>Though therefore you profess never to have seen convincing proof of this in the first 400 years, &amp; labour to infringe it in the next ages, yet I will make an essay to give you a taste of those innumerable proofs of this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Consent</hi> in the Bishop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, not of <hi>Order</hi> only, but of <hi>Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over all other Bishops, in the ensuing instances, which happened within the first 400, or 500, or 600, years.</p>

his condemnation against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and to send his condemnatory letters to him, gathered a Council of his next Bishops, and sent Letters and Articles to be subscribed, with the Letters of <hi>Celestine</hi> to <hi>Nestorius</hi>: which when <hi>Nestorius</hi> had received, he was so far from repentance, that he accused St. <hi>Cyril</hi> in those Articles, to be guilty of the Heresie of <hi>Apollinaris:</hi> so that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> being also accused of Heresie, was barred from pronouncing sentence against <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> so long as he stood charged with that Accusation. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eastern Church embroyled in these difficulties, writes to Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> about the assembling of a general Council at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> by <hi>Petronius</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>Bononia</hi> (as is manifest in his life written by <hi>Sigonius</hi>) Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> in his Letters to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> not only professeth his consent to the calling of that Council, but also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth in what form it was to be celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as <hi>Firmus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia</hi> testified in the Council of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Theodosius</hi> sent his Letters to assemble the Bishops both of the East and West to that Council.

                           <hi>Nestorius,</hi> but rather to put <hi>Celestines</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of him, given the year before, into execution. St. <hi>Cyril</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being constituted by <hi>Celestine</hi> his chief Legate ordinary in the East, by reason of that preheminency, and primacy of his See after that of <hi>Rome,</hi> presided in the Council: yet so, that <hi>Philip,</hi> who was only a Priest and no Bishop, by reason that he was sent <hi>Legatus à Latere</hi> from <hi>Celestine,</hi> and so supplied his place as he was chief Bishop of the Church, subscribed the first, even before St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and all the other Legats and Patriarchs. In the sixth Action of this holy Council, <hi>Iuvenalis</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> having understood the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who was cited before the Council, shewed of the Bishops and the Popes Legats there assembled, expressed himself against him in these words, <hi>Quod Apostolica ordinatione &amp; Antiqua Traditione</hi> (which were no way opposed by the Fathers there present) <hi>Antiochena sedes perpetuo à Romana dirigere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur judicareturque,</hi> That by Apostolical ordination and ancient Tradition the See of <hi>Antioch</hi> was perpetually directed and judged by the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> which words not only evidence the precedency of place,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61117:50"/>
as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> would have it, but of power and judicature in the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over a Patriarch of the Eastern Church; and that derived from the time and ordination of the Apostles. The Council therefore sent their decrees, with their condemnation of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> to Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> who presently ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them.</p>
                        <p>Not long after this, in the year 445. <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour makes this <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festo</hi> of the most high Ecclesiastical authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> in these words:
<q>Seeing that the merit of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who is the Prince of the Episcopal Crown, and the Dignity of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no less the authority of the holy Synod, hath established the primacy of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal See, lest presumption should attempt any unlawful thing against the authority of that See, (for then finally will the peace of the Churches be preserved every where, if the whole universality acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Governour) when these things had been hitherto inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </q>
Where he makes the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches primacy; and his authority to be, not only in place,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61117:51"/>
but in power and Government over the whole visible Church: And adds present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the definitive sentence of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> given against any <hi>French</hi> Bishop, was to be of force through <hi>France,</hi> even without the Emperours Letters Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. <hi>For what shall not be lawful for the authority of so great a Bishop to exercise upon the Churches?</hi> And then adds his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial precept, in these words.
<q>But this occasion hath provoked also our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that hereafter it shall not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, neither for <hi>Hilarius</hi> (whom to be still entituled a Bishop, the sole humanity of the meek Prelate (<hi>id est,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) permits) neither for any other to mingle arms with Ecclesiastical matters, or to resist the commands of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. We define by this our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual decree, that it shall neither be lawful for the <hi>French</hi> Bishops, nor for those of other Provinces, against the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custom, to attempt any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authority of the venerable Pope of the eternal City: But let it be for a law to them and to all, whatsoever the authority of the Apostolick See hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, or shall determine.

And the same <hi>Philip, Act.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 330. proceeds in this manner, Nulli dubium, imo saeculis omnibus notum est, quod sanctus beatissimusque Petrus, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolorum Princeps &amp; caput, <hi>Fideique columna, Ecclesiae Catholicae Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> à Domino nostro Jesu Christo, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatore generis humani ac redemptore nostro claves regni accepit, solvendique ac ligandi peccata potestas ipsi data est; qui <hi>ad hoc usque tempus ac semper</hi> in suis successoribus vivit &amp; <hi>judicium exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet:</hi> —Hujus itaque secundum ordinem

And <hi>Arcadius</hi> another of the Popes Legats en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing against the Heretick <hi>Nestorius,</hi> accuses him, (though he was Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which this Council requires to be next in dignity after <hi>Rome</hi>) as of a great crime,<note place="margin">For the age 600. See St. <hi>Gregory</hi> Pope, <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>ep.</hi> 30. where He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Shisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived then into the Church, upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and publike protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would never any more separate <hi>from,</hi> but alwaies remain <hi>in</hi> the unity of the Catholike Church, and communion in all things with the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </note> that he <hi>contemned the command of the Apostolick See,</hi> that is, of Pope <hi>Celestine.</hi> Now had Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> had no power to command him (and by the like reason to command all other Bishops) he had committed no fault in transgressing and contemning his command. By these testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies it will appear, that what you are pleased to say, <hi>That the most part of the Catholike Church hath been against us to this day, and all for many hundred of years,</hi> is far from truth: seeing in the time of the holy Oecumenical Councils of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the universal consent of the whole Catholike Church was for us in this point.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61117:53"/>As to what you say of <hi>Congregation of Christians</hi> in the beginning, I answer, I took the word <hi>Christians</hi> in a large sense, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending in it all those (as it is vulgarly taken) who are Baptized and profess to believe in Christ, and are distinguished from Jews, Mahumetans and Heathens, under the denomination of <hi>Christians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What you often say of an universal Monarch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if you take Monarch for an Imperious <hi>sole Commander,</hi> as temporal Kings are, we acknowledge no such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the Church: if only for one who hath received power from Christ, in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, charity, and humility to govern all the rest, for their own eternal good, as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren or children, we grant it.</p>
                        <p>What also you often repeat of a <hi>Vice-Christ,</hi> we much dislike that title, as proud and insolent, and utterly disclaim from it; neither was it ever given by any sufficient Authority to our Popes, or did they ever accept of it.</p>
                        <p>As to the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver questioned the Supremacy of the Pope, as <hi>ordinary chief Governour</hi> of all Bishops and people in the whole Church: nay they expresly give it to <hi>Martinus Quintus,</hi> when he was chosen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61117:53"/>But in extraordinary cases, especially when it is doubtful who is true Pope, as it was in the beginning of this Council, till <hi>Martinus Quintus</hi> was chosen: Whether any extraordinary power be in a general Council, above that ordinary power of the Pope: which is a question disputed by some amongst our selves, but touches not the matter in hand; which proceeds only of the ordinary and constant Supream Pastor of all Christians, abstracting from extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tribunals and powers, which are seldom found in the Church, and collected only occasionally, and upon extraordinary accidents.</p>
                        <p>Thus honoured Sir, I have as much as my occasions would permit me, hastened a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to your answer; and if more be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, it shall not be denyed.

                     <p>THough I am a stranger to you, I thought meet to take notice of the Letters which you sent your friend here (<hi>T. H.</hi>) It seems you urge hard for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and intimate somewhat of triumph in my delay: you speak as an incompetent Judge. God is the Master of my time and work; and him I must serve: and not neglect his greater work, for such trivial objections as your friend hath sent me, which are answered over and over by many so long ago. Had you read <hi>Blondel, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineus de novitate Papismi, Whitaker, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandus, Lubbertus, Chamier, Abbots, Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenthorp, Spalatensis,</hi> or one of many that have confuted them, you would sure call for no more: Or if in <hi>English</hi> you had read Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Dr. <hi>White</hi>; yea, or but Sir <hi>Humphery Lind</hi> (to pass by multitudes) you might have seen their vanity. Yea plainly read impartially my two books
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61117:56"/>
against Popery, and be a Papist if you can. But it seems you take it for a poor answer to be referred to books. Do not fear it. But yet let me tell you, that my hand is not more legible then my printed books: and if I had sent you this in print, would that have made it a poor answer? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not this a poor exception, and shews that it is not truth that is look after: for truth may be printed as well as written. If you be deceived by the men of the Papal way, let me yet intreat you, but to read over those two books (The safe Religion, and the Key for Catholikes): If your soul be not worth so much labour, take your course: I did my duty.</p>
                     <p>But I must say, that it is doleful case that professors are so ungrounded, that such vanities should carry them away from Catholike verity and unity, to a faction that usurps the name of Catholikes. To be free with you, I think it is that pride and levity that brings them first to separation from our Churches into Sects, and the guilt which they there incur, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth professors to be so far forsaken of God, as to be given up to believe a lie, and to turn Papists.</p>
                     <p>O dreadful case! that one Bishop can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61117:57"/>
swell in pride, but men must make a Religion of his pride! yea and make a Catholike Church of it! yea and plead for it, and make the sin their own; yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all Christians that list not themselves under this Prince of pride. He is culpably, if not wilfully blind, that hath read Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Church history, and knoweth not, that the Pope for three hundred years after Christ, was not the creature that now he is; nor had for most of that time any more Government over other Bishops, then I have over neighbour Pastors: and after that time, he was no more an universal Head, or Governour, or Vicar of Christ, then the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having indeed a far larger Diocess then he, but never was more then the swelled Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of one National (Imperial) Church. When Synods began to be gathered out of a Principality (the Emperours desiring that means of unity within their Empire), the pride of the Prelates set them presently a striving for superiority, who should sit highest, and write his name first, and have the largest Diocess, <hi>&amp;c</hi>! And now men make a Religion of the fruits of this abominable pride. What are all their disputings for, and all this stir that they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61117:57"/>
make in the world, but to set up one man over all the earth? and that to do a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all work, which consisteth not with force, but is managed on conscience: One wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man must govern the Antipodes on the other side of the earth, that is indeed uncapable of truly and justly Governing the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. Popes, that their own Councils have condemned for ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maids and wives at their doors, for Murders, Simony, Drunkenness, Heresie, denying the Resurrection and the life to come (that is, being no Christians) these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth must be the universal Governours, or we are all undone; and we are damned if we believe it not: O how dreadfull are the effects of sin; and how great a judgement is a blinded mind! This comes of falling into Sects and parties, which leads men into the gulf of the most odious Schism (even Popery) in the world.</p>
                     <p>But if you are engaged in this party, its two to one but you are presently made partial, and will not so much as read what is against them; or will believe them if they do but tell you that we write lies; when they are things done in the open sun, and which they cannot confute, nor dare attempt, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I confess, I have little hopes of turning any of them, though I could shew it them written by an Angel from heaven that Popery is a deceit: for the Scripture that's above Angelical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity declareth it; and by making it a nose of wax, they take it as if it were not sense, nor intelligible without the Popes interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (which in difficult cases he dare not give). They cry up <hi>the Church,</hi> and when we would have them stand to the Church, they shamefully turn their backs; and when two or three parts of the Churches through the world are against the Papal Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they refuse them as Hereticks or Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. They cry up <hi>Tradition,</hi> and when we offer them in the main point to be tried by it, they disclaim the Tradition of two or three parts of the universal Church as being all Hereticks. And may not any Sect do so too as honestly as they? yea among the ignorant that know not Chaffe from Corn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them that <hi>their Church</hi> is the <hi>greater half</hi> of the Christian world! when they know they speak notoriously falsly, or else they are unworthy to speak of such things that they understand not.</p>
                     <p>But to what purpose should any words be used with men, that have taught so great a part of the world, not to believe their eyes and other senses! Can any writing make any matter plainer to you, then that Bread is Bread, and Wine is Wine, when you see them, and tast, and eat, and drink them? And yet their general Councils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Pope, have made it an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their faith, that the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Bread and Wine is turned into the Body and Blood of Christ, so that there is left no Bread or Wine, but only that colour, quantity and tast that before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it. And if you know not Bread when you eat it, or Wine when you drink it, and when the senses of all the sound men in the world concur with yours, is it not vain for me, or any man to dispute with you? Can you have any thing brought to a surer judgement then to all your senses? And yet no doubt but your seducers can say something to prove that Bread is not Bread when you see and eat it: No wonder
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61117:59"/>
then if they can confute me. But do they indeed believe themselves? how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? there is no exercise of reason, and belief that supposeth not the certainty of sense. If I cannot know Bread and Wine when I see, touch, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ast them; then cannot I know the Pope, the Councils, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the Priest, or any thing else. If you think to let go this point of Popery and hold the rest, you know not what Popery is: for a Pope and Council having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, you are damned by them for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the faith: and if you depart from the infallibility of their Rule and judge in points of faith, or at least from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in one thing, they will confess to you that you may as well do it in more; <hi>False in this, and certain in nothing,</hi> is their own conclusion. Sir, I have not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to know the truth, having a soul to save or lose as well as you, and having as much reason to be loth to perish. If you have so far forfeited the Grace of God, as meerly to follow the pride of a pretended <hi>Vice-Christ</hi> (that hath turned doctrine into error, worship into superstition and dead formality, light into darkness, discipline into confusion mixt with tyranny); if meerly to set up one Tyrant over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences

(and bodies too) of all believers in the world, you can fall into a Sect, deny Scripture, Reason, the Judgement and Tradition of most of the Church, and your own and all mens eye-sight, tast and other senses, the Lord have mercy on you, if you be not past it: I have done with you, yet remaining</p>

                           <hi>The Reader must take notice that I wrote the former Letter to the person that sent Mr.</hi> Johnsons <hi>Letters, with a charitable jealousie, that if he were himself in doubt, he might be resolved: But in his return he fully disclaimed Popery, and assured me, that it is for the sake of some friends that he desired my labour, and not for his own.</hi>

                  <p>THE multitude and urgency of my employments gave me not leave till this day (<hi>May</hi> 2.) so much as to read over all your Papers; But I shall be as loth to break off our Disputation, as you can be, though perhaps necessity may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cause some weeks delay. And again, I profess, my indignation against the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crital Jugling of this age, doth provoke me to welcome so ingenuous and candid a disputant as your self, with great content. But I must confess also, that I was the less hasty in sending you this Reply, because I desired you might have leisure to peruse a Book which I published since your last, (A Key for Catholikes;) seeing that I have there answered you already, and that more largely then I am like to do in this Reply.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61117:61"/>
For the sharpness of that I must crave your patience; the persons and cause I thought required it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. What explications were made to your Friend of your <hi>Thesis,</hi> I could not take notice of, who had nothing but your writing to Answer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you will not be precise in Arguing, you had little reason to expect (much less so strictly to exact) a precise Answer; which cannot be made as you prescribed, to an Argument not precise.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I therefore expect accordingly that the unlearned be not made the Judges of a dispute which they are not fit to judge of; seeing you desire us to avoid their road.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again I say, if you will not be precise in arguing, I can hardly be so in answering. And by [<hi>a Congregation of Christians</hi>] you may mean [<hi>Christians politically related to one Head,</hi>] whether Christ, or the Pope: But the word [<hi>Assemblies</hi>] expresseth their actuall <hi>Assembling</hi> together, and so excludeth all Christians that are or were Members of no particular assemblies, from having Relation as Members of Christ (our Head) or the Pope (your Head,) and so from being of the <hi>Congregation,</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61117:61"/>
as you Call, <hi>The Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I had great reason to avoid the snare of an equivocation, or ambiguity, of which you gave me cause of jealousie by your [<hi>whatsoever</hi>] as I told you: as seeming to intimate a false supposition: To your <hi>Like,</hi> I answer, <hi>it is unlike,</hi> and still more intimates the false supposition. [<hi>Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Congregation of men is the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of England</hi>] is a phrase that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that [<hi>There is a Congregation of men which is not the Common-wealth of England.</hi>] Which is true, there being more men in the world. So [<hi>whatsoever Congregation of Christians is now the true Church</hi>] doth seem to import, that you suppose [<hi>there is a Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (univocally so called) <hi>that are not the true Church</hi>] which you would distinguish from the other: Which I only let you know at the entrance, that I deny, that you may not think it granted.</p>
                  <p>Yet I must tell you that nothing is more ordinary then for the <hi>Body</hi> to be said to do that which a part of it only doth; As that [<hi>the Church administreth Sacraments, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Teatheth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Church is assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in such a Council</hi> &amp;c.] when yet it is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61117:62"/>
but a <hi>small part of the Church</hi> that doth these things. And when <hi>Bellarmine, Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi> &amp;c. say [<hi>the Church is the infallible judge of Controversies of faith,</hi>] they mean not [<hi>the whole Church</hi>] which containeth every Christian, when they tell you that <hi>It is the Pope</hi> they mean. and therefore I had reason to enquire into your sense, unless I would willfully be over-reacht.</p>
                  <p>You now satisfie me that you mean it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, viz. [<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll that Congregation</hi> (or Church) <hi>of Christians which is now the true Church of Christ, doth acknowledge,</hi> &amp;c.] which I told you I deny.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To my following distinction you say [<hi>that all the world knows that whatsoever is acknowledged to have been ever in the Church by Christs instiution, cannot be meant of any accidental thing, but of a necessary unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and essentiall thing, in Christs true Church,</hi>] To which I Reply, Either you see the gross fallacy of this defence, or you do not: If you do not, then never more call for an exact Disputant, nor look to be delivered from your errors by argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though never so convincing. If you do, then you are not faithfull to the truth. In your Major proposition the words <hi>being</hi> many (as you say, you <hi>penetrated</hi> divers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61117:62"/>
arguments together,) ambiguities were the easier hidden in the heap. That which I told you is Accidental to the Church (and that but to a corrupted part) was [the <hi>Acknowledging</hi> of the Papacy as of Christs Institution,] and therefore if it were granted that a thing [<hi>of Christs Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>] could not be <hi>Accidental,</hi> yet [the <hi>Acknowledgment</hi>] that is, the <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>asserting</hi> of it may. If the Church by mistake should think that to be Essential to it which is not, though it will not thence follow that its <hi>Essence</hi> is but an <hi>Accident,</hi> yet it will follow that both the <hi>false opinion,</hi> and the <hi>thing it self</hi> so falsly conceited to be essential, are but accidents, or not essential. You say [<hi>It cannot be meant of any Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal thing</hi>] But 1. That Meaning it self of theirs may be an Accident. 2. And the question is not what they [<hi>Mean,</hi> that is, <hi>Imagine or affirm</hi>] it to be; But what <hi>it is</hi> in deed and truth. That may <hi>be an Accident,</hi> which they think to be none.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which you say [<hi>all the world knows</hi>] is a thing that [<hi>all the world of Christians except your selves,</hi>] that ever I heard of, do know, or acknowledge to be false. What! doth all the world know that Christ hath instituted in his Church
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61117:63"/>
nothing but what is essential to it? I should hope that few in the Christian world would be so ignorant as ever to have such a thought, if they had the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Protestants would have them have. There is no natural body but hath natural Accidents as well as Essence: Nor is there any other society under heaven <hi>(Community or Policy)</hi> that hath not its Accidents as well as Essence: And yet hath Christ instituted, <hi>a Church</hi> that hath nothing but <hi>Essence</hi> without <hi>Accidents</hi>? Do you build upon such foundations? What! upon the denyal of common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and sence? But if you did, you should not have feigned all the world to do so too. Were your asseriton true, then every soul were cut off from the Church, and so from salvation, that wanted any thing of Christs Institution, yea for a moment. And then what would become of you. You give me an instance in [<hi>the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi>] But 1. Will it follow that if the <hi>Eucharist</hi> be not Accidental or integral, but Essential, that therefore <hi>every thing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi> by Christ is Essentiall? surely no? 2. The Question being not whether the Being of the Eucharist in the Church be Essential to the Universal Church: But
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61117:63"/>
whether the <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of it by All and every one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, be Essential to the Members? I would crave your answer but to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (though it be nothing to my cause.) Was not a Baptized person in the primitive and ancient Churches a true Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, presently upon Baptism? And then tell me also, Did not the ancient Fathers and Churches unanimously hide from their Catechumens, even <hi>purposely hide,</hi> the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the Eucharist, as proper to the Church of understand? and never opened it to the auditors, till they were Baptized? This is most undenyable in the concurrent vote of the ancients. I think therefore that it follows that in the Judgement of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches the Eucharist was but of the Integrity, and not the Essence of a member of the Church; and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of it by all the members, a thing that never was existent.</p>
                  <p>Where you say, your <hi>Major should have been granted or denyed without these distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>: I Reply, 1. If you mean fairly, and not to abuse the truth by Confusion, such distinctions as you your self call [<hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and substantial</hi>] can do you no wrong. They do but secure our true understanding
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61117:64"/>
of one another: And a few lines in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by way of distinction are not vain, that may prevent much vain altercation afterwards. When I once understand you, I have done: And I beseech you, take it not for an injury to be understood.</p>
                  <p>As to your conclusion, that you <hi>used no fallacy ex Accidente,</hi> and <hi>that my instances are not apposite</hi>; I Reply, thats the very life of the Controversie between us: And our <hi>main Question</hi> is not so to be <hi>begged.</hi> On the grounds I have shewed you, I still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr, that [<hi>the holding of the Papacy is as Accidental to the universal Church, as a Cancer in the breast is to a woman;</hi>] And though you <hi>say, It is Essential,</hi> and <hi>of Christs Institution,</hi> that <hi>maketh</hi> it neither Essential, nor of Christs Institution; nor doth it make all his institutions to be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls.</p>
                  <p>Now of your second Syllogism. 1. I shall never question the successive Visibility of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Whereas I told you out of your <hi>Fransc. à S. Clara,</hi> that many or most of your own Schoolmen agree not to that which you say [<hi>All Christians agree to,</hi>] you make <hi>no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to your Minor, I have given you the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61117:64"/>
of the necessity and harmlesness of my distinctions: we need say no more to that [<hi>a Congregation of Christians</hi>] and [<hi>a Church</hi>] are Synonima: But the word [<hi>true</hi>] was not added to your first term by you or me; and therefore your instance here is delusory. But to say [<hi>whatsoever Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is now the true Church</hi>] is all one as to say <hi>whatsoever Church of Christians is now the true Church.</hi>] When I know your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have my end.</p>
                  <p>Though my syllogism say not that [<hi>the Church of Rome acknowledgeth those things alwaies done, and that by Christs institution</hi>] it nevertheless explicateth the weakness of yours, as to the fallacy <hi>accidentis:</hi> For 1. The holding it <hi>alwaies done,</hi> and that <hi>of</hi> Christs <hi>Institution,</hi> may be either an Accident, or but of the Integrity, and <hi>ad bene esse,</hi> yea possibly an errour. 2. And I might as easily have given you Instances of that kind.</p>
                  <p>To your 3. Syllogism I Reply. 1. When you say the Church [<hi>had Pastors</hi>] as you must speak of what <hi>existed,</hi> (and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls exist not of themselves) so it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that I tell you, How far I grant your Minor, and how far I deny it.</p>
                  <p>My argument from the Indians and others, is not solved by you. For 1. You
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61117:65"/>
can never prove that the Pope was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Iberians by the Captive maid, nor to the Indians by <hi>Frumentius.</hi> 2. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands were made Christians and baptized by the Apostles, without any preaching or profession of a papacy, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; passim.</hi> 3. The Indians now Converted in <hi>America</hi> by the English and Dutch, hear nothing of the Pope, nor thousands in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> 4. Your own do or may baptize many without their owning the Pope, who yet would be Christians. And a Pastor not known, or believed, or owned, is actually no Pastor to them.</p>
                  <p>To your confirmation, I Reply: You misread my words: I talk not of [<hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi>] I say it is true that the Universal Church is united to Christ as their univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Head: and is Visible 1. In the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 2. In the Profession. 3. Christ himself is visible in the Heavens, and as much <hi>seen</hi> of most of the Church as the Pope is, that is, <hi>not at all.</hi> As the Pope is not Invisible, though one of a million see him not, no more is Christ, who is seen by most of the Church, and by the best part, even by the glorified. You know my meaning: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will Call Christ visible or not, I leave to you: I think he is visible: But
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61117:65"/>
that which I affirm, is, that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church hath no other visible univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Head or Pastor: But particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have their particular Pastors all under Christ.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. I easily grant that the whole Church may be said to have Pastors, in that all the particular Churches have Pastors. But I deny that the whole have any one u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Pastor but Christ. Of that which is the point in controversie, you bring no proof. If you mean no more then I grant, that the whole Church hath Pastors both in that each particular Church hath Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and in that unfixed Pastors are to preach to all as they have opportunity, then your Minor hath no denyall from me.</p>
                  <p>Instead of prosecuting your Argument, when you had cast the work of an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent upon me, you here appeal [<hi>to any true Logician or expert Lawyer</hi>] Content; I admit of your Appeal. But why then did you at all put on the face of an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent? could you not without this lost labour at first have called me to prove the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive visibility of our Church? But to your Appeal, <hi>Ho all you true Logicians, this Learned man and I refer it to your tribunal,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61117:66"/>
whether it be the part of an Opponent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his Argument so as that the Negative shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is, and then change places, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Respondent, and make his adversary Opponent at his Pleasure.</hi>] We leave this cause at your bar, and expect your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>But before we come to the Lawyers bar, I must have leave more plainly to state our case.</p>
                  <p>We are all agreed that Christianity is the true Religion, and Christ the Churches Universal Head; and the holy Scriptures the Word of God. Papists tell us of another Head and Rule; the Pope and Tradition, and judgement of the Church. Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants deny these <hi>Additionals,</hi> and hold to <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Scripture only; Our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> being nothing but <hi>Christianity,</hi> we have no Controversie about: <hi>Their Papall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, superadded,</hi> is that which is Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: They affirm 1. the <hi>Right.</hi> 2. the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it: We deny both: The <hi>Right</hi> we <hi>disprove</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> though it belongs to them to <hi>prove</hi> it. The <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> is it that is now to be referred. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy being the Denyall of Popery, it is <hi>we</hi> that <hi>Really</hi> have the <hi>Negative,</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> that have the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61117:66"/>
                     <hi>Essence of our Church</hi> (which is <hi>Christian</hi>) is confessed to have been successively vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: But <hi>we</hi> deny that <hi>theirs</hi> as Papal hath been so; and now they tell us, that it is <hi>Essential</hi> to ours to deny the succession of <hi>theirs,</hi> and therefore require us to prove a succession of ours, as one that still hath <hi>denyed theirs</hi>: Now we leave our case to the Lawyers, seeing to them you make your appeal, 1. Whether the substance of all our cause lie not in this Question, <hi>Whether the Papacy or universal Government by the Pope, be of heaven, or of men?</hi> and so <hi>whether it hath been from the beginning?</hi> which <hi>we deny,</hi> and therefore are called <hi>Protestants</hi>; and <hi>they affirm,</hi> and are therefore called <hi>Papists.</hi> 2. If they cannot <hi>first prove</hi> a <hi>successive visibility</hi> of their <hi>Papacy</hi> and Papal Church, then what Law can bind us to prove that it was <hi>denied,</hi> before it did <hi>arise</hi> in the world, or ever any pleaded for it? 3. And as to the point of Possession, I know not what can be pretended on your side. 1. The Possession of this or that particular Parish Church or Tythes, is not the thing in question; but the <hi>universal Headship</hi> is the thing: But if it were, yet it is I that am yet here in Possession; and Protestants before me for many ages suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61117:67"/>
And when possessed you the Headship of the <hi>Ethiopian, Indian,</hi> and other extra-imperial Churches? never to this day. No nor of the Eastern Churches, though you had communion with them. 2. If the Question be, who hath Possession of the <hi>universal Church</hi>; we pretend not to it; but only to be a part, and the soundest safest part. 3. The case of Possession therefore is, whether we have not been longer in Possession of our Religion, which is bare Christianity, then you of your su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded Popery. Our Possession is not denied, of Christianity. Yours of Popery we deny: (and our denyal makes us called Protestants): Let therefore the reason of Logicians, Lawyers, or any rational sober man determine the case, whether it do not first and principally belong to you, to prove the visible succession of a Vice-Christ over the universal Church.</p>
                  <p>As to your contradictory impositions I Reply, 1. Your exception was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, and your imposition was peremptory. 2. I told you I would be a Papist if you prove [<hi>that the whole visible Church in all ages hath held the Popes universal headship</hi>] you say that you [<hi>have proved it by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that either he hath that supremacy,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61117:67"/>
or some other Church; denying that he hath alwaies had it, hath been alwaies visible,</hi>] and that Church you require should be named. I Reply, 1. Had not you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of making good your cause, you should have gone on by Argumentation, till you had forced me to contradict some common principle. 2. If you should shew these Papers to the world, and tell them that you have no better proof of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of your Papacy, then that we prove not that it hath alwaies been denied by the visible Church, you would sure turn thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands from Popery, if there be so many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional considering impartial men that would peruse them, and believe you. For any man may know that it could not be expected that the Churches should deny a Vice-Christ before he was sprung up. Why did not all the precedent <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops disclaim the title of <hi>universal Bishop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,</hi> till <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi>? but because there was none in the world that gave occasion for it. How should any Heresie be opposed or condemned before it doth arise?</p>
                  <p>But you fairly yield me somewhat here, and say that you <hi>[oblige me not to prove a continued visible Church formally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61117:68"/>
denying it; but that it was of such a constitution as was inconsistent with any such supremacy, or could and did subsist without it.] Reply,</hi> I confess your first part is very ingenuous and fair. Remember it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that you have discharged me from proving [<hi>a Church that denied the Papacy formally &amp; expresly.</hi>] But as to what you yet demand. 1. I have here given it you, because you shall not say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'le sail you: I have answered your desire. But 2. It is not as a thing necessary, but <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> as an overplus. For you may now see plainly, that to prove that the Church was without an universal Pastor, (which you require) is to prove the Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that then there <hi>was none such</hi>; whereas its you that must prove that there <hi>was such.</hi> I prove our Religion: do you prove yours: though I say to pleasure you, I'le disprove it, and have done it in two books already.</p>
                  <p>My reason from the stress of necessity, which you lay on your Affirmative and Additions, was but subservient to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Reasons,</hi> not <hi>first</hi> to prove you <hi>bound,</hi> but to prove you the <hi>more bound</hi> to the proof of your Affirmative. And therefore your instance of Mahumetans is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. He that saith, you shall be damned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61117:68"/>
if you believe not this or that, is <hi>more obliged</hi> to prove it, then he that affirmeth a point as of no such moment.</p>
                  <p>To what I say of an <hi>accident</hi> and a <hi>corrupt part,</hi> you <hi>say you have answered,</hi> and do <hi>but say so,</hi> having said nothing to it that is considerable.</p>
                  <p>Me thinks you that make Christ to be corporally present in every Church in the Eucharist, should not say, that the King of the Church is <hi>absent.</hi> But when you have proved, 1. That Christ is so absent from his Church, that there's need of a Deputy to essentiate his Kingdom, and 2. That the Pope is so <hi>Deputed</hi>; you will have done more then is yet done for your cause. And yet let me tell you, that in the absence of a King, it is only the King and Subjects that are essential to the Kingdom. The Deputy is but an officer, and not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>naked assertion,</hi> that <hi>whatsoever Government Christ instituteth, of his Church, must be essential to his Church,</hi> is no proof, nor like the task of an Opponent. The Government of inferiour officers is not essential to the universal Church, no more then Judges and Justices to a Kingdom. And yet we must wait long before you will
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61117:69"/>
prove that <hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> are in Christs place, as Governours of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I desire open dealing, as between men that believe these matters are of eternal consequence. I watch not for any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against you. Though it be your part to prove the Affirmative which our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative supposeth; yet I have begun the proof of our Negative; but it was on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that you will equally now prove your Affirmative, better then you have here done. I have proved a visible Church successively that <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld not</hi> the Popes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Government do you now prove [<hi>that the universal Church in all ages did hold the Popes universal Government</hi>] which is your part; or I must say again, I shall think you do but run away, and give up your cause as unable to defend it: I have not failed you; do not you fail me.</p>
                  <p>You complain of a deficiency in quality, though you confess that I abound in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But where is the defect! you say, I must <hi>[assert both that these were one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and ever visible since Christs time] Reply,</hi> If by [<hi>one Congregation</hi>] you meant [<hi>one assembly met for personal Communion</hi>]
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61117:69"/>
which is the <hi>first sense</hi> of the word [<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>] it were ridiculous to feign the universal Church to be such. If you mean, <hi>One as united in one visible humane Head,</hi> thats it that we deny, and therefore may not be required to prove. But that these Churches are <hi>One as united in Christ the Head,</hi> we easily prove; In that from him <hi>the whole family is named</hi>; the <hi>body is Christs body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. <hi>and one in him,</hi> Eph. 4.4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All that are true Christians are one Kingdom or Church of Christ; but these of whom I speak are true Christians; therefore they are one Kingdom or Church of Christ. And that they have been visible since Christs time till now, all history, even your own affirms: As in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> &amp; from the Apostles times, in <hi>Ethiopia, Egypt</hi> and other parts, (<hi>Rome</hi> was no Church in the time of Christs being on earth.) And to what purpose talk you of <hi>determinate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi>? Do you mean individual assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? those cease when the persons die; or do you mean assemblies meeting in the same place? so they have not done still at <hi>Rome.</hi> I told you, and tell you still, that we hold not that God hath secured the perpetual visibility of his Church in any one City or Country: but if it cease in one
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61117:70"/>
place, it is still in others. It may cease at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> at <hi>Philippi, Colosse,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Tenduc, Nubia,</hi> &amp;c. and yet remain in other parts. I never said that the Church <hi>must needs</hi> be visible still in one Town or Country. And yet it <hi>hath been so de facto,</hi> as in <hi>Asia, Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi> &amp;c. But you say, <hi>I nominate none.</hi> Are you serious! must I <hi>nominate</hi> Christians of these Nations, to prove that there were such? you require not this of the Church Historians. It sufficeth that they tell you, that <hi>Ethiopia, Egypt, Armenia, Syria,</hi> &amp;c. had Christians, without naming them. When all history tells you that these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were Christians, or had Churches, I must tell you [<hi>what and who they were</hi>]! must you have their names, sirnames, and Genealogies? I cannot name you one of a thousand in this small Nation, in the age I live in: How then should I name you the people of <hi>Armenia, Abassia,</hi> &amp;c. so long ago? You can name but few of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in each age: And had they wanted learning and records as much as the Abassins and Indians, and others, you might have been as much to seek for names as they. You ask <hi>[were they different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations?] Answ.</hi> As united in Christ they were <hi>one Church</hi>: but as assembling
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61117:70"/>
at one time, or in one place, or under the same guide, so they were <hi>not one,</hi> but divers Congregations.</p>
                  <p>That there were any Papists of 400. years after Christ, do you prove if you are able.</p>
                  <p>My conclusion, that <hi>all have been against you for many hundred years,</hi> must stand good, till you prove that some were for you: yet I have herewith proved that there were none, at least that could deserve the name of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Do you think to satisfie any reasonable man by calling for positive proof from Authors, of such Negatives? yet proof you shall not want, such as the nature of the point requireth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the said Churches; of <hi>Ethiopia, India,</hi> the outer <hi>Armenia,</hi> and other extra-imperial Nations, were not under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 1. You find all these Churches, or most of them at this day (that remain) from under your jurisdiction: and you cannot tell us when or how they turned from you. If you could, it had been done. 2. These Nations profess it to be their Tradition, that the Pope was never their Governour. 3. No history or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the least regard, is brought by your own writers to prove these Churches
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61117:71"/>
under your jurisdiction: no not by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> himself, that is so copious, and so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in making much of nothing. No credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble witnesses mention your Acts of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over them, or their Acts of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which Church history must needs have contained, if it had been true, that they were your subjects. 4. Their absence from general Councils, and no invitation of them thereunto, (that was ever proved, or is shewed by you) is sufficient evidence. 5. Their Liturgies, even the most ancient, bear no footsteps of any subjection to you. Though your forgeries have corrupted them: as I shall here (digressively) give one instance of: The Ethiopick Liturgy, because of a [<hi>Hoc est corpus meum</hi>] which we also use, is urged to prove that they are for the corporal presence, or Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: But saith <hi>Vsher, de success. Eccles. In Ethiopicarum Ecclesiarum universali Canone, descriptum habebatur [Hic panis est corpus meum]: In Latina translatione contra fidem Ethiopic. Exemplarium (ut in prima operis editione confirmat Pontificius ipse Scholiastes) expunctum est nomen [Panis.]</hi> 6. <hi>Constantines</hi> Letters of request to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> for the Churches there (which <hi>Euseb. in vit. Constant.</hi> mentioneth)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61117:71"/>
do intimate that then the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop ruled not there. 7. Even at home, the Scots and Brittains obeyed not the Pope, nor conformed about the Easter observation, even in the daies of <hi>Gregory</hi>; but resisted his changes, and refused communion with his Ministers. 8. I have already elsewhere given you the testimony of some of your own writers: as <hi>Reynerius contra Waldens. Catal. in Biblioth. Patr. Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 773. saying [<hi>The Churches of the Armenians, and Ethiopians, and Indians, and the rest which the Apostles converted, are not under the Church of</hi> Rome.] 9. I have proved from the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that it was the Fathers, that is, the Councils that gave <hi>Rome</hi> its preheminence: But those Councils gave the Pope no preheminence over the extra-imperial Nations: For 1. Those Nations being not called to the Council, could not be bound by it. 2. The Emperours called and enforced the Councils, who had no power out of their Empire. 3. The Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess are described and expresly confined within the verge of the Empire; see both the description, and full proof in <hi>Blondel de Primatu in Ecclesia. Gall.</hi> And 10. The Emperours themselves did sometime (give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to the Councils Acts) make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61117:72"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> the chief; and sometime (as the Councils did also) give <hi>Constantinople</hi> equal priviledge; and sometime set <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> highest, as I have shewed in my <hi>Key,</hi> p. 174, 175. But the Emperours had no power to do thus with respect to those without the Empire.</p>
                  <p>But what say you now to the contrary? Why 1. You ask, [<hi>Were those Primitive Christians of another kind of Church order and Government then were those under the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire</hi>?] <hi>Answ.</hi> When the whole body of Church history satisfieth us that they were not subject to the Pope, which is the thing in question, is it any weakening of such evidence in a matter of such publick fact, to put such a question as this, <hi>Whether they were under another kind of Government</hi>? 1. We know that they were under Bishops or Pastors of their own: and so far their Government was of the same kind. 2. If any of them, or all, did suit their Church associations to the several Commonwealths in which they lived, and so held National Councils, and for order sake made one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the Bishop <hi>primae sedis,</hi> then was that Government of the same kind with that of the Imperial Churches, and not of another kind. The <hi>Roman</hi> Government
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61117:72"/>
was no other, but <hi>One,</hi> thus <hi>Ordered,</hi> in <hi>one Empire:</hi> And if there were also <hi>One,</hi> so ordered, in <hi>England, one in Scotland, one in Ethiopia,</hi> &amp;c. this was of the <hi>same kind</hi> with the <hi>Roman.</hi> Every Church suited to the form of the Common-wealth, is even (as to that humane mode) of the same kind (if a humane mode must be called a <hi>Kind.</hi>) It may be of that same kind, and mode, without being part of the same <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 2. You say that [<hi>How far from truth this is, appeareth from St.</hi> Leo <hi>in his Sermons</hi> de Natali suo, <hi>where he sayes,</hi> [Sedes Roma Perri; quicquid non possidet armis, Religione tenet.] <hi>Reply,</hi> If you take your Religion on trust, as you do your authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are made your ground of it, and bring others to it when you are deceived your selves, how will you look Christ in the the face when you must answer for such temerity? <hi>Leo</hi> hath no Sermons <hi>de Natali suo,</hi> but only one Sermon affixed to his Sermons, lately found in an oid book of <hi>Nicol. Fabers.</hi> And in that Sermon there is no such words as you here alledge. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he Poetize in his Sermons, nor there hath any such words which might occasion your mistake: and therefore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61117:73"/>
doubtless you believed some body for this that told you an untruth; and yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make it the ground of charging my words with untruth. Yet let me tell you, that I will take Pope <hi>Leo</hi> for no competent judge or witness, though you call him a Saint: as long as we know what past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and that he was one of the first tumified Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> he shall not be judge in his own cause.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But you add that [<hi>The Abassines of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>were under the Patriarch of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria <hi>anciently, and he under the authority of the</hi> Roman <hi>Bishop.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Your bare word without proof shall not perswade us that the Abassines were under the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, if not four hundred years after Christ. Prove it, and then your words are regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 2. At the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is manifest by the sixth Can. [<hi>Mos antiquus perdurat in Aegypto, vel Lybia &amp; Pentapoli, ut Alexandrinus Episcopus horum omnium habeat potestatem,</hi> &amp;c.] And the common descriptions of the Alexandrian Patriarchate in those times confine it to the Empire, and leave out <hi>Aethiopia</hi> (<hi>Pisanus</hi> new inventions we regard not.) 3. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61117:73"/>
that the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was under the Government of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> any more then the Jury are under the Foremen, or the junior Justices on the bench are under the senior, or <hi>York</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>London,</hi> or the other Earls of <hi>England</hi> are under the Earl of <hi>Arundel.</hi> 4. But if both these were proved, that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was under <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> under <hi>Rome,</hi> I deny the consequence, that <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> was under <hi>Rome</hi>: for <hi>Alexandria</hi> was under <hi>Rome</hi> but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> and so far as it was within the Empire, and therefore those without the Empire that were under <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were not therefore under <hi>Rome.</hi> 5. And if it could (as it never can) be proved of <hi>Abassia,</hi> what is that to all the other Churches in <hi>India, Persia,</hi> and the rest of the world? Sir, If you have impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially read the ancient Church history, and yet can believe that all these Churches were then under the Pope, despair not of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your self to believe any thing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that you would have to be true.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your next question is [<hi>When the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Emperours were yet Heathens, had not the Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>the supremacy over all other Bishops through the whole Church</hi>?] <hi>Answ.</hi> No: they had not; nor in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61117:74"/>
Empire neither. Prove it, I beseech you, better then by questioning. If you askt, <hi>Whether men rule not Angels</hi>? your Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proves not the Affirmative.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But you ask again <hi>[Did those Heathen Emperours give it him?] Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Power</hi> over all Churches none ever gave him, till titularly his own Parasites of late. 2. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> of meer degree in the Empire, for the dignity and many advantages of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial seat, the Bishops of the Empire gave him by consent (<hi>Blondel de primatu,</hi> gives you the proof and reason at large:) yet so as that [<hi>small regard was had to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>before the Nicene Council</hi>] as saith your <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. [<hi>Whether the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>had power over the Bishop of</hi> Arles <hi>by Heathen Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi>] is a frivolous question. <hi>Arles</hi> was in the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate, and not out of the Empire. The Churches in the Empire, might by consent dispose themselves into the Patriarchal orders, without the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and yet not meddle out of the Empire. Yet indeed <hi>Cyprians</hi> words inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate no power <hi>Rome</hi> had over <hi>Arles,</hi> more then <hi>Arles</hi> had over <hi>Rome</hi>: that is, to reject communion with each other upon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61117:74"/>
dissent. Nay it more confuteth you, that even under Heathen Emperours, when Church associations were by voluntary consent of Pastors only; and so if they had thought it necessary, they might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them to other Principalities: yet <hi>de facto</hi> they did not do it, as all history of the Church declareth, mentioning their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and associations, without these ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in.</p>
                  <p>See now how little your objections are worth; and how groundlesly you bid me [<hi>See now how little my allegations are to the purpose.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>As for the rabble of Hereticks which you reckon up, (as you esteem them,) some of them are no Christians univocally so called, and those cannot be of the Christian Church. Others of them were better Christians then the Romanists, and so were of the same Church with us: And it is not many reproachfull names put on them by malice that makes them no Christians, or of many Churches or Religions. If an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant usurper will put nick-names on all that will not bow to him as the Vice-Christ, and call them Iconoclasts, Berengarians, Waldensians, Albigenses, Wicklefifts, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, Lutherans, Calvinists (you may as well
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61117:75"/>
give them a thousand more names) this makes them not of various Religions, nor blots out their names from the book of life. I have in my most retired thoughts perused the History of those mens lives, and of the lives of many of your Popes, together with their severall doctrines; and with death and judgement in my eyes, as before the great God of Heaven. I humbly beg of him, that I may rather have my everlasting por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with those holy men whom you bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as Waldenses, Albigenses, Hussites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then with the Popes that burned them, or those that follow them in that cruelty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less reconciling grace have given them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life. The Religion of all these men was one, and they were all of one universall Church.</p>
                  <p>Where you again call for <hi>One Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I tell you again that we know no <hi>Vnity</hi> essentiall, from whence the Church can be called one, but either Christ or the Vice-Christ: the former only is asserted by us, and the latter also by you, which we deny: And therefore we cannot call the universall <hi>Church One,</hi> in any other formal respects, but as it is <hi>Christian,</hi> and so <hi>One</hi> in Christ. Yet have I herewith satisfied your demand, but shewed you the unreasonableness of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61117:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, beyond all reasonable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>You next enquire <hi>whether [we account]</hi> Rome <hi>and us One Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi>] I answer, the Roman Church hath <hi>two Heads,</hi> and ours <hi>but one,</hi> and thats the difference. They are Christians, and so <hi>One</hi> Church as united in Christ, with us and all other true Christians. If any so hold their Papacy and other errours as effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and practically to destroy their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, those are not Christians, and so not of the same Church as we. But those that do not so, but are so Papists, as yet to be truly and practically Christians, are and shall be of the same Church with us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or not: And your modest stile makes me hope that you and I are of one Church, though you never so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it. As <hi>Papall,</hi> we are not of your Church; thats a new Church form; But as Christian, we are and will be of it, even when you are condemning, torturing and burning us (if such persecution can stand with your Christianity.)</p>
                  <p>But you aske [<hi>Why did you then separate your selves, and remain still separate from the Communion of the Roman Church.</hi>] Answ. 1. We never separated from you as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61117:76"/>
you are Christians; We still remain of that Church as Christian, and we know (or will know) no other form; because that Scripture and primitive Churches knew no other. Either you have by Popery sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church as Christian, or not; If you have, its you that are the (damnable) Separatists. If you have not, then we are not separated from you, in respect of the form of the Christian Church. And for your <hi>other form</hi> (the Papacy) 1. Neither I, nor my Grand-father, or great grand-father did separate from it: because they never entertained it. 2. Those that did so, did but Repent of their sin, and thats no sin. We still remain separated from you as Papists, even as we are separate from such as we are commanded to avoid, for impenitency in some corrupting doctrine or scandalous sin; Whether such mens sins or their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christianity be most predominant at the heart, we know not: but till they shew Repentance we must avoid them; yet admonishing them as brethren, and not taking them as men of another Church, but as finding them unfit for our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>But O sir, what manner of dealing have we from you! must we be imprisoned,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61117:76"/>
rackt, hang'd or burn'd, if we will not believe that bread &amp; wine, are not bread and wine, contrary to our own and all mens senses; and if we will not worship them with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, and will not obey the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> in all such matters contrary to our Consciences: and then must we be chidden for separating from you, if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

What! will you blame us for not believing that all mens senses are deceived, and the greater part of Christians and their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (against you) are false, when we read, and study, and suspect our selves, and pray for light, and are willing to hear any of your reasons, but cannot force our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to believe all such things that you believe, and meerly because the Pope commands it: and when we cannot thus force our own understandings, must we be burned, or else called <hi>Separatists</hi>? would you have the <hi>Communion of our Ashes,</hi> or else say, <hi>We forsake your Communion</hi>? In your Churches we cannot have leave to come, without lying against God and our consciences, and saying, <hi>We believe</hi> what our <hi>senses contradict</hi>; and without committing that which our consciences tell us are most heynous sins. We solemnly protest that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61117:77"/>
we would do as you do, and say as you say, were it not for the love of truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and for fear of the wrath of God, and the flames of hell: but we cannot, we dare not rush upon these errours, and sell our souls to please the Pope.

                  <p>As for possessing our selves of your Bishopricks and Cures, if any particular person had personal injury in the change, being cast out without cause, they must answer for it that did it, and not I: though I never heard any thing to make me believe it.

of old maintained Heresie, and perhaps some may do so still, or rather differ from you in words, while you misunderstand each other. Did I find such errors with them as with you, yet I durst charge them on no one man that I had not reason to hold guilty of them: I dare not accuse whole Nations of your errors. But of all these things (and of <hi>Sandys</hi> words which you cite) I have spoken already in two Books, and in the latter fully proved that you differ in many points of faith, and greater things then you call Heresies in others among your selves, even your Popes, Saints, and Councils, and yet neither part is judged by you to be out of the Church.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61117:83"/>
cause you to pass so direful a doom (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority or tryal) on so great a part of the Christian world, for such a word as this, about so exceeding high a mysterie, when your Pope and Council have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a union of meanings!</p>
                  <p>And what mean you in your Margin to refer me to <hi>Nilus,</hi> as if he asserted [<hi>That the Greeks left the Communion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church upon that difference alone.</hi>] Verily Sir, in the high matters of God, this dealing is scarce fair! (pardon this plainness: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it your self.) The substance of <hi>Nilus</hi> book is about the Primacy of the Pope: The very contents prefixed to the first book are these [<hi>Oratio demonstrans non aliam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>An Oration demonstrating that there is no other cause of the dissension between the Latin and Greek Churches, then that the Pope refuseth to defer the cognisance and iudgement of that which is controverted to a general Council: but he will sit the sole Master and Iudge of the Controversie; and will have the rest as Disciples to be hearers of (or obey) his word, which is a thing aliene from the Laws and actions of the Apostles and Fathers.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>And he begins his Book (after a few words) thus, [<hi>Causa itaque hujus dissidii,</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:61117:84"/>
&amp;c. <hi>The cause therefore of this difference, as I judge, is not the sublimity of the point exceeding mans capacity: For other matters that have divers times troubled the Church, have been of the same kind: This therefore is not the cause of the dissention; much less is it the speech of the Scripture it self, which as being concise, doth pronounce nothing openly of that which is controverted. For to accuse the Scripture, is as much as to accuse God himself. But God is without all fault. But who the fault is in, any one may easily tell, that is well in his wits.</hi>] He next shews, <hi>that it is not for want of learned men on both sides, nor is it because the Greeks do claim the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> and then concludeth it as before. He maintaineth that <hi>your Pope succeedeth</hi> Peter <hi>only as a Bishop ordained by him, as many other Bishops that originally were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him in like manner do succeed him</hi>; and that his <hi>Primacy is no Governing power, nor given him by</hi> Peter, <hi>but by Princes and Councils for order sale:</hi> and this he proves at large, and makes this the main difference. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> answering his so many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might have told you this, if you had never read <hi>Nilus</hi> himself. If you say that, <hi>This point was the first cause,</hi> I deny it; but if it were true, yet was it not <hi>the only or
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61117:84"/>
chief cause</hi> afterward. The <hi>Munner</hi> of bringing in the [<hi>filioque</hi>] by Papal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without a general Council, was it that greatly offended the Greeks from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>But you say that when I have made the best of these Greeks, Armenians, Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, Protestants, I cannot deduce them successively in all ages till Christ as a <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Congregation of Christians from that which holds the Popes supremacy,</hi> which was your proposition. <hi>Reply.</hi> I have oft told you we own no universal informing Head but Christ. In respect to him I have proved to you, that is not my interest or design to prove us or them [<hi>a different Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from you as you are Christians.</hi>] Nor shall you tempt me to be so uncharitable, as to damn, or unchristen all Papists as far as you do others, incomparably safer and better then your selves. But as you are Papal, and set up a new informing head, I have proved that you differ from all the antient Churches, but yet that my cause requireth me not to make this proof, but to call you to prove your own universal succession.</p>
                  <p>You add your Reason, <hi>because these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed were at first involved in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and then fell off as dead branches.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61117:85"/>
Reply.</hi> This is but an untruth in a most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick matter of fact. All the truth is this. 1. Those Indians, Ethiopians, Persians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Empire, never fell from you, as to subjection, as never being your subjects. Prove that they were, and you have done a greater wonder then <hi>Baronius</hi> in all his <hi>Annals.</hi> 2 The Greeks, and all the rest within the Empire, without the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate, are fallen from your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (if renouncing it be a fall) but not from your subjection, having given you but a Primacy, as <hi>Nilus</hi> shews, and not a Governing pewer over them. The wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore was in the <hi>Roman</hi> branches, if the corruptions of either part may be called a withering. You that are the lesser part of the Church may easily call your selves the Tree, and the greater part (two to one) the Branches; but these beggings do but proclaim your neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>
                  <p>In good time you come to give me here at last some proof of an <hi>ancient Papacy,</hi> as you think. But first, you quite forget (or worse) that it is not a man or two in the whole world in an age, but the <hi>universal
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61117:85"/>
Church,</hi> whose judgement (and form) we are now enquiring after. You are to prove [<hi>That all the Church in every age was for the Papal universal Government</hi>] and so that none can be saved that is not.</p>

But do you in good earnest think that all such addresses, or appeals are <hi>ad superiorem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem</hi>? What more common then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal or make such addresses to any that have advantage of interest, for the relief of the oppressed? Young men appeal to the aged in Controversies: and the less learned to the more learned: and the poor to the rich, or to the favorites of such as can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. <hi>Iohns</hi> going first to <hi>Antioch</hi> was no acknowledgement of superiority. 3. But of this I must refer you to a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of <hi>Blondel</hi> against <hi>Perron, de Primatu

Much more that [<hi>therefore the Vniversall Church held the Pope then to be the Vniversall Head or Governour.</hi>] Heres nothing of Government but intreaty, and that but <hi>within the Empire,</hi> and that but upon the seeking of one distressed man that would be apt to go to those of most interest that might relieve him, and all this rejected by <hi>Acacius</hi> and the Emperour. A fair proof!</p>

In <hi>Flavianus</hi> own Epistle to <hi>Leo</hi> there are no such words, nor any other that I can find, but the word [<hi>appeal</hi>] once in one of the Emperours Epistles (as I remember) but without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning any Judge. I will not use to turn
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61117:87"/>
over Volumes thus in vain for your citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while I see you take them on trust, and do not tell me in any narrow compasse of cap. sect. or pag. where to find them. But had you found such words, 1. An appeal is oft made from a <hi>partiall</hi> to an <hi>impartiall</hi> Judge, though of equal power. 2. He might appeal to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>one</hi> of his Judges in the Council where he was to be tried, and not as <hi>alone.</hi> And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the History, that it was not the Pope, but the Council that <hi>was his Iudge.</hi> 3. The greatnesse of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Primacy of Order (not of Jurisdiction) made that Bishop of speciall interest in the Empire: and distressed persecuted men will appeal to those that may any whit relieve them. But this proves no Governing power, nor so much as any Interest without the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                  <p>It being the custome of the Churches in the Empire, to make the Votes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs necessary in their general Councils, no wonder if appellations be made from those Councils that wanted the Patriarchs consent to other Councils where they cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of this whole matter <hi>Perron</hi> is fully answered already by <hi>Blondell de primatu, cap.</hi> 25. <hi>sect.</hi> 63. to which I refer you, it being as easie to read it in Print as Writing. Adding this only, that as <hi>Flavian</hi> (in his necessity) seeking help from the Bishop of the prime Seat in the Empire, did acknowledge no more but his Primacy of Order by the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and the Councils thereof, so the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was not all the world, nor <hi>Flavian</hi> all the Church, nor any more then one man, and therefore if he had held (as you will never prove he did) the Universall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope, if you would thence argue that it was held by all the Church, your consequence must needs be marvelled at, by them that believe that One man is not the Catholick Church, no more then seeking of help was an acknowledging an Universal Headship or Governing power.</p>
                  <p>And it is undeniably evident, that the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and all the Greek Churches did believe that Universal Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which in the Empire was set up, to be of humane right, and new, and changeable, as I prove not only by the expresse testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> but by <hi>the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61117:88"/>
stating of the Primacy at last in</hi> Gregories <hi>dayes on</hi> Constantinople <hi>it self, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence neither was nor could be any other then a humane late institution.</hi> And if the Greek Churches judged so of it in <hi>Gregories</hi> daies, and at the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi>'s daies, we have no reason to think that they ever judged otherwise; at least not in <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> dayes, that were the same as <hi>Leo</hi>'s, and the businesse done about 449. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I here set against all your instances at once; and it is unanswerable.</p>

Every Bishop hath a power to discern who is fit for his own Communion; and so <hi>Leo</hi> and the Bishops of the West perceiving <hi>Theodoret</hi> to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, received him as a Catholick into their Communion; and so might the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> have done. But when this was done, the Council did not hereupon receive him, and restore him to his Bishoprick, no nor would hear him read the passages between Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and him, no nor make a Confession of his faith, but cried out against him as a Nestorian, till he had expresly Anathematized <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Eutiches</hi> before the Council, and then they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61117:88"/>
received and restored him: so that the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall judgement was not by <hi>Leo,</hi> but by the Council: But if in his distresse he appealed as you say, <hi>to a just judgement,</hi> from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, or sought to make <hi>Leo</hi> his friend, no wonder; but this is no grant of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Soveraignty in <hi>Leo</hi>: and if it had granted it in the Empire, thats nothing to the Churches in other Empires: Or if he had granted it as to all the world, he was but one man of the world, and not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. The Council expresly take on them the determination after <hi>Leo,</hi> and they slight the Legates of the Pope, and pronounce him a creature of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and give <hi>Constantinople</hi> equall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, though his Legates refuse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.

It was the Council at <hi>Sardica,</hi> and not at <hi>Sardis,</hi> that you would mean. <hi>Sardis</hi> was a City of <hi>Lydia, apud Tmolum montem, olim Regio Craesi, inter Thiatiram &amp; Philadelphiam.</hi> But this <hi>Sardica</hi> was a City of <hi>Thrace</hi> in the confines of the higher <hi>Mysia, inter Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issum
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61117:90"/>
Myssiae &amp; Philippopolim Thraciae.</hi> As to the instance, 1. This Council was by <hi>Augustine</hi> rejected as hereticall, though I defend not his opinion. 2. It was of so little note and authority, that it was not known to the Council of Carthage to have the next antecedent Canons (which you would not have omitted if you had read them, its like) in which your writers glory as their chiefest strength; and which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinks Pope <hi>Zosimus</hi> call'd, the <hi>Nicene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>: or rather is it not suspicious that this Canon is but forged, when those Carthage Fathers plainly say, <hi>In nullo Patrum concilio decretum invenimus</hi>; mentioning that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Canon proposed by <hi>Hosius,</hi> to which this mentioned by you proposed by <hi>Gaudentius</hi> is but an addition or supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is not like that all these Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane Fathers could be ignorant of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Sardica,</hi> when such abundance of Africane Bishops were at the Council, and that but about 50 years before: you may see in <hi>Binnius</hi> how hard a strait he is put to, to give any tolerable reason of this, and only saith, that its like some how the Canons were lost: sure Tradition was then grown untrusty. Your Cardinal <hi>Cusanus de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Cath. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 25. makes a doubt whether
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61117:90"/>
the Canon of appeals be indeed a Canon of this Council. 3. But grant it be, yet take these observations, and you shall find small cause of confidence in that Canon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was made in a Case of the distresse of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and other Orthodox Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Bishops, meerly in that strait, to save them and the Churrhes from the <hi>Arrians.</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> withdrew from the Council being the <hi>minor</hi> part, and excommunicated <hi>Iulius</hi> with <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and other Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and the Occidental Bishops excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the Oriental. <hi>Athanasius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was a chief man in the Council, and had before been rescued by the help of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and therefore no wonder if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired this safety to their Churches. 2. Note, that this is a thing newly granted now by this Canon, and not any ancient thing. 3. Note, that therefore it was of Humane Right, and not of Divine. 4. Note, that yet this Canon was not received or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Church, but after this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary maintained by Councils, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, as I shall anon prove. 5. That it is not any antecedent Governing Power that the Canon acknowledgeth in the Pope; but in honour of the Memory of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as they say, (yet more for their present secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61117:91"/>
they give this much to <hi>Rome</hi>; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vulgar opinion that <hi>Peter</hi> had been there Bishop. 6. That it is not a Power of judging alone that they give, but of causing the re-examination of Causes by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and adding his assistants in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so to have the putting of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the place forborn till it be done. 7. And I hope still you will remember, that at this Council were no Bishops without the Empire, and that the Roman world was narrower then the Christian world: and therefore, if these Bishops in a part of the Empire had now given (not a Ruling, but) a saving Power to the Pope, so far as is there expressed, this had been far from proving that he had a Ruling Power, as the Vice-Christ over all the world, and that by Divine right: Blame me not to call on you to prove this consequence. 8. There is as much for Appeals to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that never claimed a Vice-Christship as <hi>Iure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino.</hi>

him upon an Orthodox confession, and their fellow-Bishops reception and Letters: No doubt but the Letters of many another Bishop might have perswaded them to his reception; though he had more advantages from <hi>Rome.</hi> Is it not now a fair Argument that you offer? <hi>Liberius</hi> (sometime an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) by his Letters prevailed with a Synod at <hi>Tyana</hi> to restore <hi>Eustathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (an Arrian) that dissembled an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox confession: What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Vice-Christ, or was then the Governour of all the Christian world. Soft and fair. 1. <hi>Basil</hi> gives you other reasons of his interest. 2. He never mentioneth his universall Government, when he had the greatest need to be helped by it, if he had known of such a thing. 3. The Empire is not all the world: If <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> knew the Roman Soveraignty, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he was a wilfull Rebel against it.</p>

The advantages of <hi>Rome</hi> by its reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and greatness, and the number and quality of the Western Bishops, made their Judgement and Communion valuable to others: <hi>Basil</hi> before cited tells you on what grounds when Churches disagree, those that are distant are supposed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall, especially when numerous. To which is added, which <hi>Basil</hi> intimates, that some hope of help from the Secular
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61117:94"/>
powers, by the interposition of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Bishops, made them the more sought to. 3. And the Primacy of <hi>Rome</hi> (though it had no Soveraignty) made it seem irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that a Patriarch should be deposed without the knowledge and judgment of the Patriarchs of the precedent Seats. This was the custome that <hi>Iulius</hi> spoke of, and the Patriarchs of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria</hi> might have said as much, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or <hi>Antioch</hi> had been deposed without them. 4. Every Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch might absolve the Innocent, and hold communion with them in his own Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate; and if any be against it, (as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians here were, and sent false accusations against <hi>Athanasius</hi> to <hi>Iulius</hi>) he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to prove their accusations, if they will have him moved by them. Our own Communion with men, is to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the judgment of our own well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed consciences. <hi>Iulius</hi> desired not any more then to be one with a Council that should decide the case. Councils then had the Rule, and Patriarchs were the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Members of those Councils, but no Rulers of them. 5. Yet <hi>Sozomen</hi> and others tell you, that <hi>Iulius,</hi> when he had done his best to befriend <hi>Athanasius</hi> and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61117:94"/>
                     <hi>Paulus</hi> could do no good, nor prevail with the Bishops of the East, till the Emperors commands prevailed: yea the Eastern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops tell him that he should not meddle with their proceedings no more then they did with his, when he dealt with the Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; seeing the greatness of Cities maketh not the power of one Bishop greater then another: and so they took it ill that he interposed, though but to call the matter to a Synod, when a Patriarch was deposed. Any Bishop might have attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppressed as far as <hi>Iulius</hi> did: especially if he had such advantages as aforesaid to encourage him. All your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences here therefore are denied. 1. It is denied, that because <hi>Iulius</hi> made this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that therefore he was Universal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the Empire. 2. It is denied that it will thence follow, if he were so, that it had been by Divine Right, any more then <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> had equall priviledges by Divine Right. 3. It is denied that it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that either by Divine or humane right, he had any Power to govern the rest of the world without the Empire. Had you all that you would rack these testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to speak, it is but that he was made by Councils and Emperours the chief Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61117:95"/>
or Patriarch in a Nationall Church (I mean, a Church in one Princes Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) as the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was in <hi>England.</hi> But a Nationall or Imperiall Church is not the Universall. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, oppressed men will seek relief from any that may help them.</p>
                  <p>In your Margin you adde that [<hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing S.</hi> Athanasius <hi>being judged, and rightly, by P.</hi> Julius, Chamier <hi>acknowledgeth the matter of fact to be so: but against all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity pretends that judgment to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> Take it not ill Sir I beseech you, if I awake your conscience, to tell me, how you dare write so many untruths, which you knew, or might know, I could quickly manifest. Both parts of your say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Chamier</hi> p. 497, are untrue. 1. The matter of fact is it that he denieth: He proveth to you from <hi>Sozomens</hi> words, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> did make no appeal to a Judge, but only fled for help to a friend: He shews you that <hi>Iulius</hi> did not play the Judge, but the helper of the spoiled, and that it was not an act of Judgement. 2. He therefore accuseth him not of wrong judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only mentioneth his not hearing the accused, to shew that he did not play the part of a Judge, but a friend, as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61117:95"/>
did by some that fled to him. I pray answer his reasons.</p>
                  <p>And for what you say again in your Margin of <hi>Theodoret</hi>; I say again, that he appealeth to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for help; as a person who with the Western Bishops might sway much against his adversaries, but not as to an Universal Governour or Judge: no not as to the Universal Judge of the Church Imperiall; much less of all the Catholick Churches.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Your tenth proof is from <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes</hi> Case, where you say some things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, and some impertinent. 1. That <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> appeals to <hi>Innocent</hi> from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is untrue, if you mean it of an Appeal to a superiour Court or Judge; much more if as to an Universal Judge: But indeed in his banishment, when all other help failed, he wrote to him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose and help him as far as he could. I need no other proof of the Negative then, 1. That there is no proof of the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that ever he made any such appeal. 2. In his first Epistle to <hi>Innocent,</hi> he tells him over and over, that [<hi>he appealed to a Synod, and required Iudgement</hi>] and that he was cast into a ship for banishment [<hi>because he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to a Synod and a righteous judgement</hi>]
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61117:96"/>
never mentioning a word of any such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Pope. Yea he urgeth the Pope to befriend and help him, by that argument, that he was still ready to stand to uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judges, never mentioning the Pope as Judge. By all which it appears it was but the assistance of his intercession that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: and withall, perhaps the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the wicked, which another Bishop might have done. Yea, and it seems it was not to <hi>Innocent</hi> only, but to others with him that he wrote; for he would scarce else have used the terms [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] But what need we more then his own words to know his request: saith he [<hi>Let those that are found to have done so wickedly, be subject to the penalty of the Ecclesiasticall Laws: but for us that are not convicted, nor found guilty, grant us to enjoy your Letters, and your charity, and all others whose society we did formerly enjoy.</hi>] The Ecclesiastical Laws enabled each Patriarch and Bishop to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in his own Diocess; though the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sentenced lived out of their Diocess, yet they might renounce all communion with him: Churches that have no power over one another, may have communion with one another; and that communion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61117:96"/>
they may hold and renounce as there is cause. Now if a neighbour Patriarch with so many Bishops of the West had renounc'd Communion with <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> enemies, and also written their Letters on his behalf, and taken him still as in their Communion, this he hoped would much further his restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which yet he doubted, as he had cause. For in his second Epistle he thanks him for doing his part, though it did no good, or did not avail.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be noted, that your Author <hi>Nicephorus</hi> tells you, <hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. that <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Letters, and his fellow-Bishops also, and the Clergies of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were all written both to the Emperour <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> and to <hi>Innocent:</hi> And therefore you may see by that on what account it was, and what help they did expect. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was not to excommunicate, but his Letters might do much.</p>
                  <p>Well, but you alledge <hi>Niceph. l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 34. to prove 1. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> appeal: But you have better or worse eyes then I, for I can find there no such thing, but a seeking for help as aforesaid. 2. You say [Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <hi>nulls his condemnation, and declares him innocent.</hi>] <hi>Ans.</hi> So might another Bishop have declared him: But how far it should
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61117:97"/>
be regarded, was not in his power. 3. You say he <hi>excommunicates Atticus and Theopilus,</hi> and 4. <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperor also, and <hi>Eudoxia.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. If he did so and did well, another Bishop might as well have done it. <hi>Mennas</hi> excommunicated <hi>Vigilius</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Excommunicating is not alwayes an act of Jurisdiction, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of Communion, with a Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall binding, which any Pastor on a just occasion may exercise, even on those that are not of his Diocess; examples in Church-history are common. 2. But I would have you answer Dr. <hi>Whittakers</hi> Reasons, by which he proves that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> is a fabler in this relation, and that that Epistle is not <hi>Innocents</hi> which <hi>cap.</hi> 34. he reciteth, <hi>Lib. de pontif. Rom. Contr.</hi> 4. <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 454, 455. 1. Neither <hi>Socrates, Theodoret</hi> or <hi>Sozomen</hi> make any mention of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, who yet write much of the Case of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Arcadius:</hi> And would these men that lived so near that time have all silenced so great and rare a thing, as the excommunication of the Emperour and Empress, which would have made so great a noise and stir, that yet mention <hi>Ambrose</hi> his censure of <hi>Theodosius</hi>? 2. This Bull of <hi>Innocents,</hi> (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> would
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61117:97"/>
have us believe it) hath such falshoods, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to more credible history, as bewray the forgery. For <hi>Socrates lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 19. writeth, that <hi>Eudoxia</hi> died the same year that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> was banished, and that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> died the third year of his banishment: And <hi>Sozomen</hi> saith <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 28. that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> was in banishment three years after the death of <hi>Eudoxia</hi>: But, if <hi>Nicephorus</hi> were to be believed, <hi>Eudoxia</hi> was alive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by <hi>Innocent</hi> after <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes</hi> death. Nor can it be said that <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> knew not of her death; for his Legats were sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> in <hi>Atticus</hi> time, who succeeded <hi>Arsacius,</hi> who outlived <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia.</hi>] This is the summe of Dr. <hi>Whittakers</hi> confutation of <hi>Nicephorus.</hi> And withall, who knows not how full of fictions <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> is?</p>
                  <p>In your Margin you pretend to confute <hi>Chamier p.</hi> 498. as saying [<hi>That other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops restored those wrongfully deposed as well as the Pope,</hi>] to which you say that [<hi>never single Bishop restored any who were out of their respective Diocess,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereas the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>by his sole and single au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, restored Bishops wrongfully deposed all the Church over.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. It seems you took <hi>Chamiers</hi> words on trust: peruse
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61117:98"/>
that page, and see his words. 2. Single Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have censured, and therefore might as well remit their own censures. <hi>Ambrose</hi> censured <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who was no fixed Member of his charge, and he remitted the Censure. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> presumed even at <hi>Constantinople</hi> to excommunicate <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and his Brethren, <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14. And many instances may be brought both of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating, and again receiving to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by particular Bishops, even as to those that were not of their charge. And if the fact were not proved, yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance proveth not the want of power. 3. I deny your unproved assertion, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> singly restored all the Church over: It is a meer fiction. How many restored he out of the Empire? Or in the Empire out of his Patriarchate, but suasorily or Synodically.</p>
                  <p>Your next instance of <hi>Theodosius</hi> his not permitting the Council at <hi>Ephesus</hi> to be assembled, and his reconciling himself to the Church, is meerly impertinent: We know that he and other Princes usually wrote to <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria,</hi> &amp;c. or spoke or sent to more then one of the Patriarchs before they called a Council. You cannot but know that Councils have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61117:98"/>
been called without the Pope: and that neither this, nor an Emperours forsaking his errour, is a sign of the Popes Universal Government. That Emperour gave suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient testimony, and so did the Bishops that adhered to <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> that in those dayes the Pope was taken for fallible and control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when they excommunicated him: But when you cite out of any Author the words that you build on, I shall take more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of them. Till then this is enough, with this addition, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours subjection, if he had been subject (not to an <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or other Bishop, but) only to <hi>Rome,</hi> would have been no proof that any without the Empire were his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: No more then the King of <hi>Englands</hi> subjection to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> would have proved that the King of <hi>France</hi> was subject to him.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Your twelfth proof from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is from a witness alone sufficient to overthrow your cause, as I have proved to you. This Synod expresly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth, that your Primacy is a novel hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention; that it was given you by the Fathers, because <hi>Rome</hi> was the Imperial Seat. If you believe this Synod, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie is at end: If you do not, why
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61117:99"/>
do you cite it? and why pretend you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Generall Councils?</p>
                  <p>But what have you from this Council against this Council? Why, 1. You say Martian <hi>wrote to</hi> Leo, <hi>that by the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority a generall Council might be gathered, in what City of the Eastern Church he should please to choose.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Whereas for this you cite <hi>Act. Concil. Chalcedon.</hi> 1. You tell me not in what Author, whether <hi>Crabbe, Binnius, Surius, Nicolinus,</hi> or where I must seek it. I have perused the <hi>Act.</hi> 1. in <hi>Binnius,</hi> which is 63 pages in <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> (such tasks your citations set me) and find no such thing; and therefore take it to be your mistake. But in the <hi>preambul. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> I find that <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> desire <hi>Leo</hi>'s prayers, and contrary to your words, that they say [<hi>Hoc ipsum nobis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priis liter is tua sanctitas manifestet, quatenus in omnem Orientem &amp; in ipsam Thraciam &amp; Illyricum sacrae nostrae literae dirigantur, ut ad quendam definitum locum qui nobis placu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, omnes sanctissimi Episcopi debeant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire.</hi>] It is not [<hi>qui vobis placuerit</hi>] but [<hi>qui nobis.</hi>] But what if you had spoke truth, doth it follow that <hi>Leo</hi> was Christs Vicar-general Governour of the world, because that the Soveraign of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61117:99"/>
did give him leave to choose the place of a Council? Serious things should not be thus jested with.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You say Anatolius <hi>and the rest of the Eastern Bishops sent to Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their faith by his order.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> 1.

Can you prove this Consequence? Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were ordinarily sent in order to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or to satisfie the offended, without respect to superiority. 2. But I see not the proof of your impertinent words. <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius</hi> Epistle to <hi>Leo,</hi> expresseth that <hi>Leo</hi> had sent his Confession first to <hi>Anatolius,</hi> to which <hi>Anatolius</hi> consented.

                  <p n="3">3. You say the <hi>Popes Legates sate first in Council.</hi>] <hi>Reply.</hi> What then? therefore the Pope was Governour of the Christian world, though not a man out of the Empire were of the Council. Are you still in jest? But if it must be so, then I can prove that others were the Universal Governours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at <hi>Nice,</hi> and other Councils they sate before the Legates of the Pope, and in many his Legats had no place. Is this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

Any accuser in a Parliament or Synod may require that the Accused may not sit as judge, till he be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. But did you not know that <hi>Leo</hi>'s Legates were not obeyed; but that the <hi>Gloriosissimi judices &amp; amplissimus senatus,</hi> required that the cause should be first made known: and that it was not done till <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Episcop.

cautelous in excommunicating a Patriarch. And we still grant you, that the Order of the Empire had given the Roman Bishop the Primacy therein: and therefore no wonder if his consent were expected. But that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> was condemned by a Council needs no proof: And what if <hi>Celestine</hi> began and first condemned him? I she therefore the Universal Bishop?

                  <p n="17">17. You next tell me of <hi>Valentinians</hi> words A. D. 445. <hi>Reply.</hi> It is the most plausible of all your testimonies, but worth nothing to your end. For 1. Though <hi>Theodosius</hi> name <hi>pro forma</hi> were at it, yet it was only <hi>Valentinians</hi> act, and done at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Leo</hi> prevailed with a raw unexperienced Prince to word the Epistle as he desired; so that it is rather <hi>Leo</hi>'s, then the Emperours originally: And <hi>Leo</hi> was the first that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the excessive advancement of his Seat above the rest of the Patriarchs. 2. It is known that the Emperours sometime gave the Primacy to <hi>Rome,</hi> and sometime to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> as they were pleased or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by each of them. So did <hi>Iustinian,</hi> who A. D. 530. <hi>Lampadio &amp; Oreste Coss. C. de Episcopis lib.</hi> 1. <hi>lege</hi> 24. saith [<hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitana Ecclesia omnium aliarum est Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put</hi>] [<hi>The Church of</hi> Constantinople <hi>is the Head of all other.</hi>] 3. It is your fiction, and not the words of <hi>Valentinian</hi> (or <hi>Leo</hi>) that [<hi>the succession from</hi> Peter <hi>was the foundation
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61117:104"/>
of</hi> Romes <hi>Primacy.</hi>] It was then believed that <hi>Antioch</hi> and other Churches had a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from <hi>Peter.</hi> It is the Merit of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Dignity of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Authority of the Synod joyntly that he ascribeth it to. The Merit of <hi>Peter</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Motive upon which <hi>Leo</hi> would have men believe the Synod gave the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Rome</hi>: And <hi>Hosius</hi> in the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> indeed useth that as his motive, [Let us for the honour of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.] They had a conceit that where <hi>Peter</hi> last preached, and was martyred and buried, and his relicts lay, there he should be most honoured. 4. Here is not the least intimation that this Primacy was by Gods appointment, or the Apostles, but the Synods: Nor that it had continued so from <hi>Peters</hi> dayes, but that joyntly for <hi>Peters</hi> Merits (and honour) and the Cities dignity, it was given by the Synod. 5. And it was but <hi>Leo</hi>'s fraud to perswade the raw Emperour of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Synod, which he would not name, because the Synod of <hi>Sardica</hi> was in little or no authority in those daies. The rest of the reasons were fraudulent also; which though they prevailed with this Emperour, yet they took not in the East. And <hi>Leo</hi> himself it seems durst not pretend to a Divine Right

and Institution, nor to a succession of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy from the Apostles. 6. But nothing is more false then your assertion, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth the power [<hi>over the whole visible Church.</hi>] The word [<hi>Vniversitas</hi>] is all that you translate in your comment, [<hi>the whole visible Church</hi>] As if you knew not that there was a Roman <hi>Vniversality,</hi> &amp; that Roman Councils were called <hi>Vniversall,</hi> when no Bishops out of that one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were present; and that the Church in the Empire is oft called [<hi>the whole Church.</hi>] Yea [<hi>the Roman world</hi>] was not an unusuall phrase.

much: But yet it seems, that the rising pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er needed this extraordinary secular help: <hi>Hilary</hi> it seems with his Bishops thought, that even to his Patriarch he owed no such obedience as <hi>Leo</hi> here by force exacteth. So that your highest witness (<hi>Leo</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Valentinian</hi>) is for no more then a Primacy, with a swelled power in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Universality; but they never medled with the rest of the Christian world: It seems by all their writings and attempts, this never came into their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And its no credit to your cause, that this <hi>Hilary</hi> was (by <hi>Baronius</hi> confession) a man of extraordinary holiness and knowledge, and is Sainted among you, and hath his Day in your Calendar. And yet <hi>Valentinian</hi> had great provocation to interpose (if <hi>Leo</hi> told him no untruths, for his own advantage): For it was no less then laying siege to Cities, to force Bishops on them without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that he is accused of; which shews to what odious pride and usurpation, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity even then had raised the Clergy: fitter to be lamented with floods of tears, then to be defended by any honest Christian: <hi>Leo</hi> himself may be the principal instance.</p>

And there you do but falsly thrust in the word [<hi>thou governst us</hi>] and so you have made your self a witness, because you could find none: The words are [<hi>Quibus tu quidem sicut membris caput prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eras, in his qui tuum tenebant ordinem bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiam praeferens: Imperatores vero ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandum decentissime praesidebant.</hi>] Now [<hi>to go before</hi>] with you must be [<hi>to Govern</hi>]: If so, then <hi>Aurelius</hi> at the Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and others in Councils that presided, did govern them. It was but [<hi>benevolenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am praetulisse</hi>] that they acknowledged: And that the Magistrates not only presided indeed, but did the work of Judges and Governours, is express in the Acts; its after wrote in that Epistle [<hi>Haec sunt, quae tecum, qui spiritu praesens eras, &amp; complacere tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fratribus deliberasti, &amp; qui pene per tuorum vicariorum sapientiam videbaris, à nobis effecimus</hi>] And [<hi>haec à tua sanctitate fuerint inchoata</hi>] and yet [<hi>Qui enim locum vestrae sanctitatis obtinent, iis ita constitutis vehementer resistere tentaverunt.</hi>] From all

which it appeareth, that he only is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to lead the way, and to please them as his brethren, and to help them by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his substitutes; and yet that the Council would not yield to their vehement resistance of one particular.</p>
                  <p>But I have told you oft enough that the Council shall be judge, not in a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Epistle, but in <hi>Can.</hi> 28. where your Primacy is acknowledged; but 1.

Was the Popes Legate the whole Catholick Church? 2. Was there one man at either of these Councils but within the Empire, yea a piece of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire?
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61117:108"/>
So that they were but such as we now call National Councils, that is, consisting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the subjects of one Republick. 3. Did the Council speak a word for your power without the Empire? 4. Do they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it so expresly to be of humane right, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath nothing regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to say against it (<hi>Can.</hi> 28. <hi>Conc. Chalced.</hi>) but that they spoke falsly? And yet your opinion or interest hath tempted you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. <hi>viz.</hi> to the Sun that there is no such thing as light.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. After the conclusion you have a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary in your Margin, from <hi>Greg. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Epist.</hi> 30. But there is no such word in that Epistle, nor is it of any such subject. But is the 31. <hi>Epistle</hi> its like that your leader meant. And there's no more but that a Bishop not named (person or place) having fallen into Schism voluntarily, swore never more to depart from the Unity of the Catholick Church, or the sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> But 1. So may a Bishop of the Roman Province do (or Patriarchate) without believing <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Universal Head. So might one in any other Province have done: And yet it follows not that he <hi>ought</hi> to do so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>did</hi> so. You see now what all your proofs are come to, and how shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61117:109"/>
naked you have left your cause.</p>
                  <p>In summ, of all the testimonies produced, 1. You have not named one man that was a Papist (Pope <hi>Leo</hi> was the nearest of any man) nor one testimony that ever a Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had the Government of all the Church without the verge of the Roman Empire; but only that he was to the Roman Church, as the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the English Church: And as between <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> so between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there have been contentions for preheminency: But if I can prove <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> to be before <hi>York,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that will prove neither of them to be Ruler at the Antipodes, or of all the Christian world. 2. Much less have you proved that ever <hi>any Church</hi> was of this opinion, that the Pope was by Divine Right the Governour of all the world, when you cannot prove one man of that opinion. 3. Much less have you proved a succession of such a Church from the Apostles, having said as much as nothing concerning the first 300 years. 4. And yet much less have you proved, that the <hi>whole Catholick Church</hi> was of this opinion. 5. And least of all have you proved, that the <hi>whole Church took this Primacy of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be of necessity
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61117:109"/>
to the very Being of the Church, and to our salvation</hi>; and not only <hi>ad melius esse,</hi> as a point of <hi>Order. So that you have left your Cause in shameful nakedness, as if you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,</hi> that you can prove nothing.</p>
                  <p>In the end you return to terms. To what you say about the word [<hi>Christians</hi>] I only say, that its but equivocally applied to any that profess not all the Essentialls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, of which Popery is none, any more then Pride is.</p>
                  <p>About the word [<hi>Monarch</hi>] in good sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, do you deny the Pope to be [<hi>an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sole Commander.</hi>] Which of these is it that you deny? not that he is [<hi>a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi>] not that he is [<hi>imperious</hi>] not that he is [<hi>sole</hi>] in his Soveraignty! I would either you or we knew what you hold or deny. But perhaps the next words shew the difference [<hi>as Temporal Kings.</hi>] But this saith not a word <hi>wherein</hi> they differ from [<hi>Temporal Kings</hi>]: sure your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words shew not the difference. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> may [<hi>receive power from Christ.</hi>] 2. <hi>Kings</hi> must rule [<hi>in meekness, charity and humility.</hi>] But I think the meekness, charity and humility of Popes, hath been far below even wicked Kings (if cruel murdering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians for Religion, and setting the world
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61117:110"/>
on fire may be witness) as your own Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries assure us. 3. The Government of Kings also is for [<hi>mens eternal good</hi>] how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Papists would make them but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners in such things. 4. Brethren, as such, are no subjects: and therefore if the Pope Rule men but as Brethren, he rules them not by Governing authority at all. 5. Children to him we are not: You must mean it but Metaphorically! And what mean you then? Is it that he must do it in Love for their good? So also must Kings: So that you have yet exprest no difference at all.</p>
                  <p>But our Question is not new, nor in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall terms: What Soveraignty you claim, you know or should know. Are you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that <hi>Bellarmine, Boverius,</hi> and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily your Writers labour to prove that the Government of the Church is Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and that the Pope is the Monarch? the supream Head and Ruler, which in English is the Soveraign. Are you ashamed of the very Cause or Title of it, which you will have necessary to our salvation?</p>
                  <p>Next you say, that you <hi>[very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Title of Vice-Christ, as proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, and utterly disclaim from it, neither was it ever given by any sufficient authority
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61117:110"/>
to your Popes, or did they ever accept of it.] Reply.</hi> Now blessed be God that makes sin a shame to it self, that the Patrons of it dare scarce own it without some paint or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is not the very life of the Cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and us, whether the Pope be the Universal Head of the Church, <hi>vice Christi. &amp; vicarius Christi</hi>? Are not these the most common titles that Papists give them, and that they take unto themselves? Nay look back into your own papers here <hi>pag.</hi> 6. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you say not that they are [<hi>Instituted Governours in Christs place of his whole Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church.</hi>] 2. Doth not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as I have cited elsewhere) labour to prove, that it is not as an Apostle that the Pope succeeds <hi>Peter,</hi> but as a Head of the Church in Christs stead? Doth not <hi>Boverius</hi> (cited in my <hi>Key</hi>) labour to prove him the Vicar of Christ, and to be <hi>Vice Christi</hi>? And what fitter English have we for the Kings deputy in a distant Kingdom, who is <hi>Vice Regis,</hi> then the Vice-King? Or a Chancelors deputy, then [the <hi>Vicechancellor</hi>]: <hi>Vice Christi</hi> is your own common word, and <hi>Vicarius Christi</hi>; none more common scarce then the latter: And what English is there fitter for this, then the <hi>Vice-Christ,</hi> or <hi>Vicar</hi> of Christ?
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61117:111"/>
It is indeed the very term that expresseth properly as man can speak, the true point and life of the Controversie between us. And how could you suffer your pen to set down that the Popes did never accept of this, when it is their own common phrase [<hi>Vice Christi, &amp; Vicarius Christi?</hi>] But here again remember (and let it be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against you) that you dislike and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disclaim the very name that signifieth the Papal Power, as <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Insolent.</hi> And if you abhor Popery while you tice men to it, let my soul abhor it, and let all that regard their souls abhor it. Blessed be that Light that hath brought it to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the works of darkness.</p>
                  <p>Were it not more tedious then necessary, I would cite you the words [<hi>Vice Christi &amp; Vicarius Christi</hi>] out of Popes and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of your Writers. But alas thats not the highest: The <hi>Vice-God</hi> is a Title that they have not thought insolent, or words of the same signification. Would you have my proof? Pardon it then for proving your pen so false and deceitfull (thats not my fault.)</p>

                  <p>Tell me now whether you said true in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61117:115"/>
the Paragraph about the Title Vice-Christ? yea, whether it be not much more that hath been <hi>given</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi>?</p>
                  <p>But what name else is it that you agree on as proper to express the power which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted? I know no name so fitted to the reall controversie? And therefore in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the Name, for ought I know, you disclaim your Cause, and confess the shame of Popery. If he that seeks to be King of <hi>England,</hi> should say he disclaimeth <hi>the Title of King as insolent and proud,</hi> doth he not allow me to conclude the like of the <hi>thing,</hi> which he concludeth of the proper name? The name <hi>[Papa] [Pope]</hi> you know (its like) was usually by the ancients given to other Bishops as well as to him of <hi>Rome</hi>; and therefore that cannot distinguish him from other men: The same I may say of the Titles [<hi>Dominus, Pater sanctissimus, beatissimus, Dei amantissimus,</hi> and many such like] — And for <hi>[summus Pontifex] Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> tells you (<hi>Martyrol.

not (as <hi>Nilus</hi> tells you) neither a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor an Universall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much less as the <hi>Vice-Christ.</hi> And that the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was called [<hi>the Apostolick Vniversal Bishop</hi>] Baronius <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth from an old Vaticane monument,</hi> which on the other side calls <hi>Agapetus [Episcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Princeps.]</hi> The Title [<hi>Apostolick</hi>] was usually given to others. <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was called [<hi>the mother of the Churches.</hi>] A Council gave <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Title of [<hi>Vniversal Patriarch</hi>] which though <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> pronounced <hi>so in pious and intolerable for any to use, yet the</hi> following Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s made an agreement with <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that their Patriarch should keep his Title of <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Patriarch</hi>] and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> be called [<hi>the Vniversal Pope;</hi>] which can signifie nothing proper to him (the name Pope being common) more then [<hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Patriarch</hi>] doth. The <hi>Foundations,</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Church, and the Apostles suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, yea <hi>Peters</hi> successors, were Titles given to others as well as him: and more then these. It being therefore the point in controversie between us, whether the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> be in the place of Christ or as his Vicar, the Head, Monarch, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Church universal; and the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61117:116"/>
terms [<hi>Vice Christi &amp; Vicarius Christi</hi>] being those that Popes and Papists choose to signifie their claim, what other should I use?</p>
                  <p>As to what you say of the <hi>Council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> (which you must say also of <hi>Basil,</hi> and of the French Church, Venetians, &amp;c.) you pretend the doubt to be only between Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary Governours. But 1. of old the Councils called Generall (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but of one Principality) were more ordinary, then now the Pope hath brought them to be: (and I blame him not, if he will hold his greatness, to take heed of them.) 2. The way not to have been extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if the Council of <hi>Const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or of sufficient power, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that there should be one every ten years. 3. The Councils that continue so many years as that at <hi>Trent</hi> did, are then become an Ordinary Government. 4. What is given to the Church Representative, is by many of you given to the Church reall or <hi>essentiall</hi> (as you call it) which is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly existent, only not capable of exerting the power it hath: The <hi>singulis major, at universis minor,</hi> is no rare doctrine with you. 5. But let it be as extraordinary as you please, if while these Councils sit, the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61117:116"/>
Pope lose his Headship, your Church is then two Churches specifically distinct, and the form of it changeth when a Council sitteth: which is a two-headed, mutable Church, not like the Spouse of Jesus Christ. 6. As your Popes are said to live in their constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Laws, when the person dyeth; and your Church is not thought by you to die with them; so why may not Councils do? The Laws of Councils live when they sit not, and the French think that these Laws are above the Pope; though I shewed you even now that <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. <hi>in Conc. Later.</hi> concluded otherwise of Decrees, and the Council of the Popes power. 7. If a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be Governed by Trienniall (and so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenniall) Parliaments as the highest power, and Councils of State in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls, who shall be accountable to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; will you say that these Parliaments are extraordinary, and not the ordinary Soveraign? No doubt they are. And the Council of State is not the Soveraign, but the chief Officer or Magistrate for executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the intervals.</p>
                  <p>Having begun this Reply <hi>May</hi> 2. I was again taken off it about <hi>May</hi> 5. or 6. And
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61117:117"/>
about <hi>May</hi> 11. I received a Letter from you, wherein you tell me of a quarter of a years expectation. Be patient good Sir! These matters concern Eternity: Believe it, I have somewhat else to do of greater hast and moment. Even some of your own friends find me more work. What if ten of you write to me at once, is it fair for each one of you to call for an answer as hastily as if I had but one in hand? This is not my case, but it is more then thus. Fear not lest I give you over, till you first prove the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter, and turn your back (if God enable me:) Only I must tell you, that I take it for a flight already, and a forsaking of your Cause, that you turn to these rambling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent citations and discourses, in stead of a Syllogisticall arguing the case, and that when you had spoken so much for it. I have here (that you may have no cause of exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, nor pretence of cause) in this Paper replyed to your last; and in another proved the Visibility of our Church syllogistically; and (as overplus) also disproved yours, and proved it to be an upstart, the sprout of Pride, upon occasion of the greatness of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the forming the Church to the Civil State, in that one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. If now you will deny to do the like, I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61117:117"/>
shall conclude you fly and forsake your Cause. Besides your Rejoinder to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, I principally expect that you syllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally (in close and faithfull Arguing) do prove to us the Affirmative of these Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>[Whether the Church, of which the subjects of the Pope are Members, hath been visible ever since the dayes of Christ on earth.] In which these three Questions are involved, which you have to prove:</hi> 1. <hi>Whether the Papacy, that is, the Vniversal Monarchy, or Soveraign Government, or Vice-Christship of the Pope (take which term you like) hath continued from Christs dayes till now.</hi> 2 <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Catholick Church did still submit to it, and were subjects of the Pope.</hi> 3. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those that did submit to it, did take it to be necessary to the Being of the Church, and the salvation of all believers, or only to the more peaceable and better being.</hi>] If you call for Catalogues, or proof of Visible succession, and pretend so high to it your selves, and yet will give us none when we importune you to it, you tell us that you seek not to reveal the truth and Church but to hide them. I urge you the harder (though it may seem immodest) because as the Cause doth lie upon your proof here, so I know
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61117:118"/>
you cannot do it: Pardon my confidence: I know you can do no more then <hi>Baronius, Bellarmine, Bullinger,</hi> &amp;c. set together have done: and therefore I say, I know you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it. I know your Vice-Christ (I doubt the Antichrist) is of humane introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, springing out of a Nationall (I mean Imperiall) Primacy, which also was of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention. It was but one Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Commonwealth, in which your Bishop had his Primacy, and that long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Governing power. And this National Primacy, because of the greatness of the Empire, was at last called Universal: And even this was long after the dayes of Christ (some hundreds of years) a stranger in the Church, unless as the Greatness of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and advantages of the place, did give that Church such authority as ariseth from magnitude, splendour, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and accidental advantages from the populousness, wealth, and glory of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The carnall Church is led by the Vice-Christ, the earthly Prince of Pride, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in the world for command and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority; and prosecuting his Cause with Strappados, fire, sword, and gunpowder, when Christ gave no Pastor a Coercive
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61117:118"/>
power, to touch mens bodies or estates. The true spirituall Church is Headed and commanded by Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace, and knoweth no other Universal Head, because no other hath either Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or Authority. It obeyeth his Laws; and learneth of him to be charitable, patient, meek, and lowly; and wonders not at er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and divisions on earth, nor therefore accuseth the providence of God: but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by faith, that the Universal Judge of Controversies is at the door, and that it is but a very little while, and we shall see that the Church had an Universal Head, that was alone sufficient for his work; for he that cometh will come, and will not tarry: Amen, Even so come Lord Jesus!</p>
                  <p>Sir, I desire you presently to send me word, whether you will by close Syllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call arguing, prove the successive visibility of your Church as Papal, or not, that I may know what to expect?</p>
                  <p>And once more I pray you take the help of the ablest of your party, both that I may not be so troubled with wrong, or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent allegations, and that I may be sure that your insufficient arguings are not from any imperfection of the person, but of the Cause.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. [<hi>The Church</hi>] sometime signifieth a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation actually met, or associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for such personal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for Communion in Gods worship. 2. Sometime it signifieth an Association of Churches, and that either of sewer, or of more, as they have opportunity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or correspondency by their Pastors; and also the Assemblies of the Pastors of the particular Churches so associated. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture useth it in the first sense, and Later custome (whether Scripture also I omit) in the later. 3. Both Scripture and Custome have used the word to signifie the Church Universal, of which all particular Churches are Members. This is [<hi>the Church</hi>] that we speak of in the Question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Defin.</hi> The Universal Church, of which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61117:121"/>
the Protestants profess themselves Members, is, <hi>The Kingdome of Iesus Christ:</hi> or, <hi>The whole company of Believers</hi> (or <hi>true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>) <hi>upon earth, subjected to Iesus Christ their Head.</hi>] The constitutive parts, or the Relate and Correlate are, (as in every Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Body) the <hi>Pars Imperans,</hi> and <hi>Pars sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita</hi>: which is <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> The form consisteth in the mutuall <hi>Relation.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> is the common good of the Church, and the glory of the Head, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the will of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. [The Protestants] <hi>Defin.</hi> [<hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are Christians protesting against,</hi> or <hi>disowning Popery.</hi>] The word [<hi>Protestant</hi>] expresseth not the <hi>essence</hi> of our Religion. And therefore it must not denominate the Universal Church, of which we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: we are not to call it [A Protestant Universal Church.] Nor doth it signifie an <hi>inseparable proper accident.</hi> For when the Catholick Church had no Popery, there was none to protest against, and therefore there could be no Protestants. And <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia, India,</hi> and other Nations that never had Popery, or those Nations that never heard of it, have no occasion to protest against it. Nor doth it signifie any <hi>Positive part</hi> (directly) of our Religion: but only
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61117:121"/>
the Negation, or Rejection of Popery: Even as when a man is called [<hi>Homo purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, sanatus, liberatus, à leprâ, peste, tabe,</hi> &amp;c.] a man purged, healed, freed from the leprosie, plague, consumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is no positive part, nor inseparable proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, much less any essential part of the man, that is signified by the word [<hi>Healed, Purged,</hi> &amp;c.] Nor is it necessary in order to the proving him [a man] or [a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man,] to prove that he was ever [a purged, or healed man.] We undertake not therefore to prove that there have been alwayes <hi>Protestants,</hi> that is, men <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing against Popery</hi>: Nor have we any need, in order to the proof of our Thesis, to prove that the Catholick Church hath all been free from Popery in all ages, or in any age since the Apostles, no more then that it hath been free from Pride, Ambition, or Contention. (But yet we shall do it <hi>ex abundanti.</hi>) The Religion then of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant is <hi>Christianity,</hi> and he knoweth and owneth no other. Which is called [the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion] as cleansed from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
                  <p>[Members] that is, true integral parts.</p>
                  <p>[Of which—are—] By <hi>Profession.</hi> We profess our selves to be of no other Church.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61117:122"/>
And before men, a man is to be taken to be of that Religion and Church of which he professeth himself to be, till he be proved false in that Profession. If a Papist affirm himself a member of the Roman Church, in disputing with him we will take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he is so; every man being best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his own mind, and fittest to describe the Religion which he owns. So that two things I here include. 1. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a Catholick Church that hath been still visible, [that Protestants own.] 2. And only such that really they are of, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession being valid.</p>
                  <p>Note also, that it is not directly the <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istency</hi> by internal invisible faith, that is in question among us, or that I mean: but the inexistency by external Visible Profession. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinks the <hi>bare Professors</hi> that are wicked, are best termed [<hi>Dead mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>] and <hi>[the true Professors, [Living members]</hi> we will not stick needlesly on words: We take the Living members only to be in strict propriety <hi>members</hi>; but <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> being known only to God and the possessors, we speak of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi> as <hi>Professors</hi> abstractively from their <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[Hath been Visible.] 1. Not <hi>visible</hi> to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61117:122"/>
man in its Internal faith; but in its external <hi>Profession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not <hi>Visible</hi> at once to any one man: for no man can see all the Christian world at once: But <hi>Visible</hi> in its parts, both in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and individual persons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not <hi>Visible</hi> in the <hi>soundness</hi> of its <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed faith</hi> unto Infidels and Hereticks: For they cannot see that faith to be sound, which they take to be fabulous and false: But <hi>Visible</hi> in the soundness of its professed faith to themselves, that know the soundness of faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Not <hi>Visible</hi> in the excellent degree of soundness in the better parts, unto the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter or infirmer parts: For though <hi>de facto</hi> they may know what Doctrine the better part do hold (as Infidels know what Doctrine the Church holdeth) yet they know it not to be true and sound in the points wherein they differ.</p>
                  <p>And note again, that it is not the [<hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>] of every <hi>accident</hi> of the Church, nor of every Truth or duty that is but of the <hi>Integrity</hi> of Religion, and necessary only <hi>ad melius esse Ecclesiae,</hi> to the <hi>Better being</hi> of the Church, but it is the [<hi>Visibility</hi>] of the <hi>Church</hi> that we speak of.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is the <hi>Body</hi> and not the <hi>Head,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61117:123"/>
whose <hi>Visibility</hi> is in Question by us.

Church was theirs: who yet had no part in it, because they were not Christians (as denying that which is essentiall to Christ, the object of the Christian faith) and therefore none of the Church, and therefore though most visible and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet not the visible Church: And the Church, which to others was as wheat hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this chaffe, or rather a few ears among so many rares, was yet Visible to it self in its Truth of faith, and visible to its Enemies in its Profession and assemblies, though in number far below them.</p>
                  <p>So also in some <hi>places</hi> it may be <hi>Latent</hi> through persecution &amp; the paucity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, when in other places it is more <hi>Patent.</hi>

                  <p>And its Degrees of soundness being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, are accordingly variously visible.

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The Body of Christians on earth subjected to Christ their Head, hath been (in its parts) Visible ever since the dayes of Christ on earth.</p>
                  <p>But the Body of Christians on earth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Christ their Head, is the Church of which the Protestants are Members:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Church of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are Members, hath been visible ever since the dayes of Christ on earth.</p>
                  <p>I have not sagacity enough to conjecture what any Papist can say against the Major proposition.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is proved by our own Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: As the profession of Popery, proveth a man a Papist, so the profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity as much proveth us to be Christians.</p>
                  <p>[α] Those that profess the true Christian Religion in all its essentials, are Members of that Church which is the Body of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on earth subjected to Christ the Head.</p>

                  <p>The Major is undeniable. The Minor is thus proved. 1. Those that profess so much as God hath promised salvation upon in the Covenant of Grace, do profess the Christian Religion in all its Essentials. (For God promiseth salvation in that Covenant to none but Christians.) But the Protestants profess so much as God hath promised sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon, in the Covenant of Grace:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Protestants do profess the Christian Religion in all its essentials.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is thus proved. All that profess faith in God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, our Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and love to him, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience to all his Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and holy Scripture, with willingness and diligence to know the true meaning of all these Laws as far as they are able, and with Repentance for all known sin, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess so much as God hath promised salvation upon, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9 <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 1. <hi>Act</hi> 26.18. But so do the Protestants: Therefore the Protestants
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61117:125"/>
profess so much as God hath promised sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those that profess as much and much more of the Christian faith and Religion, as the Catechumens were ordinarily taught in the ancient Churches, and the Competentes at Baptism did profess, do profess the true Christian Religion in all its essentials.</p>
                  <p>But so do the Protestants: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Those that explicitely profess the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all that was contained in the Churches Symbols, or Creeds, for six hundred years after Christ (and much more holy truth) and implicitly to believe all that is contained in the holy Scriptures, and to be willing and diligent for the explicite knowledge of all the rest, with a Resolution to obey all the will of God which they know, do profess the true Christian Religion in all its Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.

                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>de Verbo Dei, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 11. In the Christian doctrine both of faith and manners, some things are simply necessary to salvation to all; as the knowledge of the Articles of the Apostles Creed, of the ten

Commandments, and of some Sacraments: The rest are not so necessary that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved without the explicite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, belief, and profession of them— These things that are simply necessary, and are profitable to all, the Apostles preached to all — All things are written by the Apostles which are Necessary to all, and which they openly preacht to all —</p>

But the Antecedent is true: Therefore so is the Consequent.</p>
                  <p>The Reason of the Consequence is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the same thing that is professed by all Professors, and existent in all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and that as to Profession is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Visibility of Membership; and as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61117:126"/>
to sincere inexistence, is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent or Minor I thus prove. All that by saith in Christ are brought to the unfeigned Love of God above all, and speciall Love to his servants, and unfeigned willingness to obey him, are Members of the true Church as intrinsecally informed. But such are all sincere Protestants: Therefore all sincere Protestants are Members of the true Church as intrinsecally informed.</p>
                  <p>The Major is granted by the Papists, who affirm charity to be the form of Grace, and all that have it to be justified. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Scripture prove it to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>The Minor 1. Is proved to others by our Professions: If this be in our Profession, then the sincere are such indeed. But this is in our Profession: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its certainly known to our selves by the inward knowledge and sense of our souls. I know that I Love God and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and am willing to obey him; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Papists Sophisms shall never make me not know what I do know, and not feel what I do feel. They reason in vain with me, when they reason against the knowledge and experience of my soul. Your
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61117:126"/>
scope is to prove me in a state of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You confess that if I have charity I am in a state of salvation. I know and feel that I have charity: Therefore I know that your Reasonings are deceit.</p>

                  <p>That the Catholick Church which hath been Visible till now, hath received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures which we receive, is confessed by all Papists that ever I heard or read ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of it.

                  <p>That this Church hath taken these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures for the Rule of faith in all points necessary to salvation (allowing Church-Governours to make Canons about the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials of Government and worship, which in the Universal Law are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,

The highest is by manifest Vision (as in heaven): and the middle way is in the Book of holy Scripture, without which there is no coming to the highest way.] And going on to extoll the Scripture, he citeth <hi>Ieromes</hi> words <hi>ad Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linum,</hi> [Let us learn on earth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those things which will abide with

If any man think he knoweth any thing, he yet knoweth nothing as he ought to know. For the measure is not to exceed the measure of faith: of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle bids us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Not to be wiser then we ought to be, but to be wise to sobriety, and as God hath divided to every man the measure of faith. Which <hi>Measure</hi> consisteth in two things; to wit, that we subtract not from faith that which is of faith, nor (N.B.) attribute that to faith which is not of faith: For by either of these wayes, the measure of faith is exceeded, and men deviate from the continence of the sacred Scripture, which expresseth the measure of faith.]
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61117:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(That is, from the full sufficiency of the Scripture measure:) [And this measure, by Gods assistance, we will hold, that we may write or teach nothing dissonant to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. But if by ignorance or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, we should write any thing disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, let it be taken <hi>ipso facto</hi> as not written.] This is a confession of the Religion of the Protestants. And though he adjoyn a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Roman Church, because he was bred in it, it is only as to an interpreter of doubtfull Texts of Scripture: So that the sufficiency of our Rule and measure of faith is granted by him, and zealously asserted; and that without <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Costerus</hi> limitation, to points necessary to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all; he extendeth it to all the faith.</p>

                  <p>This is more then the former say: For to extend the sufficiency and necessity of Scripture to all thats Theologicall, is more then to extend it to matter of faith. No Protestant goeth higher then this that I know of. And note, that he makes this the

[And therefore whether it be of Christ, or whether it be of the Church, or whether it be of any other matter that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to our Faith or Life, I will not say [<hi>if we</hi>] as being not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with him that said [<hi>Though we</hi>] but (I will say) plainly what he added following: [If an Angel from heaven shall declare to you any thing besides that which you have
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61117:133"/>
received in the Legall and Evangelicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, let him be Anathema, or accursed.] Was not the Church then purely Protestant in their Religion?</p>
                  <p>The Minor needs no proof but our own Profession. My profession is the best evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my own Religion to another: And I profess this to be my Religion; which is contained in the holy Scripture, as the Test, or Law, or Rule. And let no man contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict me, that knoweth not my Religion bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I do: The Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> profess this also to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Composers. And the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants commonly <hi>uno ore</hi> do profess it. It is the great difference between us and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. The whole Universal Law of God that we know of, and own, is contained in Nature and Scripture conjunct. But the Papists take somewhat else to be another part. We allow by-Laws about mutable undetermined things (as aforesaid) to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: But we know no Universal Law of faith and holiness, but Nature and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: This is our Religion: And this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion contained in Nature and Scriptures hath been still received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> We confess Scripture is sufficient to them that have no further light: All that is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61117:134"/>
necessary to the salvation of all, is in that perspicuously, as <hi>Costerus, Bellarmine,</hi> and others say: but more is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to some.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Then at least it containeth all the Essentialls of Christianity, which suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to our present end. 2. And what maketh more Necessary to me, or others here in <hi>England,</hi> if it be not necessary to all? Is it because that more is Revealed to us? But <hi>how</hi> and by whom; and with what <hi>Evidence</hi>? We are willing to see it, and can see no such thing: But if this be it, (if I may speak so plainly without offence) it seems it concerneth us to keep out Friars and Jesuites from the Land, as much (if we knew how) as to keep out the Devil. For they tell us, 1. That we must believe the Popes Soveraignty, against the Tradition and judgement of most of the Catholick Church. 2. And we must believe our selves to be void of Charity (because no Papists) contrary to our internall sense and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 3. And we must believe that bread is not bread, and wine is not wine, contrary to the common senses of all sound men: and if we will not thus renounce the Churches Vote, Tradition, our Certain knowledge, Reason, and all our Senses, we must be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61117:134"/>
damned: where as before this doctrine was brought us, we might have been saved, as having in the Scriptures all things necessary to the salvation of all.</p>
                  <p>But the Papists must needs have us shew them where our Church was, and name the persons. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It were not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, if it were confined to any place that is but a part of the Christian territories. 2. Nor were it the Catholike Church if we could name half or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of the members: As <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> oft tells the <hi>Donatists,</hi> it is the Church which begun at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and thence is spread throughout the world. Part of it may be in one Nation one year, which may forfeit and lose it before the next. God hath not tyed it to any place. 3. To tell you where the Catholike Church hath been in every age, and who were the Members or the Leaders, requireth much knowledge in History and Cosmography, which God hath not made necessary to salvation. 4. There are no known Histories that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us the Catalogues of the Christians in every age of the world. Had any been so foolish as to write them, they would have been too chargeable to keep, and too long to read: yea were it but of the Pastors.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61117:135"/>
5. God hath nowhere commanded the Church to keep such Catalogues or Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor promised when they are written, that Papists shall not purposely corrupt and destroy them, not <hi>Turks</hi> (as at <hi>Buda</hi>) take the Christian Libraries, and burn them. 6. Papists cannot prove the successive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and habitations of the Catholike Church any more then we; and we can do it as well as they: for we have the same means. If they can tell us where it hath been in every age, they need not ask us: If they cannot, they have as much need to learn as we, and much more. They think it not necessary to their Laity, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their faith, to be able to prove the habitations or names of the Members of the Catholike Church in all ages: and why is it more necessary to us then them? 7. But yet, to men acquainted with history, what can be more easie, then to tell you where great multitudes of Christians in all ages have inhabited, and where many parts of the Church have been, though no man can give you a Catalogue of the Church, any more then of the world?</p>
                  <p>Would you know then where our Church, that is, the Catholike Church hath been, in all ages? why it hath been in <hi>Asia,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61117:135"/>
Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Is that too general? It hath been in <hi>Syria,</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, Media, Armenia, India, Persia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Habassia, Georgia, Cilicia, Circassia, Mengrelia, Natolia, Isauria, Thrace,</hi> and more other Countries, then I have any need to name to you, (to say nothing of <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Brittain</hi> by name, as a thing most known). But no man well in his wits will deny a succession of the Christian Church which I have defined, from the first plantation of it until now. If Christianity had ever ceased in the world, how came it to be new planted, and revived?</p>
                  <p>That this before described is the only Catholike Church that hath been owned by the ancient Doctors, appeareth by their constant witnesses. To cite a few, and yet enough.</p>

                  <p>The consequence also is past denyal. 1. Because the <hi>Roman</hi> as Christian, is part of the universal Christian Church. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they profess to believe the same holy Scriptures and Creed as we do.

So that themselves are our sufficient witnesses.</p>
                  <p>Well! but this will not satisfie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,

unless we shew a succession of our Church as Protestant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This we need not, any more then a sound man lately cured of the Plague, doth need to prove, that he hath ever been, not only <hi>sanus</hi> but <hi>sanatus,</hi> a cured man (before he was sick.) How could there be a Church protesting against an universal Vicar of Christ, before any claimed that Vicarship? 2. And when the Vicarship was usurped, those millions, abroad, and even within the <hi>Roman</hi> territories, that let the pretended Vicar talk, and followed their own business, and never consented to his usurpation, were of the very same Religion with those that openly protested against him: And so were those that never heard of his usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But at least, (say they) you must prove a Church that hath been without the universal Vicar negatively, though not against him positively.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But they have possession, and therefore you that would dispossess them, must disprove their title.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is nothing to most of the Catholike Church where they have no possession: therefore with them they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves obliged to the proof. 2. This is a meer fallacious diversion: for we are not now upon the question of their Title, but the matter of fact and history: we make good the negative, that they have no Title from the Laws of Christ himself: and so will not dispossess them without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their pretended Title. But when the question is <hi>de facto,</hi> whether they have ever had that possession from the Apostles daies, they that affirm must prove, when we have disabled their title from the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what must we prove? that <hi>all</hi> the Church hath been guiltless of the Papal usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, or only <hi>some</hi> in every age? of <hi>all</hi> its no more necessary to us, then to prove that there have been no Heresies since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. If a piece of the Church may turn Hereticks, or but Schismaticks, as the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Donatists, why may not another piece turn Papists?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What will you say to a man that knoweth not a Protestant, nor a Papist, or believeth only Christianity it self, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth not with the Pope, any further then to say, [I believe not in him, Jesus I know:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61117:142"/>
and the Apostles, and Scripture, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity I know, but the Pope I know not:] and suppose he never subscribed to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustane, English,</hi> or any such confession, but only to the Scripture, and the Apostles, and Nicene, and other ancient Creeds; By what shew of Justice can you require this man to prove that there hath been no Pope in every age?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The foundation of all our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is doctrinal, whether the Papal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty be Essential to the Church? or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our membership? we deny it; you affirm it. If it be not Essential, it is enough to us, to prove that which is Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, to have been successive: we be not bound in order to the proof of our Church it self, to prove the succession of every thing that maketh but to its better being.</p>
                  <p>Yet professing, that we do it not as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our main cause, we shall <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti</hi> prove the negative, that the Catholike Church hath not alwaies owned the Papal Soveraignty, and so that there have been men that were not only Christians, but as we, Christians without Popery, and against it: and so shall both prove our <hi>Thesis,</hi> and overthrow theirs.</p>

daies of Christ, a Christian Church that was not subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope, as the Vicar of Christ and universal Head and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Church; then the Church of which the Protestants are members, hath been visible both in its being, and its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Popery. But the Antecedent is true: therefore so is the consequent.</p>
                  <p>I shall prove the Antecedent, and therein the visibility of our Church, and the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence in those times of the Papacy.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. My first Argument shall be from the general Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the priviledges of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea were given to it by the Bishops consequently because of the Empire of that City, and therefore equal priviledges after given to <hi>Constantinople</hi> on the same account; then had not <hi>Rome</hi> those priviledges from the Apostles (and consequently the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church was without them). But the Antecedent is affirmed by that fourth great approved Council: In <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Bin. p.</hi> 134. [We everywhere following the definitions of the holy Fathers, and the Canon, and the things that have been now read, of the hundred and fifty Bishops most beloved to God, that were congregate under the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> the great of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61117:143"/>
pious memory, in the Royal City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> new <hi>Rome,</hi> we also knowing them, have defined the same things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priviledges of the same most holy Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> new <hi>Rome:</hi> For to the seat of old <hi>Rome,</hi> because of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of that City, the Fathers consequently gave the priviledges. And the hundred and fifty Bishops, most beloved of God, being moved with the same intention, have given equal priviledges to the most holy seat of new <hi>Rome</hi>: reasonably judging, that the City adorned with the Empire and Senate, shall enjoy equal priviledges with old Regal <hi>Rome.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Here we have the Testimony of one of the greatest general Councils, of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane original of <hi>Romes</hi> priviledges. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> hath nothing to say, but that they spoke falsly, and that this clause was not confirmed by the Pope (which are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by me elsewhere.) But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our present business: It is a matter of fact that I use their Testimony for. And if all the Bishops in two of the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved general Councils, (called the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative Catholike Church) were not competent witnesses in such a case, to tell us what was done, and what was not done
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61117:144"/>
in those times, then we have none. The Papists can pretend to no higher testimony on their part. The Church it self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath here decided the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
                  <p>And yet note, that even these priviledges of <hi>Rome</hi> were none of his pretended univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Government.</p>
                  <p>Its in vain to talk of the Testimonies of particular Doctors, if the most renowned general Councils cannot be believed. Yet I will add an Argument from them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Had the <hi>Roman</hi> universal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, as essential to the Catholike Church, been known in the daies of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Cyprian, Athanasius, Nazianzen, Nyssen, Basil, Optatus, Augustine,</hi> and the other Doctors that confounded the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies or Schisms of those times (<hi>e. g.</hi> the <hi>Novatians, Donatists, Arrians,</hi> &amp;c.) the said Doctors would have plainly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently insisted on it for the conviction of those Hereticks and Schismaticks: But this they do not: therefore it was not known in those times.</p>
                  <p>The consequence of the Major is evident hence: The Doctors of the Church were men at least of common wit and prudence in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61117:144"/>
the matters which they did debate: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would have insisted on this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if then it had been known. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the consequence is, because it had been most obvious, easie, and potent to dispatch their controversies. 1. When the <hi>Arrians</hi> and many other Hereticks denied Christs eternal Godhead, had it not been the shortest expeditious course, to have cited them to the barr of the Judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, the infallible Soveraign Head of the Church; and convinced them that they were to stand to his judgement? 2. Had not this Argument been at hand, to have confounded all Heresies at once, [That which agreeth not with the Belief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope and Church is false: But such is your opinion: therefore]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So for the Donatists; when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for so many years against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, which was the true Church, had it not been <hi>Augustins</hi> shortest, surest way to have argued thus: That only is the true Church that is subject to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and adhereth to him: But so do not you: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.]</p>
                  <p>Either the <hi>Arrians, Donatists</hi> and such others did believe the Papal Soveraignty and Vicarship, or not: If they did, 1. How
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61117:145"/>
is it possible they should actually reject both the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of the Pope and Roman Church? 2. And why did not the Fathers rebuke them for sinning against conscience, and their own profession herein?</p>
                  <p>But if they did not believe the Papal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, then 2. How came it to pass that the Fathers did labour no more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of that (now supposed) fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Errour? when 1. It is supposed as hainous a sin as many of the rest. 2. And was the maintainer of the rest. Had they but first demonstrated to them, that the Pope was their Governour and Judge, and that his Headship being essentiall to the Church, it must needs be of his faith, all Heresies might have been confuted, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple satisfied, and the controversies dispatched in a few words.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Either Arrians, Donatists, Novatians, and such like, were before their defection acquainted with the Roman Soveraignty, or not. If they were not, then it is a sign it was not commonly then received in the Church, and that there were multitudes of Christians that were no Papists: If they were, then why did not the Fathers, 1. Urge them with this as a granted truth, till they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61117:145"/>
had renounced it? 2. And then why did they not charge this defection from the Pope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, among their hainous crimes? why did they not tell them, that they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him as soon as they were made Christians; and therefore they should not perfidiously revolt from him? How is it that we find not this point disputed by them on both sides, yea and as copiously as the rest, when it would have ended all?</p>
                  <p>And for the Minor, that the Fathers have not thus dealt with Hereticks, the whole Books of <hi>Tertullian, Nazianzen, Nyssen, Basil, Optatus, Hierom, Augustine,</hi> and others are open certain witnesses. They use no such Argument, but fill their Books with others; most imprudently and vainly, if they had known of this, and had believed it. Otherwise the Papists would never have been put to gather up a few impertinent scraps to make a shew with.</p>
                  <p>We see by experience here among us, that this point is Voluminously debated; and if we differ in other matters, the Papists call us to the Roman bar, and bring in this as the principall difference. And why would it not have been so then between the Fathers, and the Donatists, Arrians, and such like, if the Fathers had believed this? Its clear
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61117:146"/>
hence that the Papall Vicarship was then unknown to the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Tradition witnessed by the greater part of the Universal Church saith, that the Papal Vicarship or Soveraignty is an innovation and usurpation, and that the Catholick Church was many hundred years without it: Therefore there was then no such Papal Church.</p>
                  <p>This is not a single testimony, nor of ten thousand, or ten millions, but of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Vote of the whole Church; and in Councils the Major Vote stands for the whole. If this witness therefore be refused, we cannot expect that the words of a few Doctors should be credited; Nor may they expect that we credit any witness of theirs, that is not more credible.</p>
                  <p>And that the Antecedent is true, is known to the world; as we know that the Turks believe in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by the common consent of history and travellers. Part of the Churches anathematize the Romans, and part more modestly disown them, and the generality that subject not themselves do profess that Popery is an usurpation, and that in the ancient Church it was not so; and this they have by Tradition from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation. And if the Roman
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61117:146"/>
pretended Tradition be with them of value, the Tradition of the far greater part of the Church is with us to be of more. We must despair of satisfying them with witness, if most of the Christian world be rejected, and the Tradition of the greatest part of the Church be taken to be false in a matter of publick notorious fact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Many Churches without the verge of the Roman Empire, never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themselves to <hi>Rome,</hi> (and many not of many hundred years after Christ:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were visible Christian Churches from the beginning, to this day, that were not for the Roman Vicarship.</p>
                  <p>That abundance of Churches were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles, without the reach of the Roman Empire, is plentifully testified by the ancients, and the Papists commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it. That these were under the Papal Government, all the Papists in the world cannot prove. The contrary is confessed by them, and proved by us. 1. They came not so much as to Generall Councils. 2. They had no Bishops ordained by the Pope, or any impowred by him. 3. They never appealed to him. 4. They never had any causes judged by him. 5. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed no obedience to him, nor lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61117:147"/>
his Laws; nor scarce had any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, more then the common communion that is held in Charity, and common faith and ordinances with all. Such were the Indians, the Persians, the further <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Parthia,</hi> the Habassines and many more. And of long time the English and the Scots, that refused so much as to eat and drink in the same Inn with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Legates: much less would obey him, so much as in the change of Easter day; we challenge them to shew us any appearance of subjection to the Pope in the generality of the Churches without the Empire.</p>
                  <p>But you say, that the Habassines were under the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and he under the Pope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If that were true, yet whats that to all the rest? 2. Give us your proof that the Abassines were under the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before that Patriarch broke off his communion with <hi>Rome.</hi> The Canons of <hi>Pisanus,</hi> of yesterdayes inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we regard not: Surely the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Nice</hi> (<hi>Can.</hi> 6.) measure out no more to the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but <hi>Aegypt, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis.</hi> There's no mention of <hi>Ethiopia</hi>: And its not like that the greatest part of his Province would
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61117:147"/>
have been left out. 3. If it had been so, yet we utterly deny that ever the Pope had the Government of the Alexandrian Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch: Only for a little while he had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency in honorary Title, and in Councils; as the City of <hi>London</hi> is preferred before <hi>York,</hi> but doth not Govern it at all.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore (without the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) you may see those Churches that have successively been visible, and yet no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.

And they can give us themselves no plausible appearance of a proof of that subjection which they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61117:148"/>
assert: no more then the younger Justices on the Bench are subject to the elder, or the Jury to the foreman, or a Master of Arts in a Colledge to a Batchelor in Divinity, or then the Mayor of <hi>Bristoll</hi> is to the Mayor of <hi>York.</hi>

But I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this fully from his following words.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Ita ut Vniversa sibi tentet ascribere, &amp; omnia quae soli uni capiti cohaerent, videlicet Christo, per elationem pompatici sermonis, ejusdem Christi sibi studeat membra subju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Here it is plain 1. That it is the <hi>Thing</hi> as
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61117:149"/>
well as the <hi>Name</hi> that <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote against. 2. And that it is also a palpable fiction of the Papists (for want of a better) that <hi>Gregory</hi> opposeth only such an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Episcopacy as taketh away all Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy from others. Ridiculous! They would make us believe, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> would have had no Bishop in the world but himself; and that the Council that gave him the Title, intended all to degrade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and that there were no Bishops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him ever after; when other Councils confirmed his Title. On the contrary, you here see 1. That there is but one Head, even Christ. 2. And that <hi>Iohns</hi> sin in arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Title [<hi>Vniversal</hi>] was, that he would subjugate, or subject all Christs Members to himself. And is not this now the very form of Popery, which <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> makes so great a sin? even to subject all Christs Members to one, as an Universal Patriarch or Bishop? Yea much higher Titles do they arrogate, even to be [the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Christ, and God, and in stead of Christ and God; and to be the Vice-Christ.]</p>
                  <p>He proceeds [<hi>Nec mirum quod ille ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, qui initium omnis peccati scit esse super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biam,</hi> &amp;c.] Making the Devil the author of this Title.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:61117:150"/>He adds a weighty reason [<hi>si enim hoc dici licenter permittitur, honor Patriarcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum omnium negatur. Et cum fortasse is in errore periit qui Vniversalis dicitur, nullus jam Episcopus remansisse in statu veritatis invenitur</hi>] or as more plainly before <hi>c.</hi> 76. <hi>fol.</hi> 180. in the <hi>Epist.</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Maurice [si igitur illud nomen in ea Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia sibi quisquam arripuit, quod apud bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum omnium judicium fuit: Vniversa ergo Ecclesia, quod absit, à statu suo corruit, quando is qui appellatur Vniversalis cadit]</hi> The reason is plain, because the Head of every political society is essential to it: and therefore if the Head of the Universal Church fall away to Heresie or Infidelity, the Church falls: as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knew when he told us, that if the Pope should erre in determining, the Church would be bound to take evil for good, and vice for vertue.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds in the same <hi>Epist. ad Maur. Imperat.</hi> [<hi>Sed absit à Cordibus Christiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nomen istud blasphemiae,</hi> &amp;c.] [Far be this name of blasphemy from the hearts of Christians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>And after again saith [<hi>Sed nullus eorum unquam. hoc singularitatis vocabulum assumpsit, nec uti consensit</hi>] That none of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61117:150"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops did ever assume this name of singularity, nor consent to use it.]</p>
                  <p>And therefore he concludes to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> c. 80. [<hi>Oportet ergo ut constanter ac sine praejudicio servetis sicut accepistis Ecclesias, &amp; nihil sibi in nobis haec tentatio diabolicae usurpationis ascribat.

                  <p>And in <hi>Ep.</hi> 38. <hi>c.</hi> 82. to <hi>Iohn Const.</hi> himself he calls it [<hi>Nefandum elationis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulum</hi>] and the cause [<hi>Nefandum &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanum tumorem</hi>] and after he calls it [the usurping of a proud and foolish word.]</p>
                  <p>To all this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> miserably answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>de Pontif. Rom. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 31. that the title [Universal] as it signifieth a sole Bishop to whom all other are but Vicars, is indeed profane, sacrilegious and Anrichristian, and is it that <hi>Gregory</hi> speaks against, but not as it excludeth not particular Bishops,] To which I answer, 1. To be the <hi>Vicarius</hi> of a Superiour, is not an exclusion. The Pope saith he is the Vicar of Christ the chief
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61117:151"/>
Pastour and Bishop of souls: and all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours are to Preach the Word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation in his name and stead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and yet they are not thereby excluded from being Pastours. If to be Christs servants, may consist with Episcopacy; much more to be his <hi>Vicarii</hi> over their particular flocks. Rather this is too high an honour for us to assume. I do not think that all the Clergy under the Pope, do think themselves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured so much as they should be if they were his Vicars. 2. Hath not that man sold his conscience to his cause, that will perswade the world that the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was about to unbishop all the Bishops in the world except himself? Let any man shew us by tolerable proof, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their cause is at a fair pass, when they must fly to such palpable falshoods, as makes them the wonder of their sober readers. 3. I proved before from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that it is Superiority
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61117:151"/>
of Government, and making all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops subject to him, that he condemned in the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And no doubt he made not the least of his arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Nor do I believe that it can be proved that <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the Council that gave him the Title, did ever intend so much as a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Government, which the Pope now usurpeth; but only a Primacy before all, which Popes were then striving for. For the Greeks to this day disclaim it, and they never strove to exercise it.</p>

                  <p>Here you see 1. That the unity and concord of the Church is not maintained by universal Headship, but by fraternal communion and humility. 2. That it wounded <hi>Paul,</hi> and should do us, to see the Church make men as it were their heads, though they were Apostles, and though <hi>Peter</hi> was one of them: and that <hi>extra Christum,</hi> beside Christ, none, no not <hi>Peter</hi> should be as a Head to Christs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 3. Much more abominable is it for any man to pretend to be the universal Bishop or Head to all Christs members: 4. That the sin of this usurpation was against Christ the Churches Head, and that before him in Judgement the usurper of universal Episcopacy will be confounded for this very thing. 5. And that the crime of this title of universal Bishop was, that it endeavoured to put all Christs members under him that used it <hi>(tibimet supponere:)</hi> not to exclude all other Bishops, but to put under him all Christs members. These are the words of <hi>Gregory:</hi> and if men can make what their list of words so full and plain,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61117:152"/>
and oft repeated in many Epistles, what hope have they that their Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies should do any more to end their Controversies then Scripture hath done, which they cannot understand without such an unintelligible Judge?</p>
                  <p>He proceeds <hi>(ibid.)</hi> [<hi>Quis ergo in hoc tam perverso vocabulo, nisi ille ad imitandum proponitur, qui despectis Angelorum legioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, secum socialiter constitutis, ad culmen conatus est singularitatis erumpere, ut &amp; nulli subesse, &amp; solus omnibus praeesse videre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>] He maketh him the imitator of the Devil, that aspiring above the rest of the Angels, fell by pride.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath three Reasons to prove yet that <hi>Gregory</hi> after all this meant not the universal Headship or Episcopacy indeed. 1. Because the holy Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> offered it him. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. A fair offer! because two or three Deacons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed their Libels to him with the name of universal Archbishop: And we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Council approved of this, though we cannot prove it. Or if they called him the <hi>Head,</hi> as the City of <hi>London</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> City in <hi>England,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> the Head Earle, or the Lord Chancelour the Head Judge, that yet have
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61117:153"/>
no Government of the rest, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage were this to the <hi>Roman</hi> Vicarship? 2. If <hi>Gregory</hi> judge the name so blasphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when it signifieth an universal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church, surely he believed that the Council offered it not to him in that sence, but as he was the <hi>Episcopus primae sedis.</hi> 3. But again, I say the matter of fact is it that I am enquiring of: And I have the testimony of this <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop that none of his Predecessors would receive that name.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he saith that the care of the whole Church was committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> which is all one.] <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

                  <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not charge <hi>Gregory</hi> of such horrid dissimulation without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

                  <p>But 2. His other reason is worse then this; forsooth [because the question was only whether <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should have this title, and not whether the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should have it: and therefore <hi>Gregory</hi> simply and absolutely pronounceth the name sacrilegious and prophane, that is, as given to <hi>Iohn,</hi> (but not to himself) yet he refused it himself, though due to him, that he might the better repress the pride of the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>] <hi>Ans.</hi> The sum is then, that <hi>Gregory</hi> did meerly lye and dissemble for his own end.

which he desired; But we will not judge so odiously of the Pope as Papists do. Doth he charge the other Patriarchs and Bishops to give it no man? doth he blame them after in other Epistles that gave him that Title? and doth he profess that never any of his Predecessors received it, and make so hainous a matter of it, and yet all this while approve it as for himself? Who will believe a Saint to be so diabolical, that calls it an imitation of the Devil?

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They differ in nothing Essentiall to our Church or Religion, nor near the Essence. 2.

                  <p>I will now add a Testimony sufficient to silence Papists in this point: and that is, The Determination of the Theological fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Paris</hi> under their great Seal, against one <hi>Iohan. de Montesono ordinis Praedic.</hi> as you may find it after the rest of the Errors

rejected by that University, in the end of <hi>Lombard,</hi> printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1557. <hi>pag.</hi> 426. Their 3. Conclusion is, that [Saint <hi>Thom. Aquin.</hi> doctrine is not so approved by the Church, as that we must believe that it is in no part of it erroneous <hi>de fide</hi> (in matter of faith) or hereticall. They prove it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath many contradictions, even in matter of faith; and therefore they ought not to believe it not hereticall. Here <hi>fol.</hi> 426, 427. they give six examples of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions: and therefore they conclude, that though he were no Heretick (because not pertinacious) yet they ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that his doctrine was in no part hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or erroneous in the faith. They further argue thus [If we must believe his doctrine not hereticall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this should be chiefly, because it is approved by the Church. But there is some doctrine much more approved by the Church then the doctrine of S. <hi>Tho.</hi> which yet is in some part of it hereticall or erroneous in the faith: therefore— The Minor they prove by many examples. The first is of <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. (I own not this by citing it:) The second is of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> The third of <hi>Hierom</hi>; and they add, that the same may be said of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and many more approved Doctors.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61117:163"/>
The fourth example is <hi>Lombard</hi> himself, who they say hath somewhat erroneous in the faith. The fifth is <hi>Gratian,</hi> who had he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously adhered to his doctrine, they say, had been a manifest Heretick: And (say they) some say the like of the Ordinary Glosses of the Bible, which yet seem of greater authority then <hi>Aquinas.</hi> The sixth example is of some not Canonized Saints, as <hi>Anselm. Cantuar. Hugo de Sancto Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> and others, as authentick as S. <hi>Thomas.</hi>] [And (say they) his Canonization, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not, which some pretend as of great colour—To say that S. <hi>Tho.</hi> in some part of his doctrine erred in faith, derogates not from his Canonization, nor from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his Theologicall doctrine: even as to say this of other Saints and chief Doctors derogateth not from their Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation or approbation. For as the Church by Canonizing one a Saint, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by approve all his Deeds, so in approving his doctrine, it doth not hereby approve all his sayings or writings, but only that which is not retracted by himself, or corrected by another, or deservedly to be corrected as contrary to truth.</p>
                  <p>And now when Fathers, even the chief, and your Saints and highest Doctors have
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61117:164"/>
this Testimony from the famous University of <hi>Paris,</hi> to have somewhat hereticall or erroneous in the faith (and so who among you is free?) I leave it to modesty to judge, whether the Greeks, Armenians, &amp;c. and we, are not of one Faith, Religion, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, for all our differences in some points! Have you had all these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons man by man before your bar, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of pertinaciousness in heresie? If not, call them not Hereticks till you are willing to be called such your selves, and that by your selves.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have evinced, 1. That the Church of which the Protestants are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, hath been Visible since the dayes of Christ on earth. 2. And <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that the Papal Church as Papal hath not been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and that Christian Churches without Papal Soveraignty have been Visible since <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes, and the whole Catholick Church was such before. And you see both in the Essentialls, and in the freedom from the Romish Vice-Christ, where our Church hath been before <hi>Luther,</hi> even since Christ.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I have performed this task on this supposed condition, that you will now do
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61117:164"/>
the like as to your own Church; and send me in solid Arguments your proof of this Thesis.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>The Church of which the Subjects of the Pope are Members, hath been Visible ever since the dayes of Christ on earth.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Where note, that it is not the Visibility of your Church as Christian, United in Christ the Head, that is in Question: We grant, as Christians, all of you are of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church that destroy not your Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: But it is your new Church form, as Papal, that we question, and renounce. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are of no Church but the Christian united in Christ: The name Protestant sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth not any essentiall of their Church, but their Rejection of your Church as Headed by the Pope: You are therefore to prove that your Catholick Church as Headed by the Pope hath been visible in all ages.</p>
                  <p>And here I must in Justice expect, that you give us such a Definition as you will stand to through the dispute, 1. Of [the Church] 2. Of [the Pope] and 3. [Of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Pope] or [Papists.] The term [Roman Catholicks] would but divert and elude: For it is not as [Romane] that we oppose you, that is, as inhabitants
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61117:165"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or as subject to him as a Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>: Nor is it as [Catholicks] that is, as of the Universal Christian Church: but as [Papists] that is, [subjects of the Pope as universal Soveraign, or Bishop.] To dispute of terms not agreed on, is lost la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Define first, or you do nothing.

sufficient proof: but yet we will accept of them, when you argue but <hi>ad hominem</hi>: for we renounce them not.

                        <p>
                           <hi>ANsw.</hi> My words are plain, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly answer your question, so that I know not what more is needful for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of my sense; Unless you would call us back from the <hi>Thing</hi> to the meer <hi>Name,</hi> by your [properly so called,] you are answered already. But I would speak as plainly as I can, and if it be possible for me
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61117:170"/>
to be understood by you, I shall do my part.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is supposed that you and I are not agreed What <hi>the Vniversal visible Church</hi> it self is, while you take the Pope, or any meer humane Head to be an essential part; which is an assertion that with much abhorrence I deny. You think each member of that Church must necessarily <hi>ad esse,</hi> be a subject of the Pope; and I think it enough that he be a subject of Christ; and to his <hi>orderly</hi> and well-being, that he hold local Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the parts within the reach of his capacity, and be subject to the Pastors that are set over him; maintaining due associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with and charity to the rest of the more distinct members, as he is capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them at that distance. So that when I have proved a person to be a member of the Catholick Church, it is not your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church that I mean: No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ound Christian is a member of yours; it is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks (in the softer sense) that are its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Its necessary therefore that we first agree of the Definition of the Catholick Church, before we dispute who is in it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Your word [Properly so called] is ambiguous; referring either to the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, or to some definition in an authentick
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61117:170"/>
Canon; or to custom and common speech. Of the first, we have no reason now to enter controversie: For the second, I know no such stablisht Definition that we are agreed on: For the third, custom is so variable here, not agreeing with it self, that what is to be denominated <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Improper</hi> from it, is not to be well conjectured. However all this is but <hi>de nomine</hi>; and What is the proper, and What the improper use of the word <hi>Heretick,</hi> is no Article of Faith, nor necessary for our debate. Therefore again you must accept of my distinguishing, and give me leave to fly confusion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The word [Heretick] is either spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of one that corrupteth the Doctrine of Faith (as such), or of one that upon some difference of Opinion, or some personal quarrels, withdraweth from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those particular Churches that before he held communion with, and gathereth a separated party: such are most usually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Schismaticks; but of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. As the word [Hereticks] signifieth Schismaticks as such, so Hereticks with drawing from some parts of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church only, may yet be parts of the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

maketh neither cease to be parts] and while both own the Head and the Body as such, they have an union <hi>in tertio,</hi> and so a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the principal respects, while they peevishly disclaim it in other respects. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the local or particular Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is it that is proper to members of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and therefore the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it only separates him from that Church. But it is the general Communion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us as members of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, which may be still continued. But should any renounce the Body of Christ as such, and separate (not from this or that Church, but) from the whole, or from the Church Universal as such, this man would be no member of the Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. As the word [Heretick] is taken for one that denyeth any thing essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Christianity; so an Heretick, if latent, is out of the Church <hi>Deo judice,</hi> as to the invisible part, or soul of the Church, (as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> calls it) as a latent Infidel is; but he may be (if latent) in the outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls him) a dead member, that properly is none; as the straw and chaffe are in the corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</p>

judged by the Pastors of that particular Church, of which he is a subject-member, is accordingly to be avoided, and <hi>in foro illius Ecclesiae,</hi> is so far cast out of that Church, as the sentence importeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. Such an Heretick, if he be a Pastor of one Church, and be convict and condemned by the consociate co-equal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of the neighbour Churches, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly cast out from communion of all the Churches, of which they are Pastors.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. So far as any Christians through the world have sufficient proof or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance of the said conviction and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they are all bound accordingly to esteem the condemned Heretick, and avoid him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop</hi> 6. If [Heresie] be taken for the obstinate, impenitent resisting or rejecting of any point of Faith (that is, of Divine Revelation) which is made so plain to the person, that nothing but a wicked will could cause such resistance or rejection, such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being justly convicted and condemned as aforesaid, are to be taken as persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for obstinacy and impenitency in any other sin; and are out of the Church, as far as a man condemned for impenitency in drunkenness or fornication is.</p>

                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. Heresie taken in this softer sense (for the denyal of a truth of Divine revelation, not essential to the Christian Religion, or necessary to the Being of a Christian) excludeth no man from the Church of it self, unless they are legally convict of wicked Impenitency and obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in defending it.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. A sentence passed by an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Pastor, (or by many) if it be noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously unjust, <hi>clave errante,</hi> proveth no man an Heretick, or out of the Universal Church.</p>

                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. A sentence passed by one Church, or many consociate, binds none to take the condemned person to be an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and out of the Universal Church, but those that have sufficient notice of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Judges, and validity of the Evidence, or a ground of <hi>violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> (as its called) that the sentence is just.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. He that is sentenced an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Impenitent by the Pastors of some Churches, and acquit by the equally-au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Pastors of other Churches, is not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61117:173"/>
                           <hi>eo nomine</hi> to be condemned or acquit by a third Church, but used as the evidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. There is an actual excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication <hi>pro medelâ</hi> and <hi>pro tempore,</hi> due for an actual, willful defence of error, or for other willful sin; which statedly puts not a man out of the Church; as there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication <hi>à statu &amp; Relatione,</hi> which is due for stated habitual or obstinate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency in that or other great or known sin.</p>
                        <p>Having thus distinctly told you my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment how far Hereticks are, or are not in or out of the universal Church, I add in order to the application: 1. That this whole debate is nothing to the great difference between you and us, it being not <hi>de fide</hi> in your own account, but a <hi>dogma theologicum,</hi> which you differ about among your selves: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells you <hi>Alphonsus a Castro</hi> maintaineth that <hi>Hereticks are in the Church</hi> (de Eccles. l. 3. c. 4.) And he himself saith that <hi>haeretici pertinent ad Ecclesiam ut oves ad ovile unde confugerunt,</hi> ibid. c. 4. so that they are <hi>oves</hi> still, and if it be but <hi>ovile par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare (veluti Romanum)</hi> that they fly from, and not the <hi>Vniversal,</hi> that proves them not out of the <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi>
                           <pb n="301" facs="tcp:61117:173"/>
And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith of the <hi>Catechumen. &amp; Excommunicatis,</hi> that they are <hi>de anima, et si non de corpore Ecclesiae,</hi> ib. c. 2. <hi>and may be saved,</hi> cap. 6. And the <hi>anima Ecclesiae</hi> is not incorporated in the world without: All that have that soul, are of that Church which Christ (that animateth his members) is the head of. Which made <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> (<hi>fatente Bellarmino de Eccl. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the being of that which indeed is the true Catholike Church, saying of the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized Believers,</hi> that [<hi>sunt de Ecclesia quae comprehendit omnes fideles ab Abel usque ad consummationem mundi.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Many Popes have been condemned for Hereticks, even by General Councils, as not only <hi>Henorius</hi> (by two or three) but <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> by the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> when yet he kept his place, and the rest come in as his successors. And your writers frequently confess that a Pope may be an Heretick (as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> himself affirmeth.) Now if these are not of the Church, then they are not Heads of the Church, and then being essential parts of your Church, it followeth that your Church is heretical and unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them. But if these Popes may be in the Church (and Heads of yours) while Hereticks, then so may others.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="302" facs="tcp:61117:174"/>3. Its commonly said by others (of yours) as well as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were misinformed about <hi>Honorius,</hi> (and the Popes that consented to those Councils) and so that he was not a Heretick nor out of the Church: Also that a Pope may erre in matter of fact, and unjustly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. If so, a Pope and Council may erre about another, as well as about <hi>Honorius</hi> or other Popes; and therefore their sentence be no proof that such are out of the Church, no more then that he and <hi>Eugenius</hi> were out.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As the Pope and his Synods condemn the Greeke, so the Greeks condemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate you; as formerly the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Pope have excommunicated each other. I am therefore no more bound to take them for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate persons, than you, they having as much authority over you as you over them, and their witness being to us as credible as yours.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>Abassines, Armenians, Greeks,</hi> &amp;c. are not proved to deny any essential point of the Christian Religion, or which is necessary to the Being of a Christian or Church.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Nor are they proved to be willful,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61117:174"/>
obstinate and impenitent in defending any errors, with a wicked mind; and so to be formally Hereticks in your own sense.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. They are large Nations, and millions of souls, and their Pastours numerous, so that its impossible they should be all legally by you convicted. They never spake for themselves, nor were witnesses heard against them. <hi>Noxa caput sequitur.</hi> Guilt of Heresie is to be proved of each individual whom you condemn. If a few Bishops were Hereticks, or a Prince were such, that proves not that the rest, and all the Pastors, or people, even to many mill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ons are such. Or if half had been such in former ages, that proves not that half or any are such now. Christ never appointed the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of millions for the sakes of a few of their Rulers, nor of whole Nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; but of single persons upon a just and equal tryal. If therefore your Pope, or any of his Councils, (which you falsly call General) do excommunicate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Habassia, Armenia, Georgia, Syria,</hi> and other Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61117:175"/>
arrogancy, presuming to pass a damning sentence on so many millions of souls, whose faces you never saw, nor were ever called to a legal tryal.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Your own writers ordinarily acquit the Greeks from Heresie; and those of them that have travelled to other Countries, as <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp;c. acquit most of them, as I have proved in former writings out of their own words (not needful therefore here to be recited, when you may see any writings.]</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Your Pope (and Bishops) is none of their authorized Pastor, and therefore hath no power as such to judge them. And as neighbour Churches they have as much to do to judge you as you to judge them. Therefore they are never the more out of the Church for your judgement, any more than you for theirs.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. There are as many and as great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors proved by them to be in your Church as is by you to be in theirs: so that (in sum) your cause being much worse, and your censure of them proving you guilty of such inhumane cruelty, injustice, arrogancy, usurpation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by condemning them, you go much nearer to prove your selves no Christians and no Church than them.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And yet I think the far greatest part
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61117:175"/>
of them (many thousands to one) are not actually excommunicated or condemned by any pretended sentence of your own, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your writers may say of them, and whatever one Council might say of some few in some one age.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Lastly, It can be no matter of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to you your self, or any of you, that these Nations or Churches are Hereticks, both because it is a thing that none of your approved Councils have determined of, as to any person now living, nor to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number comparatively, in other ages; and also because you confess your Pope and Councils fallible in these cases, of fact and personal application. You cannot therefore build upon such acknowledged uncertainties.</p>
                        <p>BUt Sir, having thus answered your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I must ask you, whats all this to the Answer of my last Papers, which I have now near a year expected from you? I suspected some such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61117:176"/>
as you begun in your first Argument. 2. To answer my proofs of our successive visibility. 3. To prove your own successive visibility in all ages since Christ, as I have proved ours. I do therefore once more urge you speedily to do this, assuring you that else I must take it for an open deserting of your Cause.</p>
                        <p>But yet I must add, that if you will please to dispute the main cause in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, upon equal terms; we have yet other Questions in which we differ, that are lower then these, and nearer the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Besides the forementioned work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I desire, that you will dispute the main Cause, in two distinct disputations, in one of which be you the Opponent, and bring your strongest Arguments against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches and Religion; and in the other I will be Opponent and argue against Popery; in the beginning agreeing upon the sense of those terms that we are like to have greatest use of through our disputation. If you will but let us meet, and state our sense of such terms, before I return into the Country, that we may the better manage it after at a distance, it will be worth our labour: And for verbal dispute, I shall at

First you make the Catholick Church to consist only of visible Assemblies: and after you allow such to be members of the Church that are of no visible Assemblies 2. You now mention subjection to the supream Pastor as sufficient, which in your description or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition you did not. 3. If to be only <hi>in voto</hi> resolved to be of a particular Church will serve, then inexistence is not necessary. To be only <hi>in voto</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> proves no man a member of the Catholick Church, but proves the contrary, because it is <hi>Terminus diminuens.</hi> Seeing then by your
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61117:179"/>
own confession, <hi>inexistence</hi> in a particular Church is not of necessity to <hi>inexistence</hi> in the Catholike Church; why do you not only mention it in your definition, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Church to such? will you say you meant <hi>in voto</hi>? who then can understand you, when you say they must <hi>be of visible Assemblies,</hi> and mean, <hi>they need not be of any, but only to wish, desire or purpose it</hi>? 4. But yet you say nothing to my case in its lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Many a one may be converted to Christ by a solitary Preacher, or by two or three, that ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> convert many <hi>Indians</hi> to the faith of Christ, that never hear of a supream Pastor. 5. If it be necessary that a particular Church must be assigned for such members by the supream Pastor, then they are yet little the better that never have any such assignation from him (as few have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</p>

                        <hi>Reply, Ad</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. Your second answer fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves that your definitions signifie just nothing. They must <hi>live</hi> in unity of the faith: that is, either <hi>with faith</hi> or <hi>without it: with a belief</hi> of what Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hath revealed to be believed, or <hi>without it.</hi> For to <hi>believe</hi> any point <hi>implicitly,</hi> in your ordinary sense, is <hi>not to believe it,</hi> but only to believe one of the Premises, whence the conclusion must be inferred. But why do you not tell me what you mean by [<hi>an Implicite faith</hi>]? Faith is called Implicite in several senses. 1. When several truths are actually understood and believed <hi>in confuso,</hi> or in gross, in some one proposition which containeth the substance of them all; but not with accurate distinct conceptions, nor such as are ripe for any fit expression: This <hi>indistinct, immature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:61117:180"/>
kind of apprehension may be called Implicite; and the <hi>distinct</hi> and more digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conceptions <hi>Explicite.</hi> 2. When a general proposition is believed as the <hi>matter</hi> of our faith, but the <hi>particulars</hi> are not <hi>understood</hi> or not believed: As to believe that <hi>omne animal vivit,</hi> not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>you</hi> are <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Cadaver.</hi> Or to believe that [all that is in the Scripture is the Word of God and true,] but not to know [what is in the Scripture]. 3. When it is only the formal object of faith that is believed, without understanding the <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> object.</p>
                     <p>The first sort of these, I confess, is <hi>Actual Belief,</hi> though <hi>indistinct</hi>: But I suppose you mean not this. 1. Because it is not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sense of your party. 2. Because else you damn either all the world, or most of your own professed-party at least as no members of the Church: for few or none have an <hi>Actual understanding and belief</hi> of all that ever God revealed to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all men (or most at least) have been sinfully negligent in searching after, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving truth; and so are sinfully ignorant: No man knoweth all that God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that he ought to know. 3. Because by this rule it is impossible for you or any
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61117:181"/>
man to know who is indeed a member of your Church; for you cannot know mens confused knowledge, or know that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to all revealed: For if you speak of all <hi>revealed</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> or in <hi>Scripture,</hi> you still damn all, (or most in your own sense) for none, as I said, understand it all to a word: But if you speak of all which that particular man hath had sufficient means to know, it is then impossible for you to make a judgement of any mans faith by this: For you can never discern all the means (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or external) that ever he had; much less can you discern whether his faith be commensurate to the truth so far revealed. So that by this course you make your Church <hi>invisible.</hi> I pray tell me how you can avoid it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second sort of <hi>Implicite Belief,</hi> is no <hi>Belief</hi> of the particulars at all. An <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> may <hi>live,</hi> and yet it followeth not that you are <hi>alive</hi> or an <hi>animal.</hi> If this were your meaning, then either you mean [that it is enough if <hi>all</hi> be believed <hi>Implicitly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that general proposition]; or you mean that some must be believed <hi>explicitly</hi> (that is actually) and some Implicitly, (that is, not at all). If the former be your sense, then Infidels or Heathens may be of your
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61117:181"/>
Church. For a man may believe in general that [the Bible is the Word of God and true] and yet not know a word thats in it; and so not know that Christ is the Messias, or that ever there was such a person. But if <hi>somewhat</hi> must be <hi>explicitely</hi> (that is, <hi>Actually</hi>) believed, the Question that you should have answered was, [What is it?] For till that be known, no man can know a Member of your Church by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you take [<hi>Implicite</hi>] in the third sense, then <hi>Implicite faith</hi> is either <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane. Divine,</hi> when the <hi>Divine Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> is the formal <hi>Object. Humane,</hi> when mans Veracity is the formal Object. Which may be <hi>Conjunct</hi> where the Testimonies are so conjunct, as that we are sure it is God that speaks by man; who is therefore credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble because God infallibly guideth or inspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him: This is at once to believe a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Veracity. If any of this be your meaning, the last questions remain still to be resolved by you. A man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that [<hi>God is true,</hi>] and that [his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> or <hi>inspired messengers are true</hi>] and yet not understand a word of the message: so that still if this will serve, a man may be of your Church that knoweth not that ever
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61117:182"/>
there was such a person as Jesus Christ, or that ever he died for our sins, or rose again, or that we shall rise. And are Infidels of your Church while you are arguing us out? But if there be some truths besides the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God (and his Messengers) that must be believed, you must shew what it is, or your Church-members cannot be known. Tell me therefore without tergiversation, [what are the revealed truths that must actually be believed] or [what is the faith materially, in unity whereof all members of the Catholike Church do live?] I pray fly not, but plainly tell me.</p>
                     <p>And if again you fly to <hi>uncertain points,</hi> because of the diversity of means of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and say, [It must be so much to every man as he had means to know] I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain answer you. 1. If a man had no means to know that there is a Christ, it seems then he is one of your Church. 2. You still damn all your own, there being not a man that knoweth all that he had means to know, because all have culpably neglected means. And so you have no Church. 3. Still you make your Church invisible (if you had any:) For no man can tell, as I said, who <hi>knoweth</hi> in full proportion to his helps and means.

                        <hi>Ad Qu.</hi> 3. <hi>R. Reply</hi> 1. Here still you tell me that your descriptions signified nothing. You told me that the members must [live in dependance on their lawful Pastors.] And now you tell me that [their authority must not be rejected or contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.] And indeed, is <hi>dependance</hi> and <hi>non-rejection</hi> all one? The millions of heathens that never heard of the Pope or any of your Pastors <hi>reject</hi> them not, nor <hi>contemn</hi> them:
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61117:183"/>
Are they therefore fit matter for your Church? 2. If you say, that you mean it of such only as have a sufficient Revelation of the Authority of these Pastors, I further reply. 1. It seems then it is not only the Pope, but every Priest respectively that is an essential member of your Church; or to whom each member must be subject necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>ad esse.</hi> If so, then every man that by falling out or prejudice, doth culpably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the authority of any one Pastor or Priest among a swarm, is damned, or none of the Church, though he believe in the Pope and in twenty thousand Priests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then have we not cause to pray God to bless us from the company of your Priests? or at least, that we may not have too many, when among a multitude we may be in danger of rejecting some one, and then we are cast out of the Church! What if a Gentleman should find some such as <hi>Watson</hi> or <hi>Montaltus</hi> describe in bed with his wife; or a Prince find a <hi>Garnet,</hi> a <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> or a <hi>Parsons</hi> in a Treason, and by such a temptation should be so weak, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, or reject the authority of that single Priest, while he honoureth all the rest: Is it certain, that such a man is none of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61117:183"/>
Church for that? How hard is it in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> then to be a Catholike, where Priests are so numerous, that its ten to one, but among the crowd the authority of some one may be rejected!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But is it all the Priests that we never knew, or knew not to be Priests, that we must depend on, or is it only those whose authority is manifested to us by sufficient evidence? Doubtless you will confine our dependance to these only (or else no man could be a Christian:) And if so, you know we are never the nearer a resolution for your answer, till you yet tell us how we must know our Pastors to have authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. What if they shew me the Bishops orders, and I know that many have had forged Orders? am I bound to believe in his authority? what if I be utterly ignorant whether he that ordained him, were him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ordained? or had <hi>intentionem ordinandi</hi>? how shall I then be sure of his authority that is ordained? And how can the people be acquainted with the passages in Election and Ordination that are necessary to the knowledge of their authority? especially of the Popes and prelates. And what if you tell me your own opinion, of the <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means</hi> by which I must be convinced
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61117:184"/>
of the Popes and Priests authority? how shall I know that you are not deceived; and that these are the sufficient means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, unless a General Council have defined them to be sufficient? And if they have, if it were not as an Article of faith, you'l say I am not bound of necessity to believe their definition. And what if I have sufficient means to know the authority of a thousand Priests, but am culpably ignorant of it in some few through my neglect? Doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that therefore I am out of the Church? Is my obedience to each Priest as necessary, as my belief of every Article of my faith? If so, I know not whether your multiplying Articles, or multiplying Priests, doth fill hell faster, if men must be judged by your laws. But it is our Allegiance to our Soveraign, that is the character of a Subject in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and not our Allegiance, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to every inferiour Magistrate: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of one of them may stand with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, though not with innocency: It is not treason to reject a Constable: why then should more be necessary to our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership and salvation?</p>
                     <p>But still you make your Church invisible: For as no man can know that liveth in the remote parts of the world, whether your
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61117:184"/>
Popes themselves are truly Popes, as being duly qualified and elected, nor which is the true Pope, when you have oft had more then one at once; so you can never know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your members, whether their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on their Pastors be extensively proportionate to the means that discovered their authority? and whether their diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unchurch them or no? I earnestly crave your answer to the thirty uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which I have mentioned in my <hi>Safe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> p. 93, to 104. And tell us how all our Pastours may be known. And whether every particular sin unchurch men? and if not, why the contempt or rejection of a drunken Priest doth it, while all the rest are (perhaps too much) honoured?</p>

                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Still your descriptions signifie just nothing. You describe <hi>Heresie</hi> to be <hi>An Intellectual</hi> obstinate <hi>Opposition</hi>; and yet say that this is <hi>in the will.</hi> And yet again you contradict your self by saying that it is an <hi>Imperate act.</hi> No <hi>Imperate</hi> act is <hi>in the will,</hi> though it be <hi>from the will.</hi> It is <hi>voluntary,</hi> but not <hi>in voluntate.</hi> An <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perant</hi> act may be in the will, but not <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> All <hi>Imperate</hi> acts are in (or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the commanded faculties.) The <hi>Intelligere,</hi> which is the Imperate act, is in the <hi>Intellect</hi>: though the <hi>Velle intelligere,</hi> which is an Elicite act, be in the will. 2. From hence its plain that you cannot prove me or any man to be an Heretick that is unfeignedly willing to know the truth, and is not obstinately willful in opposing it: which are things that you cannot ordinarily
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61117:186"/>
discern and prove by others, that are ready to be sworn that they would fain know the truth.</p>

                     <p>Answ. <hi>Yes. Nor is he a</hi> Formal, <hi>but only a</hi> Material <hi>Heretick, who opposes a revealed Truth, which is not sufficiently propounded to him to be a Divine revelation.</hi>

                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>Reply</hi> 2. Every man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that there is a God indeed, believeth that he is true: For if he be not <hi>True,</hi> he is not <hi>God.</hi> If therefore no man be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> an Heretick, that doth not obstinately oppose the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God, which is the formal object, then as there are I hope but few Hereticks in the world, so those few
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61117:186"/>
cannot by ordinary means be known to you: unless they will say that they take God to be a lyar, so that you make none Hereticks indeed but Atheists.</p>
                     <p>What if a man deny that there is a Christ, a Heaven, a Hell, or a Resurrection? and also deny the <hi>Revelation</hi> it self, by which he should discern these truths? and yet deny not the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God, (no nor of the Church?) is this no Heretick? I would your party that have murdered so many thousands as Hereticks, had so judged: (if a falshood may be wished, as a thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to have prevented such a mischief.) It is not Gods <hi>Veracity</hi> that is commonly denyed by Hereticks, but the <hi>thing revealed,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation of that thing:</hi> And your <hi>Turnebul</hi> against <hi>Baronius</hi> hath told you, that the Revelation is no part of the <hi>Formal</hi> object of faith, but as it were the <hi>Copula,</hi> or a condition <hi>sine qua non.</hi> If he that obstinately refuseth to believe that the Godhead of Christ, or the Holy Ghost is any where by God revealed, and so denyeth it, be no Heretick, unless he also obstinately deny or resist the <hi>Veracity</hi> of God; then there are few that you can prove Hereticks. (For <hi>forma dat nomen</hi>; and he that is not a Heretick <hi>Formally,</hi> but <hi>materially only,</hi> is no Heretick at all.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:61117:187"/>Lastly, many a truth is sinfully neglected by the members of the Church; that have a proposal <hi>sufficient,</hi> and yet not <hi>effectual</hi> through their own fault: and yet they are no Hereticks. Millions in your Church are ignorant of truths sufficiently proposed, and therefore their ignorance is their sin: but it followeth not that it is their Heresie. But if it be, then Hereticks constitute your Church; and then your Church is a thing unknown; because the Hereticks cannot be known, the sufficiency of each mans revelation being much unknown to others.</p>

But if it did, either you think the <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> varieth according to the variety of advantages, opportunities, and capacities of the persons, or else that it consisteth only in the act of common publication, and so is the same to all the subjects. If the first be your sense (as I suppose it is,) then still you are uncertain who are Hereticks, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncertain of mens various capacities, and so of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> in question. Unless you will conclude (with me) that thus you make all Hereticks, as aforesaid; because all men living are culpably ignorant of some truths, which they had a revelation of that was thus far sufficient. If the second be your sense, then the same unhappy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will follow (that all are Hereticks;) and moreover, that some of obscure educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are unavoidably Hereticks, because they had no opportunity to know those

things, which as to the Majority, are of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick testimony</hi> or <hi>universal Tradition.</hi> Is not the Bible, a publick Testimony and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and being universally received, is an universal Tradition? And yet abundance of truths in the holy Bible are unknown, (and therefore not actually believed) by millions that are in your Church, and are not taken by your selves for Hereticks.

For either <hi>Election</hi> of him (by some body) is necessary, or not. If <hi>not,</hi> then you or another man unchosen may be Pope, for ought I know, or any man else. If <hi>yea</hi>; then it is either <hi>any bodies Election</hi> of him that will serve turn, or not. If <hi>it will,</hi> then you may be Pope, if your Scholars choose you, and then you have had three true Popes at once; for so many were <hi>Elected.</hi> But if <hi>it will not,</hi> then it must be known who hath the <hi>Power of Election,</hi> before it can be known who is indeed the Pope: But you are forced here by your answer to intimate to us, that the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> cannot be known: and therefore the Pope cannot be known. For,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61117:190"/>
1. Here are no determinate Electors men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and therefore it seems none known to you: And no wonder: for if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to the people, or to the Cardinals, or to the Emperours, or to Councils, you cut off all your Popes that were chosen by the other waies. 2. Nor do you determine of any particular discernable note, by which the Electors, and power of election may be known to the Church: But all these patches make up your description. 1. It must be those that are esteemed fit for the charge. 2. And that by those to whom it belongs. 3. And that by <hi>custome.</hi> 4. And that <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> 5. And the Church must be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the election. O miserable body then that hath been so oft headless, as <hi>Rome</hi> hath been! 1.

But is not this to say nothing while you pretend to speak? and to hide what you pretend to open? 3. And who knows what custome, and of what continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance you mean?

way; and later custom hath varied from both; and hath the power of Election changed so oft? 4. And who is it that must <hi>approve</hi> this custom? and what appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation must there be? All these are meer <hi>hiding,</hi> and not resolving of the doubt, and tell us that a Pope is a thing invisible or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. 5. And your <hi>last</hi> assureth us, that your succession was interrupted through many usurpations, yea indeed that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a Pope. For the Church was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the election of abundance of your Popes, when Whores, and Simony, and Murder, and power set them up: And most of the Church through the world is unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with them still to this day. And you have no way to know whether the greater part of the Church is satisfied or not; for non-resistance is no sign of satisfaction, where men have not opportunity or power to resist. And when one part of Europe was for one Pope, and another for another through so many Schisms, who knows which had the <hi>approbation</hi> of that which may be called the Church?</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Bishops must be <hi>jure divino,</hi> they are more excellent and necessary then the Pope. 2.

And yet thus your <hi>R. Smith</hi> Bishop of <hi>Calcedon (ubi supra)</hi> confesseth it to be no point of your faith, that the Pope is St. <hi>Peters</hi> successor <hi>jure divino.</hi> And if you leave it indifferent to be believed, or not, that both your Pope and Bishops are <hi>jure divino,</hi> you confess you are but a humane policy or society, and therefore that no man need to fear the loss of his salvation by renouncing you.</p>

Is no one way of <hi>Election</hi> necessary? Do you leave that to be varied as a thing indifferent? And is Episcopal Consecration also unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary? I pray you here again remember then, that none of our Churches are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from the plea of a continued suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61117:193"/>
for want of Episcopal Consecration, or any way of Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If our Pastors have had the peoples consent, they have been true Pastors, according to this reckoning: And if they <hi>have now</hi> their consent, they <hi>are</hi> true Pastors. But we have more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By this rule we cannot know of one Bishop of an hundred whether he be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or no; for we cannot know that he hath the <hi>Common consent of the people:</hi> yea we know that abundance of your Bishops have no such consent: yea we know that your Pope hath none of the <hi>Consent</hi> of most of the Christians in the world; nor (for ought you or any man knows) of most in Europe. Its few of your own party that know who is Pope, (much less are called to Consent,) till after he is settled in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. According to this rule, your successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been frequently interrupted, when against the will of general Councils, and of the far greatest part of Christians, your Popes have kept the seat by force.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In temporals your rule is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally true. What if the people be engaged to one Prince, and afterward break their vow, and consent to a Usurper? Though in this ease a particular person may be obliged to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61117:193"/>
submission and obedience in judicial admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations; yet the usurper cannot thereby defend his Right, and justifie his possession, nor the people justifie their adhesion to him, while they lye under an obligation to disclaim him, because of their preengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another.

As in the case of the Popes Soveraignty, when two or three parts of the Christian world is against it, and the rest for it, can private Christians try which party is the more credible? Or is it necessary to their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If so, they are cast upon unavoidable despair. If not, must they all take the words of their present Teachers? Then most of the world must believe against you, because most of the Teachers are against you: And then it seems mens faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into the authority of the Parish-Priest or their Confessors. The Laws of a Kingdom may be easier known, then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61117:195"/>
doctrines can be known, (especially such as are controverted among us) by meer unwritten Tradition. Kingdoms are of narrower compass then the world: And, though the sense of Laws is oft in question, yet the being of them is seldom matter of controversie; because men conversing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and familiarly with each other, may plainly and fully reveal their minds; when God that condescendeth not to such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, hath delivered his mind by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired persons long ago, with much less sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible advantages, because it is a life of faith that he directeth us to live.</p>

                     <p>Answ. <hi>Yes, my Definition speaks specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of Bishops and chief Prelates, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct from inferiour Pastors and Clergy, and thereby comprises all the</hi> Individuums <hi>contained in the</hi> Species; <hi>and consequently makes a distinction from National, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Councils, where</hi> some <hi>Bishops only are convened, not</hi> all; <hi>that being only some part, and not the whole</hi> Species, <hi>or specifical Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on applied to Bishops of every age. And yet I said not</hi> all Bishops, <hi>but</hi> Bishops and chief Prelates; <hi>because though all are to be called, yet it is not necessary that all should come. Whence</hi> appears <hi>what I am to answer to the next two Questions.</hi>

                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. Then you have had no General Councils; much less can have any more: For you have none to represent the greatest part of the Church, unless by a mock representation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If all must be called, your Councils have not been General, that call'd not a great part of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If most are necessarily detained (as by distance, the prohibition of Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the call made it not their duty to be there, and so makes it not a General Council; which is so called from the generality of the meeting and representation, and not of the invitation: no more then a Call would make it a true Council if none came.</p>

                     <p>Answ. <hi>The number is morally to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, more or fewer according to the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61117:197"/>

If not, it can be no General Council, when difficulties keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the most. Much less when such a petty confederacy as met at Trent, shall pretend to represent the Christian world. You thus leave us uncertain when a Council is General, and when not. How can the people tell, when you cannot tell your self, when the Bishops are so many as make a Council General!</p>

                  <head>Appendix.</head>
                  <p>THe most that I here said against the <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Visibility of our Church,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them to the point of Ordination. They say, <hi>We can have no Church without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors: no Pastors without Ordination; and no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination but from the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>therefore when we broak off from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>we interrupted our succession, which cannot be repaired but by a return to them.</hi> This is the sum of most of their discourses, in what shape soever they appear. To which I answer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As [<hi>a Church</hi>] is taken for a <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christians,</hi> which are really members of the Church universal, so it may <hi>ad esse</hi> be without Pastors. But the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> can <hi>never</hi> be <hi>without</hi> them: nor yet, any true <hi>Political, organized, particular</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is contrary to the Papists own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Ordination of their particular Pastors, is necessary to the being of a true particular Church. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth (<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Eccles. c.</hi> 10.) that it is indeed
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61117:201"/>
to us uncertain that our Pastors have <hi>potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ordinis &amp; jurisdictionis</hi>; and that we have but a moral certainty that they are true Bishops: though we may know that they hold Christs place, and that we owe them obedience; and that to know that they are <hi>Our Pastors, non requiritur nec fides, nec Character Ordinis, nec legitima electio, sed solum ut habeantur pro talibus ab Ecclesia.</hi> [i. e. <hi>It is not requisite, that they have faith, or the Character of Order, or lawful election; but only that they be taken for such by the Church.</hi>] And if it be enough that <hi>their</hi> Church repute their Pastors to be elected, ordained, and believers, though they are not so indeed; then can no more be necessary to <hi>ours.</hi> We repute <hi>ours</hi> as confidently to be lawfully <hi>elected</hi> and <hi>ordained</hi> as they do <hi>theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is contrary to the Papists own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>any Consecration</hi> (much less <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical</hi>) is necessary to the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>their Vniversal Head.</hi> I need not cite their <hi>Authors</hi> for this; as long as you have 1. The <hi>History</hi> of their <hi>Practices</hi>: And 2. The confession of this learned man that I dispute with, in the explication of the term [<hi>Pope</hi>] in these his last Papers. And that which is not necessary to their Pope,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61117:201"/>
cannot by them be made necessary to our Bishops.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nothing in Church History more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, then that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had no continued succession of a truely elected, or ordained Pope according to their own Canons. 1. If Infidelity or Heresie judged by a Council (in the case of <hi>Honorius, Ioh.</hi> 23. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> &amp;c.) will not prove a nullity and intercision. 2. If Simony, Murder, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not prove it. 3. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourty years Schisme at once will not prove it: none knowing who was the true Pope, but by the prevalency of his secular power; and their writers confessing that it is known to none but God. 4. If intrusion without any just election will not prove it; Then there is no danger to those Churches that are lyable to no such accusations. But if any or all of these will prove it, the <hi>Roman</hi> intercision is beyond dispute, as I shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifest on any just call, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>standing Law</hi> and <hi>Institution of Christ,</hi> is it that gives the <hi>Power</hi> (by <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> the <hi>duty</hi>) of Ministration: and <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> only determineth of the <hi>person</hi> that shall receive it (together with election,) and solemnizeth it by Investiture: as Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61117:202"/>
to a King, that is a King before.</p>
                  <p>I have already proved that an <hi>uninterru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted succession of Regular Ordination</hi> is no more necessary to the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> then <hi>uninterrupted succession of Regular Coronation</hi> is to the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>: which I am ready to make good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This whole case of <hi>Ordination</hi> I have already spoken to (so carefully and fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my measure) in my <hi>second Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute of Church Government,</hi> that I shall suppose that man hath said nothing to me, requiring my reply, on this point, that doth not answer that. And to write the same thing here over again, cannot fairly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Voetius de desperata causa Papatus,</hi> hath copiously done the same against <hi>Ianse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> which they should answer satisfactorily before they call for more.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>Nullity</hi> which they suppose to make the <hi>Intercision,</hi> is either the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> we had <hi>from the Papist Bishops before our Reformation,</hi> or the <hi>Ordination that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived since.</hi> If the <hi>former</hi> be a nullity, then <hi>all</hi> the Papists Ordinations are null; and so they nullifie their Church and Ministry. That the <hi>latter</hi> is no nullity, we are ready to make good against any of them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:61117:202"/>Object. <hi>But if you own your Ordination as from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>you own their Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We consider them, 1. As <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Pastors.</hi> 2. As <hi>Popish Pastors</hi>; As <hi>Christian</hi> Pastors in the Catholike Church, their <hi>Ordination</hi> is no more a nullity than their <hi>Baptizing,</hi> (which we count valid.) But as <hi>Popish,</hi> they have no authority for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Object. <hi>But they gave both Baptism and Ordination as Papists, and it must be judged of by the intention of the giver, and receiver. Answ.</hi> It is the Baptism and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of <hi>Christs Institution, as such,</hi> which was pretended to be <hi>given</hi> and <hi>received:</hi> Could we prove that they Administred any other or otherwise, they say they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it: <hi>As such</hi> therefore we must take it, till we can prove that they destroy the very essence of it. If it be given and taken <hi>secondarily as Popish</hi> the scab of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <hi>polluteth it,</hi> but not <hi>nullifieth it.</hi> So they profess themselves first <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> and but <hi>subordinately</hi> (as they think) of the <hi>Pope</hi>: so much therefore as belongs to them in their <hi>first</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> relation may be <hi>valid</hi>; though so much as respecteth their <hi>usurped relation</hi> be <hi>sinful.</hi> Had I been baptized or ordained by one of their Priests,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61117:203"/>
I would disown all the corruptions of them, but not the baptism and ordination it self.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There is no necessity to the being or well-being of a particular Church, that it hath continued from the Apostles daies, or that its particular Ministry have had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercision. If <hi>Germany</hi> were converted but lately to the Christian Faith, it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless a true part of the Catholike Church. If <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had sometime a Church, and sometime none, it may have now a true Church nevertheless.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If our Ordination had failed by an intercision, it might as well be repaired from <hi>other Churches</hi> (that have had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued succession) as from <hi>Rome.</hi> And much better; because without participation of their peculiar corruptions. Or if any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that were of the Papal faction should <hi>repent</hi> of their <hi>Poperie,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> of their <hi>Ordination,</hi> they might <hi>Ordain</hi> us as <hi>Bishops,</hi> and repair our breach. And indeed that was the way of our <hi>continued Ordination.</hi> Many that repented that they were <hi>Popish Prelates,</hi> continued the office of <hi>Christian Bishops,</hi> and by such our Ancestors were Ordained. As <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> were before <hi>Popery,</hi> and so are they still
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61117:203"/>
separable from it, and may continue when it is renounced. Besides what I have more fully said in the foresaid dispute of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I see no need of adding any more, against this Objection, about successive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Ministerial Power.</p>
                  <p>As to their other Objection (which they make such a stir with, and take no notice of the Answer which we have so often given) viz. [<hi>When every Sect pretend that they have the true Church and Ministry, who shall judge?</hi>] I again Answer, There is a <hi>Iudicium privatum,</hi> and <hi>publicum</hi>: A private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of discerning belongs to every man: The <hi>publick judgement</hi> is either <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> The <hi>Civil judgement</hi> is [who shall be thus or thus esteemed of, in order to Civil encouragement or discouragement] (as by corporal punishments, or rewards:) This judgement belongeth only to the Civil Magistrate. The <hi>Ecclesiastical judgement,</hi> is in order to <hi>Ecclesiastical Communion</hi> or <hi>Excommunication.</hi> And so it belongs to those with whom the person is in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in their several capacities. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular Church, are to be judged Authoritatively by the Pastors of that Church, (and by the people, by a <hi>Private</hi> judgement of <hi>Discerning.</hi>) <hi>Pastors</hi> should
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61117:204"/>
                     <hi>associate</hi> for <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Churches:</hi> and so in order to that <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Association,</hi> it belongs to the several Associations to judge of the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi>: which yet is not by a publike <hi>Governing judgement:</hi> For in Councils or Associations, the <hi>Major Vote</hi> are not properly the <hi>Governors</hi> of the <hi>lesser part</hi>: But those that are out of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of <hi>Communion,</hi> have nothing to do to judge of the <hi>Aptitude</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> in order to <hi>Communion</hi> or <hi>non-Communion.</hi> And for the <hi>Pope,</hi> he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with us at such a distance, whose persons and cases are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him; he being neither our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> nor our <hi>Associate.</hi> But if we and our case were known to him, he may judge of us so far as we may judge of him. And other judgement (what ever men may say to deceive) there is none to decide our controversies, but the <hi>final judgement</hi> of the <hi>Vniversal Iudge,</hi> who is at the door.</p>

                        <p>THe noted sanctity, admirable integrity, and extraordinary charity so eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in your pious actions, (and as I have some cause to think, the indelible characters of your sacred function) hath animated me to make choice of your self rather then any of your coat to this present address: hoping your candour and tenderness will bear with what may be (by others less sensible of the value of immortal souls slighted) interpreted according to the candid and true sense of your supplicant by you. It hath pleased the great and terrible Iudge of heaven and earth to put me upon some thoughts more seriously then ordinary of my eternal estate, and to be somewhat doubtful (in the midst of external perturbations) of those internal grounds which I have formerly relyed upon; And truely Sir with all cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, my desire is clearly to know the mind of my God, which were I truely satisfied in, I should soon wave all other interests to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: and assuring my self according to what I have seen and read, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which I have long cleaved and adhered, to be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61117:206"/>
the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> and that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church which the ancient Creed testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, we are to believe in: My desire is to be as soon satisfied as may be of your thoughts, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ever were a true Church,</hi> which I suppose you will not deny, when you consider the first verse of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi>; and if so, <hi>when it made its defection?</hi> The reason of my urging this is, because I think all other questions to be but going about the bush, and the true Church being proved, all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments else easily are answered. I have heard Protestants aver the ancient maxime, <hi>viz. Extra Ecclesiam non est salus.</hi> Therefore I suppose it the only thing pertinent to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and necessary to salvation to enquire after. My occasions will suddenly draw me from these parts, unless I hear from you speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and doubt not Sir, but I am one who freely will resign my self to hear truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially. Therefore I beseech you to send something to me by way of satisfaction the next Saturday, after which you shall be more particularly sensible who the person is that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himself to you, and in the interim sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes himself, Sir,</p>

                        <p>THat you can have such charitable thoughts of one that is not of the <hi>Roman</hi> subjection, and of my function, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not received from the Pope, is so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, yea and contrary to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your writers, that I must needs entertain it with the more gratitude, and some admiration. And that you are so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially willing to entertain the truth, (as you profess) though it be no more then the truth deserves of you, and your own well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare doth require; yet is the more aimiable in you, by how much the more rare in those of your Profession, so far as my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can inform me: for most of them that I have met with, understand not well their own Religion, nor think themselves much concerned to understand it, but refer me to others for a Reason of their hope. For my part, I do the more gladly entertain the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61117:207"/>
of this entercourse with you (though unknown,) that I may learn what I know not, and may be true to my own conscience in the use of all means that may conduce to my better information. And therefore I shall plainly answer your Questions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure of my understanding; most solemnly professing to you, that I will say nothing which comes not from my heart in plain simplicity, and that I will with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gladness and a thousand thanks come over to your way, if I can finde by any thing that you shall make known to me, that it is the mind of God that I should so do. And therefore I am desirous, that if what I write to you shall seem unsound, you would not only afford me your own advice for the correction of it, but also the advice of the most learned of your mind, to whom you shall your self think meet to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it. But on these conditions. 1. That it be a person of a tender conscience, that dare speak nothing but what he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves. 2. That he will argue closly, and not fly abroad or dilate Rhetorically. And for any divulging of it to your danger or hurt, you need not fear it: For these two grounds of my following answers; I shall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, 1. That I am so far from persecuting
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61117:207"/>
bloody desires against those of your way, that their own bloody principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices where they have power (in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> &amp;c.) hath done much to confirm me, that the cause is not of God that must be so upheld and carried on. 2. And I am so far from cruel uncharitable censures of any that unfeignedly love the Lord Jesus and his truth, that it is the greatest motive to me of all other to dislike your Profession, because it is so notoriously against Christian charity, restraining the Catholike Church to your selves, and outing and condemning the far greatest part of Christians in the world, and that because they believe not in the Pope, though they believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and all that the Primitive Church believed. I am so Catholike, that (according to my present judgement) I cannot be of your Church, because it is so little Catholike. I am of the one universal Church, which containeth all the true Christians in the world: And you are of a <hi>Party</hi> which hath separated it self from most of the Christians in the world. I am of that one body that is centred in Christ the Head; you are of a piece of this body, that hath centred in a man, and oft a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed heretical wicked man, whom you
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61117:208"/>
take while he lives to be the infallible Judge and foundation of all your faith and hope; and when he is dead, perhaps pronounce him to be in hell (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and others commonly.) I know, as every Sect hath a kind of unity among themselves, however divided from all the rest of the Church, so also hath yours: but nothing will satisfie me but a Catholike Unity, Church and Faith. So much being premised, I answer your Questions.</p>
                        <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Whether the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was a true Church in the Apostles dayes</hi>?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> The word [<hi>Church</hi>] signifies more things then one. 1. Sometime it is used to signifie the whole mystical body of Christ, containing all and only those that are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And in this sense the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apostles dayes was not <hi>the Church,</hi> but the justified members were part of the Church. 2. Sometime it is used to signifie all that <hi>profess</hi> true Christianity in the world: And thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not <hi>the Church,</hi> but part of it. 3. It is oft used by your writers to signifie one Church, that by Prerogative is the Head or Mistris of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61117:208"/>
all Christians in the world, to which they must all be subject, and from which they must receive their name, as the Kingdom of <hi>Mexico,</hi> of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> of <hi>Fez,</hi> &amp;c. are so called from the chief Cities of the same name, and from which they receive their Faith and Laws, as the body hath life and motion from the head or heart. In this sense the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>no Church</hi> in the Apostles dayes. 4. Sometime it is used to signifie one particular Church, associated for personal Communion in Worship. And thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church in the Apostles dayes. 5. Sometime it is used to signifie a Collection or Conjunction of many particular Churches (though not all) under the Bishop of one Church, as their Patriarch or Metropolitan. And thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was no Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles dayes, but about two hundred years after Christ it was.</p>
                        <p>It is only the <hi>Church</hi> in the third of these senses, that is in controversie between the <hi>Roman</hi> and Reformed Churches. Now to your next Question.</p>
                        <p>Quest. 2. <hi>When was it that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ceased to be a true Church</hi>?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="372" facs="tcp:61117:209"/>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> In the first, second, and third sences it never ceased to be a true Church: for it never was one. In the first and second sence it never was one either in title or claim, (I hope.) In the third, it was never one in Title, nor yet in claim for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Christ: but now it is. Therefore the Question between us should not be, <hi>when it ceased,</hi> but <hi>when it begun</hi> to be such <hi>a Capital Ruling Church, Essential to the whole?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the fifth sence it never ceased other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then as it is swallowed up in a higher Title. It begun to be a <hi>Patriarchal Church,</hi> about two or three hundred years after Christ: and it ceased to be <hi>meerly Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal</hi> when it arrogated the Title of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> or <hi>Mistris of all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the fourth sence, the Question is not so easie, and I shall thus answer it. 1. By speaking to the use of the Question. 2. By a direct answer to it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is of small concernment to my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or yours, to know whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>a true particular Church or not</hi>: no more then to know whether the Church of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> or <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> be now a true Church. In charity to them I am bound to regard it, as I am bound
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61117:209"/>
to regard the life of my neighbour: But what doth it concern my own life, to know whether the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> or <hi>Glocester</hi> be dead or alive? So what doth it concern <hi>my Salvation</hi> to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be now a true particular Church? If I lived at the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi> or in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and had never heard that there is such a place as <hi>Rome</hi> in the world (as many a thousand Christians doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less never heard of it) this would not hinder my salvation, as long as I believed in the blessed Trinity, and were sanctified by the Spirit of Grace. So that, as I am none of their Judge, so I know not that it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth me, to know whether they be a true particular Church, save for charity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Yet I answer it more directly. 1. If they do not by their errors so far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Christian faith which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, as that it cannot practically be believed by them, then are they a true particular Church, or part of the universal Church. 2. And I am apt to hope at least of most that they do not so hold their errors, but that they retain with them so much of the essentials of Religion as may denominate them a <hi>true professing Church.</hi> More plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61117:210"/>
                           <hi>Rome</hi> is considered first <hi>as Christian,</hi> secondly <hi>as Papal: As Christian,</hi> it is a <hi>true Church</hi>: As <hi>Papal,</hi> it is <hi>no true Church</hi>: For <hi>Popery</hi> is not the <hi>Church</hi> according to Christs Institution, but a <hi>dangerous corruption</hi> in the Church. As a Leprosie is not the <hi>man,</hi> but the <hi>disease</hi> of the man. Yet he that is a <hi>Leper</hi> may be a <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>.</hi> And he that is a <hi>Papist</hi> may be a <hi>Christian:</hi> But 1. Not <hi>as he is a Papist.</hi> 2. And he is <hi>but a leprous</hi> or diseased Christian.</p>
                        <p>So much to your Questions.</p>
                        <p>By this much you may see that it no way concerneth me to prove <hi>when</hi> Rome <hi>ceased to be a true Church.</hi> For if you mean such a Church as <hi>Corinth, Philippi, Ephesus,</hi> &amp;c. was, that is, but <hi>a part of the Catholike Church,</hi> so I stick not much, saving in point of <hi>Charity,</hi> whether it be true or false. But if you mean as your party doth, <hi>a Mistris Church to Rule the whole, and denominate the Catholike Church [Roman,]</hi> so I say, its <hi>Vsurpation</hi> is not ceased (that's the misery) and its just <hi>title</hi> never did begin: and its <hi>claim</hi> was not of many hundred years after Christ: so that your Question requireth no further Answer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="375" facs="tcp:61117:210"/>But what if you had put the Question, At what time it was that your Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>claim</hi> this universal Dominion? I should give you these two answers. 1. When I understand that it is of any great moment to the decision of our controversie, I shall tell you my opinion of the man that first laid the claim, and the year when. 2. But it is sufficient for me to prove, that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not so. Little did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Constantines</hi> dayes, dream of governing all the Christians in the world. But when the Emperours became Christians, their great favour and large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Church, and the greatness and advantage of the Imperial City did give opportunity to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as having both riches, and the Emperours and Commanders ears) to do so many and great favours for most other Churches, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and vindicating them, that it was very easie for the Bishop hereby to become the chief Patriarch (which he was more beholden to the Emperour for, then to any Title that he had from Christ or <hi>Peter.</hi>) And then the quarrel with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> occasioned the thoughts of an universal Headship; which <hi>Gregory</hi> did disclaim and abominate, but <hi>Boniface</hi> after him, by the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61117:211"/>
grant of a murdering trayterous Emperour, did obtain: But so as the See swelled before into a preparatory magnitude.</p>
                        <p>And if we could not tell you the time within two hundred years and more, it were no great matter, as long as we can prove <hi>that it was not so before.</hi> For who knows not that even some Kings in <hi>Europe</hi> have come from being <hi>limited Monarchs,</hi> to be <hi>absolute,</hi> and that by such degrees, that none can tell the certain time. Nay I may give you a stranger instance. The Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> have part in the legislative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: And yet I do not think that any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in <hi>England</hi> is able to prove the just time, yea or the age, (or within many ages) when they first obtained it: which yet in so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a spot of ground may be easilier done, then the time of the Popes usurpation over all the world. For it could not be all at once: for one Country yeilded to his (late) claim in one age, and another in another age, and many a bloody battle was fought before he could bring the <hi>Germane</hi> Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and Christian Princes to submit to him fully.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But let me tell you one thing more; Though as to <hi>an arrogant claim,</hi> the Pope is Head and Governour of all the Catholike
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61117:211"/>
Church, and <hi>Rome</hi> their Mistris, (as the Pope makes Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> that never come near the place or people,) yet as to any <hi>possession</hi> or <hi>acknowledgement</hi> on the Churches part, he <hi>was never universal Head,</hi> nor <hi>Rome the Mistris</hi> to this day. For the greater half of the Christians did never subject themselves to him at all, nor come under his power. So that the Pope even now in his greatest height, is only the head of the universal Church by his <hi>own claim,</hi> and <hi>naming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so,</hi> without any <hi>Title given</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>acknowledged</hi> by <hi>men,</hi> and without having ever been <hi>possessed</hi> of what he claims. The King of <hi>France</hi> doth scarce believe that the King of <hi>England</hi> was King of <hi>France,</hi> for all that he put it into his title: nor do the <hi>Swedes</hi> take the <hi>Pole</hi> for their King, because he so calls himself. I am sure if the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour call himself the <hi>Emperour of the world,</hi> that doth not prove that he is so. <hi>Rainerius</hi> the Popes Inquisitor (<hi>in catal. post. lib. cont. Waldens.</hi>) saith plainly, <hi>That the Churches that were planted by the Apostles themselves</hi> (such as the Abassines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>) <hi>are not subject to the Pope.</hi> Once he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> the Government of <hi>no Church</hi> in the world, but <hi>Rome</hi> it self: After that he grew to have
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61117:212"/>
the government of the <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of the <hi>West:</hi> since that he hath <hi>got</hi> some <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>claimed all</hi>; but never <hi>got neer half</hi> the Churches into his hands to this day. Do I need then to say any more to disprove his universal Headship, and that <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Catholike Ruling Church?</p>
                        <p>But having gone thus far in opening my thoughts to you, I shall forbear the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the proof of my Assertions, till I hear again from you. If I understand it, The Question between you and me to be debated, must be this, [<hi>Whether the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was in the Apostles dayes, the Mistris or Ruling Church, which all other Churches were bound to obey, and from it were to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholike Church</hi>?] This I deny: and you must maintain, or else you must be no Papist. The motion that I make is, that by the next you will send me your Arguments to prove it (for it belongs to you to prove it, if you affirm it.) To which I will return you (if they change not my judgement) both my <hi>Answers</hi> and my <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the Negative.</hi> And if you do indeed make good but this one Assertion, I do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61117:214"/>
discourse is a stronger motive. Although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure it may seem somewhat wonderful, that I should so soon be brought over to the serious apprehensions of the weight of what you have written to me; yet when you consult the divine providence, and the Almighty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which prompted me to the choise of your self above others, upon grounds not altogether insufficiently established, which will be further made good when I shall have the happiness of a personal entercourse of communion with you, it will be certainly concluded upon by your self and whosoever it shall be communicated to, that the truth, which I have already seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pondered, was the full aim of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: which truth I shall impartially and joyfully entertain wheresoever I find it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thoughts at all of temporal or external discouragements, of which I have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested with some, and expect (the Lord arm me against them) far greater. It is no small thing that I shall be lookt upon as an Apostate, and so worthy of excommunication utterly; but I conclude according to St. <hi>Augustine</hi> (I guess) that it is no shame to turn to the better, and withal I add (although I could insert some small exceptions) I am <hi>to the main sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> but yet in <hi>some doubtful suspence,</hi> wherein I expect full satisfaction by <hi>your

If I might receive two or three lines from you in the interim, by way of establishment, it would be very gratefully accepted, in relation to the comfortable taking off those obstacles which I am certain to meet with in my change of judgement. I am very sorry that a person whom I know to be so tender of eternal souls in general, should be so continually taken off your important business daily by particulars.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> late of <hi>Martins</hi> Ludgate <hi>London</hi> was brought up in the Protestant Religion, and for some years accounted an affectionate professor thereof, by those who were acquainted with his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and pains in writing out at large the notes he took of (Mr. <hi>Calamies</hi> and others) pious Sermons: but afterwards (not living up to the knowledge he had) he grew more remiss in his practice, and in his company; and became a great affliction to his Father in his life-time by reason thereof, but a greater to his Mother after his Fathers death: which I suppose Mr. <hi>Iacomb,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fauller</hi> and others of her acquaintance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget. But when she understood the company he most frequented were Papists, who did at length take the boldness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to her house, she was very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, fearing that they had prevailed with her son to turn Papist, which she soon found, as she told me, to be so indeed. I was not willing to believe her report, but desired
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61117:215"/>
to satisfie my self by discoursing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, hoping that I should not have found his judgement determined that way, as I did to my great trouble find it to be, especially in his justification of the Jurisdiction and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope, and other tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> By this time he had wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Patrimony, and had run himself into debt so far, that he durst not walk up and down the streets as he had done: he went a Voyage to the Barbadoes, but returned thence in a worse condition then he went, yet continued still in the opinion he had received, notwithstanding the great offence and trouble it was to those from whom he expected relief and maintenance, whose hearts and hands were in that particular somewhat shut up against him, in so much that he was reduced to manifold extremities here. Afterwards, hopeless of any lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood here, he went over to <hi>Ireland</hi> where he had a kinsman; but meeting with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment there of what he expected, he returned again into <hi>England,</hi> and steered his course to <hi>Worcester,</hi> where he had another kinsman lived; during this Voyage I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed several letters with him, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to make him sensible of the hand of God eminently out against him, hedging up
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61117:216"/>
his way with thorns everywhere, which I desired might be in order to his return to God, looking upon his condition to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly desperate for ever, if he should refuse to return, and harden his heart against him. At <hi>Worcester</hi> he fell sick, which through Gods blessing brought him to a more serious consideration of his everlasting state which he apprehended to approach near. And it wrought some kind of doubt in him, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of some of the chief of those things which he had entertained as true about the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he informed me by his letter; whereunto for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and better satisfaction, I did advise him to apply himself unto Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of <hi>Kederminster</hi> (who I told him I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was a great lover of souls) which he by letter did as he told me, and that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did return him an answer thereunto in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with liberty to shew it to any the most learned of his way; which when he came to <hi>London</hi> he shewed me, acknowledging himself much convinced by it: and the more taken, for that so large and full an answer with that liberty should be dispatch't to him with so much expedition, which as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he said he had the next day after he sent his. Yet was he confident, as he said, that it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61117:216"/>
would be answered, and as he told me, he had left it with one that had undertaken it; He spake of its being shewn to Embassadors or an Embassador, and that within fourteen days he should have an answer to it; but enquiring after it, I could never see any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, nor could he notwithstanding all his solicitations and provocations used, prevail to have an answer; which he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very much offended at; and at length, as he told me, those with whom he had to do about it, were much offended with him: in so much that he intimated himself to be apprehensive of danger from some of them: yet he seemed resolved to adventure whatsoever might befall him in that respect, rather then he would stifle those convictions, which by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> letter had been begotten in him; This letter of Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> together with [The Safe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion] a Book which he did refer him to, either then or near that time in the press, which he went for and had of the Stationer upon Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> account, (which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgot) gave him such resolution and satisfaction, that he thereupon altered his judgement and practice, and waited upon the Ordinances here in <hi>London</hi> in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations for some time; I my self having
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61117:217"/>
seen him at the morning exercise in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>: what further effects it wrought upon him I know not; for that he left the City and went over into <hi>Flanders</hi> as his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath informed me, and is since dead:</p>

                        <p>WHen I was invited to this Disputation with you, I entertained hopes, from your profest desires of close argumentation, that we should speedily bring it to such an issue, as might in some good measure answer our endeavours, in taking off the covering that Sophistry and carnal interest had cast upon the truth. When my necessary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denyed me the leisure of reading over your second Papers for some weeks; and when the loss of my Reply by the Carrier, and the difficulty of procuring another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, had caused a little longer delay; you ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged so hard for a Reply, as put me in some
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61117:217"/>
further hopes that you were resolved to go through with it your self. But after near a twelve months expectation of a <hi>Rejoinder,</hi> and of the <hi>Proof of your own succession from the Apostles,</hi> being here at <hi>London,</hi> I desired you to resolve me, whether I might expect any such <hi>Return</hi> and <hi>Performance</hi> from you, or not: And when you would not promise it, I took up the thoughts of publishing what had past between us: But upon further urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, some moneths after, you renewed my hopes, which caused me to make some stay of my publication, and to desire you to give me your sense of the most used terms; (promising you that I shall do the like, when you require it; which I am ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.) But yet I hear nothing to this day of your <hi>Answer</hi> to my Papers, or the <hi>Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of what is incumbent on you for the justification of your Church: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having waited and importuned you in vain so long, and finding by your last, that you cannot or will not so explicate your terms, as to be understood (without which there is no disputing;) and also perceiving, that my abode in <hi>London</hi> is like to be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer; my <hi>discretion</hi> and the <hi>ends</hi> of my writing have commanded me, to forbear no longer the publication of what hath past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61117:218"/>
us: For, though the work be not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and elaborate, yet being on a subject, which your party do so much insist upon, I am assured it may be of common use. And I know that the publication is no breach of any promise on my part, nor do I perceive how it can be any way injurious to you; and therefore I see nothing to prohibite it: And I am not willing to be used as Mr. <hi>Gunning</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pierson</hi> were, by the partial unhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some publication of another.</p>
                        <p>If yet I may prevail with you, to justifie your cause, as you are engaged, I must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you specially to try your strength for the proof of your own succession: for we are most confident that its a notorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility which you undertake. Our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against it are such as these.</p>

of Christ on earth:) <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> since the time of Christ, hath received a new essential part. The novelty I have here and elsewhere proved: And <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Molinaeus</hi> against <hi>Perron</hi> have done it more at large.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That Church which hath had frequent and long interceisions in its head or essential part, hath not had a continued succession from the Apostles. But such is the Church of <hi>Rome: Ergo</hi>—</p>
                        <p>The Minor is here proved: and some hints of it are in the Appendix.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That Church which hath had many new essential Articles of Religion, hath not had a continued succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: (For if the essence be new, the Church is new.) But such is the Church of <hi>Rome. Ergo</hi>—</p>
                        <p>First it is commonly maintained by you that all <hi>Articles</hi> are <hi>Essential</hi> or <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi>: and you deride the contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the Protestants.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that you have had many <hi>new Articles</hi> of Religion (of faith and points of worship) is proved by our writers, and your own confessions. See <hi>Molinaeus de Novit. Papismi.</hi> Prove a succession of all that is <hi>de fide</hi> determined in your Councils, or but of

                        <p>But these arguings being works of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation, I shall trouble you here with no more; but wait for such <hi>proof of all your essentials, as we give you of all ours.</hi> In the mean time, I shall endeavour so to defend the <hi>Truth,</hi> as not to lose or weaken <hi>Charity,</hi> but approve my self</p>
