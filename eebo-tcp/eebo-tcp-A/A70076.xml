            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though hitherto we have moſt earneſtly wiſhed and longed for the continuance of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Peace of Chriſtendom; and that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by the Providence of God committed to our Charge, might under our Conduct enjoy in ſome degree the Bleſſings of Peace and Quiet, in which they have been ſo long interrupted by the Wars, wherein our Father of bleſſed Memory was entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, during almoſt the whole Time of His glorious Government.

               <p>If any of the Commodities and Manufactures of the French King's Subjects ſhall happen to be found in the Ships belonging to the Subjects of our Friends, Allies, Confederates or neutral Princes: We freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that we will let them paſs, provided they be not contraband Goods. But if any ſuch Wares ſhall be found on Board any of the French Ships, our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may juſtly ſeize both Ship and Goods, as forfeited according to the Practiſe of other Nations on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, notwithſtanding that ſuch Wares do really
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29362:6"/>
belong to the Subjects of our ſaid Friends, Allies, and neutral Princes; being very well content, that the ſame courſe be taken with our Subjects, and their Effects in the like caſe. Wherefore we do ſtrictly command, and (under pain of our higheſt Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſuch Puniſhments as juſtly we may inflict on ſuch as are refractory and diſobedient to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) and injoyn all our Lords-Deputies, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Generals, and other Officers by Sea and Land, together with all Civil Magiſtrates in Cities and Towns, and all others who by any way are ſubject to our Juriſdiction, to put this our Declaration exactly, in Execution in all the Points, Clauſes and Articles of it, and ſtedfaſtly to obſerve the ſame; but in no caſe to act, or ſuffer others to act contrary to the Tenor of it.</p>
               <p>And as we have been neceſſitated to emit this our Declaration, and to take up Arms in our own Defence againſt the French King (not only out of our Duty to the Roman Empire, our renowned Native Country, but particularly to uſe all effectual means at this time to preſerve us and our Countries againſt the Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties already practiſed, and to reſtore them to their former Security; and to procure full Recompence and Satisfaction for the Injuries done to us, and our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and other States of the Empire) So we put Our whole Confidence in Almighty God, that he will maintain our juſt Cauſe, and continue to bleſs, and make the Armies of Us and our Allies victorious, who are ſo unjuſtly provoked, and to give ſo happy an Iſſue to this preſent War; that they (whoſe unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ambition to bear ſway in the World, could not be appeaſed and ſatisfied by the many conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ſuffered to be taken from time to time for

the ſake of Peace, nor by the Obligation of Treaties and Promiſes ſworn and agreed in the moſt ſolemn and religious manner; but for many Years paſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed all Chriſtendom with continual Troubles, Diffidence and Irreſolution; nay made uſe even of the very Articles of Peace to begin and foment a War) may at laſt by the moſt conſiderable Forces of <hi>Europe,</hi> now by the miraculous Providence of God united in one common Intereſt, be compell'd and conſtrained to ceaſe from thoſe Hoſtilities and Oppreſſions, under which ſo many thouſand innocent Souls of all Degrees have hitherto groaned, and to ſuffer the Empire, our renowned Native Country, to enjoy a conſtant Peace and Tranquillity, according to its moſt ancient Luſtre, Liberty, and Authority; toward which good Deſign we ſhall never fail to contribute all that lyes within the compaſs of our Power, even to the Hazard of our Life.</p>

            <head>A Letter ſent from the Imperial Diet at <hi>RATISBON,</hi> to the thirteen Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons in <hi>SWITZERLAND,</hi> March the <hi>7</hi>th, <hi>1688/9,</hi> to adhere to the Empire in the preſent War againſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE have underſtood at large by the Letters of his Imperial Majeſty, our moſt gracious Lord, how fairly it was repreſented to you, why his Imperial Majeſty, upon the unexpected Breach of Peace made by the French King, without any juſt or reaſonable Cauſe, (and even in Deſpight of Faith it ſelf) could not, becauſe of the Arch-Dutchy of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> conſent to the Neutrality by you propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between his Majeſty and the French King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Conſtantz,</hi> and the four Foreſt Towns, as alſo a Liberty of two Leagues, as they commonly call it, in regard that it did not at all conſiſt either with the Intereſt of his Imperial Majeſty and the Empire, or of your ſelves, to ingage in a particular Neutrality with the ſaid French King, after ſo manifeſt a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peace; but rather that it conduced to your Advantage, and to the Preſervation of your free State, to continue in good Correſpondence, and to hold a friendly Intelligence with his Imperial Majeſty, and the Arch-Dukes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to obſerve inviolably
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29362:8"/>
the perpetual Agrement reſpectively made, ſo that his Imperial Majeſty might alſo effectually receive the Benefit of your Aſſiſtance, all which in his Imperial Majeſties ſaid Letter more amply doth appear.</p>
            <p>Neither do we doubt, but that before this Time you have received Advertiſement, what an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Reſolution, touching this Affair, hath been taken by this Diet, and moſt graciouſly approved by his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty; and that the French King (by reaſon of his invading the ſacred Roman Empire, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Eſtates of the Electors on the upper Rhine, with the Circles of <hi>Franconia, Suabia,</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> without the leaſt Provocation, or Pretence of any lawful Cauſe imaginable; Acting therein in a Hoſtile and Barbarous manner againſt the Articles of Peace concluded in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and at <hi>Nimiguen</hi> (in which your ſelves are more eſpecially concern'd, in regard of the many conſiderable Priviledges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages obtain'd thereby from the Empire) and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Twenty-Years Truce here concluded, and the many repeated Sanctions on the Word of a King) is declared the Common and Publick Enemy of the Empire. Wherefore, among other Diſpatches, it was adjudged moſt neceſſary to make a particular Addreſs to the illuſtrious Confederate Cantons in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> and to admoniſh them to preſerve a good and neighbourly Correſpondence, as appears out of the two encloſed Papers, to which, to avoid Repetition, we refer our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Tho we do not in the leaſt doubt, but that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantagious Propoſal and Demand made by His ſaid Majeſty, according to our moſt humble Addreſs preſented to Him, out of the ſincere and unwearied Care he takes for the Roman Empire, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29362:8"/>
Good of Chriſtendom, will carry its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to you, whoſe Intereſt is ſo evidently interwoven with it: yet upon eſpecial Command given us by our moſt Gracious Maſter, and Superiors, we muſt not be deficient in the friendly imparting our thoughts to you, and duly repreſenting the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity thereof. And firſt of all be pleaſed a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how you are not only really ſtraitned, and every day more and more confin'd, and ſurpriſed by the French King's taking <hi>Alſatia, Sundian, Briſac, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and the Free County of <hi>Burgundy</hi> together with the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and ſeveral other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but are yet more pinch'd by the many erected For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, Sconces and Bridges as well on this ſide, as beyond the Rhine; on purpoſe that he may the more conveniently intercept all Succors deſigned for you by the Roman Empire, which at this very Time ſeems to be aimed at by the undertaken Deſign with <hi>Creutz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack,</hi> and which will indubitably as well now as hereafter be carried on, whenſoever the French King ſhall obſerve you to be in a Condition not to hinder it, or ſhall think it fit to fall upon your ſelves, accordingly as he hath ſince his coming to the Government given many Proofs to the World, that he ſeeks to bring all under his Yoke. Nay he placeth his inward Peace in forreign Wars, from whence you may eaſily judge what you are to expect in time to come, if it ſhould ſo fall out, that the French King ſhould according to his Evil purpoſes get the upper hand in <hi>Germany</hi>; not to mention the unbecoming uſage and Entertainment your Ambaſſadors lately met with in <hi>France,</hi> and other Paſſages there.</p>
            <p>And now if you will take this and other matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your moſt ſerious Conſideration, and particularly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29362:9"/>
call to Mind how little any of the French King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, how obligatory ſoever they may ſeem to be, are to be relied on, ſince no Articles of Peace or other Treaties (to the Performance of which he hath bound himſelf with an Oath) have been kept, but hitherto violated and broken upon ſeveral frivolous Pretences, nay even ſometimes without any Pretext at all, at his Will and Pleaſure: We cannot believe, or fear, that in reſpect to the ſaid Towns you will either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with his Imperial Majeſty upon any Neutrality, not at all allowable in this caſe, by Vertue of the Acts, and the approved Decree of the Empire afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; or that you will reſolve to enter upon any ſuch Terms with the French King, for the ſake of your Eſtates, whereby the Enemy would be ſtrengthened, and unavoidable Danger and Miſchief would fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Wherefore we deſire you, as it becomes us, that you will be pleaſed not only not to hearken to the Enemies Overtures and Propoſals, which have been, or hereafter may be made, but rather wholly to abandon the French King, and to adhere to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, and eſpecially without delay to recal the Forces of your Nation, and free Companies, whereſoever they may have their Quarters, or remain in the French King's Service, on pain of ſevere Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, according to the Example of former times, and in imitation of your Anceſtors; ſince they have been already engaged againſt the Empire, and done ſo great Miſchiefs, though we are apt to believe, without your Knowledg, and againſt your Will, and directly contrary to the Hereditary Agreement. And that hereafter you will not permit the ſaid King to liſt, or raiſe Recruits of any Souldiers, to buy Horſes, export Corn, Ammunition, or Proviſions; nor be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29362:9"/>
to him, either directly or indirectly with Mony, or in giving him free Paſſage; but that by all means poſſible you will prohibit the French Manufactures in all the Cantons, and other places belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and in general break off all Commerce with him. Further, that you will take <hi>Conſtantz,</hi> and the reſt of the four Foreſt-Towns into your particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, in whoſe Conſervation you are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with his Imperial Majeſty and the Empire; and that upon emergent occaſions you may be in a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to march your Troops toward the Frontiers. All which as it tends directly to your own Intereſt, and to the maintaining a good and neighbourly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence (to the ſincere Obſervance whereof you have hitherto always tendred your Willingneſs; while the Alliance formerly made with <hi>France,</hi> could not, or ought not to be any Obſtruction, in regard a ſaving Clauſe for his Imperial Majeſty, and the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is there expreſly inſerted, not to mention that this War is undertaken merely for Self-defence; whereas the French King has again at this time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a notorious Truce-breaker, and a hoſtile Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Germany.</hi>) So we hope you will take theſe things into your ſerious Conſideration, and proceed in the good Correſpondency, which hath been kept time out of Mind with the ſaid Roman Empire: particularly that you will adhere to the perpetual Hereditary Agreement with the Arch-Dukes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> which hitherto hath proved ſo gloriouſly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and which you have not many Years ſince conſtantly aſſured us, always to obſerve ſincerely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and inviolably, with all the obligatory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it. And further that you will freely declare your Mind to theſe our Meſſengers (diſpatch'd to you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29362:10"/>
for that purpoſe, and to whom we deſire full Credence may be given) concerning his Majeſties moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Demand, and this our reaſonable Requeſt: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your ſelves, that the Roman Empire ſhall not fail upon all occaſions to afford you conſiderable Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; as we are ſtill willing and ready to do you all poſſible Kindneſs.</p>
