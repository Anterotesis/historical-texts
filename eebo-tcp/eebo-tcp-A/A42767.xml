            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have in this Sermon applied my thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward these three things; 1 The soul-ensnaring Errour of the greatest part of men, who choose to themselves such a way to the kingdom of Heaven as is broad, and smooth, and easie, and but little or nothing at all displeasing to flesh and blood; like him that tumbled down upon the grasse and said, <hi>utinam hoc esset la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borare.</hi> 2 The grumbling and unwillingnesse which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in very many, when they should submit to that Reformation of the Church which is according to the minde of Jesus Christ;<note place="margin">Isa. 30.10.

               <hi>Call me not Naomi</hi> (pleasant) <hi>call me Morah</hi> (bitter) <hi>for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</hi> We were <hi>pressed out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,<note place="margin">Cor. 1.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> above strength,</hi> and <hi>had the sentence of death</hi> in our selves, <hi>that wee should not trust in our selves, but in God which raiseth the dead; who delivered us from so great a death, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,

in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us</hi>; Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren also <hi>helping together by prayer for us,</hi> that for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bestowed on us by means of the prayers of many,<note place="margin">Psal. 18.46.</note>

               <hi>and let the God of our salvation be exalted. He is our God, and we will prepare for him an habitation; our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 72, 18, 19</note> 
               <hi>and we will exalt him. Blessed be the Lord God the God of Israel, who onely doth wondrous things: and blessed be his glorious Name for ever, and let the whole earth befilled with his glory.</hi>

Now are both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms put to a triall, whether their Humiliations be siliall, and whether they can mourn for sin more then for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And let us now hear what the Spirit speaketh to the Churhes, and not turn again to folly.

               <bibl>MALACHI 3.2.</bibl>
               <q> But who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he is like a Refiners fire, and like Fullers Sope.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you ask,<note place="margin">Act. 8.34.</note> 
               <hi>Of whom speaketh the Prophet this, of himselfe or of some other man?</hi> It is answered, both by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Jewish Interpreters: The Prophet speaketh this of Christ, the Messenger of the Covenant, then much longed and looked for by the people of God, as is manifest by the preceding Verse: And as it was fit that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> the last of the Prophets should shut up the old Testament with clear promises of the coming of Christ (which you find in this, and in the following Chapter) so he takes the rather occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the corrupt and degenerate estate of the Priests at that time (which he had mentioned in the former Chapter) to hold forth unto the Church the promised Messiah; who was to come unto them to purifie the sons of <hi>Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you ask again, of what coming or appearing of Christ,<note place="margin">The meaning of the Text searched.</note> doth the Prophet speak this? Whether of the first, or of the last, or of any other? The answer of Expositors is not so unanimous. Some understand the last coming of Christ in the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and holy Angels, to judge the quick and the dead. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand with ver. 34. <hi>He shall purifie the sons of Levi, and purge them, &amp;c.</hi> But at the last judgement it will be too late for the sons of <hi>Levi</hi> to be purified and purged; or for <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to bring offerings unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old.</p>
            <p>Others understand the first coming of Christ; and of these, some understand his Incarnation, or appearing in the flesh: others
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47415:4"/>
take the meaning to be of his coming into the Temple of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 21.10, 11, 12.</note> to drive out the buyers and sellers, at which time all the City was moved at his coming. This Exposition hath better grounds then the other, because the coming of Christ (here spoken of) did not precede, but soon follow after the Ministery of <hi>John Baptist</hi>; and therefore cannot be meant of our Saviours Incarnation, but rather of his appearing with power and authority in the Temple. But this also falleth short, and neither expresseth the whole, nor the principall part of what is meant in this Text: For how can it be said, that the Prophecy which followeth, Vers. 3, 4. (which is all of a peece with Vers. 2.) was fulfilled during Christs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sitting in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> Or how can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the offerings of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were pleasant to the Lord at that time, when the Gentiles were not, and the Jews would not be brought in,to offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousnesse? So that whether we understand by <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> the Jewish Church, or the Christian; this thing could not be said to be accomplished, while Christ was yet upon earth. And in like manner, whether we understand by the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> the Priests, and Levites of the Jews, or, the Ministers of the Gospel, it cannot be said that Christ did in the dayes of his flesh purifie the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> as Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but the Lord Jesus did then begin to set about this work. But that which is more principally here intended, is Christs coming and appearing in a spiritual, but yet most powerfull and glorious manner, to erect his Kingdom, and to gather and govern his Churches, by the Ministery of his Apostles and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whom he sent forth after his Ascension.</p>
            <p>Of this coming he himself speaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. <hi>Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 9.1.</note> 
               <hi>Mark</hi> addeth <hi>with power.</hi> Neither was that all. He did not so come at that time, as to put forth all his power, or to do his whole work. He hath at divers times come, and manifested himself to his Churches. And this present time is a time of the revelation of the Son of God, and a day of his coming.<note place="margin">Isa. 59.20.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47415:4"/>
place the Apostle hath respect to <hi>Isai.</hi> 11.4. where it is said of Christ, <hi>The rod of Jesse, with the breath of his lips shall be slay the wicked.</hi> There withall, you have the Churches tranquility, the filling of the earth with the knowledge of the Lord, and the restoring of the dispersed Jews,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brought on</hi> Revel 9.</note> as you may read in that Chapter. Some have observed (which ought not passe without observation) that the Chaldee Paraphrase had there added, the word <hi>Romilus: He shall slay the wicked Romilus:</hi> Wherupon, they challenge <hi>Arias Montainus</hi> for leaving out that word to wipe off the reproach from the Pope. However, the Scriptures teach us, that the Lord Jesus will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed mightily, and will make bare his holy Arm, as well in the confusion of Antichrist, as in the conversion of the Jews, before the last judgement, and the end of all things.</p>
            <p>By this time you may understand what is meant in the Text, by the day of Christs coming, <note place="margin">

            <p>When this Temple is built Christ cometh into it, to fill the house with the cloud of his glory, and to walk in the midst of the seven Golden Candlesticks.

               </note> saith the Chaldee: Others read, <hi>When he shall be seen,</hi> or <hi>in seeing of him.</hi> The originall word I find used to expresse more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, divine, and glorious sights, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</hi> Gen. 22.14. <hi>In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</hi> From this word had the Prophets the name of <hi>Seers, 1 <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now but what of all this, might some think? It Christ come, its well: He is the desire of all Nations. O but when Christ thus cometh into his Kingdom among men with power, and is seen appearing with some beams of his glory; <hi>Who may abide, and who shall stand,</hi> saith the Text? How shall sinners stand before the Holy One? How shall dust and ashes have any fellowship with the God of glory? How shall our weak eyes behold the Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, coming forth like a Bridegroom out of his Chamber? Did not <hi>Ezekiel</hi> fall upon his face <hi>at the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 1 28, Isa. 6.5.</note> Did not <hi>Isaiah</hi> cry out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47415:5"/>
for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why is it so hard a thing to abide the day of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to stand before him when he appeareth in his Temple? If you ask of him as <hi>Joshua</hi> did,<note place="margin">Iosh. 5.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</hi> He will answer you, <hi>Nay, but as a Captain of the Hoste of the Lord, am I now come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.4, 5.</note> If you ask of him, as the Elders of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> asked of <hi>Samuel</hi> (while they were trembling at his coming) <hi>Comest thou peaceably?</hi> He will answer you as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>Peaceably.</hi> What is there here then to trouble us? Doth he not come to save, and not to destroy? Yes, to save the Spirit, but to destroy the flesh. He will have the heart blood of sin, that the soul may live for ever. This is set forth by a double metaphor: One taken from the Refiners fire, which purifieth metals from the drosse. The other, from the Fullers sope; others read, the Fullers grasse, or the Fullers herb. Some have thought it so hard to determine, that they have kept into the Translation,<note place="margin">In Ier. 2.2.</note> the very Hebrew word <hi>Borith. Jerome</hi> tels us, that the Fullers herb which grew in the marish places of <hi>Palesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> had the same vertue for washing and making white, which nitre hath. Yet I suppose, the Fullers sope hath more of that vertue in it,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> then the herb could have. However, it is certain that <hi>Borith</hi> cometh from a word which signifieth to make clean, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.3. <hi>His raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow: So as no Fuller on earth can white them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to whom will Christ thus reveal himself? And who are they whom he will resine from their drosse, and wash from their filthinesse?<note place="margin">Ier. 6.30.</note> That we may know from the two following verses. He is not a Resiners fire to those that are <hi>reprobate silver,</hi>and can never be refined:<note place="margin">Deut. 32.5</note> Neither is he as Fullers sope to those whose spot <hi>is not the spot of his children.</hi> Nay, Christ doth not thus lose his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: But he refineth and maketh clean the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> also <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This (I doubt not to aver) doth principally belong to the Jews,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.4.</note> for to them pertain the promises, saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.24.</note> and the naturall branches shall be grafted into their own Olive-tree. But it belongeth also to us Gentiles, who are cut out of the wilde Olive-tree, and are grafted into the good Olive-tree, God hath perswaded <hi>Japhet</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Sem.</hi> And so we are now the <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and our Ministers, the sons of <hi>Levi.</hi> Gods own Church and people, even the best of them have need of this Refiners fire, and of this Fullers sope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47415:5"/>And so much for the scope, sence, and coherence of the Text. The generall Doctrine which offereth it self to us from the words, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1.</note>
               <hi>The way of Christ, and fellowship with him, is very difficult and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to our sinfull nature: And is not so easie a matter as most men imagine</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First of all,<note place="margin">Proved first from the Text Iosh. 24.16. Iosh 6.19.</note> this doth clearly arise out of the Text. As when the people said to <hi>Joshua, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other gods. Joshua</hi> answered, <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God.</hi> Just so doth the Prophet here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Jews, when they were very much desiring and longing for the Messiah, promising to themselves comfort, and peace, and prosperity, and the restoring of all things according to their hearts desire, if Christ were once come. Nay, saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, not so: <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand when he appeareth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. From other Scriptures.</note> Other Scriptures do abundantly confirm it. The Doctrine of Jesus Christ was such as made many of his Disciples say, <hi>This is a hard saying, who can hear it?</hi> And from that time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them <hi>went back,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 6.60.</note> 
               <hi>and walked no more with him.</hi> A young man, a ruler,<note place="margin">Mar 10.21.22</note> who came to him with great affection, was so cooled and discouraged at hearing of the crosse, and selling of all he had,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.24, 25.</note> that he went away sad and sorrowfull. The Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves having heard him say, that, <hi>It is easier for a camel to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God; They were exceedingly amazed</hi> at this Doctrine, saying, <hi>Who then can be saved?</hi> As for his life and actions, they were such,<note place="margin">Matth 8.34.</note> not onely did the <hi>Gadarens</hi> beseech him to depart out of their coasts;<note place="margin">Mark 3.21.</note> but his own friends and kinsfolks were about <hi>to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself.</hi> His sufferings were such, that all his Disciples did forsake him, and went away every man to his own home again. And what shall be the condition of those that will follow him?<note place="margin">Luk. 14.28.</note> If we will indeed be his disciples, he hath forewarned us to sit down first,<note place="margin">Ioh. v. 26, 2, 33.</note> and count our cost. He hath told us, It will cost us no lesse then the bearing of the crosse, the forsaking of all, yea, (which is hardest of all) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of our selves:<note place="margin">Matth. 16, 24.</note> We must even cease to be our selves, and cannot be his, except we leave off to be our own. And what shall the world think of us,<note place="margin">Iames 44.</note> all this while? <hi>Know ye not,</hi> (saith <hi>James</hi>)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47415:6"/>
               <hi>that the friendship of this world is enmity with God? Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be a friend of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>is the enemy of God. Let no man deceive himself,</hi> saith <hi>Paul: If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</hi> What do ye think now? Are not all these hard sayings for flesh and blood to hear? I might adde much more of this kinde. But</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. From the excellency of Christ. 1 Sam. 24.24.</note> Thirdly, Thus it must be, to set the higher value upon Christ, and upon the lot of Gods children. <hi>Will I offer burnt-offerings to the Lord my God,</hi> saith <hi>David, of that which doth cost me nothing?</hi> And shall our lines fall to us in pleasant places? Or shall we have a goodly heritage, which doth cost us nothing? How should the preciousnesse of the Saints portion be known, if we lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is dear to us, to come by it? <hi>Phil. 3.7. What things were gain to me, those I counted losse for Christ.</hi> Matth. 13.44, 45, 46. <hi>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</hi> Again, <hi>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant-man seeking goodly pearls, who when he had found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 35.4.</note> 
               <hi>Jacobs</hi> family must give away all the strange gods, and all their ear-rings also, before they get leave to build an Altar unto the Lord at <hi>Bethel. Abraham</hi> must get him out of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and from his kinred, if he will come unto the land which the Lord will shew him. <hi>Moses</hi> must forsake the Court of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if he will take him to the heritage of <hi>Jacob</hi> his father. The disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples must leave ships, nets, fathers, and all, if they will follow Christ. And as they who come in sight of the South-pole, lose fight of the North-pole: So when we follow-Christ, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to forsake somewhat else, yea, even that which is dearest to us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. From the nature of the Covenant.</note> Fourthly, If it were not so, there should be no sure evidence of our closing in covenant with Christ: For then (and never till then) doth the soul give it self up to Christ to be his, and closeth with him in a covenant, when it renounceth all other lovers, that it may be his onely. Shall a woman be married to a husband, with the reservation of another lover, or upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that she shall ever stay in her fathers house? So the soul cannot be married to Christ, except it not onely renounce its bosome-sins, lusts, and idols; but be content also to part with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47415:6"/>
the most lawfull creature-comforts for his sake. <hi>Forget thine own people, and thy fathers house,</hi> saith the <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.10. The repudiating of creature-comforts, and a covenant with Christ, go hand in hand together, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.2, 3. <hi>Nahash</hi> would not make a covenant with the men of <hi>Jabesh-Gilead,</hi> unlesse they would pluck out their right eyes, intending (as <hi>Josephus</hi> gives the reason) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them from fighting, or making war: For the buckler or shield did cover their left eye when they fought, so that they had been hard put to it, to fight without the right eye. This was a cruell mercy in him: But it is a mercifull severity in Christ, that he will make no covenant with us, except the right eye of the old man of sin in us be put out.</p>
            <p>O then let us learn from all this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Use.</hi>
               </note> how miserably many a poor soul is deluded, imagining as the Jews did, that Christ shall even satisfie their carnall and earthly desires, and that the way of salvation is broad, &amp; easie enough. If the way of Christ be such as you have now heard, then surely they are far from it;<note place="margin">1 King. 1.6. Eccles. 2.10.</note> who give loose reins to the flesh, as <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Adonijah,</hi> who have not displeased their flesh at any time, nor said, <hi>Why hast thou done so?</hi> Who do not withhold their heart from any joy, and whatsoever their eyes desire, they keep it not from them:<note place="margin">Ier. 2.23, 24.</note> Who are like <hi>the wiide Asse used to the wildernesse, that snuffeth up the winde at her pleasure</hi>; and like <hi>the swift Dromedary, traversing her wayes</hi>: Who cannot endure to be inclosed into so narrow a lane, as Ministers describe the way to Heaven to be. These are like fed oxen, which have room enough in the Meadows, but they are appointed for slaughter; when the labouring oxen which are kept under the yoke, shall be brought home to the stall and fed there.<note place="margin">Luk. 16.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>5.</note> Was it not so with the rich man and <hi>Lazarus</hi>? Nay, and many of the children of God fall into this same errour, of making the way of Christ broader and easier then ever Christ made it, and taking more libertie then ever he allowed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mark ye well our Saviours words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that finde it.</hi> There be but few that seek it, and yet fewer that finde it,<note place="margin">An Objection answered four wayes.</note> but fewest of all that enter in at it.</p>
            <p>But how doth all this agree with <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.30. <hi>My yoke is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47415:7"/>
easie, and my burthen is light</hi>: and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>His Commandments are not grievous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That is spoken to poor souls that are labouring, and heavy loaden; a metaphor taken from Beasts drawing a ful Cart, which both labour in drawing, and are weary in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But my Text speaketh to those that are like undantoned Heifers, and like Bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke: The same Christ is a sweet and meek Christ to some; but a sowre and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Christ to others.</item>
               <item>2. Christs yoke is easie in comparison of the yoke of the law, which neither we, nor our Fathers were able to bear.</item>
               <item>3. As wisdom is easie to him that understandeth, so is Christs yoke easie, &amp; his burthen light to those that are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and have good experience of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.12. <hi>When thou g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <item>4. Mark Christs own words. Its a yoke though an easie one; and a burthen, though a light-one. A yoke to the flesh, but easie to the Spirit: A burthen to the old man; but light to the new man. He poureth in Wine and Oyl into our wounds. Oyl to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them, and Wine to cleanse them. He can both plant us as Trees of righteousnesse, and at the same time lay the Ax to the root of the old Tree. He will have mercy upon the sinner, but no mercy upon the sin. He will save the soul, but yet so as by fire.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And thus much in generall of the difficulty and hardship of the way of Christ; the great point held forth in this Text, which I have the rather insisted upon, as a necessary foundation for those particulars, which I am to speak of. Were this principle but rightly apprehended, it were easie to perswade you, when we come to particulars.</p>
            <p>Some Papists have alledged this Text for their purgatory. Here is indeed a Purgatory, and a fire of purgatory; and such a purgatory, that we must needs go thorow it, before we can come to Heaven: But this purgatory is in this world, not in the world to come. The flesh must go through it, and not the soul separated: And it must purge us from mortall, not from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47415:7"/>
veniall sins: And by a spirituall, not a materiall fire.</p>
            <p>I will now come to the particulars. Christ is to us as a Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fire, and as Fullers Sope, three wayes:
In respect of<list>

            </p>
            <p>Which make not three different sences, but three harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of one and the same sence.</p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>Reformation,</hi> concerning which I draw this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Doctrine. <hi>Cleared in four branches thereof. Gualt. hom. 8.

It is a very purgatory upon earth: Its like the fire to drossy silver: And like Fullers Sope to slovenly persons, who would rather keep the spots in their garments, then take pains to wash them out.</p>
            <p>Look but upon one peece of the accomplishment of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and by it, judge of the rest. When Christ cometh to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem meek, and sitting upon an Asse</hi> (as the Prophet said) all the City is troubled at his coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.5, 10. When he had but cast out the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, the Priests and Scribes begin to plot his death, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.45, 47. Nay, where Christ and the Gospel cometh, there is a shaking of Heaven and Earth, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.6. The lesse wonder, if I call <hi>Reformation</hi> like a Refiners fire. The drosse of a Church is not purged away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this violence of fire.</p>
            <p>This is the manner of <hi>Reformation</hi> held forth in Scripture, and that in reference. 1. To Magistrates and States men. 2. To Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. 3. To a people reformed. 4. To a people not reformed.</p>
            <p>In reference to Magistrates and States-men, <hi>Reformation</hi> is a fire that purgeth away the drosse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.25, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>6. <hi>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away the drosse, and take away all thy tin.</hi> Here's the Refiners fire: And the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphrase ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Fullers <hi>Borith.</hi> Then followeth, <hi>And I will restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counsellors as at the beginning: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thou shalt be called the City of righteousnesse, the faithfull City.</hi> Interpreters note upon that place, that no effectuall <hi>Reformation</hi> can be looked for, till Rulers and Magistrates be reformed; and that therefore the Lord promiseth to purge away the drosse

and tin of corrupt Rulers and Judges, and to give his people such Judges and Rulers as they had of old, <hi>Moses, Joshua,</hi> the Judges, <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>In reference to Ministers, the Doctrine is most clear.

            <p>In the third place, you shall finde <hi>Reformation</hi> to be a refining fire, in reference to a people or Church reformed. <hi>He that is left in Zion shall be called holy,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the Daughters of Zion, and shall have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bullinger</hi> on the place.</note> 
               <hi>and by the spirit of burning, Isa.</hi> 4.3, 4. Where you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the filth of the daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> their former Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and such like abominations against the first Table (which the Prophets call often by the name of filth and pollution) and by the blood of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the sins against the second Table. These the Lord promiseth to purge away by the Spirit of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, by a Spirit of Reformation (according to that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Now is the judgement of this world, now shall the Prince of this world be cast out:</hi>)<note place="margin">Matth. 3.12.</note> Which Spirit of Reformation is also a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of burning; even as the Holy Ghost is elsewhere called fire,<note place="margin">Act. 2.3.</note> and did come down upon the Apostles in the likenesse of cloven tongues of fire. The spirit of Reformation may be the rather called the Spirit of burning, because ordinarily Reformation is not without tribulation (as we shall hear) and by the voice of the rod doth the Spirit speak to mens consciences. When the Lord hath thus washed away the filthy spots, and burnt away the filthy drosse of his Church, then (<hi>Isa.</hi> 4.5.) she becomes a glory or a praise in the earth, and the promise is, That <hi>upon all the glory shall be a defence:</hi> But you see she is not brought to that condition, till she go thorow the Refiners fire. It is no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cast Satan out of a person; How much lesse to cast his kingdom out of a Land? Another place for the same purpose we find, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. When two parts of the Land are cut off, the remnant whichescape, the third part which is <hi>written to life in Jerusalem,</hi> even they must be brought thorow the fire <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>and will refine them as

silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried.</hi> This is the fiery triall of affliction, but the fruit of it is a blessed Reformation to make the Church, as most pure refined gold. <hi>They shall call on my Name,</hi>

               <hi>and I will hear them,</hi> that is, they shall no longer worship Idols, but me onely, and they shall offer to the Lord an offering in righteousnesse, which shall be accepted; And what more? <hi>I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, The Lord is my God</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a reforming people, and a covenanting people: But he that <hi>hath his fire in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem,</hi> doth first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them, and purifie them. We are not reformed in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, till the refining sire have purged away our drosse, till we be refined as silver is refined, and tried as gold is tried.</p>
            <p>Lastly, In reference to a people not reformed, hear what the Prophet saith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.28, 29, 30. <hi>They are brasse and iron, they are all corrupters: The bellows are burnt, the lead is consumed off the fire, the founder melteth in vain; for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase expoundeth it of the Prophets who labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain, and spent their strength for nought, speaking to the people in the Name of the Lord, to turn to the Law and to the Testimony; but they would not turn.</p>
            <p>I might draw many <hi>Vses</hi> from this <hi>Doctrine:</hi> but I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with these few.</p>
            <p>First of all,<note place="margin">First, applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Revel. 14.2.</note> it reproveth that contrary Principle which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reason suggesteth: Reformation must not grieve, but please it must not break nor bruise, but heal and binde up; it must be an acceptable thing, not displeasing: it must be <hi>as the voice of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers harping with their harps,</hi> but not <hi>as the voice of many waters,</hi> or <hi>as the voice of great thunders.</hi> Thus would many heal the wound of the daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> slightly, and daub the wall with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered morter; and so far comply with the sinfull humours and inclinations of men, as in effect to harden them in evil, and to strengthen their hands in their wickednesse; or at least, if men be moralized, then to trouble them no further. Saith not the Apostle, <hi>If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ?</hi> And again, <hi>The carnall minde is enmity against God, and is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> So that either we must have a Reformation, displeasing to God, or displeasing to men.

Malignants, or evil Instruments, by hindering the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any Faction or Parties among the people contrary to this Covenant. There was once a compliance between the Nobles of <hi>Judah</hi> and the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> which I hope you do not read of, without abominating the thing: You find it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.17.19. <hi>In those dayes, the nobles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah sent many letters to Tobijah, and the letters of Tobijah came unto them.

            </p>
            <p>In the second place,<note place="margin">2 Touching <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi>
               </note> think of the extirpation of Heresie, and of unsound dangerous Doctrine, such as now springeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, and subverteth the faith of many. There is no Heretick nor false Teacher, which hath not some one fair pretext or another: But bring him once to be tried by this refining fire, he is found to be <hi>like a potsheard covered with silver drosse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 26 23. Ier. 3.28.</note> 
               <hi>What is the chaff to the wheat,</hi> saith the Lord? and what is the drosse to the silver? If this be the way of Christ which my text speaketh of, then (sure) that which now passeth under the name of <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> is not the way of Christ. Much hath been written of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For my part, I shall for the present onely offer this one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: If <hi>Liberty of conscience</hi> ought to be granted in matters of Religion, it ought also to be granted in matters Civil or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. But <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> ought not to be granted in matters Civil or Military, as is acknowledged: Therfore neither ought it to be granted in matters of Religion. Put the case now there be some well-meaning men (otherways void of offence) who from the erroneous perswasion of their consciences, think it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly sinfull, and contrary to the Word of God, to take Arms in the Parliaments Service, or to contribute to this present War, or to obey any Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, which tendeth to the resisting of the Kings Forces: Now compare this case with the case of a Socinian, Arminian, Antinomian, or the like: They both plead for <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>: They both say, Our conscience ought not to be compelled; and if we do against
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47415:10"/>
our Conscience, we sin. I beseech you, how can you give <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> to the Heretick, and yet refuse <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> to him that is the conscientious Recusant in point of the War? I am sure there can be no answer given to this Argument, which will not be resolved into this Principle. Mens Consciences may be compelled for the good of the State, but not for the glory of God. We must not suffer the State to sink; but if Religion sink, we cannot help it. This is the plain English of it.</p>
            <p>When I speak against libertie of conscience, it is far from my meaning to advise any rigorous or violent course against such as being sound in the faith and holy in life, and not of a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent factious cariage, do differ in smaller matters from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule.<note place="margin">Iob 3.4.</note>

Or, if you please to make a Catalogue of seven, you may, provided itbe such as God himself makes in the fifth verse of this Chapter, where seven sorts are reckoned forth (as some Interpreters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute) but the last of the seven, is generall and comprehensive, <gap reason="foreign">

Nay I dare undertake to draw out of <hi>Erastus</hi> himself (the great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie) a Catalogue of seven sorts of persons to be kept off from the Lords Table, and such a Catalogue as Godly Ministers can be content with. But of this elsewhere.</p>

The Parliament of England (if any State in the world) oweth much to Jesus Christ; and he will take it very ill at your hands if ye do him not right in this. I say do him right, for, alas, what is it to Ministers, it were more for their ease, and for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the people, to admit all: but a necessity is laid upon us that we dare not do it, and wo unto us, if we do it. And for your part, should you not establish such a rule as many put a difference between the precious and the vile, the clean and the unclean; you shall in so far make the Churches of Christ in a worse condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more disabled to keep themselves pure, then either they were of old under Pagan Emperours,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binsons</hi> Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> wrote a Book to prove that all those in the Reformed Churches of <hi>Poland</hi> who desire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O that we were Christs Incendiaries against the kingdom of Sathan.

            <p>
               <hi>Passively</hi> also the Application must be made, because the sons of <hi>Levi</hi> must in the first place go through this refining fire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and they most of all other men have need to be and must be refined from their drosse.

            <p>I am sorrie I have occasion to adde a third Application But come on and I will shew you greater things than these. What will you say, if any be found among the sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> that will neither be active nor passive in the establishing of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refining and sin-censuring Government of Jesus Christ, but will needs appear upon the Stage against it.

            <p>I have done with that which the Text holds forth concerning Reformation. The second way how Christ is like a refiners fire, and like fullers sope, is in respect of tribulation which either fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, or accompanieth his coming into his Temple. Affliction is indeed a refining fire, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.10. <hi>For thou O God hast proved us: thou hast tried us as silver is tried,</hi> vers. 12. <hi>We went through fire and through water,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. <hi>Ye are in heavinesse through manifold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that the triall of your faith being much more precious then of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, &amp;c.</hi> Affliction is also the fullers sope to purifie and make white, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.35. and 12.10. <hi>Many shall be purified and made white, and tried</hi>: where the same word is used from which I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the fullers sope hath its name.</p>

               <hi>Tribulation doth either accompany or follow after the work of Reformation, or purging of the house of God.</hi> So it was when Christ himself came into his Temple. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.49. <hi>I am come to send fire on the earth,</hi> vers. 51. <hi>Suppose ye that I am come to send peace on earth, I tell you nay; but rather divis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signes in earth beneath, blood and fire, and vapour of smoke, the Sun shall be turned into darknesse, and the Moon into blood.</hi> Acts 2.19, 20. The meaning is, such tribulation shall follow the Gospel, which shall be like the darkening of the great lights of the world, and as it were a putting of heaven and earth out of their course, so great a change and calamity shall come. The experience both of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and now-reformed Churches doth also abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Doctrine.

And now when the sword of the Lord hath gotten a charge against these three covenanting and reforming Kingdoms, is this any other then the word of the Lord, that when Christ cometh into his Temple, <hi>who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand, when he appeareth? so he is like a refiners fire, and like fullers sope.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly.</hi> as the promises of spirituall and eternall blessings, so the promises of peace and temporall deliverances, are not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall but even Evangelicall: If we be not refined and purged as we ought to be, that is a matter of humiliation to us, but it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a matter of magnifying the riches of free mercy, Isa. 48.9, 10, 11. <hi>For my Names sake will I deferre mine anger, and for my praise will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver, I have chosen thee in the fornance of affection, for mine own sake, yea for mine own sake will I do it.</hi> The Lord is there arguing with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to humble them, to convince them, and to cut off all matter of glorying from them.

A land is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a peoples peace made with God, not by their repentance and humiliation, but by Christ beleeved on, <hi>Micah</hi> 5:5. <hi>This man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our Land.</hi> There were Sin-offerings, and Burnt-offerings appointed in the Law for a Nationall atonement, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.13.21. <hi>Num.</hi> 15.25, 26. which did typisie pardoning of Nationall sins through the merit of Jesus Christ. We must improve the office of the Mediator, and the promise of free grace, in the behalf of Gods people, as well
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47415:15"/>
as of our own souls, which (if it be indeed done) will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but further a great mourning, and deep humiliation in the Land. And so much of tribulation.</p>
            <p>The third thing held forth in this Text (of which I must be very short) is Mortification: This also is a refining fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>He shall baptize you with the holy Ghost and with fire, Mark</hi> 9.49. <hi>For every one shall be salted with fire; and every Sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</hi> He hath been before speaking of mortification, of the placking out of the right eye, the cuting off the right hand, or the right foot, <note place="margin">Levit. 2.13.</note> and now he presseth the same thing by a double allusion to the Law, there was a necessity both of fire and salt, the Sacrifice was seasoned with salt, <note place="margin">Lev. 6.12, 13.</note> and the fire upon the Altar was not to be put out, but every morning the wood was burnt upon it, and the burnt offering laid upon it. So if we will present our selves as a holy and acceptable Sacrifice to God, we must be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the salt, and our corruptions burnt up with the fire of mortification.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine shall be this:<note place="margin">4 Doctrine.</note> 
               <hi>It is not enough to joyn in publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yea to suffer tribulation for the name of Christ, except we also endeavour mortification.</hi> This mortification is a third step distinct from the former two; and without this, the other two can make us but <hi>almost Christians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth 13.</note> or, <hi>not far from the Kingdom of God</hi> In the parable of the Sower and the seed,<note place="margin">Mark 4.</note> as we find it both in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 8.</note> and <hi>Luke,</hi> this method may be observed, That of the four sorts of ground, the second is better then the first, the third better then the second; but the fourth onely is the good ground, which is fruitfull, and getteth a blessing. Some mens hearts are like the high way, and the hard beaten road, where every soul spirit, and every lust hath walked and converted, their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences through the custome of sin, are as it were <hi>seared with a hot Iron:</hi> In these the Word takes no place, but all that they hear doth presently slip from them. Others receive the Word with a present good affection and delight, but have no depth of earth, that is, neither having had a work of the Law upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences for deep humiliation, nor being rooted and grounded in love to the Gospel, nor paradventure so much as grounded in the knowledge of the truth, nor having counted their cost, and solidly resolved for sufferings; thereupon it comes to passe, when suffering times come, these wither away, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47415:16"/>
thing. There is a third sort, who go a step further, they have some root, and some more solid ground then the former, so that they can suffer many things, and not fall away because of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, yet they perish through want of mortification. One may suffer persecution for Christ, not being sore tried in that which is his Idol lust, yet enduring great losses and crosses in other things.<note place="margin">Mark 4.19.</note> Of such it is said, <hi>that the cares of this world, and the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the Word, and it becometh unfruitfull.</hi> Mark that, <hi>the lusts of other things,</hi> that is, whether it be the lust of the eyes, or the lust of the flesh, or the pride of life; and he speaks of the <hi>entring</hi> in, meaning of some strong tentation coming upon a man to catch him in that which is the great Idol of his heart, and his beloved lust, what ever it be, such a tentation he never found before, and therefore thought the lust had been mortified, which was but lurking. Did not <hi>Judas</hi> suffer many things with Christ, during the time of his publike Ministery? Did not <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> suffer for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with the Apostles and Church at <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> What was it then that lost them? They neither made defection from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth, nor did they fall away because of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But having shined in the light a sound profession, having also taken up the crosse, and born the reproach of Christ, they make shipwrack at last upon an unmortified lust.</p>
            <p>I shall enlarge the Doctrine nofurther,<note place="margin">I <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> but touch upon some few Uses, and so an end.</p>
            <p>First, let all and every one ofus be convinced of the necessity of our further endeavouring after mortfication. The best silver which cometh out of the earth, hath drosse in it, and therefore needeth the Refiners fire; and the whitest garment that is worn, will touch some unclean thing or other, and therefore will need the Fullers sope. The best of Gods children have the drosse of their inherent corruptions to purge away, which made <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into subiection; lest that by any means when I have preached to others,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>I my self should be a castaway.</hi> It is a spee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and so is the word used by the <hi>Septuagints, Isa.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Thy silver is become drosse.</hi> The Apostle therefore sets himself to the study of mortification, lest, saith he, when I have been refining and purifying others, I my self be found to be drossie silver. And as there is <hi>inherent</hi> drosse, so there is <hi>adherent</hi> uncleannesse in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47415:16"/>
best, and who can say, that he hath kept his garments so clean that he is <hi>unspotted of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa 1.27.</note> or that he hath so separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the pollutions of the world, as that he hath touched no unclean thing. So that there is an universall necessity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use both of the refiners fire, and of the Fullers sope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> let us once become willing and contented, yea desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be throughly mortified. A mans lus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s and corruptions are indeed so strongly interested in him, that sin is himself, and his corruptions are his members, therfore when we leave off sin, we are said to live no more <hi>to our selves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> And morification is the greatest violence that can be done to nature, therefore it is called a cutting off of the chief members of the body, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43.45.47. a salting with salt, and a burning with fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 49. a ciccum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. a crucifying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. So that nothing can be more difficult or displeasing; yea, a greater torment to flesh and blood. Yet now art thou willing, notwithstanding of all this, to take Christ on his own terms, to take him not only for rightous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and life, but to take him as a refiners fire, &amp; as fullers sope? O that there were such a heart in thee. When Christ bids thee pluck out thy right eye, and cut off thy right hand, say not in thy heart, how shall I do without my right eye, and my right hand. Nay thou shalt do well enough, thou shalt even enter into life without them, thou shalt be a gainer, and no looser. Say not thou, how shall I go through this refining fire: fear not, thou shalt lose nothing but thy drosse. Thus get thy heart wrought to a willingnesse, and a condesending, in the point of mortification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 <hi>Vse.</hi>
               </note> if you say, But after all this, how shall I attain unto it? put thy self in the hands of Iesus Christ, trust him with the work, if you mark the Text here; and the verse that followeth, Christ is both the refiner, and the refiners fire: thou shalt be refined by him, and thou shalt be refined in him. Thou deceivest thy self if thou thinkest to be refined any other way but by this refiner, and in this refiners fire. The blood of Christ doth! not onely wash us from guilt, but <hi>purge our consciences from dead works to serve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> Heb. 9.10. and <hi>they that are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts, Gal.</hi> 5.24. Here you may see the thing is feceable and attainable, and not onely by an Apostle or some extraordinary man, but by all that are Christs. Being his and in him, they are inabled through his strength to crucifie the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof.</p>

            <head>A Brotherly Examination of some passages of Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> late Sermon upon <hi>Job</hi> 11.20. as it is now Printed and published: By which he hath to the great offence of very many, endeavoured to strike at the very root of all Spiritual and Ecclesiasticall Government, contrary to the Word of God, the solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, other reformed Churches, and the Votes of the Honourable Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> after advice had with the Reverend and Learned Assembly of <hi>Divines.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have before touched this purpose in the third branch of the third Application of my second Doctrine: and did in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the <hi>Abbey Church,</hi> expresse my thoughts of it at some length. But as I was then unwilling to fall upon such a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie so publickly, &amp; especially in a Fast Sermon, if that which I intend to examine had not been as publikly and upon the like occasion delivered: So now in the publishing, I have thought good to open my mind, concerning this thing distinctly, and by itselfe. That which had been too late to be preached after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is not too late to be Printed after Sermon. Others (upon occasion offred) have given their testimony against his Doctrine; And I should think my self unfaithful in the Trust put upon me, if upon such an occasion I should be silent in this businesse: and I beleeve no man will think it strange, that a peece of this nature and strain get an Answer: and I go about it, without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect either to the person or parts of my Reverend Brother. Onely I must give a testimony to the truth when I hear it spoken agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, and I hope his Objections have made no such impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any mans mind, as to make him unwilling to hear an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Come we therefore to the particulars.</p>
            <p>Foure rules were offered by the Reverend Brother, as tending to Unity, and to the healing of the present Controversies about Church-Government. But in truth his cure is worse than the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47415:17"/>
disease: and instead of making any agreement, he is like to have his hand against every man, and every mans hand against him.</p>
            <p>The first Rule was this. <hi>Est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</hi> What you take from the Word of God is <hi>fine gold tried in the fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3.18.</note> But an holy thing of mans devising is the drosse of silver. Can he not be content to have the drosse purged from the silver, except the silver it self be cast away? The very contrary rule is more sure and safe, which I prove thus.</p>
            <p>If it be a sin to diminish or take ought from the Word of God, in so much that it is forbiden under pain of taking away a mans part out of the Book of Life and out of the holy City: then as many things as are to be established <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as can well be. But it is a sin to diminish or take ought from the Word of God, in so much that it is forbiden under pain of taking away a mans part out of the book of life, and out of the holy City. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as many things are to be established <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as can well be.</p>
            <p>It must be remembred withall. 1. That the question is not now whether this or that form of Church-Government be <hi>Jure Divino?</hi> but whether a Church-Government be <hi>Jure Divino?</hi> Whether Jesus Christ have thus far revealed his will in his Word, that there are to be Church-censures, and those to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by Church-Officers? The Brother is for the Negative of this Question. 2 Neither is it stood upon by any (so far as I know) that what the Parliament shall establish concerning Church-Government, must be established by them <hi>Jure divino.</hi> If the Parliament shall in a Parliamentary and Legislative way establish that thing which really and in it self is agreeable to the Word of God, though they do not declare it to be the will of Jesus Christ, I am satisfied, and I am confident so are others. This I confesse, that it is incumbent to Parliament-Men, to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and to all other Christians, according to their vocation and interest, to search the Scriptures, and thereby to info<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> their own and other mens Consciences, so as they may do in faith what they do in point of Church-Government, that is,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47415:18"/>
that they may know they are not sinning, but doing the will of God: And it ought to be no prejudice nor exception against a Form of Church-Government that many learned and godly Divines do assert it from Scripture, to be the will of God. And why should <hi>Jus divinum</hi> be such a <hi>Noli me tangere?</hi> The reason was given: <hi>This was the onely thing that kindered union in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> (saith he) <hi>Two parties came biased, The Reverend Commissioners from Scotland, were for the Jus Divinum of the Presbyteriall; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents for the Congregationall Government. How should either move? Where should they both meet?</hi> If it was thus, how shall he make himself blamelesse, who made union in the Assembly, yet more difficult, because he came byased a third way, with the <hi>Erastian</hi> Tenents? And where he asketh, where the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and we should meet? I answer, in holding a Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is, that the Pastors and Elders ought to suspend or excommunicate (according to the degree ofthe offence) scandalous sinners. Who can tell, but the purging of the Church from scandals, and the keeping of the Ordinances pure (when it shall be actually seen to be the great thing endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured on both sides) may make union between us and the Independents more easie than many imagine.

Rites, and had so declared themselves at <hi>Antioch,</hi> before they came to the Synod at <hi>Jerusalem? Act.</hi> 15.2. It's not fault to be engaged for the truth, but against the truth: It's not blame-worthy, but praise-worthy to hold fast so much as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attain'd unto.<note place="margin">In our first paper present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</note> Nothwithstanding we, for our part, have also from the beginning professed, <hi>That we are most willing to hear and learn from the Word of God, what needeth futher to be reformed in the Church of Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second rule which was offered in that Sermon, was this; <hi>Let all precepts, held out as divine Institutions, have clear Scriptures, &amp;c. let the Scripture speak expressely,</hi> (saith he.) I answer; The Scripture speaks in that manner, which seemed fittest to the wisdom of God, that is, so as it must cost us much searching of the Sripture, as men search for a hid treasure, before we find out what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God concerning the Government of his Church. Will any Divine in the world deny that it is a divine truth, which by necessarie consequence is drawn from Scripture, as well as that which in expresse words and syllables is written in Scripture? Are not divers Articles of our profession, for instance the Baptisme of Infants necessarily and certainly proved from Scripture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it make no expresse mention thereof in words and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables? But let us hear what he hath said concerning some Scriptures (for he names but two of them) upon which the Acts of Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall Government have been grounded. <hi>That place,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>takes not hold</hi> (saith he) <hi>on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for excommunication, and I admire that Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>so should up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any.</hi> It's strange that he should superciliously passe them over without respect to so great a cloud of witnesses in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, or without so much as offering any answer at all to the arguments which so many learned and godly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of old and of late have drawn from these places for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; which if he had done, he should not want a Reply. In the meantime, he intermixeth a politick considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into this debate of divine right. <hi>I could never yet see</hi> (saith he) <hi>how two co-ordinate governments exempt from superiority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferioritie, can be in one State.</hi> I suppose he hath seen the co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Governments of a Generall, and of an Admirall; or if we shall come lower, the Governments of parents over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47415:19"/>
and masters over their servants, though it fall often out, that he who is subject to one man as his master, is subject to another man as his father. In one ship there may be two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Governments, the Captain governing the Souldiers, the Master governing the Mariners. In these and such like cases, you have two co-ordinate governments, when the one Governor is not subordinate to the other. There is more subordination in the Ministers and other Church-Officers toward the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. For the Ministers of Christ must be in subjection to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate; &amp; if he be not, he is punishable by the Law of the Land as well as any other Subject. The persons and estates of Church-officers and all that they have in this world is subject to civill Authoritie. But that which is Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and not ours, the royall prerogative of the King of Saints, in governing of his Church, according to his own will, is not subject to the pleasure of any man living. But the Reverend Brother might well have spared this. It isnot the Independency of the Church-Government upon the civil Government, which he intended to speak against. It is the very thing it self, a Church-Government, as is manifest by his other two rules.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to his next, which is the third rule, <hi>Lay no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urthen of government upon the shoulders of Ministers, then Christ hath plainly laid upon them.</hi> He means none at all, as is manifest not onely by his fourth rule, where he saith, that he finds no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of other Governments beside Magistracy, but also by the next words, <hi>The Ministers have other work to do,</hi> saith he, <hi>and such as will take up the whole man:</hi> He might have added this one word more, that without the power of Church-government, when Ministers have done all that ever they can, they shall not keep themselves nor the Ordinances from pollution. Before I proceed any further, let it be remembred when he excludes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters from Government: First, it is from spirituall or ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Government, for the question is not of civill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, he excludes ruling Elders too, and therefore ought to have mentioned them with the Ministers, as those who are to draw the same yoke together, rather then to tell us of an <hi>innate enmity between the Clergie and the Laity.</hi> The keeping up of the names of the Clergy and Laity savoureth more of a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering power, then any thing the Brother can charge upon

And for the thing it self, to object an innate enmity between the Ministers of the Gospel and those that are not Ministers, is no lesse then a dishonouring and aspersing of the Christian Religion. To return, you see his words tend to the taking away of all Church-Government out of the hands of Church-Officers. Now may we know his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? He fetcheth the ground of an Argument out of his own heart; <hi>I have a heart</hi> (faith he) <hi>that knews better how to be governed, then govern.</hi> I wish his words might hold true in a sence of ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse and yeelding to Government. How he knows to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern I know not; but it should seem in this particular he knows not how to be governed: For after both Houses of Parliament have concluded, <hi>That many particular Congregations shall be under one Presbyteriall Government</hi>; he still acknowledgeth no such thing as Presbyteriall Government. I dare be bold to say, He is the first Divine in all the Christian world that ever advised a State to give no government to Church-Officers, after the State had resolved to establish Presbyterian Government. But let us take the strength of his Argument as he pretendeth it. He means not of an humble p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus his Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion runs, <hi>Might I measure others by my self, and I know not why I may not (God fashions mens hearts alike; and as in water face answers face, so the heart of man to man)I ingeniously professe, I have a heart that knows better how to be governed, then govern: I fear an ambitious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snarement, and I have cause; I see what raised Prelacy and Papacy to such a height, &amp;c.</hi> The two Scriptures will not prove what he would.

Is this corruption onely in the hearts of Ministers, or is it in the hearts of all other men? I suppose he will say in all mens hearts; and then his Argument will conclude against all civill Government. Last of all, admit that there be just fears of abusing the Power and Government Ecclesiasticall; let the persons to be intrusted with it be examined, and the power it self bounded according to the strictest rules of Christ. Let abuses be prevented, reformed, corrected. The abuse cannot take away the use, where the thing it self is necessary. Why might he not have satisfied himself without speaking against the thing it self. Once indeed he seemeth to recool, and faith, <hi>Onely I would have it so bounded, that it might be said, Hitherto shalt thou come, and here shalt thou stay thy proud waves</hi>; yet by and by he passeth his own bounds, and totally renounceth the Government to the civill Power, which I shall speak to anon. But I must first ask, Whence is this fear of the proud swelling waves of Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? where have they done hurt? Was it upon the coast of <hi>France,</hi> or upon the coast of <hi>Holland,</hi> or upon the coast of <hi>Scotland?</hi> or where was it? Or was the dashing upon <hi>Terra in cognita?</hi> He that would forewarn men to beware of Presbyteriall usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (for so the Brother speaking to the present Controversie about Church-Government must be apprehended) and to make good what he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now seeing I have touched upon the Covenant, I wish the Reverend Brother may seriously consider, whether he hath not violated the Oath of God, in advising the Parliament to lay no burden of Government upon Church Officers, but to take the Government of the Church wholly into their own hands. In the first Article of the solemn League and Covenant, there is thrice mention made of the Government of the Church; and namely, That we shall indeavour the Reformation of Religion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47415:21"/>
in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, according to the Word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches. Where observe,
<list>
                  <item>1. The extirpation of Church-Government is not the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. The second Article is indeed of things to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; but this of things to be preserved and reformed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as by the Covenant Prelacy was not to be reformed, but to be abolished: so by the same Covenant Church Government was not to be abolished, but to be reformed.</item>
                  <item>2. Church-Government is mentioned in the Covenant as a Spirituall, not a Civill thing. The matters of Religion are put together; <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament</hi> come after, in the third Article.</item>
                  <item>3. That Clause, <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> implieth, that the Word of God holdeth forth such light unto us, as may guide and direct us in the Reformation of Church-Government.</item>
                  <item>4. And will the Brother say, that the example of the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches leadeth us his way, that is, To have no Church-Government at all distinct from the Civil Government?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And so much concerning his third Rule.</p>
            <p>The fourth was this: <hi>A Christian Magistrate, as a Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, is a Governor in the Church.</hi> And who denieth this? The Question is, Whether there ought to be no other Government in the Church, beside that of the Christian Magistrate. That which he driveth at, is, That the Christian Magistrate should leave no power of Spirituall Censures to the Elderships. He would have the Magistrate to do like the rich man in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who had exceeding many Flocks and Herds, and yet did take away the little ewe-lamb from the poor man, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing save that.

            <p>But now in the close, let the Reverend Brother take heed he hath not split upon a Rock, and taken from the Magistrate more then he hath given him. He saith, Christian Magistrates <hi>are to manage their Office under Christ, and for Christ. Christ hath placed governments in his Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28, &amp;c. <hi>I finde all Government given to Christ, and to Christ as Mediator (I desire all to consider it)</hi> Eph. 1.3. last vers. <hi>and Christ as Head of these given to the Church.</hi> If this be good Divinity, then I am sure it will be the hardest task which ever he took in hand, to uphold and assert the Authority either of Pagan or Christian Magistrates.</p>
            <p>First, he lets the Pagan or Infidel Magistrate fall to the ground, as an Usurper who hath no just title to reign, because all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given to Christ and to him as Mediator: But which way was the Authority of Government derived from Christ, and from him as Mediator, to a Pagan Prince or Emperour?</p>
            <p>Next, he will make it to fare little better with the Christian Magistrate: For if the Christian Magistrate be the Vice-gerent of Christ, and of Christ as Mediator; and if he be to manage his office under and for Christ; then the Reverend Brother must either prove from Scripture, that Christ, as Mediator, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven such a Commission of Vice-gerent-ship and Deputy-ship to the Christian Magistrate; or otherwise acknowledge that he hath given a most dangerous wound to Magistracie, and made it an empty title, claiming that power which it hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to assume.</p>
            <p>God and Nature hath made Magistrates, and given them great Authority: But from Christ as Mediator they have it not.</p>
            <p>I finde in Scripture, that Church-Officers have their power from Christ as Mediator, and they are to manage their Office under and for Christ, and in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ do we assemble our selves together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. in his Name do we preach, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.17, 18. and 5.28.44. and 9.27. In his Name do we baptize, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and 4.12, 16. and 19.5. In his Name do we excommunicate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. But I do not find in Scripture that the Magistrate is to rule, or to make Laws, or to manage any part of his Office in the Name of the Lord Jesus
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47415:22"/>
Christ. And as the Mediator hath not any where given such a Commission and power to the Magistrate: so, as Mediator, he had it not to give: For he was not made a Judge in Civil affairs, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14 and his Kingdom is not of this world, <hi>Job.</hi> 18.36. How can that power which Christ as Mediator hath not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Father, be derived from Christ to the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate? I know that Christ, as he is the eternall Son of God, and <hi>thought it no robbery to be equall with God,</hi> doth with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Ghost reign and rule over all the Kingdoms of the sons of men. He that is Mediator, being God, hath, as God, all power in heaven and earth, (and this power was given to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. both by the eternall Generation, and by the declaration of him to be the Son of God with power, when he was raised from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. even as he said to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, when he was raised again, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. he had relinquished and laid aside his Divine Dominion and Power, when he had made himself in the form of a servant; but after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it's gloriously manifested.) And so he that is Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, hath power to subdue his and his Churches enemies, and to make his foes his footstool.<note place="margin">

               </note> But as Mediator he is onely the Churches King, Head and Governor, and hath no, other Kingdom. The <hi>Phatinians</hi> have defined the Kingly Office of Christ thus. <hi>It is an Office committed to him by God, to govern with the highest authority and power all creatures endued with understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and especially men, and the Church gathered of them.</hi> But those that have written against them have corrected their definition in this particular, because Christ is properly King of his Church onely.</p>
            <p>As for those two Scriptures which the Brother citeth, they are extremely misapplied. He citeth. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, to prove that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47415:23"/>
Christ hath placed Civil Governments in his Church. If by the Governments or Governors there mentioned, be understood the Civil Magistrates; yet that place saith not that Christ hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, but that God hath done it.</p>
            <p>Next, the Apostle speaks of such Governors as the Church had at that time; but at that time the Church had no godly nor Christian Magistrates. This is <hi>Calvins</hi> argument, whereby he proves that Ecclesiasticall, not Civil Governors, are there meant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ask, How can we conceive that Civil Government can come into the Catalogue of Ecclesiastical and Spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations? for such are all the rest there reckoned forth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Brother, after second thoughts, may think he hath done another disservice to the Magistrate, in making the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy to be below and behinde the Ministery. The Apostle puts them in this order: <hi>God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles, then gifts of Healings, Helps, Governments,</hi> &amp;c. How makes the Brother this to agree with his Interpretation?</p>
            <p>Next, he citeth <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22, 33. to prove that all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given to Christ, and to him as Mediator; and Christ, as head of these, given to the Church. But this place maketh more against him then for him: for the Apostle saith not that Christ is given to the Church as the Head of all Principalities and Powers. The Brother saith so; and in saying so, he makes Christ a Head to those that are not of his Body.</p>
            <p>The Apostle saith far otherwise, that God gave Christ <hi>to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body</hi>; which the Syriack readeth more plainly, <hi>And him who is over all, he gave to be the Head to the Church.</hi> He is a Head to none but the Church: but he who is Head to the Church <hi>is over all, God l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sed forever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. yea, even as man, he is over or above all. The very Humane nature of Christ which was raised from the dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set at the right hand of the Majesty of God, is exalted to a higher degree of honour and glory, then either man or Angel ever was, or ever shall be: So that he that is Head of the Church, is over all, because he doth not onely excell his own members, but excell all creatures that ever God made. It is one thing to say that Christ is exalted to a dignity, excellency, preeminence, majesty, and glory, far above all Principality, and Power, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47415:23"/>
Might, and Dominion: Another thing to say that Christ is head of all Principalities and Governments, and as Mediator excerciseth his Kingly Office over these. The Apostle saith the former, but not the latter.</p>
            <p>Shall I need to illustrate this distinction? Is there any thing more known in the world? Will any say, that he who excels other men in dignity, splendor, honour, and glory, must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reign and rule over all those whom he thus excels?</p>
            <p>The Apostle saith indeed, in another sense, that Christ <hi>is the Head of all Principality and Power,</hi> Col. 2.10. But that is spoken of Christ not as he is Mediator, but onely as he is God: And the Apostles meaning in those words is nothing but this; That Christ is true God, saith <hi>Tosanus</hi>; That he is Omnipotent, saith <hi>Gualther</hi>; That he, being the naturall Son of God, is together with the Father Lord of all things, saith <hi>Bullinger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is the meaning, will soon appear:
<list>
                  <item>1. From the scope of the place, which is to teach the <hi>Colossians</hi> not to worship Angels, because they are but servants, and the Son of God is their Lord and Head.</item>
                  <item>2. The Apostle expounds himself, how Christ is the Head of all Principality and power, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. <hi>Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature: For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in the earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore <hi>Beza, Zanchius, Gualther, Bullinger, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssanus,</hi> M. <hi>Bayne,</hi> and divers other Interpreters upon the place, do generally agree, that the Apostle, vers. 15.16, 17, speaks of the dignity and excellency of the Person of Jesus Christ, proving him to be true God; and that vers. 17. he cometh to speak of
his Office, as he is Mediator: <hi>And be is the Head of the Body, the Church,</hi> &amp;c. So that we may distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish a twofold Headship of Jesus Christ. One, in regard of his Godhead; and so he is Head of all Principality and Power: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of his Office of Mediatorship; and so he is Head of the Church onely. The present Question is of the later, not of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47415:24"/>
the former. The former is common to the Son of God, with the Father and the holy Ghost: The latter is proper to Christ God and man. The former shall continue for ever: The latter shall not continue for ever. The former doth not necessarily suppose the latter; but the latter doth necessarily suppose the former. Christ can reign as God, though he reign not as Mediator; but he cannot reign as Mediator, and not reign as God. The object of the former is every creature: the object of the latter is the Church gathered out of the world.</item>

            </p>
            <p>This digression concerning the Headship of Jesus Christ, may for the future prevent divers Objections. So I shall return.</p>
            <p>And now (I desire all to consider it) there is not one word in those three last verses of <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">P.

               </note> which will give any ground for that which the Brother with so much confidence averreth. Vers. 21. affordeth this Argument against him. The Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Jesus Christ there spoken of, hath place <hi>not onely in this world, but in that which is to come.</hi> But the Kingdom and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is given to Christ as Mediator, shall not continue in the world to come (for when Christ hath put
his enemies under his feet, he shal deliver up the Kingdom to the Father, and reign no longer as Mediator, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25.) Therefore the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to Christ, as he is Mediator, cannot be meant in that place, but the dignifying, honouring, preferring and exalting of Christ, to a higher degree of glory then either man or Angel.</p>
            <p>Come on now, and see whether vers. 22. maketh any whit more for him; <hi>He hath put all things under his feet</hi>; that is, saith <hi>Zanchius,</hi> all things but the Church, which is his Body. But this must be meant in respect of the Decree and foreknowledge of God, as <hi>Hierome</hi> expounds the place; and so doth the Scripture expound it self, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. <hi>But now we see not yet all things put under him.</hi> 1.15.25. <hi>He must reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</hi> Acts 2.34, 35 <hi>Sit thou on my right hand till I make thy foes thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool.</hi> Now when Christ shall have put down all Rule, and all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power, and shall put his enemies under his feet; then he shall cease to reign any more as Mediator (which I have even now proved:) But before that be done, he reigns as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. So that it can never be proved, that the meaning of these words, <hi>He hath put all things under his feet,</hi> is, That all Government in this world is given to Christ as Mediator: And whoever saith
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47415:24"/>
so, must needs acknowledge, that Christs exercising of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as he is Mediator) over all Principalities and Powers, shall continue after all things shall be put under his feet; Or that Christ shall not govern as Mediator, till all things be put under his feet; which is so contrary to the Apostles meaning, that Christ shall then cease to reign as Mediator.</p>
            <p>The next words, <hi>And he gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church,</hi> do furnish another Argument against him. Christs Headship and his Government as Mediator, are commensurable, and of an equall extent. Christ is a Head to none but to his Church: Therfore no Government is given to him as Mediator, but the Government of his Church.</p>
            <p>The last verse doth further confirm that which I say: For the Apostle continuing his speech of the Church, saith, <hi>Which is his Body, the fulnesse of him that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lleth all in all.</hi> He cals the Church Christ fulnesse, in reference to his Headship, that which makes him full and compleat so far as he is a Head or King: Having his Church fully gathered, he hath his compleat Kingdom, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Body; and this being done, he wants nothing, so far as he is Mediator. So that the holy Ghost doth here as it were on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose anticipate this Opinion, lest any should think all C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>l Government is given to Christ as Mediator. Though, as God, he filleth heaven and earth; yet, as Mediator, his filling of all in all extends no further then his Body, his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called his fulnesse.</p>
            <p>Finally, to avoid the mistake of this place, and upon the whole matter; let these three things be well distinguished, in the Mediator Jesus Christ. 1. His <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> his eminence and highnesse in respect of the glory and majesty he is exalted to, far above whatsoever is highest among all the creatures. 2. His <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the power, by which he can, and doth by degrees, and will more and more subdue his and his Churches enemies, and dash them in pieces like a potters vessel, and break them with a rod of Iron. 3. His <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his Kingly Power, by which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth acts of Government. These three are distinguished in an earthly King, the first two being of a larger extent then the third. The conclusion of that prayer which our Lord taught his disciples, doth distinguish the same three in God. <hi>Thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the power, and the glory.</hi> Now these being distinguished
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47415:25"/>
in the Mediator Jesus Christ, I conclude with these three distinct Assertions (the truth whereof I hope I have made to appear.) 1. As Mediator, he is exalted and dignified above all creatures, and his glory is above all the earth. 2. As Mediator, he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth acts of divine power and omnipotency over all creatures, in the behalf of, and for the good of his Church, and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or diverteth, or destroyeth all his Churches enemies. 3. As Mediator, he is King, Head, and Governour to none but his Church: Neither was all Government put in his hand, but the Government of the Church onely.</p>
            <p>I could enlarge my self further against that most dangerous Principle, <hi>That all Government, even that which is Civil, is given to Christ, and to him as Mediator.</hi> But let these things suffice for the present. The Reverend Brothers opinion will finde better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment among the Jews, who expect a Temporall Monarchy of the Messiah; and among Papists, who desire to uphold the Popes Temporall Authority over Kings, as Christs Vicegerent upon earth.</p>
