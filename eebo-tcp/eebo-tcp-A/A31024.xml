            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Muſt beg your juſtification of this pedant and <hi>Common-place</hi> Apology, wherewith I am oblig'd to Preface my ſelf to the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> that you not only earnestly requeſted, but even forc'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from me of putting this diſcourſe in Print, which I mention not ſo much in acknowledgment of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved reſpect you were pleas'd to ſhew me, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſhould be the worſt of men not to own ſo great an obligation) nor to beg your protection againſt the malice and calumnies of the many inveterate Factions, (for I know 'tis more than you can do for your ſelves.) But to declare the averſion I have ever
<pb facs="tcp:51787:3"/>
had to appear in this kind, with the loſs of that freedom I have formerly taken in cenſuring other mens too great forwardneſs herein? for I ever commiſerated the poor burthen'd Preſs, and amongſt Friends, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reflected upon our many ſelf-admiring Authors, with thoſe little tricks and Artifices, which of my knowledge are uſed to get abroad by publick order, or eſpecial command; Beſides, as I was engag'd to ſerve Mr. High-Sheriff in this way of my profeſſion (as you Sir can teſtify) before this laſt <hi>Helliſh Conſpiracy</hi> was diſcover<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:51787:3"/>
of a better opportunity to cut the throat, whilſt that malicious monkiſh wit upon the great <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Heaven and Hell, may be apply'd to many of our <hi>Wiſe Diſcreet Men,</hi> who take care to keep themſelves equally pois'd between <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi>; Had the Deſign indeed newly drop'd out of the Clouds, from the Prince of the Air, or been ſome antiquated project of <hi>Machiavel</hi> or <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> a ſober well meaning intention might have been impos'd upon by thoſe many fair Gloſses which are never wanting upon ſuch occaſions, but when 'tis one continued Scene of villany carry'd on for Forty (I may ſay for Fourſcore) years together, and now begun to be acted over again by many of the ſame perſons, all upon the ſame principles; nay, ſo dull is their invention, by the ſame method too, by the ſame improbable Stories, falſe ſuggeſtions, and moſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous reproaches upon all men that ſtand up for Peace and Truth, Religion or Loyalty; How can any man of ſence debauch his Reaſon or Charity ſo far, as to believe that ſuch Vipers have all on a ſuddain loſt their Stings, or that they will not naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Generation of the ſame kind? especially when we find them equally impenitent for the miſchiefs they have formerly done, and partial in their preſent Judgment and repreſentation of things; Thus the
<pb facs="tcp:51787:4"/>
               <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> was a <hi>Helliſh Bloody Plot,</hi> but the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>January's</hi> Parricide muſt not be call'd to remembrance; the Court muſt be arraign'd of <hi>Arbitrary Deſigns,</hi> but not one ſingle Member ſuſpected of <hi>Commonwealthiſm</hi>; and therefore whilſt our <hi>Demagogues</hi> were in being to defend the eſtabliſh'd Church was nothing leſs than <hi>Popery</hi>; and to compare <hi>Eighty</hi> with <hi>Forty One,</hi> the direct way into <hi>T—ms</hi> Inquiſition, as if no man living could remember the Arbitrary arrogance of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican Junto</hi> with our twenty years Captivity under a Rebel Sword: or to ſpeak of our Religious concerns, as if <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> and <hi>John Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> had not both ſet up about the ſame time, or our poor Church and Nation ſuffer'd as much from the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this Gentlemen, as well as in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, I preſent you with nothing but your own thoughts, which as they are much better expreſs'd in your <hi>Loyal Addreſs</hi> to His Majeſty, ſo do you ſtill more effectually declare them in a continued ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vigour for His Service and Preſervation.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:51787:4"/>
it no mean part of my happineſs that He and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath fix'd me amongſt a company of worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who will ſet a value upon a man, though be hath nothing more to recommend him than an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Zeal for the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State, King</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> but ſo good a Principle will buoy up any ordinary parts, and alone enable its votaries to laugh at, and defie, the froppiſhneſs and falſhood of a <hi>gain-ſaying diſobedient People,</hi> whom I ſhould not deſpair ſhortly to ſee of another temper; had you Gentlemen the ſame influence upon our little <hi>Commonwealth Corporations,</hi> as you have upon the out-lying Factions: But ſince it is the will of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that theſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> ſhould be continued in the Land, doubtleſs it will now on all hands be thought requiſite to have ſuch an eye upon them, that it may not be in their power to quench the light of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or diſturb the Peace of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if by this means we can at laſt be throughly awakened into a ſence of danger, it will be ſuch light out of darkneſs, ſuch an unexpected good from ſo Helliſh an intended Evil, as thoſe malevolent Spirits whom the diſappointments cannot convert, the envy muſt neceſsarily confound, whilſt our repeated deliverances having wearied the malice of their

            <p>THere is ſuch a mutual correſpondence between our publick and private wel-fare, every mans perticular intereſt ſo unavoidably depends upon the common good, that our firſt thoughts may probably ſuggeſt, that Univerſal principle of Self-Preſervation ſhould equally concern us for both: But upon more exact conſideration, we ſhall find Man in his ſingle capacity is center'd only upon himſelf without any different Parties, any contrary Votes to Retard or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him; and will naturally make that the ultimate end of all his undertakings, whatever other obligations may lie upon him from the dictates of right reaſon, or the compacts of humane ſociety engage him unto: whereas the Body Politick is ſo artificial a piece, made up of ſo many different Tempers and Conſtitutions, Humours, Intereſts, and Deſigns, that, like other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Compoſitions, every unhappy jog, every rough hand, or foul breath, is liable to diſorder, if not quite deſtroy it. And next to the all-diſpoſing Providence of Heaven, I cannot aſſign any other cauſe but this, of thoſe many Revolutions which have ſo frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the World, that the whole Earth ſhould ever

ſince the Creation, have been as it were an <hi>Akeldama</hi>; and the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of all Ages, and Places too, contain little elſe than ſo many Records of Blood and Slaughter, Deſolation and Ruine: whilſt Goverment becomes more mortal than the Members whereof it conſiſts; not an Age doth paſs without many ſignal Revolutions, and fatal Cataſtrophes. Nay, that the ſame Miſchiefs do not happen every day, is not for want of evil Spirits to foment and raiſe them up; but from the prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of ſome more Peaceable diſpoſitions, who by the aſſiſtance of that Divine Power <note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Here are the Parties concern'd, their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Profeſſion, Demetrius <hi>and the Craftſmen</hi>; what theſe <hi>Shrines</hi> were which caus'd all this ſtir, would be too tedious a digreſſion critically to relate: In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, 'tis concluded they were little Cabinets or Chaplets of Silver, with the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> in them; which every man was at liberty to purchace for the uſe of his private Superſtition, Devotion I cannot call it; ſo that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Artificers was much like that of the <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and other ſuch like Trinket-makers in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; had therefore St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine been agreeable to that of St. <hi>Peters</hi> prerended Succeſſor now there, in all probability theſe <hi>Craftſmen</hi> would have been as Zealous for the change, as they were violent againſt any alteration, ſince for every <hi>Shrine,</hi> they might have been imploy'd to make ten times as many <hi>Saints.</hi> But our Apoſtles Commiſſion was quite otherwiſe, to call upon, <note place="margin">

               <hi>and exhort all men every where to repent,</hi> and particularly to <hi>turn from thoſe dumb Idols unto the living God</hi>; And this the Devil knew very well, which made him take occaſion from theſe mens avarice, to ſuppreſs (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the further progreſs of thoſe glorious Truths, which would totally ſubvert his Kingdom of Darkneſs, and ſome probability there was of an expected ſucceſs; for when that evil Spirit enters into a multitude, <hi>its name is Legion</hi> to purpoſe, when <hi>Faction</hi> comes once to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated,</hi> and the ſeveral male-contents dare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Aſſociations</hi>; when every rude <hi>Mechanick</hi> will preſume to cenſure Affairs of State, and admire none

            <p n="2">2. Secondly, We are to conſider the matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, the pretended grievance, or accuſation, which is here ſuppos'd by the <hi>Town-Clerk</hi>; but fully enlarg'd upon in <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Seditious Rethorick at the 27<hi>th. Verſe, By St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Preaching that they be no Gods which are made with hands, not only their Craft was in danger to be ſet at nought, but their Temple and great Godeſs deſpis'd</hi>; The Schools tell us of a <hi>cauſa latens</hi> and <hi>cauſa patens,</hi> one thing pretended, when another occaſioned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and here we find a doubie Inducement urg'd by our Appron'd Orator, <hi>Great was</hi> Diana, <hi>but greater were her</hi> Shrines. Religion might have ſome influence, but Intereſt much more; had they not by this Craft got their wealth, ſo cold would have been their Zeal, that her Altars might have frozen. <hi>Innovations in Religion,</hi> were indeed by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> themſelves, look'd upon as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and the great <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Favorite told him, <hi>There were no perſons he ought to be ſo ſevere upon, as they that introduc'd a Worſhip contrary to the eſtabliſh'd Laws</hi>; which was the reaſon doubtleſs, that Chriſtianity met with ſo much oppoſition, and notwithſtanding its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſuperlative excellencies, was ſo long before the Civil Power gave it countenance: but whatſoever is done, either upon this, or any other account, ſuppoſeth a due procedure, a regular courſe of Juſtice, without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo Sacred a matter to the Arbitrage of the Rabble, the <hi>Pious Whimſies,</hi> not to ſay <hi>Religious Cheats,</hi> of ſelf

deſigning men; yet, make the Obſervatton where you pleaſe, even amongſt the demureſt Profeſſors of our moſt holy Religion, and all pretences of this kind will be found no better, when it comes once under a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reformation, 'tis made a ſtalking horſe to the vileſt enterprizes, where every man wears the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, proportions his Devotion to the Intreague he has on foot: So far as it anſwers their Ambition, ſatisfies their Avarice, gratifies their Revenge, promotes a Party, or carries on a Deſign, with <hi>Jehu</hi> none ſhall be more ready to expreſs their Zeal, altho' in ſo prepoſterous a mannar, as half an eye may diſcover, they that bawl lowdeſt on its behalf, reſolve to ſtifle it in the noiſe; Fight for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence till 'tis ſmothered in the Blood they ſpill. Thus I ſay it has been always found, but more eſpecially of late; he that is of a <hi>Godly Party,</hi> ſhall in ſpight of the deepeſt guilt, <hi>be a Godlyman,</hi> ſo meritorious a thing with ſome it is to be <hi>Factious,</hi> that it aſſumes the place of <hi>Charity, and covers a multitude of Sins</hi>; in the mean while, can we imagine any thing ſhould more highly provoke the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven, then to ſee ſuch Pearls trodden under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot by Swine, that Prayer, which was deſign'd to open the Gates of Heaven, ſhould <hi>devour Widows Houſes,</hi> and all other his moſt Sacred Ordinances, inſtead of purchaſing an Eternal Inheritance, be proſtituted to the Luſts, the Humours, and Intereſts of <hi>Hypocrites, Atheiſts,</hi> and ſuch like unreaſonable men?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, We are to conſider their manner of redreſs, which is here tacitly reflected upon, both as unjuſt, and dangerous. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Unjuſt, That they who were a Party, ſhould preſume to Judge, give Sentence, and be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners too themſelves; an Infallible ſign of a bad Cauſe, and worſe intention, by not appealing to the Law
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51787:8"/>
for right, it was abundantly evident they deſign'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers no little wrong. But then 2<hi>dly.</hi> this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was not more unjuſt, than dangerous; for ſo it is declared at the 40 <hi>verſe, We are in danger to be call'd in queſtion for this days uproar,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> were a Wiſe and Generous, but withall a Jealous Nation, as they indulg'd their conqueſts with more liberty than could be many times expected; ſo when it appear'd that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not be contain'd within thoſe juſt and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable bounds they knew well enough how to take up the Rains, to tame the exorbitancy of ſuch unmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirits. And indeed not only they, but any other Civilis'd Nation muſt look upon ſuch proceedings as of dangerous conſequence, to ſtrike at the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goverment, and as far as in them lies, bring all things back to a ſtate of Nature, or rather a <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſion. Yet this principle, ſo generally exploded by all ſober Heathens, we have found not only put in practice, but alſo juſtifi'd, by ſome <hi>Chriſtian Libertines</hi> of our preſent Age, who will aſſume to themſelves a power of controlling any Goverment, either in <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> upon a two-fold account, the one Temporal, the other Spiritual; The Right of the People, and the Juriſdiction of Conſcience; two worthy Topicks, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; and falſe, as they are popular; But becauſe of their Popularity, it will be requiſite to take notice of their impertinency. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. Second Plea, the <hi>Juriſdiction of Conſcience:</hi> We find here at the 31<hi>ſt. verſe,</hi> amongſt this Rabble of <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oters,</hi> ſome cry'd one thing, ſome another, (for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was confus'd) without knowing wherefore they came together, or what they would be at; and juſt ſuch a Stale is <hi>Conſcience</hi> made to all the humourſom <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricio's</hi> of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi>; every perverſe Will; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private Fancy, and perticular Opinion; every cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Scruple, ſlight Perſwaſion, or groundleſs Fear, is cry'd up for the Great <hi>Diana</hi> of Conſcience; and they that dare to contradict or oppoſe it, muſt expect St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Fate here at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and provide to fight with Beaſts in the ſhape of men. Neither will time permit, nor the ſubject oblige me exactly to ſtate the caſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall only obſerve in general, That Conſcience in Spiritual, in Religious Concerns, is the ſame with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Temporal Affairs, and conſiſts in a ſound and well grounded apprehenſion of things; which too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons having not patience to attend to, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to enquire after, take up with every pious whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, every ſtrong deluſion, or prejudiciate opinion, and obtrude them upon the world under this ſpecious title of <hi>Conſcience</hi>; whereas, alas! they are but ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the mind, and thoſe dangerous enough; a kind of ſpiritual Spleen, which as it ſeldom kills, ſo is it rarely cur'd but continually renders the parties which it affects uneaſie to themſelves, and all they converſe with.

            <p>Thus with promis'd brevity have I run over the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of my Text. There remains now the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateon,</hi> which, ſhould I bring it wholly to the occaſion of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51787:12"/>
your preſent Aſſembling, would be found both appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and natural; for as the buſineſs is more eſpecially <hi>matters of impleading,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Law open,</hi> and <hi>here are the Reverend Deputies,</hi> of whoſe Candor and Integrity you have already had, and will now find the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory experience. But to avoid the nauceouſneſs of perſonal addreſſes, or commendations, and all pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intermedlings with what belongs to a diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; my application ſhall relate to our more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concern, as we are men, and as we are Chriſtians, as we are ſubject to Laws, and as our well-being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the due execution of thoſe Laws unto which we are Subject; To this purpoſe I ſhall crave leave to raiſe two or three Inferences from what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcours'd, and ſo put an end to any further exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of your Patience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Then the 1<hi>ſt. thing I infer, is the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the temper of primitive Christanity, and that of our Religious pretenders in theſe later Ages:</hi> For doubtleſs could <hi>Demetrius</hi> have promiſed himſelf any advantage from the Law, he would never have taken ſo illegal a courſe; Nay the Town-clerk, in the precedent <hi>verſe,</hi> wholly acquits St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, from <hi>Blaſpheming their Goddeſs</hi> (although we may well believe they ſufficiently abhor'd that Helliſh Idolatry) or any other rude deportment, which might give occaſion of offence to men of ſence and civility. A commiſſion indeed they had received from the King of Heaven, and it concern'd them to be exact in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof; But then his inſtructions as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were as carefully to be obſerv'd, which confin'd them to ſtrength of Argument, and allegations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; with Modeſty of Behaviour, Meekneſs, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51787:13"/>
Charity, to repreſent thoſe errours under which the World then lay, <hi>aſſert the Truth, convert misbelievers, and, in a word, bring them all to the knowledge of the only true God:</hi> This was the method they took; Theſe were the weapons which ſubdu'd Kingdoms, made the Croſs of Chriſt the <hi>Romans</hi> Standard, and his Goſpel the joy of the whole Earth: There was no <hi>oppoſing Magistracy,</hi> no <hi>fighting the Lord's Battle against Carnal Powers,</hi> no <hi>Holy Leagues,</hi> no <hi>Covenants,</hi> nor <hi>Aſſociations</hi>; Theſe are the ſpurious Doctrines and Practices of our modern Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, who have fought for Religion till 'tis almoſt baniſh'd <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and made their many zealous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings but one continued <hi>Mystery of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly. The ſecond thing I infer, is, the opinion which all ſober Heathens had of <hi>Tumultuous Aſſemblies,</hi> and <hi>Riotous Reformations</hi>; common obſervation inform'd them, that if it comes to a <hi>hanc populus,</hi> if the people may alter the Goverment, as the Painter once for a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al let them do his Picture, it will prove ſuch a Monſter at laſt, as every wiſe man with reaſon may be afrighted at. Affairs were ſome time at this paſs in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, <hi>Judges</hi> 17.6. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but every man did that which was right in his own eyes,</hi> Yet, as the conſequent thereof, the Spirit of God records a number of ſuch hainous Enormities, and groſs Violations, as are ſcarce to be parallell'd in any Hiſtory, Sacred or Prophane. And a wiſe <hi>Roman</hi> reflecting upon the like Practices in his own time, lays down this as an experienced Truth, <hi>It was better to live where Nothing, than where All things were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> And, as was partly obſerved before, what have not we ſeen, nay felt, from the extravagant heats of ſuch popular deluſions! and how are we daily threatned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51787:13"/>
with Arrows from the ſame Quiver, the continu'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms of an unquiet Generation, whom as too ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teſtifies, no kindneſs could ever oblige, nor any condeſcention ſatisfy. It ſeems ſo ſtrange a fatality hangs over ſome mens heads, or rather about their Necks, that having more than once eſcap'd their due reward, by a too much abus'd Indemnity; they ſtill continue to run willfully into the ſame nooſe, and even force Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to do them reaſon at laſt.</p>
            <p>Nay, further our condition was for ſo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now, what is this, but for our Phyſicians to become our Diſeaſe? they that ſhould preſerve the <hi>juſt rights</hi> of a well order'd State, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo little to hold the Rains, that had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd much longer in the Seat, <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf could not have repair'd the ruines ſo dreadful a conflagration would have made. <hi>Inter utrum<expan>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> My third and laſt Inference is, <hi>That nothing preſerves the Peace and welfare of mankind, ſo much as a regular obedience unto Laws, and a due execution of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51787:14"/>
them, upon ſuch as will not yield obedience:</hi> Which St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes the two main branches of every Magiſtrates Duty, and for the greater encouragement, aſſures them of a Divine Commiſſion, being ſent from God for the <hi>puniſhment of evil-doers</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>praiſe of them that do well on the other,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.14. <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power,</hi>

True freedom never appears ſo graceful as when it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands its duty, regularly moves in its proper ſphere as providence and Authority hath order'd. But for ſome to diſpute whether they ſhall obey or not, and others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute whether they ſhall not let them alone, is to ſuffer the Ship both of Church and State to drive at the mercy of wind and Tide, whilſt neither <hi>Pilot</hi> nor <hi>Mariners</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their buſineſs. 'Tis what the Spirit of God ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflects upon in a <hi>Heathen</hi> Magiſtrate, and therefore ſtrange if we have any <hi>Gallios</hi> under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, who can ſee the groſſeſt violations before their eyes,and yet <note place="margin">
