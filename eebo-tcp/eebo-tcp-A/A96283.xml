            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a common Proverb: <hi>Dogs bark more

had I not aſſuredly known this <hi>Whelp Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
to be one of that bawling Litter; I ſhould
not have ſuffered his perpetuall ſnarling with
that Patience and temper I did: but before
this, would have alighted from my Saddle, to
hurle him one ſtone (at the least) to gnaw
on. But, as hee is now growne bolder, and
blacker in the jawes; I muſt begin to have
an eye over him, and a care to keepe him at a

thereby I become maniaque, or Brain-ſicke

notice of his former Grinnings; nor will I

of his by-paſt Fooleries, frantique

            <p>I Will not trouble my ſelfe, or the

by whom (as he pretendeth) hee found
himſelfe intollerably abuſed in Print, and
could doe no leſſe, then vindicate himſelfe
in point of Art,</p>
            <p>As for the Name, <hi>Naworth,</hi> which <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Lilly,</hi> and <hi>John Booker</hi> (to make their
Worſhips merry) have ſo often, and as
wiſely, as wittily, inverted to <hi>No-worth,</hi> and
<hi>Worth-nothing:</hi> it is well knowne, to be the
Letters of my name long ſince tranſpoſed,
purpoſely to avoid the Scandall and oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy,
which both theſe Mounte-banks ſo
greatly delight in, and indeavour ſo much
to aſſume. For, whereas I obſerved, the
Common people generally poſſeſſed of a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118846:4"/>
confident beliefe, or rather a fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
that ſuch as could write Almanacks,
were eſteemed (with a Country-reverence)
Wiſe-men (like <hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker</hi>) or (if
I ſhall render it in their owne Dialect)
Conjurers, or ſuch as can tell all things,
paſt, preſent, and to come: And ſo were
uſually haunted (by the ſilly people) with
a number of unlawfull, unneceſſary, and
ridiculous queſtions by meanes whereof,
many ingenious and honeſt Artiſts, have
not only been branded with the titles of
Conjurers, Necromancers, Wizards, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
and Figure-Caſters (in the worſt
ſenſe) but have often been impriſoned, and
Indicted and proceeded againſt upon the
Statute, againſt Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hardly
eſcaped with their lives, (eſpecially when
they came before Judges, that were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in, or diſaffected to <hi>Aſtrology</hi>) after
they had ſuffered ſeverall yeares impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thereby waſted and conſumed
their eſtates: I ſay, that I having reſolved to
write yearly, which was not uſuall without
prefixing a name; (nor for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned,
would I then publiſh any
thing of that nature, in my owne name:)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118846:4"/>
I therefore Anagramatiz'd my name to
<hi>Naworth,</hi> and by that Name I writ an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack
for ſeverall yeares together, and
continued unknowne, unleſſe to ſome two
or three of my friends; whereby I ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prevented the before-named inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
and hazards, which otherwiſe I
ſhould inevitably have ſhared of: And I
preſume that in doing this, I neither
wrong'd my ſelfe, nor abuſed the Countrie
where I lived: And what ever other witty
conſtruction may be made thereof, by theſe
two trifling Gypſies; by this they may
perceive, I tooke no delight (as they doe) to
be tearm'd a Conjurer, a Magician, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſt,
a <hi>Merline,</hi> a trucking Mercury, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe, whereby they deſire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
ſo much to promote, and propagate
their deceitful &amp; unwarrantable dealings.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Lilly,</hi> in the ſame Preface,
chargeth me under the ſame name to have
wreſted many falſe judgements from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie,
againſt the Parliaments actions,
intending thereby to prepoſſeſſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with a vaine feare, that his Majeſtie
and his deſignes ſhould take place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
muſt tell him, that this his Accuſation, is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118846:5"/>
moſt maliciouſly falſe: And let him ſhew
me (if he can) but one Aphoriſme, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that ever I delivered, for which I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quoted not my Authors, or gave a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reaſon in Aſtrology: or that ever
(of which I ſhall hereafter prove him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
guiltie) I wreſted any part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology
from the Genuine ſence thereof,
either to make for his Majeſtie, or againſt
the Parliament? And if it hath pleaſed
God, to ſuffer the loyall party thus to bee
trampled over, it is for their ſinns: and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with it a ſupernaturall Cauſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
above the ſtars, which could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by the cleareſt mortall eye. No
Symtome of ſuch (our ſufferings, could be
read, or obſerved by any man in the great
Booke of Heaven; but rather the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as I could inſtance for many reaſons
in Aſtrology: And whatſoever I ſpoke, or
writ, was (as your owne ſence implyes) ever
with ſubmiſſion to divine Providence.</p>
            <p>But I will not buſie my ſelfe ſo much, as
to examine and retort every Tatter of his
ragged-Preface: nor ſhall I need to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his Majeſties Officers, (whom hee is
therein pleaſed to tearme <hi>Ravenous</hi>) from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118846:5"/>
his polluted lips: I ſee no reaſon why they
may not meet with a fitter occaſion and
opportunitie to requite him: but the thing
I have propoſed to my ſelfe, is firſt, to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
the poore Quack in point of <hi>Art,</hi> and
afterwards in matter of <hi>Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing, and indeed the only
thing that's worth my obſervation is, his
Tranſcript of <hi>Eichſtadius</hi> his Ephemerides,
for the year 1647. wherein (indeed) he hath
taken a great deale of paines, and deſerves
to be commended for this indifatigable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
but withall, I muſt tell him, that hee
hath therein greatly betrayed his owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in Aſtronomy, or ſhewed himſelfe
exceedingly negligent and careleſſe, in that
he hath not fitted the places of the Sunne,
<hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> (but eſpecially the
Moone,) to the Meridian of <hi>London,</hi> as he
hath done (to his thinking) in the Lunati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and aſpects of the Planets, nor (which
had been more eaſie, and ſooner done) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
any Rule, or Direction, whereby to
ſupputate their true places for that Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
or any other place of the Kingdome:
And this Error hee hath beene guilty of
throughout the two former yeares: whereby
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118846:6"/>
our young Tyro's are much deceived in the
<hi>Merline,</hi> when they thinke they have the
places of thoſe Planets therein exactly
Calculated to the Noone-tide of every day
at <hi>London:</hi> for, although in the higher Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
whoſe motion is but ſlow, there bee
no ſenſible difference: yet, in the Sun, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and <hi>Mercury,</hi> there is an apparent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
For, when they are in their ſwift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
their places at noone, as <hi>Lilly</hi> hath ſet
them, will differ above 2. min. and often
3. min. from the truth: And in the Moone
(whoſe motion is farre ſwifter then any
other of the Planets) her Error is intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
(eſpecially when ſhe is in her ſwift
motion.) For example: the firſt of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
1647. the Diurnall motion of the Moon
is 12. degr. 24 min. (being then but in her
ſlow motion.) The difference of Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
betwixt <hi>London</hi> &amp; <hi>Uraniburge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to which
place the Longitude of the Planets, (as <hi>Wil.
Lilly</hi> hath printed them) were Calculated
by <hi>Eichſtadius,</hi>) is 50 minutes, (by his own
confeſſion in his <hi>Anglicus 1645. Page</hi> 54.)
that is, the Sun co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth later to the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
at <hi>London,</hi> then he does at <hi>Uraniburge,</hi> by
50 min. of time; ſo that how much ſoever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118846:6"/>
the Moon moveth (according to longitude)
in that ſpace of time? by ſo much hath <hi>Lilly</hi>
erred in the Moones true place at noon, for
every day in the yeare: which, what it is for
the ſaid firſt of <hi>January;</hi> I examine thus:</p>
            <p>If the Moone in 24 houres, move 12 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
24 minutes in Longitude,
What moves ſhe in 50 min. of time?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facit 26. min. ferè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by ſo much hath <hi>Lilly</hi> erred from her
true place the ſaid firſt of <hi>January</hi> at Noon:
So that whereas he hath placed her that day
in 21 degrees, 10 min. of Piſces, ſhe ought
to have beene in 21 degrees 36 min. of the
ſame Signe.</p>
            <p>And when ſhe is in her ſwift motion, he
commits a greater Errour: as the tenth of
<hi>March</hi> 1647. (if you examine it according
to the former rule) you ſhall find juſt halfe
a degree (or 30 min.) error; and in ſtead
of 26 degrees, 3 min. of Virgo, (wherein
<hi>Lilly</hi> hath put her that day) ſhe ſhould be
in 26. degree 33 min. of the ſame Signe.</p>
            <p>The next thing which I meane to take
notice of, is, his Scheme erected to the
Apparent time of the Moons Ecclipſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tenth of <hi>January</hi> 1647. at 9. houres
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118846:7"/>
and 19 min. <hi>P. M.</hi> as he hath taken it from
<hi>Eichſtadius,</hi> by deducting 50 min. for the
difference of Meridians betwixt <hi>London</hi>
and <hi>Uraniburge:</hi> and to the ſame time I
erect the Figure of Heaven, according to
the Doctrine of <hi>Regiomontanus;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
his printed Scheme with that, which
I had more curiouſly ſet, I find <hi>Lilly</hi> ſtill
bungling and botching, but without any
reſult of truth: For, whereas he hath made
the Cuſpe of the tenth Houſe 22. degrees
20 min. of Gemini, according to exact
Calculation, it is no leſſe then 23. degr. 30
minutes, whereby it appeares, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Lilly</hi> hath miſtaken 1 degree, &amp; 10 mi.
in the Cuſpe of the <hi>Medium Coeli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Aſcendent of the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
he hath miſtaken above one whole
degree, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 degr. 10 min. for hee hath
made the Cuſpe thereof but 23 deg. and
51 min. of Virgo, which ſhould have been
25 degrees, and 1 min. and the like Errors
follow in the ſeventh houſe of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
and proportionably in all the reſt,
which makes me wonder with what face
this ſenſleſſe botcher dares tearme me an
<hi>A. B. C.</hi> fellow, when all men may perceive
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118846:7"/>
him ſo ſhamefully ignorant in the very
fundamentalls of the Art hee pretends to,
and that I am able to correct him in every
point and particle of his Profeſſion: For, I
deſire the Reader to conſider but thus
much with me, that if (as Sir <hi>Chriſtopher
Heydon</hi> hath ſaid, in his unparalell'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
written in defence of Judiciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
againſt Mr. Chambers) that Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
is an Art which teacheth by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Configurations, and influences of
the Signes, Stars, and Coeleſtiall Planets
to Prognoſticate of the naturall effects, and
mutations to come in the Elements, and
theſe inferiour and elementary bodies:
How (I pray) is it poſſible, that this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
can Prognoſticate rightly of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
effects and Mutations to come in the
Elements, and theſe inferiour and elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
bodies, before he be able to Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
exactly the true motions and configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Signes, Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
which you clearly ſee, he is not? And
I marvell much that <hi>Lilly</hi> ſhould bee no
more tender and cautilous of his credit,
then thus fooliſhly and frequently to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
his unskilfulneſſe: for me thinkes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118846:8"/>
as he knowes that he cannot Calculate the
houſes exactly, either by the Doctrine of
Sphericall Triangles, or (which is more
ready, and built upon the ſame foundation)
by the Tables of Directions in <hi>Regiomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>)
to the degree and minute of each
Cuſpe, yet he ſhould have held it a ſafer
way (if he purpoſed to palliate his defects)
to have ſet down the Cuſpes only in whole
degrees, and not have publiſhed himſelfe
thus erroneouſly ſcrupulous, which hee
might have done very eaſily, by the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
tables, without further helpe. But I
perceive him ſo impudent, and ſhameleſſe,
that he neither heeds, nor cares what hee
does, or otherwiſe hee would have beene
more wary in ſupputating the places of the
Planets: For (according to <hi>Eichſtadius,</hi>
whom he indeavours to follow) the Sun
(at the middle of the Eclipſe) ſhould have
been in 56 minutes of Aquarius, and the
Moone in 56. min. of the Oppoſite Signe
Leo, <hi>Venus</hi> in Capricorne, 24 degr. 29 min.
and <hi>Mercury</hi> in Aquarius, 3 degr. 17 min.
But this man's diſcretion hath put the Sun
in 53 min. of Aquarius, and the Moone in
53 min. of <hi>Leo, Venus</hi> in 24 degr. 39 min.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118846:8"/>
of Capricorne, and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the 3 degr.
20 min. of Aquarius; So that he hath erred
3 min. in the places of the Luminaries, and
<hi>Mercury;</hi> and 10 min. in <hi>Venus,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to every man, that will take the pains
to Calculate the true places of theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
by <hi>Eichſtadius</hi> his Tables, to the Mean,
or Equall time of the ſaid Eclipſe.</p>
            <p>And in like manner, hath he playd the
Botcher in his Figure at the Vernall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe:
for according to the time therein
poſited, the Cuſpe of the tenth Houſe
ought to be 13 degr. 44 min. of Taurus, and
the Aſcendent 25 degr. 48 min. of Leo,
yet he hath made the tenth Houſe 14 degr.
0. min. of Taurus, and the Aſcendent 26
degr. 0. min. of Leo: ſo that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
16 min. Error in the Cuſpe of the
tenth Houſe, and 12 min. in the Cuſpe of
the Aſcendent, nor is hee leſſe erronious
in collocating of the Planets here, then in
the former Figure, but eſpecially in the
Moone, whom he hath placed in 27 degree
48. min. of Virgo, whereas ſhe ought to
have bin in 28 degr. 14 min. of that Signe,
wherein hee hath miſtaken no leſſe then
26 minutes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118846:9"/>
And thus much I conceive ſufficient to
prove his ignorance, in point of Art: Now
will I alſo unmaske his Errors, defects,
miſtakes, and miſ-applications in matter
of judgement.</p>
            <p>I will not meddle with, or queſtion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what grounds Prince <hi>Charles</hi> left his
Native. Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> nor who
were the original cauſers of this his ſo long
abſence; It is ſufficient that <hi>Will. Lilly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
him to bee <hi>Enforc'd upon neceſſitie,
exiled, or baniſhed,</hi> for the honour of the
Engliſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>I will not enquire further, then of the
Scottiſh Papers, whether the King be at
preſent reſtrained of his Libertie, as <hi>Lilly</hi>
tells us he is; Nor dare I interrogate by
what Law of God, or Man, the King of
<hi>Englands</hi> Perſon, ought to be impriſoned,
or be diſpoſed of, by either, or both of the
two Kingdomes, or by any, or all of his
Subjects: Or whether His impriſonment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> be intended for the defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Royall Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Liberty
of the Subject? Or how it can conſiſt with
the Honour of the Engliſh Parliament to
ſuffer his Majeſties Honour thus to lye at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118846:9"/>
the ſtake, and his Sacred Name to bee
traduced, by ſuch Pamphlet-mongers as
<hi>Lilly</hi> and <hi>Booker,</hi> and that Pillory-man <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
without any reſtraint, or puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I care, whether the Eclipſe
in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1645. pre-ſignified the P. of the
Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or whether he have merited
ſo much Honour, as to have a Statua in
Crowne Gold erected at the Charges of
<hi>William Lilly,</hi> and an Epitaph made (and
thereon engraven) by <hi>Martin Parker,</hi> or
<hi>Mercer</hi> (the Scot;) Theſe things are all
beſide my Text, my intention being only
to examine Maſter <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Aſtrologicall
diſcourſe, and to ſhew him, and all men
wherein it is invalid, and no more.</p>
            <p>The judgement he hath given, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deduced from the poſition of the

            </p>
            <p>Whereby it is cleare, that unleſſe (in a
Lunar Eclipſe) the Moone bee above the
Earth, and likewiſe on the Signe, or at
leaſt in the Triplicitie of that Signe,
whereunto the Kingdome (in whoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere
the Defect happeneth) is ſubject:
And unleſſe that the Sun, or Moon place,
or the Signe aſcending or Culminating, be
alſo the Horoſcopicall ſigne of the Citie,
or Towne (you live in, or enquire after)
the effects of ſuch a Lunar Eclipſe, ſhall
not any way concerne that Kingdome or
Citie.</p>
            <p>But in a Solar Eclipſe it is neceſſary,
(beſides that the Sun be above the Earth,
and that his place agree to the Kingdome,
or Citie,) that the Eclipſe be alſo viſible
to the Kingdome or Citie, or otherwiſe the
effects ſhall in no wiſe concerne the one,
or the other.</p>
            <p>Now the Solar Eclipſe, here (by him)
mentioned, is not viſible at all to us, for it
appeares in the Iſlands <hi>de S. Pedro, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,
de Don Alfonſo, de Praxaros,</hi> and to
ſuch as ſayle beyond the Equator, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118846:11"/>
the Tropick of Capricorne through the
Perſian Sea: and (indeed) in 13. and 14.
deg. of North latitude, it wil be a very great
Eclipſe but of what concernment is this to
<hi>England;</hi> or why ſhould it put forward
this Lunar Eclipſe in <hi>January,</hi> ſeeing it is
neither viſible to us (for at <hi>London</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
at their 11. aclock at night, &amp; ſo the
Luminaries are both under the Horizon,)
nor yet is the degree Eclipſed in the Signe,
or Triplicitie of that Signe whereunto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> are thought to be
ſubject, which is required (by <hi>Cardanus</hi> his
Rule) before the effects can concerne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whereby it appeares that this Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apparent
Solar Eclipſe can no way helpe
or harme us, nor augment, or put forward
the effects of the Lunar Eclipſe, and that
<hi>William Lilly</hi> in thus preferring his owne
idle fancy, beyond the experience, and more
ſolid Reaſons and Rules of <hi>Campanella, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi>
and of all other Authors that ever
I read, or heard of, hath very much abuſed
the Reader, and rendered himſelfe a very
Novice and fondling in Aſtrology.</p>
            <p>As touching the Lunar Ecclipſe in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
1647. I have writ of it already in my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118846:11"/>
Prognoſtication, wherein you may ſee
what the effects of it are; and thoſe that
deſire further ſatisfaction, may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to <hi>Origanus,</hi> page 460. upon <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
being Lord of an Eclipſe, as hee is of
this. But although this Lunar Eclipſe bee
viſible, and fall out in a ſigne of the Fiery
triplicity, and in that reſpect doth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerne <hi>England:</hi> yet in regard it is ſo
ſmall, <hi>viz.</hi> but 4. digits, 47 min. 42 ſect. its
effects will ſcarcely be felt, or obſerved by
any body; For, as, <hi>Eclipſes nihil nocent illis
Regionibus in quibus non videntur;</hi> So, <hi>parvae
Eclipſes parum nocent, &amp; in pauca operantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, as both (<hi>Lilly</hi> in his <hi>Anglicus,</hi>
and I in my Prog.) have in effect obſerved,
that, <hi>in caeremoniis, religione</hi> (to which hee
addes <hi>in reditibus regiis) ac legibus mutatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
affert:</hi> A likelyhood (as hee ſaith) of
ſome change, or alteration in Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
in the Revenues of Kings, or more
properly, in ſuch matters as at preſent the
Parliament make uſe of, for maintenance
of their Wars and affaires: and of altering
or aboliſhing many lawes formerly in uſe.
All this I grant him, and why may it not
admit of thus much malignancy in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118846:12"/>
thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Kingdome
are weary of the Presbireriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and will not indure the ſmell of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
for Gentlemen are (commonly) Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and doe naturally affect freedome in
the Exerciſe of their Religion, and ſcorne
to be conſtrained to give an account of
their Beliefe to Broom-men, Coblers, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and Tinkers, or to any ſuch illiterate,
mechanique and prophane fellowes, or to
ſubject their underſtandings to the ſenſe
and interpretation of ſo unſanctified a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie,
and ſhall therefore wiſh for, and
(moſt juſtly) indeavour a change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the Church. So likewiſe may
his Majeſties Revenue (ſo long detained
from him) be in a better poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining,
or in ſome part reſtored to him, or
at leaſt great means uſed to perſwade thoſe
that have uſurped the Poſſeſſion and profits
thereof to reſigne and accompt. And that
many Ordinances, Orders, and Votes that
have paſſed and been formerly enjoyn'd,
and obſerved, as Lawes muſt admit of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and aboliſhment: but (as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
noted) theſe things will not be done
effectually this yeare, in regard of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118846:12"/>
of the Defect, ſo that we ſhall be ſcarce
ſenſible of its operation. Yet without all
doubt the Dragons head in the tenth Houſe
(in the intercepted ſigne <hi>Cancer</hi>) bodes very
much good to his Majeſtie to be begun and
wrought by the Scottiſh Nation, who ſhal
partake of that influence. And whereas
<hi>Lilly</hi> addes, that <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

That this ſmall Eclipſe portends ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
infirmity, or caſualty to a King, Prince,
or worthy man, perhaps ſome eminent and
famous Man's death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he had done well
to have cyted his Author, or given his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for what he ſayes here, for I cannot
pick out any ſuch ſignification from this
Eclipſe, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is truly and really Lord
thereof: nor as he hath made <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>
to be ſharers with him: Indeed <hi>Mars</hi>
ſtirrs up Wars, inteſtine Seditions, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

or caſualty to befall any King or

for him, that if prince <hi>Griffith</hi>
ſhould but this yeare fall aſunder of the
Pocks; the next yeare after, <hi>Lilly</hi> will tell
you that this Prediction was verified in
him. Nor know I any reaſon why <hi>Scotland</hi>
ſhould be at all concern'd in it, ſeeing the
Eclipſe happeneth in the Fiery Trigon,
and that the Aſcendent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
is Cancer, is of another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Watery
triplicity, nor at all aſpected by the Signe,
wherein the Eclipſe happeneth, nor affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by either of the Malevolents, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fortified by the preſence of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
Head in it (as before I noted) in the
Mid-heaven; and although the Eclipſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
be Diſpoſitrix of the ſigne Cancer, yet
for the reaſons formerly given, the effects
of the Eclipſe cannot be at all diſcerned in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> or ſcarce in any part of <hi>England,</hi>
and therefore it is but a foolery in <hi>William
Lilly</hi> to make ſuch a fluttering and a noiſe
about nothing: But I am well pleaſed to
heare him ſcatter that one truth (if ſo it
prove) that the Scots will ſtand like Okes
unſhaken to their firſt Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118846:13"/>
behoves ſome body elſe to remember their
Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And truly the Scots do owe
<hi>William Lilly</hi> a great many thankes for his
confiding Epithites: but I feare, I feare I
ſhall heare him ere long, laſh out of his
open Sepulchre as much and as vildly as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he did againſt the King and the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
though now he Court them, with the
Titles of <hi>Prudent</hi> and <hi>Wiſe People.</hi> I hope
they'le be wiſe enough, for thoſe they are
to deale with.</p>
            <p>What he ſayes againſt the Iriſh is not
materiall: the more the Fox is curs'd, the
better he thrives. But I ſuſpect <hi>Lilly</hi> to be
one of thoſe <hi>London Adventurers,</hi> who were
dividing the Beares skin, before hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
(as his Majeſtie once told them) If he
were, I preſume a man might purchaſe
<hi>Lilly</hi>'s ſhare of the Land in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at an
eaſie rate: And although out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
he tell them their Ruines approaching,
and threaten them with Cupps, and even
brimmers of vengeance; I believe he may
drink them their off himſelfe, before they
once pledge him. And although <hi>Booker</hi> (in
his bloody Iriſh Almanack) hath diſgorg'd
a filthy and confuſed heap, and maſſe of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118846:14"/>
miſery, ruine and vengeance to befall that
Kingdome, yet you have not heard of any
conſiderable loſſe that they have ſuſtained
ſince firſt that malicious lying Pamphlet
peep'd out into the world, which beares
date on Tueſday the 17th of <hi>March,</hi> 1645/6.
But on the contrary have beene exceeding
victorious, and ſucceſſefull beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
and at this preſent have all, or the

But I ſhall not (at preſent) take

               <p>Having already diſcovered his
decrepedneſſe in point of Art, I come now
to rip him up in matter of judgement, and
ſhall begin with this his firſt Aphoriſme,
wherein the Reader may obſerve himſelfe
ſufficiently abuſed, in the very quotation
thereof: for, whoſoever will perſue that
place of <hi>Guido,</hi> Colum. 514. may obſerve,
that <hi>Lilly</hi> (to fit the words for his turne)
hath left out at leaſt two lines of the Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme.
For, thus the words are in <hi>Guido:
Aſpice etiam in revolutione anni, utrum Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter

fortunarum <hi>ſignificabit enim res mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,
&amp; mutationes mirandas &amp; nominatas,
&amp; durabiles, ad bonum tamen,</hi> &amp;c. So that
the words here marked (by a different Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
he hath quite expunged, whereby it is
plaine, that this Aphoriſme hath but little
force, unleſſe that <hi>Jupiter</hi> were in the 15
degree of <hi>Cancer</hi> (which now hee is not)
or that he received the diſpoſition of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118846:17"/>
Fortunes, which in this Revolution he doth
not, for <hi>Jupiter</hi> is in the 28 degr. 25 min.
of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and within 3 degrees of Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Mars,</hi> whereby he is much afflicted and
weakened: and although he be in the Signe
of his Exaltation, yet he is there ſlow in
motion, Occidentall of the Sun, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde,
and <hi>Planeta Retrogradus nihil bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
ſignificat, donec dirigatur,</hi> A retrograde
Planet hath no ſignification of that which
is good, untill he be direct. It is true, that
within five dayes, he begins to move ſlowly
forward, yet, that brings him to a perfect
Conjunction with <hi>Mars</hi> the 23 day of
<hi>March,</hi> and they will not be fully ſeparated
from each others Beames of a ſudden, by
which <hi>Jupiter</hi> is very much debilitated:
And notwithſtanding that <hi>Mars</hi> is in his
Fall, yet he is the ſtrongeſt ſave one in the
Figure; ſo that I cannot perceive upon what
ground in Aſtrology he ſhould Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
of Peace and Tranquilitie from the
Poſition of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the latter part of
<hi>Cancer,</hi> conſidering him ſo weake and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,

               <p>Now if <hi>William Lilly</hi> could but have ſet

might alſo have obſerved the Conjunction
to be in <hi>Scotlands</hi> Horoſcopicall Signe, and

by ſo much the leſſe feare there is of the
death of ſuch a perſon: I rather conceive
that this Aphoriſme preſages only that
ſome ſuch perſon ſhall have his Honour,
(and may be his life) queſtioned, and bee
thereby in ſome perill of being deprived of
both. However, you may perceive by what
hath bin ſaid, that <hi>William Lilly</hi> hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceived the Reader, by this falſe quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of <hi>Bonatus,</hi> and that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
he had no cauſe or ground in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology
to delude the world with a vaine
hope of Peace and Tranquility, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

is threatned by the great dominion of
<hi>Mars,</hi> and the infortunate poſiture of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
in the Revolution. And if <hi>Lilly</hi> would
learne when this ſhall happen <hi>Lupoldus</hi> wil
tell him; <hi>Belli tempus eſt cum fuerit Mars

were Aſtrology the ground of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of ſmall Affection, or unitie betwixt them;
and as for that Reception you mention to
be betwixt them; I will not grant any, for
I learn'd when I was in my <hi>A. B. C.</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology,
that <hi>Receptio eſt duplex, una ex do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micilio,

cannot find here betwixt the Sun and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;
for, althought the Sun be in his Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yet <hi>Venus</hi> is not in hers, ſo that there
is no Reception in reſpect of Exaltation,
and for matter of Houſe you'le grant there
can be none. Yet I remember <hi>Zael</hi> admits
of this, and one more, as a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
and <hi>Origanus</hi> takes notice of them
in him and <hi>Schonerus,</hi> and calls them <hi>Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones

poſited portends great comfort from friends,
and that they ſhall merit honour and a good

and have good effect and encouragement in the
actions they ſeeke after, and of which matters
they themſelves expected good. If wee would

the 14. of March, and <hi>Saturne</hi> is not in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pog.
Epicicli</hi> untill the 4. of <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
ſo that this way <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are
both elevated above <hi>Saturne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereby the way will I put Mr. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>
in mind of one miſtake in this

Error in each committed.</p>
               <p>The 3. way by which a Planet may be
ſaid to be elevated is in reſpect of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Figure; as he that is above the
earth is more elevated then he that under is
the Horizon, he that is in the 12. Houſe is
elevated above an other Planet in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent,
he that is in the 11. above any i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

the 12. and he that is in the 10. above
any other in the Figure as indeed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
is now: And if all the Planets were
under the Horizon, then that which is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to the Aſcendent is ſaid to be moſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated;
but this is not ſo much conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by Aſtrologers as their elevation in
reſpect of Latitude, and of their proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to their Auges, or if it were, yet you
ſee there is two to one againſt <hi>Wil. Lilly:</hi>
For <hi>Saturne</hi> is neither elevated above all
the other Planets in reſpect of Latitude,
nor in reſpect of his Auge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Aphoriſme of <hi>Halyes</hi> hath no
ſignification here, <hi>Saturne</hi> being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>infortunatus in alto loco, nec ſublevatus
ſuper omnes alios planetas</hi> as <hi>William Lilly</hi>
ſuppoſes him: So that the South, and
South-eaſt parts of this Kingdome need
not feare this poſiture at all.</p>
               <p>Next I deſire the reader to obſerve that he hath
cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> corrupted, and miſunderſtood that Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme
in <hi>Bonatus 574 viz ſignificat naufragia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente,
&amp;c.</hi> For that Aphoriſme is not deduced
from the dominion of <hi>Mars</hi> in the 4 and 9 houſes
of the figure, but (as you may ſee in <hi>Guido</hi>) from the
ſcituation of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Cancer</hi> and his triplicity, and
the words of <hi>Bonat:</hi> are theſe, <hi>Et ſi fuerit</hi> Mars <hi>in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118846:29"/>
Revolutione anni in Cancro, vel elus triplicitate: &amp;
maxime in Cancto, erit apparitio eorum, quae ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caverit
in partibus Septentrionalibus:</hi> and thus much
of that Aphoriſme Maſter <hi>Merline</hi> hath quite left
out, which is thus much in Engliſh: if <hi>Mars</hi> in
the yeares revolution ſhall be in <hi>Cancer</hi> or his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
but eſpecially in <hi>Cancer,</hi> the viſibility of his
effects ſhall be in the Northern parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
Further <hi>In Cancro ſignificat naufragia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente
venientia ex forti atque ſubito flatu ventorum,
&amp; ſignificat rixam atque contentionem, &amp; bellum,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Cancer</hi> hath ſignification of unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhipwracks, happening by fierce and ſudden
gales of wind; he alſo portends ſtrife, contention,

to the Governours you ſpeak of from the ſunne as
he is Lord of the aſcendant, for he that will look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118846:30"/>
the Sunne muſt not onely be Lord of the
aſcendent, but free from the Malevolents, but he
muſt alſo be Lord of the yeare, which he is not in

may be in force, the King will have the beſt
ſhare thereof, if the Sunne be the naturall <hi>ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>

What <hi>Venus</hi> portendeth in the 9 as ſhe is

579 is not amiſſe; onely his application is
like all the reſt, as idle and fooliſh as may be, in
that it concerns all the Clergy in generall, and not
the Prick-ear'd Divines onely, as every Artiſt can
teſtifie.</p>
               <p>Now, for that <hi>William Lilly</hi> ſeemes to be very
much offended with one Maſter <hi>Geere,</hi> who (as he
ſaith) was ſometimes a prieſt of <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> and
hath lately writ a Pamphlet called <hi>Aſtrologo-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrix,</hi>
(which indeed is as full of old idle Sophiſtry,
as Maſter <hi>Lilly</hi> is of Malice, and Ignorance) yet I
hold it no ſufficient anſwer to tell him a ſtory of a
Weathercock, or a Cock and Bull, in ſtead of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and avoyding his Arguments by better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118846:30"/>
nor is it Scholler like, or favours at all of
Common Civility, to fall upon ſcandalizing of a
mans Reputation, when he hath not wit enough to
require him otherwiſe. I think (<hi>Lilly</hi>) you would
ſcarce accept of it as a ſufficient anſwer from me,
if in ſtead of correcting your errours, I ſhould tell
the world that you were but a Taylours Boy in
Saint <hi>Clements</hi> Pariſh, and that the ſummity of
all your honour was to be afterwards a Scriveners
Man, and that he dyng your Mrs taught you firſt
to write Secretary, in which reſpect I account you
not worthy of the juſt revenge of my Pen: This
(though it be true) were but mean Logick, but the
truth is, you are lame of that legge, and therefore
you may do well to borrow a crutch of Maſter
<hi>Thomas Challoner,</hi> that preciſe Logitian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor does it grieve me at all that I ſuffer ſo much

and ſworn to, as to be traduced by you, with
the tearmes of an obſcure footman, ungownd, and
unbooted, &amp;c. the time was when I have been on
Horſeback, where neither <hi>Lillie,</hi> nor <hi>Booker</hi> durſt
have ſhown their faces, and 'tis no matter whether
I weare Boots or Shoes, either ſhall content me: I
have both, and if I want a Colledge Gown, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
(Sir) you'r not in ſo much credit as to take
one up for me till my nex yeares Almanack may
defray your engagement, however you are not ſo
much Maſter of your trade, as to make it for me,

in Negotiis Regis, ſimiliter &amp; in lege,</hi> very great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,

dare not tell us his author, and (indeed) he
either will not, or dare not; yet nevertheleſſe I
have trac'd him, and found <hi>Haly</hi> to be the authour
of thoſe words, and of ſome other proceedings,
which you may gueſſe he was unwilling to publiſh,
by the tenour of them, <hi>Haly pag.</hi> 391 they run thus:
<hi>Significat</hi> (ſaith <hi>Haly) quod exiſtent Rebelles qui
adverſabuntur Regi, &amp; qui querunt regnum,</hi> &amp;c.
The plain Engliſh is this, it ſignifieth that there
ſhall be Rebels (and traytors, who ſhall riſe and
oppoſe themſelves againſt the King, who ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
to deprive him of his Kingdome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
this together with the former, is the genuine ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the ſquare of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and
theſe very words I had noted in my Almanack, but
the Printer maliciouſly expunged and altered them
and divers more, whereby he hath unworthily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
me, and made my Almanack look weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat

               <p>As for the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in

learnedly handled by <hi>John Booker;</hi> I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
laid him open in that diſcourſe I formerly

Peaceable judgement from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> being in the
