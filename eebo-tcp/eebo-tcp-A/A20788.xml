         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

who enstated in all the <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of Heaven, yet sues for a
welcome on earth: and wee
have him in my Text.</p>
            <p>First, for Posture, <hi>Standing,
I stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for Place: <hi>At the doore: I stand

            </p>
            <q>Behold I stand at the doore, and Knocke.</q>
            <p>These are the severall Branches the bodie of
this Text spreads into, where doe perch on every
sprigg, <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Mercy: Wonder</hi> that GOD
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10430:4"/>
who is all <hi>Glory,</hi> should come downe unto man
who is all <hi>vilenesse: Mercy</hi> that Man who is a
foule <hi>ragge</hi> of uncleanenesse, should be made a
<hi>temple</hi> for GOD to dwell in, who is all <hi>Holy;</hi>
GOD and man were at <hi>distance</hi> but now, nay at
<hi>odds,</hi> nay at <hi>feud,</hi> if ever any, happy is that <hi>union,</hi>
which brings them under one <hi>roofe,</hi> to one <hi>table:</hi>
this is marveilous in our eyes, and therefore
<hi>chain'd</hi> in with an <hi>Ecce</hi> here; <hi>Behold, I stand at the
doore, and Knocke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold</hi> is a word of Emphasis and Energie: if
this <hi>Starre</hi> stand ore the house, a JESVS is
within, nor points this <hi>hand</hi> in the <hi>Margin,</hi> but
there's juice and substance in the <hi>Text:</hi> Some of
ranke are in the <hi>Palace,</hi> where this <hi>Porter</hi> keeps
the gate, and <hi>fruits</hi> not to be plucked rudely, in
that <hi>Paradice,</hi> where this <hi>Cherube</hi> guardes the
entry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where <hi>Ecce</hi> is written on the <hi>box,</hi> be sure
the <hi>ointment</hi>'s precious, something of weight and
moment doth march in the <hi>reare,</hi> if <hi>Behold</hi> leades
up the <hi>front,</hi> and as the <hi>Baptist</hi> in Sacred Writ,
prepares the way to it; 'tis so here; GOD bowes
the Heavens and <hi>comes</hi> downe among men, nor
<hi>comes</hi> he arm'd with thunders, cloath'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
darkenesse being his pavilion about him, as
to Israel on Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 16.</note> So to <hi>come,</hi> would strike
terrour in all hearts; nor <hi>comes</hi> he as sometime he
<hi>came</hi> into his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> where the <hi>Singers went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 23.</note>
               <hi>the plaiers of instruments followed after, among
them were the Damosels playing with timbrels;</hi> thus
to <hi>come</hi> would be a pleasant object to all eyes: He
comes here <hi>forma pauperis,</hi> as a <hi>Mendicant</hi> who
begs an <hi>almes</hi> for GODS sake: He <hi>breakes</hi> not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10430:4"/>
into our roomes, but <hi>stands</hi> at our doores, at
whose least breath the <hi>gates</hi> of hell flie open, and
the barres of <hi>iron</hi> burst in peeces: here is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and humility to a miracle, and both stamped
with an <hi>Ecce, Behold I Stand,</hi> &amp;c. Nay not a <hi>word</hi>
here but this <hi>dash</hi> of the HOLY GHOSTS quill,
the <hi>impression</hi> of this character is due unto it.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>I,</hi> it were enough were I a guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to some Monarch below, if one from the

of peace, the <hi>King</hi> of glory, the LORD <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi>
of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I stand,</hi> I sit not in my <hi>chaire</hi> of state,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
I leane not on a <hi>cushion</hi> of ease, I roule not on <hi>beds</hi>
of violets and <hi>strewings</hi> of rose-buds; but <hi>I stand,</hi>
and this <hi>posture</hi> of mine, speakes as my <hi>readinesse</hi>
to enter, so my <hi>patience</hi> to awaite it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I Stand at the doore,</hi> not in the <hi>Hall,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
where the warmth of a fire might cheere me, not
in the <hi>chamber,</hi> where I might rest my limbes on

or <hi>penthouse;</hi> where the drislie <hi>sleete</hi> chils, and the

               <hi>stand</hi> not at the doore,<note place="margin">Prov. 9. 14.</note> as the harlot <hi>sate</hi> at hers in the
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> to tole in, gaine, and enamour the passin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to folly:<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 14.</note> nor <hi>stand</hi> I, as those <hi>Sodomites,</hi> who
thronged about the dores of <hi>Lot,</hi> to shed that
blood which bedewes the earth, and with its
shreekes awakens Heaven to vengeance: I <hi>stand</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:10430:5"/>
not with my hands in my bosome, or my armes
enfolded together, or to gaze about me, as those
Idlers in the Market-place: but I stand to <hi>knocke,</hi>
nor give I a <hi>rappe</hi> and away, as a Post that flieth
by, but as 'tis a peece of my devoire to gaine an
entry, so I <hi>stand</hi> to it: if by any meanes, they will
open to <hi>mee,</hi> and their owne <hi>happinesse: Behold I
