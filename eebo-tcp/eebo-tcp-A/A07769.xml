         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

worke which I presume to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

be vnto you very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For vnto such as are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
wisedome, vertue and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
the wisest best and weightiest matters are alwaies
most agreeable. And whereas all men are naturally desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of the souereine welfare, highest felicitie, or cheefe
good, howbeit that very fewe doe knowe what it is, or
wherein it consisteth, or which is the right way that
leadeth thereunto: And yet not withstanding, without
the knowledge of that trueth, all their wisedome is but
mere ignorance blyndnesse and folly, all their goodnesse
is but mere corruption &amp; wickednesse, &amp; al their braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
tryumphe iollitie and pompe is but vtter miserie and
<pb facs="tcp:13215:3"/>
wretchednesse: This present worke treateth of the trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that is to say of the perpetuall and inuariable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
and sted fastnesse of the Christian Religion, the
only band that linketh God vnto man, and men one to
another, and all vnto God, the only Lampe that enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
mans wit with true wisedome, the onely water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
that replenisheth his will with true goodnesse, and
the only mightis power that giueth strength and courage
to mans spirit, whereby he is enabled both perfectly to
discerne and beholde his souereine welfare or felicitie,
which is God the very founder furtherer and finisher of
trueth or rather the very trueth it selfe; and constantly
to hold on with ioy to the obteynement of the same; than
the which no greater thing can by any meanes bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
And in the discourse of this most graue &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
matter, many deepe poynts of humaine Philosophie,
and many high misteries of heauenly Diuinitie, be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
breefly and plainly discussed and layd open, to the
vnderstanding euen of the meanest capacities, that will
vout safe to reade aduisedly, &amp; to conferre the parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with diligence. For the Author of this work being
a man of great reading, iudgement, learning &amp; skill, and
there with addicted or rather vowed (as appeareth by
this and dyuers other of his excellent writings) to the
furthering of Gods glorie by his most faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
imploying of himselfe in the seruice of his Church;
hath conueyed into this worke, what soeuer he found ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the Historiographers and Poets; that might conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
make to the manifestation of that trueth which
he taketh in hand to proue. VVherby he hath so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
brought his purpose to passe; that if any Atheist In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
or Iew hauing read this his worke with aduiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
shall yet donye the Christian Religion to be the true and

to bee mere vanitie and wickednesse; must needes she we
himself to be either vtterly voyd euen of humaine sence,
or els obstinatly and wilfully bent to impugne the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

conscience. Not without iust cause therfore hath so great
loue and lyking of this worke of his bene generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued;
that many not onely of Gentlemen in the Court

haue purposed and attempted the translating ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
into our English tongue, as an increase of comfort and

as a meane to reuoke such as of themselues or by sinister

to say some what (though farre lesse than is meet) of that,
right worthie and valiant Knight, your good Lordships
noble kinsman Sir Philip Sidney, whose rare vertue, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and courtesie, matched with equall loue and care of
the true Christian Religion, being disappoynted of their
purposed end by ouerhastie death in the very enterance
of his honorable race, haue left iust cause to his louing
Countrie to be wayle the vntymely forgoing of so great
an Ornament, and the sodeyne bereuing of so hopefull a
stay and defence. VVhereof not withstanding this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
remayneth, That he dyed not languishing in ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
ryot and excesse, nor as ouercome with nyce plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and fond vanities; but of manly wounds receiued
in seruice of his Prince, in defence of persons oppressed,
in maintenance of the only true Catholick &amp; Christian
Religion, among the noble valiant and wise, in the open
field, in Martiall maner, the honorablest death that
could be desired, and best be seeming a Christian Knight,
whereby he hath worthly wonne to himselfe immortall
fame among the godly, and left example worthie of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to others of his calling. This honorable gentleman
being delighted with the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of this present work,
began to put the same into our Language for the benefite
of this his natiue Countrie, and had proceeded certeyne
Chapters therein; vntill that intending a higher kind of
seruice to wards God and his Prince, not drawen therto
by subtile deuyce of a wylie Vlysses from companie of
Courtly Ladies, himself being disguised in Ladies attire
<pb facs="tcp:13215:4"/>
after the maner of Achilles; nor discouered against his
will by the wisedome of a Palamedes after the maner
of Vlysses; but aduaunced through the hardynesse of his
owne knightly courage like to Prosilaus, he willingly
passed for a tyme from the companie of the Muses to
the Campe of Mars, there to make tryall as well of the
Pyke as he had done of his Pen, after the example of the
valiant Iulius Caesar, whose excellencie in all kinde of
knowledge and learning, could not hold him backe from
seeking to inlarge his renowme by hazarding his noble
person among the weapons of armed Souldyers. Beeing
thus determined to followe the affayres of Chiualrie; it
was his pleasure to commit the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this peece
of seruice which he had intended to the Muses or rather
to Christes Church and his natiue Countrie, vnto my
charge; declaring vnto me how it was his meaning, that
the same being accomplished should bee dedicated vnto
your Honor; a matter so acceptable vnto me, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the charge it self, and of the partie that imposed
it vpon me, and of the person to whom it was intended:
that although in respect of the toylesome and tedious
troubles wherewith I was then pressed and am yet still
in maner oppressed, I could haue found in my heart to
haue forborne the vndertaking of so great a taske at
that tyme; yet notwithstanding I gladly tooke it vpon
me, &amp; (by the goodnesse of God) haue faithfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it to the vttermost of my skill. In his name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp; as an executor of his will in that behalf, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:13215:5"/>
offer this excellent worke vnto your good Lordship,
as his and not myne. VVherein if any words or phrases
shall seeme straunge, (as in some places perchaunce they
may) I doubt not but your good Lordship will impute it
to the rarenesse and profoundnesse of the matters there
handled, not accustomed heretofore to bee treated of in
our language. For the auoyding of which inconuenience
as much as might be, great care hath bene taken, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and deryuing of fit names and termes, out of the
fountaynes of our owne tongne, though not altogether
most vsuall, yet alwaies conceyuable and easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
rather than by vsurping the Latin termes, or
by borrowing the words of any forreine language, least
the matters which in some cases are misticall enough of
themselues by reason of their owne profoundnesse, might
haue bene made more obscure to the vnlearned, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them downe in termes vtterly vnknowne vnto
them. VVherefore forbearing to withhold your Honor
with any further processe of words fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reading the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it selfe, which may much more delight you: I

euerlasting. And that is the foundation of all Religion. For Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(to speake properlie) is nothing else but the schoole wherein
we learne mans dutie towards God, and the way to be lincked most
straightly vnto him. Againe, in the world we see a stedie and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled
order, and euery creature to do seruice in his sort. Onely man
withdraweth his dutie, shrinking from God, and wandring away
in himselfe. <hi>He</hi> that is most indebted, is lothest to pay and least able
<pb facs="tcp:13215:6"/>
to pay. <hi>He</hi> for whome the highest thinges are made, is become a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue
to the basest and vilest thinges: And the Recordes of all ages
are as inditements against all mankind; prouing him to be vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to God, a murtherer of his neighbors, a violater of nature, and an
enemie to himself. Shall not he then, which instead of dooing his
dutie, is not asbamed to offend God, stand in dread of the death which
wayteth vpon him for his offence? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es: for what is God, but Iustice?
What is Iustice, but a iudgement of duety? And before that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
who dareth appeare? What remedy than is there, both for
Gods glorie and for mans welfare: but that the debt be discharged
by release, and the Iustice satisfied with free fauour? The duty ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of trew Religion, is to conuict vs by the Law, and to iustifie vs
by grace, to make vs feele our discase, and there with all to offer vs
remedy. But who shall purchase vs this grace so necessarie for mans
welfare? Either the world (as we thinke) or else man. Nay, what is
there in man (I say euen in the best man) which burneth not before
Gods Iustice, and which setteth it not on fire? And what shall become
of the world then, if man for whom it is created be vnable to stand?
soothly it is the welbeloued sonne of God that must stand for all:
the righteous for the vnrighteous, the mightie for the vnmightye,
the rich for the poore, the dearling and the welbeloued for them
that are in the displeasure and curse of God his father, and the same
(say I) is our Lorde Iesus Christ. The foole (sayth the Psalmist) hath
said in his heart,<note place="margin">Psalme. 14, Auicen the Arabian.</note> 
               <hi>There is no God.</hi> And a Heathen man hath passed
yet further, saying: <hi>Hee that denieth the one God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urdence
in all thinges, is not onely witlesse, but also senselesse.</hi>
And his so saying is, because the world which offereth it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
vnto vs, replenisheth our wittes with the knowledge of
God: euen in this respect, that with one view of the eye, we see this
vniuersall masse furnished with so many and so diuerse thinges, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
one to another, and tending all to one marke. Traly I dare say
and by Gods grace I dare vnder take to prooue, that whosocuer will
lay before him wholly in one table (so as he may see them together
with one view) the promises and prophesies concerning Christ, the
comming of our Lord Iesus and the proceeding of his Gospell, he shall
not be able to deny, euen by the very rules of Philosophie, but that he
was sent of God, yea and that he was God himself. Howbeit, in this
lyeth our fault, that (whether it be through ignoraunce or through
negligence) we consider not the incomparable worke of our creator
<pb facs="tcp:13215:6"/>
and Recreator, but by piecemeale, without laying the one of them to
the other: like as if a man would iudge of the whole space of time
by the night, or by some one season of the yeare, or by some one of
the Elements: or as if he would iudge of a building by some one
quarter: or of an Oration by some syllables thereof: whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
Gods wisedome in creating thinges cannot be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but in the vnion of the partes with the whole, and of themselues
among themselues: nor his goodnesse in recreating or renewing
them, and in regenerating of mankind for whom he made the world,
but by the heed full conferring of all times from the first byrth of
Man vnto the seconde byrth, and repairing of him againe, which it
hath pleased God to ordaine and make for him.</p>
            <p>As for the world, it is sufficiently conuersant before our eyes,
and would God it were lesse grauen in our hartes: and therefore
let vs leaue the world, and busie our selues in the vniuersall table
of mans saluation and reparation. When man had by his sinne
drawne Gods wrath and the decay of the world vppon his owne
head: Gods euerlasting wisedome, euen the same whereby God had
created him, stepped in and procured his fauour, so as it was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vnto the first man, that Christ should come and breake the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head, and make attonement betweene God and man. That was
the foundation-stone of the wonderfull building of the Church, and
the seede whereof men were to be regenerated new againe, whome
God did as it were create, beget, and adopt new againe in his sonne,
which is his euerlasting wisedome. This promise was deliuered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
from hand to hand, and conueyed from Father to Sonne, solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: committed as a pawne
by Moses to the people of Israell, celebrated by Dauid in his songs,
and renewed from time to time by many excellent Prophets, which
pointed out the time, place, and manner of his comming, and sette
downe plainly and expresly his stocke, his parents and his birth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred yeares, yea and some thousand yeares a forehand: which
are such thinges as noman could know, nor any creature teach or
conceiue. What were they else therefore but Herauldes that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed
the comming of the king of the world into the world: and
certes by another spirite than the spirite of the world: After a
long successe of these Herauldes, came the sauiour in the selfe
same manner which they had foretolde and painted out. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they had saide of him, agreed vnto him, and which more
<pb facs="tcp:13215:7"/>
is could agree to none but him. Who then can doubt that the promise
is not performed, and that he is not the bringer of the promised grace
to the World? And seing that the prophets could not tell any tidings
of him but from God, from whence can he be sent but from God? I
know well that this one thing is a stumbling blocke vnto vs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that after the sounding of so many clarions and trumpets, we see
a man in outward show base, and to the sight of our fleshly eies
contemptible, come into the world; whereas notwithstanding if we
opened the eies of our mind, we should contrariwise espie in that
wretchednesse, the verie Godhead, and in that humane weakenesse,
the selfesame infinite almightines which made both the world and
man. He was borne say you: but of a virgin. He was weake: but yet
with his onely voice he healed all infirmities. He died: but yet he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the dead, and rose himselfe from the dead too. If thou beleeue
that, thou beleeuest that he was both sent and susteined by God. Or if
thou wilt doubt thereof, tell mee then how he did the things after his
death, which are witnessed by thine owne histories? As soone as he
was borne say I, he by and by chaunged the outward shape of the
world, making it to spring new again all after another sort.
When he was once crucified, he turned the reproch of his crosse into
glorie, and the curse thereof into a blessing. He was crowned with
thornes, and now Kings and Emperors doo cast downe their crownes
and Diademes at his feete. What a death was that, which did such
things as all the liuing could not doo? By ignorance he subdued
learning; by folly, wisedome; by weakenesse, power, by miserie, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie;
by reproch, triumphs; by that which seemed not to be, the things
which seemed verily and chiefly for to be. Twelue Fisher-men in
effect, did in short space subdue the whole world vnto him, by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and by teaching to suffer, yea and by dying, and by teaching to
die And the great Christian kingdomes which we now gaze at, and
which we exalt so much, are but small remnants of their exploites,
and little pieces of their conquests. If his birth offend thee, looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Heraulds that went a fore him, and vppon the Trumpetters
that told tidings of him, both in the beginning and in the chiefe state
of the world, from whom, but from him that made the worlde? And
wherefore in all ages, but for the welfare of the world? If his crosse
offend thee, see how the Emperours and their Empyres, the Idols whom
they worshipped, and the deuils whom they serued. Lye altogether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne,

               </gap>oot-anker of this booke,
wherein I declare the trewnesse of the christian Religion, and that
(as I hope) with such Reasons, that the despisers of God, if they will

Moreouer to offer this to your Maiestie, I haue chiefly two causes, the
one is, that God hath made you to be borne, not onely a Christian, but
<pb facs="tcp:13215:8"/>
also a Christian Prince, to whom it belongeth chiefly both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and for others, to knowe what the Christian Religion is. For ye

               </gap>unce it, when you be throughly

and hath made you a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and set you ouer men. To be short, that
it is both your prospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itie in this life which dependeth vppon Gods
gratious goodnes, and your welfare in the other life which is of far
greater importance, than all that euer we can endure or attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
here.</p>
            <p>The other reason is, that forasmuch as God hath called me to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
your Maiestie (as I hope) to do you seruice in that notable worke
which he is about to doe in our daies to his glory, and wherein he
hath put into your hart to imploy your person without sparing of
your life: reason would that the fruits both of my labors and of my
leisure should be yours, as well as the field is yours, without that it
should be in my power to dispose otherwise thereof. And I pray the
almighty to increase his grace in you from day to day, and to giue
vnto you his spirit to go for ward with his worke, and vnto me to
do you seruice to the vttermost of my small power as long as I lyue.

they ought to follow most wholie, or doubting in the things
which they ought to be leeue most stedfastlie, he findeth euen

by answer and yeeld the reason of himselfe, why I haue taken
this worke in hand, more needfull now adaies (yea euen (which

Some busie themselues so much about their pleasures,
that they can neuer find anie leisure, not to mount vp vnto
God, but onelie so much as to enter into themselues: in somuch
that they be more strangers to their owne nature, to their owne
Soules, and to the things which concerne them most neerelie
and peculiarlie, than they bin either to the deserts of Inde, or
to the Seas that are worst to be haunted &amp; least knowen. That
is the verie welspring of the Atheists, who (to speake rightlie
of them) offend not through reasoning, but for want of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
nor by abusing of reason, but by drowning of reason, or
rather by bemiring it in the filthie and beastlie pleasures of
the world. Othersome match their pleasures with malice, and
to make short waie to the atteinement of goods or honour, doo
ouerreach and betraie othermen, selling their freends, their
kinsfolke, yea and their owne soules, &amp; not sticking to do anie
euill, that may serue their turne, neuer alledging or pretending
honestie or conscience, but to their owne profit. Of such kind
of stuffe are the Epicures made, who bicause they feele their
<pb facs="tcp:13215:9"/>
minds guiltie of so many crimes, do thinke themselues to haue
escaped the Iustice and prouidence of GOD by denying it.
And of these we may say, that their reason is caried away and
oueimaistered by the course of the world, wherevnto it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
tied, so as they can haue none other course or discourse than
his.</p>
            <p>Some go yet a litle further, both in respect of God, and of
themselues. They thinke there is a God, and that of him man
hath receiued an immortall soule: that God gouerneth all
things, and that man ought to serue him. But forasmuch as
they see both Gentiles and Iewes, Turkes and Christians in
the world, and in diuerse nations diuerse Religions, whereof
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uery one thinketh he serueth God, and that he shall find sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
in his owne Religion: These (like men at a stoppe
where many waies meet,) in steed of choosing the right way
by the iudgement of reason, do stand still amazed, and in that
amazement conclude that all comes to one, as who would say,
that South and North lead both to one place. But foothly if
they applied their wit as aduisedly to iudge betweene truth
and falshood, godlinesse and worldlinesse, as euery man in his
trade doth to iudge betweene profit and losse: they should
foorthwith by principles bred within themselues, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
following vpon the same, discerne the true Religion
from the false: and the way which GOD hath ordeined to
welfare, from the deceitfull bywaies and from the crosse and
crooked inuentions of men. What shall I say of the most part
of vs? Of vs I meane which beleeue the Gospell and professe
the Christian Religion, and yet liue as though we beleeued it
not? Which preach the kingdome of heauen, and haue our
groynes cuer wrooting in the ground? Which will needes
seeme and bee taken to be Gods children and coheires with
Christ, children of so rich a father and heires of so goodly an
inheritance, and yet doo scarsly thinke earnestly vpon it once
in a whole yeare, but are readie to forsake it euery howre,
for lesse than a messe of grewell and a bit of bread? Surely
wee may well say then, that if euer it were needefull, it is
needefull at this time to waken such as are asleepe, to bring
backe such as are gone astraie, to lift vp such as are sunke
downe, and to chafe them a heat which are waxed cold. And
<pb facs="tcp:13215:9"/>
that is to bee done by painting out the true Religion liuely
before their eyes, with the ioy, happines, and glorie which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
therevpon, to the intent that the voluptuous may seeke
their ioy, the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etous their gaine, and the ambitious their
glorie there, bending themselues with their whole hearts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that alone, which all onely can fill their harts, and satisfie
their desires.</p>
            <p>That is the thing which I indeuor to doo in this worke,
and GOD of his gratious goodnesse vouchsafe to guide my
hand, to his owne glorie and to the welfare of those that are
his. But afore I enter into the matter, I haue to answere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two sortes of people. The one are such as say that Religion
cannot bee declared vnto Infidels or vnbeleeuers by
reason. The other sorte are those whiche vphold, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
reason doo somewhat inlighten it, yet it is neyther
lawfull nor expedient to doo it. But let vs see what reason
they can haue, to exclude reason from this discourse. The
first sort say, It is to no purpose to dispute against such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
grounded principles. And by this meanes, because one
grounded principle is denied them, they breake of quite and
cleane, as though all meane of conference were taken awaie.
Surelie this principle of theirs is very true, but yet (in my
iudgement) it is very ill vnderstood. I graunt it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to dispute against such as denie grounded principles,
by the same principles which they denie: That is very true.
But there may be some other principles common to both
sides, by the which a man may profitably dispute with them,
and by those common principles oftentimes prooue and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
his owne principles. And that is the thing which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to doo in this worke. As for example; The Christian
groundeth himselfe vpon the Gospell; the Iew denieth it:
and therefore it were to no purpose to alledge it vnto him.
But both the Iew and the Christian haue one common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and ground, which is the old Testament: By this may the
Christian profitably dispute against the Iew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
of the gospel, as if ye should make one to call some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to his knowledge, by the draughts or descriptions of his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture.
Likewise the Iew is grounded vpon the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
which the Gentile would mocke at if he should alledge it
<pb facs="tcp:13215:10"/>
vnto him. But both the Gentile and the Iew haue one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature, which furnisheth them both with one common
Philosophie, and with one common sort of principles; as that
there is one God which gouerneth all things; that he is good,
and no author of euill; That he is wise, and doth not anie thing
in vaine. Also that man is borne to be immortall; that to be
happie he ought to serue God and continew in his fauour.
And therewithall, that he is subiect to passions, inclined to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
weake vnto good and so forth. Of these common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
the Iew maie draw necessarie conclusions, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
shall not perceiue at the first, like as when a man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
a proposition, but conceiueth not yet the drift and
consequence thereof. He that marketh that the Adamant or
Loadstone pointeth to the North, perceiueth not foorthwith
that by the same a man maie goe about the world, although he
was of capacitie to cenceiue it. After the same maner, by this
principle:<note place="margin">Euclid. lib. 1. prop. 45.</note> He <hi>that from equall things taketh equall things, leaueth
the remainder equall;</hi> and by a few other propositions which
children learne in playing; the Mathematician leadeth vs gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

Thus shall the Iew by common principles and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
verifie his owne ground which is the old Testament.
For he shall proue vnto the Gentiles by their owne Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that vnto God alone, things to come are present, and that
vnto Spirits they be knowen but onelie by coniecture, and so
farre forth as they can read them in the starres. And he shall
proue by their Astrologers, that the names of men and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of their doings cannot be betokened nor red in
the starres. And he shall proue by their Historiographers,
that the bookes of the old Testament, which containe so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and so perticular prophesies, were written manie hundred
yeares afore the things came to passe. Now what will reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
insue hereof, but the proofe of the principle which is in
controuersie, by the principles which are agreed vpo betweene
them both: namel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that the old Testament is of God, seing it
<pb facs="tcp:13215:10"/>
cannot be from anie other. And what else is all this, than that
which is commonlie done in Geometric and Logicke, which
by two lines or by two propositions that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie knowen
&amp; certeine, do gather a third proportion that was vnknowen, or
a third proposition (that is to saie a conclusion) that was erst ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubted of or hidden, and by meanes of the other two is
euidentlie found out, and necessarilie prooued. Such are these
proofes against the Atheists: nothing hath mouing of it selfe.
It is nature that saieth so. The world turneth about, and the
heauenlie bodies haue a mouing: and that doth man himselfe
see. Therefore they must needs be moued by some other power
and that is the Godhead; which our eie seeth not, and yet by
means of the eie, our reason conceiueth and perceiueth it in all
things. Against them which denie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hristes Godhead, [we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this principle of their owne.] That naturally of nothing
nothing is made. It is the saying of Aristotle, and the schooles
would haue him by the eares that should denie it. Iesus Christ
hath of nothing made verie great things, yea euen contraries
by contraries. The Heathen wonder at it, all ages crie it out,
our eies do still behold it. He that will denie this; must denie
the world, he must denie all things, he must denie himselfe.
It followeth then that Christ wrought by a powre, that is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
of Nature. Aristotle himselfe saw it not, and yet Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
maketh vs to see it. The writers of Histories tooke no
heed of it; and yet they themselues make vs to beleeue it.
The Philosopher thought but onelie vpon nature, and the
Histographer but onelie vpon his owne writing. And yet
from both twaine of them, wee drawe both the Godhead of
Christ, and the truth of our Scriptures: Certesse in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as by Arithmetike, out of two and sixe wee draw out one
continuall proportionable line hidden after a sort in either
of them, and yet greater than both of them togither, which is
Eighteene: &amp; as out of two sticks chafed one against another,
we draw out fire which is not seene in the two, the consuming
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both out of hand. To be short, the marke that our faith
looketh at, is the Author of Nature &amp; principle of all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
The rules therefore &amp; the principles of Nature which he
hath made cannot be contrarie vnto himselfe. And he is also
the verie reason and truth it selfe. All other reason then, &amp; all
<pb facs="tcp:13215:11"/>
other truth dependeth vpon him, &amp; relieth vpon him, neither
is there, or can there be any reason or truth but in him: So far
off is it, that the thing which is trewe and reasonable in nature,
is or can be false in Diuinitie, which (to speake properly) is not
against nature, but against the corruption of nature, and in verie
deede about nature.</p>
            <p>Nowe come I consequently to the other sort,<note place="margin">How farre matters of faith are to bee dealt with by reason.</note> which say that
although it bee possible in some sorte; yet the faith (that is to
say, the Christian doctrine) ought not to be proued or declared
by reason: And their reason is, because it consisteth in manie
things which exceed the capacitie of man, &amp; therefore that he
which should measure them by reason, shoulde diminish the
dignitie and greatnes of them. Surely I will say more for them
than they require: namely, that mans reason is so farre off from
being the measurer of far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, which very far exceedeth nature,
that it is not so much as the measurer of nature, &amp; of the least
creatures which lie farre vnderneath man; because of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and vntowardnes which is in vs and raigneth in vs. But in
this they deceiue themselues, that they imagine vs to vpholde,
that wee should beleeue no further than reason can measure &amp;
comprehend. For what a great way doth the truth of thinges
excend further than mans reason? But we say that mans reason
is able to lead vs to that point; namely, that we ought to beleue
euen beyond reason, I meane the things whereunto all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
of man cannot attaine. And like wise, that when things
are reuealed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto vs, which reason could neuer haue entered
into nor once imagined, no not euen when it was at the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest;
the same reason (which neuer could haue found them out)
maketh vs to allow of them: the reason I say (whereunto those
mysteries were insuisible afore) maketh them credible vnto vs:
surely euen after the same maner that our eye maketh vs to see
that in the visible things, which we ought to beleue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
without the which the visible could haue no beeing:
that is to wit, the inuisible God, by the visible Sonne, &amp; also to
see many things when the Sun is vp, which were hidden afore
in darknesse: not that the eie-sight was of lesse force, or the
thing it selfe lesse visible afore: but because the Sonne is now
vp, which lighteneth the aire with his brightnes, which is the
meane both wherby the eie seeth, &amp; wherby the thing is seen.
<pb facs="tcp:13215:11"/>
As for example, we beleeue that there is one God, the Father,
the Son, &amp; the holy Ghost. This is the article which they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against vs, &amp; therfore doe I take the very same. This arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in any wise fal within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe of vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp;
much lesse be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended by mans reason. But yet doth reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lead vs to the said point, that there is a God: that he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man to liue for euer: that whereas man hath stepped out
of the way, to followe his owne sway, he reformeth him again
by his word: That this word (as I haue said already heretofore)
is the olde and new Testament, which conteine thinges that
cannot proceed from creatures. Heere Reason stayeth, &amp; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it selfe contented. For seeing that God speaketh, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
man to holde his peace: and seeing that hee vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
to teache vs, it becommeth vs to belecue. Nowe wee
reade this doctrine in Gods foresaid bookes, yea oftentimes
repeated. Lo how Reason teacheth vs that which she her selfe
neither knewe nor beleeued, namely by leading vs to the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
whom we ought to heare and beleeue; and to the booke
wherein he vouchsafeth to open himselfe vnto vs, in giuing vs
infallible markes and tokens, whereby to discerne what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of God, and what commeth not of him. But when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
commeth to the reading of the doctrine, and is perswaded
thereof; then she awaketh, and if the Gentile refuse it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
and repugnant to reason and truth, then steppeth she
forth stoutly, and marketh the likenesse thereof in nature, the
images thereof in her selfe to set it foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, and the Recordes
of the Gentiles themselues to incounter them withall.</p>
            <p>Also she findeth out solutions of their arguments, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to their absurdities. For surely all truth cannot be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proued by reason, considering that many thinges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
reason and nature. But yet cannot any vntruth pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ayle
by reason against truth; nor any truth bee vanquished by the
iudgement of reason. For vntruth is contrary to nature, nature
helpeth reason, reason is seruaunt to truth; and one truth is not
contrary to another, that is to say, to it selfe. For truth cannot
be but truth, and Reason, reason.</p>
            <p>The like may wee say of the incarnation of the Sonne of
God; that no man could of himselfe haue imagined it, nor as
now also conceiue it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and yet not withstanding, that reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:13215:12"/>
able both to teach it vs, and to defende it. What will she say
then to vs in this behalfe? That the workes which IESVS
wrought could not proceede, neither from a man, nor from a
deuil, nor from an Angell considered in their seuerall kindes,
but onely from God the maker of heauen and earth. And this
will she proue vnto vs, both in the respect of the history, and
in respect of the kindes of his workes, as well by the Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
and Philosophers who were enemies to Christ and
his doctrine, as by conclusions of necessitie conueyed from the
principles which remaine in the natures of euery of them.
And what will ensue thereof, but that Iesus woorking by the
power of God, was sent of God, and therefore ought to bee
heard and beleeued? Beleeued (say I) to bee God the sonne of
God, because hee sayth it; and to bee man borne of woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the world sawe him to be so; &amp; that otherwise he should
be an enemie to God, and God an enemie to mankind; God (I
say) too good to assist him with his power to our ouerthrowe,
and too wise to lend him his spirit, to the defacing of his owne
glory? But if vngodlines stirre coales; Reason will open her
mouth and shewe, that it was agreable to Gods Iustice, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for mans welfare; possible to the power of the creator,
and agreeable to his wil and promises; behooffull for our base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and beseeming his glorie. And euen in vngodlines it selfe
she will find wherewith to put vngodlines to silence, howbeit
that euen in all godlines, she findeth not wherewith to speake
thereof sufficiently. The same is to bee vnderstood of other
like misteries, which shalbe treated of in their due places. And
this bringeth vs backe againe to the saide point, that the truth
beeing reuealed, enlighteneth reason; and that reason rowseth
vp her selfe to rest vpon truth. And so farre off is Reason from
abasing fayth, to make vs attaine thereto, that contrariwise she
lifteth vs vp as it were vpon her shoulders, to make vs to see it,
and to take it for our guide, as the onely thing that can bring
vs to God; and the onely schoolemistresse of whome we ought
to learne our saluation. To bee short, we say not that because.
Reason comprehendeth not this or that, therefore lette vs
not beleeue it: for that were a measuring of Fayth by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as they say. But wee say that Reason and Nature haue
such a Rule, and that that is the common way, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:13215:12"/>
that this thing or that thing is done or spoken
beyond reason and beyond nature. I say then that the worke
and word of God are an extraordinarie case, &amp; that forasmuch
as they are of God, it behoueth vs to beleeue them; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
is to submit our reason and vnderstanding to him. And
so it is a making of reason seruant to faith by reason, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of reason to stoope to the highnesse of faith: and not an
abasing of faith to the measure of reason.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch as we take reason to our helpe against the
Infidels, the proofes which she shall yeeld vnto vs to guide
vs to the doctrine and schoole of faith, shalbe chiefly of two
sorts; namely, Arguments &amp; Records. The Arguments which
we will vse against the Iewes, we will take out of the grounds
of the Iewish Religion, the maiestie of God, the nature and
state of man, and the most euident and best authorised prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or conclusions among them. Against the Gentiles, wee
will take them out of their substantiallest Rules, out of the
most renowmed Authors of Philosophie, and out of the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of their owne most approued Interpreters; one while
abiding vpon their principles, &amp; another while standing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the conclusions which they themselues do gather of them, &amp;
sometimes drawing such necessarie consequents and sequeales
out of them my selfe, as they oftentimes perceiued not, as
though they had not vnderstood what they themselues spake.
Also against either of them, wee will iudge of the cause by
his effects, and of the effects by their cause; of the end, by the
instrument or moouer thereto, and of the mouer, by the end,
&amp; so forth of other things: which are the strongest arguments
that can be, as which are either demonstratiue, or very neere
demonstratiue. At a word, we will not alledge any argument
which shall not be substantiall, or at leastwise which we shall
not thinke to be so, neither will wee vrge any thing whereof
we be not throughly perswaded in our selues: choosing alway
the euidentest &amp; easiest that we can, to apply our selues to all
mens capacities. Notwithstanding, let not any man looke here
for arguments that may bee felt, as that I should proue fire
to be hotte by touching it, or the mysteries of GOD and
Religion by the outward sence: but let it suffise him that
mine argumentes shal bee fully as apparant, and commonly
<pb facs="tcp:13215:13"/>
more apparant, than the argumentes which the Philosophers
alledge in naturall things: Howbeit that <hi>Aristotle</hi> would haue
men to looke for argumentes of lesse sorce at his hande in his
first Philosophie, then in his discourses of naturall thinges; and
for reasons of lesse force in his morals (so they be likely,) than
in his first &amp; highest Philosophie: which thing we may with
much better right require in the thinges that surmount both
nature and man, that is to witte, in Diuinitie. Moreouer, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heere shall bee questions propounded to vnfold, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
made to bee confuted, which might trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if he were not satisfied in them, or else breake off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of our proofes. And in them I shal be compelled now
and then to be obscure, either by reason that the nature of the
thing depending in controuersie, may perchaunce bee of some
old forworne opinion, or els in respect of the tearmes peculiar
to the case, which may hap to be lesse vnderstood of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sorte, and more diffuze, and lesse pithie in our language,
wherein such things haue not hitherto bene treated of. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
I hope to take such paines in the opening of them
that the Reader whosoeuer he be, if he take any heede at all,
shall easily attaine to the vnderstanding of them.</p>
            <p>As touching the Records, they shalbe (in my iudgement)
of the worthiest sort, and such as are least to be suspected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
as neere as I can choose. We be to declare our doctrine
vnto men, &amp; men themselues are a part of the doctrine which
we set foorth. And what more clearenesse can there bee, than
to make themselues parties in the proofe, Iudges in their own
case, and witnesses against themselues? Vnto men therefore we
will bring the witnessings of men, euen the things that euerie
man readeth in his owne nature, and in his owne heart, from
whence hee vttereth them either wittingly or vnwittingly, as
things that are so written there, that he cannot wype them out
though he would neuer so faine. These are common insightes,
or inse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s (as a man may tearme them) namely the perswasion
of the Godhead, the conscience of euill, the desire of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
the longing for felicitie, and such other thinges, which in
this neather world are incident vnto man alone, and in al men,
without the which a man is no more a man; insomuch that hee
cannot deny them except he be out of his wittes, nor cal them
<pb facs="tcp:13215:13"/>
in question without beiying of himself wrongfully. And here
of proceedeth the agreeable consent of all mankind in certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
beleefes which depend immediatly vpon the said Principles;
which consent we ought to hold for certaine and vndoubted.
For the vniuersalnesse of this consent she weth that it is nature,
and not instruction, imitation, or bringing vp, that speaketh, &amp;
the voice or nature is the voice of truth. As for lying or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
it is a fondling, and not a thing bred; a meere corruption,
and not a fruit of nature. Neuerthelesse, whether it were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
ignorance which hath as good as choked the, or through
frowardnesse which hath turned reason a wrong way &amp; made
man as a stranger to himselfe: those common and generall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
haue remained ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ren in the most part of men. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
some men in sundrie nations haue mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the common rate, and indeuored to cherish and aduaunce
the said Insights, and drawen some small sparkes of truth and
wisedome out of them, as out of some little fire raked vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a great heape of ashes; the which they haue afterward
taught vnto others; and for so doing haue bene called Sophies
and Philosophers, that is to say, Wise men and louers of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
These also doo we take for witnesses of our doctrine;
and amongst them, the notablest and such as the world hath
esteemed to be wisest. And wheresoeuer they shall disagree,
either one with another, or with themselues; there shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason be Iudge. And like as they haue caught some
sparkes from the fire, so will we kindle a fire of their sparkes:
how be it (in verie deed) not to lead vs to saluation the hauen of
our life; for in that behalfe we haue neede of God himselfe to
be our Pilote: but to shew vs as it were from a Tower; which
way it standeth in the darke wherin we now be, to the end we
may call to God for helpe, and euer after make thither ward
with all our whole hart. Particularly against the Atheists and
Epicures, we will bring themselues, the world, &amp; the creatures
therein for witnesses. For those are the Recordes which they
best loue and most beleeue, &amp; from the which they be lothest
to depart. Against the false naturalists [that is to say professors
of the knowledge of nature and naturall things] I will alledge
nature it selfe, the Sectes that haue sought out nature, &amp; such
writers in euery Sect, as they hold for chiefe Disciples, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
<pb facs="tcp:13215:14"/>
and Anatomists or Decipherets of nature; as <hi>Pyt hago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Plato, Aristotle,</hi> the <hi>Academikes</hi> and <hi>peripatetikes</hi> both old and
new, and speciallie such as haue most stoutly defended their
owne Philosophie, and impugned our doctrine; as <hi>Iamblich,
Plotin, Porphirie, Procle, Simplice,</hi> and such others: whose depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
or rather oppositions against vs, I thinke men will
wonder at.</p>
            <p>Against the Iewes I will produce the old Testament, for
that is the Scripture where to their fathers trusted, and for the
which they haue suffered death, &amp; whereby they assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of life. And for the interpreting thereof, I will alledge
their Paraphrasts, &amp; those which translated it into the Greeke
and Chaldey tongues afore the comming of our Lord Iesus
Christ. For they were Iewes borne, of the notablest men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, chosen by publike authoritie to translate it, and at
that time reason was not so intangled with passions, as it hath
bene since. Also I will alledge their ancient doctors, dispersed
as well in their Cabales as in their Talmud, which are their
bookes of greatest authoritie and most credit. And diuerse
times I will interlace the Commentaries of their late writers,
which generally haue bene most contrarie to the Christen do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
whom (notwithstanding) the truth hath compelled se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally
to agree, in expounding the Texts whereon the same
is chiefly grounded.</p>
            <p>Now in these allegations I shall sometimes be long, and
peraduenture tedious to the Reader, whome manifest reason
shall haue satisfied alreadie, so as (to his seeming) there needed
not so manie testimonies. But I pray him to beleeue, that in
this longnesse of mine, I straine my nature to apply myselfe
to all men; knowing that some like better of Reasons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome
of Testimonies; and that all men (notwithstanding
that they make more account of the one than of the other) are
best satisfied by both, when they see, both reason authorised
by witnesses, (for that is as much to say, as that many men had
one selfe same reason) and also Recordes declared by reason;
for that is as much to say, as that credit is not giuen to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
person, but to the diuine thing which the person hath
within him, that is to wit, to Reason. Herewithall I thought
also, that all men haue not either the meane to come by all
<pb facs="tcp:13215:14"/>
bookes, or the leysure to read them; whose labour I haue by
that meane eased. And oftentimes I am driuen to doo that in
one Chapter; whereof others haue made whole volumes.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I pray the Reader, first to read this booke
throughout, for without mounting by degrees, a man cannot
attaine to high things; and the breaking of a ladders steale ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
a man backe, &amp; maketh the thing wearisome which was
easie. Secondly I desire him to bring his wit rather than his
will, to the reading thereof. For foredeemings and foresetled
opinions doo bring in bondage the reason of them that haue
best wits; wheras notwithstanding, it belongeth not to the will
to ouerrule the wit, but to the wit to guide the will. Thirdly
and most of all I beseech him to beare alwaie in mind that I
am a man, and among men, one of the least; that is to say, that
if I satisfie him not in all points, my reason attaineth not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewhere
so far as truth doth; to the end that mine ignorance
and weakenesse preiudice not the case, mine vndertaking
whereof, in good sooth is not vpon trust of mine owne wit, or
of mine owne abilitie; but vpon assured trust of the cleernesse,
soundnesse, substantialnesse, and soothnesse thereof.</p>
            <p>Now God vouchsafe to shead out his blessing vpon this
worke, and by the furtherance thereof to glad them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
to confirme them that wauer, &amp; to confute them which
go about to shake downe his doctrine. This is the onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that I desire, the onely fruit which I seeke of my labour.
And (to say the truth) I feele alreadie some effect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
thereof in my hart. But lette vs praie him also to
vouchsafe in our daies, to touch our stonie harts with the force<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of his spirit, and with his owne finger to plant his doctrine
so deeply in them, as it may take roote and bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
foorth fruit. For certesse it is Gods worke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
and win men, albeit that to counsell
them, yea and to mooue them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in some sort to lie
in man.</p>

that whereas our eyes cannot pearce vnto God; he suffereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

properly by knowing it, but as it were by feeling it, which is more
certeine: yea, and that the béeing of our Soule is nothing els, but
the knowing of God vpon whom it dependeth. And <hi>Auicen</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
yet more boldly, saying that he which acknowledgeth not the
Godhead, is voyd, not of Reason, but euen of Sence. Now, if these
Sences from whence our first knowledge proceedeth, doo witnesse
the thing vnto vs; and wée do firmly beléeue a thing when we feele
it, and that (as they teach vs) wée may féele GOD as well in the
world as in our selues: Surely vnto him that treateth of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

nothing but the world, will not see in the world, the thing which
the world sheweth and teacheth in all parts. For, let vs begin at
the lowest, &amp; mount vp too the highest; and let vs consider it whole
together or in his parts; and wée shall not finde any thing therein,
either so great or so small, which leadeth vs not step by step vntoo a
Godhead. In this world (too consider it first in the whole,) we haue
fower degrées of things: to wit, which haue Béeing, which haue
Life, which haue Sence, and which haue Reason: Some are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
with all these giftes, and some but with some of them. The
Ayre, the Sea, and the Earth are great, and haue a great scope.
They beare vp and susteyne all things that haue Life, all things
that haue Sence, and all things that haue Reason. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
they themselues haue not any more then onely bare
Béeing, without Life, without Sence, without Reason: that is too
say, the néerest too not being. The Plants, besides being, haue also
life, and they draw their nourishment from the Earth, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresshing
from the Ayre. The Beastes haue both Béeing, Life, and
Sence, and take their foode both from the Elements and from the
Plants. Man hath Béeing, and Life, and Sence, and Reason; and
he inioyeth the Elements, liueth of the Plants, commaundeth the
Beastes, and discourseth of all things both aboue him and beneath
him. Lo heere an order, such from degrée too degrée, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
conceiueth not by and by some Author thereof, hath neither
Reason nor Sence, no nor is worthie too haue either life or béeing.
I pray you from whence commeth this goodly proportion, and this
orderly procéeding of things by degrées? Whence commeth the
difference in their partitions? Whence commeth it that the hugest
and widest things are vnderlings to the least and weakest things?
Whereof commeth it that some things haue but a dead being, and
next vnto notbeing; and that othersome haue a beeing that is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
sensible, and reasonable, howbeit some more, and some lesse?
Commeth it of the things themselues? How can that bée? For sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that nothing doth willingly become an vnderling vnto others:
why bée not the heauiest masses allotted to the best shares? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
commeth it that the liuing things which in respect of the whole
Sea are but as a drop, and in respect of the whole Earth are but
as a grayne of dust, are in degrée of preheminence aboue them?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13215:17"/>
And whereof commeth it, that man being the fraylest of all liuing
wightes, is serued by the Elements, by the Plants, and by the
Beastes, yea euen by the wildest of them? Then is there a deuider
or distributer of these things, who hauing imparted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too others,
had them first himselfe, and that most aboundantly; and who more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
is of necessitie, almightie, seeing that in so vnequall partition,
he holdeth them neuerthelesse in concorde. I say further, that all
things are comprized vnder these fower: that is too wit, vnder <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Life, Sence, and Reason,</hi> according too his diuers imparting
of them vnto all things.</p>
               <p>Now I demaund, whether was first, of <hi>Beeing</hi> or <hi>Notbeing;</hi>
of <hi>Liuing</hi> or <hi>Notliuing;</hi> of <hi>Sensible,</hi> or <hi>Notsensible;</hi> of <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
or <hi>Notreasonable?</hi> Surely it was neither Reasonable, nor
Sensible, nor liuing; for the time hath bin that wée were not. But
wee knowe that wee had fathers, and that our fathers had forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
and the ende of them maketh vs too beléeue that they had a
beginning. In like cace is it with beasts and plants; for wée know
the bréeding, growing, decaying and fading of them. Much more
then may wée say the same of <hi>Being.</hi> For the things héere beneath
which haue but onely bare beeing, are farre inferiour too the other
things; and therefore cannot bring foorth themselues, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
much lesse bring foorth the other things. It remaineth then
that <hi>Notbeeing, Notliuing, Notsensible,</hi> and <hi>Notreasonable,</hi>
were afore <hi>Beeing, Liuing, Sensible,</hi> and <hi>Reasonable.</hi> And yet
notwithstanding wée haue both Béeing, Life, Sence, and Reason.
It followeth therefore that it is a power from without vs, which
hath brought vs out of Notbéeing into béeing, and hath parted the
said gifts among vs diuerlly according too his good pleasure. For
otherwise, from out of that nothing which wée were (If I may so
terme it,) we should neuer haue come too be any thing at all. Now
betweene nothing and something, (how little so euer that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can bee) there is an infinite space. Néedes therefore must it be
that the cause thereof was infinite (at leastwise if it may bée called a
cause,) and that is the very same which we call God.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the nature of the Elements whereof the whole
is compated. The Fyre is contrarie too the Water, and the dry to
the moyst; and of these contraries are infinite other things produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vnder them. Now the nature of contraries is too destroy one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and no twoo things, euen of the least, can bee coupled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but by the working of a higher power that is able too compell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13215:17"/>
them. But wée see that these things doo not incroche or vsurpe one
vppon another, but contrariwise that they match toogither in the
composing of many things: and yet notwithstanding that not so
much as two strings beeing of one selfesame nature, can agree in
one tune, without the wit of a man that can skill too streine them
and too slake them as he seeth it good. It followeth therefore that
the heauenly harmonie wherein so many contraries are made too
accord both vniuersally and particularly, are set toogither and guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a spirit. Insomuch that if we will say, that according too the
comon opinion, the aire is spread foorth as a stickler betweene the
Fyre and the Water, and is ioyned too the one by his moysture,
and too the other by his heate: Yée must needes say also, that there
is a great and souerein Iudge aboue them, which hath made them
too abyde that stickler.</p>
               <p>Let vs mount vp higher. Wee see the Heauen how it mowweth
round with a continuall mouing. Also wee see there the Planets
one vnder another, which (notwithstanding the violence of the first
moueable) haue euery one his seuerall course and mouing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And shall wee say that these mouings happen by aduenture?
But the same aduenture which made them to moue, should also
make them to stand still. Agein, as for aduenture or chaunce, it is
nothing els but disorder and confusion: but in all these diuersities,
there is one vniformitie of mouing, which is neuer interrupted.
How then? Doo they moue of them selues? Nay; for nothing
moueth it selfe, and where things moue one another, there is no
possibilitie of infinite holding on; but in the end men must be faine
to mount vpto a first beginning, and that is a rest. As for example,
from the hammer of a Clocke wée come too a whéele, and from that
whéele too another, and finally too the wit of the Clockmaker, who
by his cunning hath so ordered them, that notwithstanding that he
maketh them all too moue, yet he himselfe remoueth not. It remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
then that of all these mouings, wée must imagine one <hi>[Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer]</hi>
vnmouable: and of all these so constant diuersities, one [vnua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable]
alwaies like it selfe: and of all these bodies, one spirite. And
like as from the Earth wée haue styed vp too the Ayre, from the
Ayre too the Skye, from the Skye too the Heauen of Heauens, still
mounting vp from greater too greater, from light too light, and
from subtile to subtile: so let vs aduaunce our selues yet one degrée
higher, namely too the infinite, too the light which is not too bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
but in vnderstanding, and too the quickening spirit; in respect
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13215:18"/>
whereof, the thing that wée woonder at héere beneath, is lesse then
a poynt, our light is but a shadowe, and our spirit is but a vapour.
And yet notwithstanding he hath so paynted out his glorie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuitenesse,
euen in the things which wée most despise; as that euen
the grossest wits may easely comprehend it.</p>
               <p>Let vs come downe againe too doo the like heere belowe. Wée
shall see the Earth replenished with Herbes, Trees, and Fruites:
both Sea and Land furnished with Beastes, Fisshes, Woormes,
and Birds of al sorts; euery of them so perfect in his kind, as mans
vnderstanding cannot spye any want or superstuitie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whence
is all this? Is it of the Elements? Nay, how shall the thing which
hath neither life nor sence, giue life and sence too other things? Or
commeth it of the Sunne? Nay, when did wée euer see him bring
foorth any such like thing: Whence then is this varietie, but of a
mast fruitfull &amp; vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumable might? Whence commeth this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but of a singular wisedome? Of Plants, some are hot, and
some cold; some swéete, and some bitter; some nourishing, and some
healing. And of the most daungerous, the remedie is found either
in themselues or in the next vnto them. Also as touching Beastes,
the wildest and such as liue by pray, kéepe by themselues alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the flocking of them together would bee noysome. But the
tame &amp; such as are most for our profite, doo naturally liue in flockes
and heardes, because the great numbers of them are for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.
Is this also a worke of fortune? Nay, I say further: The
Sunne heateth the Earth, the Starres doo limit her seazons, the
Ayre moysteneth her drought; the Earth serueth the Grasse, the
Grasse serueth the Beasts, and the Beasts serue Man. Each thing
serueth other, and all serue one alone. Whence may this bonde
come? If things bée euerlastingly, and of themselues; how haue
they thus put themselues in subiection? By what meanes or when
began they first too do so? Also how can one of them be for another,
seeing that the ende wherefore things are, is euer afore the things
themselues, either in nature, or els in consideration; and that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie
hath not any thing either afore or after it? So that if they
haue had their beginning of themselues; did they bring foorth them
selues in seed, in flower, or in kernell? in Egge, or in full life? small
or great, and so foorth? Againe, seeing that the one cannot bée with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other, neither Beastes without Grasse, nor Grasse without
the Earth, nor the Earth bring foorth any thing without the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
which of them came afore, and which of them came after? Or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13215:18"/>
if they were all bred together: whence commeth this agréement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
so many diuers things; but of the same mynd which made
and still gouerneth all things? Seeing then that these things are
so linked together, and that they tend all to one: let vs conclude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that that cannot come to passe but through one, who brought
them foorth altogether at one instaunt and one burthen, when hee
thought good. But now let vs see whence commeth this other one
wherunto they tend, that is to wit Man; and whether he also bée
not for and by that one which hath made them, that is to wit, for
and by God.</p>
               <p>He that seeth but onely the portrayture of a man,<note place="margin">Man leaded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by to thinke vpon a Paynter; and the first speech that he vttereth,
is to aske who made it. Now, if a dead worke doe make vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a liuing worker: much more reason is it, that a liuing worke
as man is, should make vs to bethinke vs of a quickening worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister:
yea euen of such a one as may bée (at least wise) as farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
man, as man is aboue the portrayture of his owne making,
(forsomuch as there is an infinite distaunce betwixt being and not
being, liuing and not liuing;) and the same againe is God. The
proportion in mans bodie, which is so well obserued, that all our
Artes doe borrow from thence, doth witnesse vnto vs a singuler
Cunning: and the parts also in that they all serue each others vse,
and euery of them serue the whole; betoken a great wisedome.
Now, where Cunning and wisedome bee, there chaunce hath no
place. For when a man loseth an eye, an arme, or a legge; wée follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
the common error do commonly say, it is a mischaunce. But
when a member that was out of ioynt is set in againe, or a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that was lost is supplyed, though it be but with a botched one:
none of vs will say it was chaunce; because that in the iudgement
euen of the grossest sort, the propertie of chaunce is to vndo and to
marre things, and not to make or mend any thing at all. Againe,
by our Sences which conceiue al Colours, Sounds, Sents, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors,
and Féelings; wée may see, heare, smell, tast, and feele, that
one selfsame workman made both the Sences, and the things that
are subiect to the Sences. For to what purpose were the Sences
without the sensible things? or the sensible things, without the
Sences? And seeing that they relye one vpon another; which of
them was bred first in the world? If man made them for his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
why maketh he not the like still? If he made himselfe to bée
borne for them; why suffereth he himselfe to bée bereft of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13215:19"/>
one after another? Then is it to be sought for elswhere then in
man. But when in the same man we yet further consider Spéech:
must wee not needes say that he was made to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to many? And how are they borne one for another? Againe,
when wee come to his Mynd, which in discoursing reacheth farre
beyond all sensible things; shall wee not say that there are things
merely to bee comprehended by vnderstanding, for the which the
Mynd was made? And on the other side, if wee finde a Mynde in
our selues which are but a little grayne of the whole world; dare
wee say that there is no Mynd elswhere then in our selues? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
seeing that by this Mynd of ours wee vnderstand all other
things; which Mynd yet for all that vnderstandeth not ne knoweth
not it selfe, neither perceiue wee what or whence this Mynde is
which so vnderstandeth in vs: ought wee not to acknowledge that
there is a Mynd aboue vs, whereby wee haue vnderstanding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, and which vnderstandeth &amp; knoweth in vs the things
which wee our selues knowe not there?</p>
               <p>Now then, seeing we vnderstand not ne knowe not our selues,
(my meaning is that we bee ignorant what we bee, and what it is
from whence our noblest actions procéede:) can we bee the authors
of our selues? And from whence then ought wée too acknowledge
our selues too haue our originall? O man, it may bee that thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
but too thy father. But from father too father, we shall come at
length too a beginning. And soothly thou art very dulheaded too
thinke thy selfe too bee the author of a man, considering that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou in begetting him, nor his Mother in bréeding him, did
once thinke vppon the fashioning of him in hir wombe: No more
(say I) than the Nuttree doth when a Nutte falleth from it to the

man, tell mee why thou hast not children when thou wouldest, and
why thou hast them sometime when thou wouldest not? Why hast
thou a Daughter, when thou wouldest haue a Sonne, or a Sonne
when thou wouldest haue a Daughter? In peinting thy Pictures
thou doest not so disapoint thy felfe. Also, if thou beest this good
workemaister in making of thy child; tell me how thou hast fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Seest thou this, which is also as smally in thy power, as if it
were none of thine? Tell mée what is hidden in his breast, and the
whole workemanship that is couched within him. If thou hast not
seene it in the opening of thy like, thou knowest nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Tell mée yet further the imaginations of his brayne, and the
thoughts of his heart: nay, tell mee thine owne, which oftentimes
thou wouldest fame alter or stay, and canst not. It is a bottem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Pit, the which thou canst not gage: and therefore it followeth
that thou madest it not. Knowe thou therefore O man, that all this
commeth too thee from some cause that is aboue thy selfe. And sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that thou hast vnderstanding, needes must that cause haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

needes must that vnderstand thee: and seeing that thou after a sort
art infinite in nomber, but much more infinite in thy thoughts and

               <p>Nowe like as all men may reade in this booke as well of the
world as of themselues;<note place="margin">Vniuersall Consent.</note> so was there neuer yet any Nation vnder

to the diuersitie of their owne imaginations. Let a man
ronne from East to West, and from South to North: let him
ransacke all ages one after another: and wheresoeuer he findeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, there shall he find also a kind of Religion and Seruing of
God, with Prayers and Sacrifices. The diuersitie whereof is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13215:20"/>
great; but yet they haue alwayes consented all in this poynt,
That there is a GOD. And as touching the diuersitie which is in
that behalf, it beareth witnesse that it is a doctrine not deliuered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only
from people to people; but also bred and brought vp with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of them in their owne Clymate, yea and euen in their owne
selues. Within these hundred yeres many Nations haue bene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
and many are daily discouered still, which were vnknowen
in former ages. Among them, some haue bene found to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Lawe, without King, without House, going starke naked, and
wandring abroad in the fields: but yet none without some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, none without some spice of Religion: to shewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, that it is not so natural a thing in man to loue company, and
to clad himselfe against hurts of the wether, (which things wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
to be verie kindly:) as it is naturall vnto him to knowe the
author of his life, that is to say, God. Or if wee yeeld more to the
iudgement of those which were counted wise among the Heathen
nations, (whome afterward by a more modest name men called
Philosophers:) The <hi>Brachmanes</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the
<hi>Magies</hi> among the <hi>Persians,</hi> neuer began any thing without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto God. The lessons of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and of their
Disciples, began with prayer and ended with prayer. The aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Poets (who were all Philosophers,) as <hi>Orphey, Homer, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siodus,
Pherecides,</hi> and <hi>Theognis,</hi> speake of none other thing.
The Schooles of the <hi>Stoikes, Academikes,</hi> and <hi>Peripatetikes,</hi>
and all other schooles that florished in old time, roong of that. The
very Epicures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues who were shamelesse in all other things,
were ashamed to denie God. To be short, the men of old time (as
witnesseth <hi>Plato</hi>) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hose their Priestes (which were to haue regard
of the seruice that was to be yéelded vnto God,) from among the
Philosophers, as from among those which by their consideration
of nature, had atteined to knowe God. And so (which sildome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
but in an apparant trueth) the opinion of the comon people
and the opinion of the wise, haue met both iump togither in this
point.</p>
               <p>Well may there bee found in all ages some wretched kaytifes,
which haue not acknowledged God, as there be some euen at this
day. But if we looke into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either they were some yong fooles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer to their pleasures, which neuer had leysure to bethinke
them of the matter, and yet when yeeres came vppon them, came
backe againe to the knowing of themselues, and consequently of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13215:20"/>
God: or els they were some persons growen quite out of kind, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in wickednesse, and such as had defaced their own nature in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues; who to the intent they might practise all maner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with the lesse remorse, haue striued to perswade themselues by
soothing their owne sinnes, that they haue no Soule at all, and that
there is no Iudge to make inquirie of their sinnes. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
if these fall into neuer so little daunger, or be but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vpon the hip, they fall to quaking, they crye out vnto heauen,
they call vpon God. And if they approch, but a farre of, vnto death,
they fall to fretting and gnashing of their téeth. And when they be
well beaten; there is not any shadowe of the Godhead so soone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vnto them, but they imbrace it: so ready are nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
(which they would haue restreined and imprisoned) to put
them in mind thereof at all howres.<note place="margin">Suctonius in the life of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula.</note> They be loth to confesse God,
for feare to stand in awe of him; and yet the feare of the least things
maketh them to confesse him. Nay, because they feare not him that
made all things, therefore they stand in awe of all things; as wee
see in the Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> who threatened the Ayre if it ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpon his Gameplayers; and yet notwithstanding he wrapped
his Cape about his head, or hid himselfe vnder his Bed, at euery
flash of lightening. I beléeue (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca in his first booke concerning Wrath.</note> concerning the same
matter) that this threatening of his did greatly hasten his death,
for so much as folke sawe that they were too beare such a one, as
could not beare, euen with the Goddes.</p>
               <p>Among the learned,<note place="margin">Obiections concerning such as were counted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists.</note> although the libertie of Sects was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse:
yet the chiefe that men counted for Atheists, were one <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
a <hi>Melian</hi> Poet, one <hi>Theodore</hi> a <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> one <hi>Ewhemere</hi>
a <hi>Tegean,</hi> and a very fewe others. But to say truely, these rather
skorned the Idolles and false Goddes of their tymes, then denyed
the true God. Accordingly as we sée many of them yet still among
vs, which hold themselues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with the knowing of vntrueth,
without seeking after the trueth; and with mocking of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
without seeking the pure and true Religion. Of the sayd
<hi>Diagoras</hi> it is reported, that as hee was burning an Image of
<hi>Hercules</hi> in his fire; he sayd, <hi>Thou must now doe me seruice in
this thirteenth incounter, as well as thou hast done to Eurist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heus
in the other twelue.</hi> This was but a skorning of Idolles.
For notwithstanding this: his Uerses began thus, that all things
are gouerned by a Godhead. Also it is reported of the other, that
he should say to the <hi>Egiptians; If they be Gods, why bewayle ye
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13215:21"/>
them? and if they be dead folkes, why worship ye them?</hi> This
also was a disprouing of the false Gods. And as for <hi>Ewhemere</hi> of
<hi>Tegea,</hi> men are of accorde that the cause why he was called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
was for that he wrate the true Historie and Genealogie of
the Heathen Gods; shewing that they were Kings, Princes, and
great Personages, whose Images being kept for a remembrance
of them were turned into Idolles, their woorthie doings into yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gamings, and their honorings into worshippings. And which
of vs at this day beleeueth not as much? There were in deede a
kinde of Philosophers called Scepticks (that is to say Dowters)
which did rather suspend their Iudgement concerning the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
then call it in question. But yet it ought to suffize vs, that
they be the selfsame which deny al Sciences, yea euen those which
consist in Demonstration; and which professe themselues to doubt
of the things which they see and feele; in so much that they doubt
whether they themselues haue any beeing or no. But yet for all
that, let vs see after what maner these kind of people doe reason.
Against the thing which the world preacheth, which Nations wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and which wise men wonder at; these folke say at a worde for
all, how shall wee beleeue that there is a God, sith we see him not?
O foole, and (which worse is) O foole by being wise in thyne owne
conceyt: Thou beléeuest that there is a Sunne, euen when thou art
in a Dongeon or in the bottome of a Prison, because his beames
are shed in at thy windowes: and doubtest thou yet still whether
there be a God or no, when he sheweth himself to thee through the
Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres; in the Ayre, the Earth, the
Sea; in all things that they conteyne, yea and euen in they selfe? If
thou haddest neuer seene Tree afore, thy wit at the very first sight
of it, would leade thée to the roote which is vnder the Tree: and the
sight of a Riuer would leade thee to the welspring thereof, which
may peraduenture be two hundred Leagues of. And whosoeuer
should tell thee the contrarie, thou wouldest stand at defiaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. O man, like as the Tree leadeth thee to the roote by
his braunches; doth not the roote leade thee likewise to the kernell,
and the kernell to him that made it? And as the Riuer leadeth thée
to his head; shal not the head leade thée to the originall spring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
seeing thou canst not doubt but it hath a beginning, sith thou
seest that it runneth with a streame? If thou shouldest arriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Indians, and finde but some sislie Cottage in the deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latest
Countrey thereof; Thou wouldest by and by conclude, this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13215:21"/>
Ile is inhabited, some man hath passed heere. And why? Because
thou seest there some tokens of mans wit, and knowest well that
the Goates which thou hast seene raunging or skipping vpon the
Rockes, can build no such thing. Now, when thou beeing borne
beneath, seest here a hundred and a hundred thousand things which
are not possible to be made by man: nay (which more is,) which it
is not possible for him to knowe nor to vnderstand: oughtest thou
not to say immediatly, Gods spirite hath passed this way, needes
must here haue bene some higher thing then man?</p>
               <p>Mention is made of certeyne precize persons,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his treatise of the ceassing of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Cilicia which was an Atheist, came to the beleef of a God, by an answere giuen from the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Mopsus, to a demaund of his whiche was deliuered sealed.</note> which beléeued
nothing but that which they sawe, and the Wizards made them
to see Deuilles: Wherevpon they came to beleeue also that there
is a God. It was a mad kinde of conuersion, to beleeue in God by
the ministerie of the Deuill. But what a number of other things
beleeuest thou which thou seest not? Thou beleeuest that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plants
haue a kinde of Soule, that is to say, a certeyne inward power or
vertue which maketh them to shoote foorth in their season. Thou
seest them, but thou seest not it; neither knowest thou whence it
commeth, or where it lyeth. Thou beleeuest that the Beastes also
haue one other kinde of Soule, which maketh them to mooue: and
yet thou seest it as little as the other. Also thou beleeuest that thou
thy self (besides these) hast an abilitie of reasoning both vpon them,
and vpon thy selfe, and vpon such as are like thy selfe. And yet as
touching the bodie, thou seest not any thing altered in the partes
thereof after death; neither within nor without. Where is that
Soule then, or where hast thou euer seene it? If thou beleeue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
because of the effects which thou seest, which cannot come from
any thing els: I assure thée euen by the same effects, that if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
nothing thereof but that which thou seest with thyne eyes;
thyne eyes see not but by thy Soule, and thyne eyes themselues
see not thy Soule. To be short, thou beléeuest that thou hast a face,
which without a looking Glasse thou seest not: And wilt thou not
beléeue there is a God, whose face shineth foorth in all things?</p>
               <p>Othersome to shewe themselues more fineheaded, haue arge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
thus. If there bee a GOD, he must needes be a bodily liuing
wight, or els he should be sencelesse. And if he haue sences, then is
he chaungeable; and if he be chaungeable, then may be perish: that
is to say, he is no longer God. Beasts are they in very deed, which
can conceiue no better then that which is common to Beasts.</p>
               <p>Others haue sayd thus: If he be without bodie, he is also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13215:22"/>
Soule, and consequently without action. Or if he be a bodie, he
is subiect to the chaunges therof. Alas that they should not be abls
to conceiue a Spirite without a bodie, nor to see that euen in our
selues it is the onely Soule that worketh, and that the bodie stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not but as it is moued by the Soule.</p>
               <p>Others againe do reason, that if there be a God, he must needes
be perfectly happie: and if he be perfectly happie, he is vertuous: if
vertuous, he ouermaistereth his affections: and if he ouermaister
his affections, he is tempted of his lustes; a thing altogether vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
the Godhead. And by these incouneniences they conclude,
that there is no God at all: not perceiuing, or rather wilfully refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to perceiue that which <hi>Plutarke</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarke in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>reatise of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue.</note> sayth very well: namely, that
the person which ouermaistereth his affections, is but halfe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but the stayed person is wholly vertuous, because the one doth
but bridle his passions by force of reason, whereas the other hath
them alreadie settled according to reason, But there is yet more in
God: for he is reason it selfe, and there is nothing in him but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sou.
Soothly this kind of reasoning of theirs agréeth in effect with
this saying of <hi>Xenophanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xenophanes as he is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria in his Stromats.</note> that if Beastes were able to paynt,
they would portray God like to themselues, because they could not
naturally conceiue any further. Such and other like are the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of these goodly Philosophers, which euen little babes might
laugh to skorne: but els they could not haue bene against so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and euident a trueth. And yet dare I also well assure you, that
they themselues knewe the falsenesse of those arguments, but that
they were as it were sworne to doubt of all things, and to gainsay
all things.</p>
               <p>Let vs then conclude with the learned and the ignoraunt, the
<hi>Greekes</hi> and the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Men and Beastes, things sensible
and sencelesse, the whole and euery part thereof: That there is a
God. And if there bee yet any folke that caste doubts thereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring
to race out not onely God but also man himselfe out of
their hearts: let vs boldly appeale euen vnto themselues; not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at all, but that their owne Conscience which cannot be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
will one day make them to vnderstand it.</p>

haue proued already) there went a <hi>Notbeeing.</hi> The residue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how diuers so euer they be, are all conueied in the one <hi>Beeing,</hi>
and this one <hi>Beeing</hi> must needes rest in the power of one first <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
whereof the being which we sée, is but a shadowe. Againe, in
all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which we sée; we reduce the particulars too an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the vnderkinds to an vpperkind, and the vpperkind to a most
generall. As for example, we reduce all particular humane persons
vnder the terme of man; All men vnder the terme of Wight; all
wights vnder the terme of liuing things; and all liuing things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the terme of things that are or be; alwayes referring euery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
to some vnitie, and the same vnitie to another vnitie which
is more vniuersall. It remaineth then that when we can mount no
higher, we must distinguish y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things that are, into the thing which
is of it selfe, and the thing which is not of it selfe. That which is
not of it selfe, is the World and all that euer is therein, as I haue
proued afore. That which is of it selfe, is the thing which we cal
God, beyond whom nothing can bee imagined, and by whome all
things both are and haue bene, as which could haue no beeing of
themselues. Now to produce from Notheeing into beeing, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
an infinite power. For betweene nothing and something is an
infinite distance; and two infinites cannot be abidden, no nor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
together. For the infinitenesse of the one doth incloase and
bynd the power of the other, and looke whatsoeuer is giuen too the
one, is taken away from all others. Therefore like as there must
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13215:23"/>
néedes be one Infinite, so must there be but only one, yea and most
simply one: from whose vnitie neuerthelesse flowe all the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which we sée in the whole world, like as from a Pricke, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth
a Lyne, an outside, and all substantiall bodies. And of vnitie
or one in nombering, proceedeth euen and odde, round and square,
and all the multiplicities, proportions, and harmonies which wee
sée: sauing that the Pricke and the vnitie of nomber are interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and interlaced with all things, whereas the foresayd most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and alonly One, abyding still one in it selfe, bringeth foorth all
the other vnities, and conteineth them all.</p>
               <p>Let vs examine euery sort of things seuerally by them selues,
and we shall learne the like still in them. In the Elements wee see
contrarie qualities &amp; operations. And where contraries are, there
néede but two heads to set them at warre. For they cannot dwell
together, neither can they match together, and much lesse can they
reigne together. The further that any of them extendeth his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
the lesse can hee away with any fellowe. Now then if one rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
ouer the Heate, and another ouer the Colde; one ouer the
Dryth, and another ouer the Moysture; so as there were diuers
makers or gouerners of the worlde: wee should also see diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of factions, Element against Element in the whole worlde
and in euery thing that is compounded, and continual warre in the
middes of their Bowels. But now see we no such thing; but euery
of them imbraceth other, both in the whole and in euery seuerall
thing, notwithstanding that naturally they displace and destroy
one another.</p>
               <p>Furthermore they stand not at defyance alone by them selues,
but the Sea becleapeth the Earth, the Sea and Earth togither are
lapped vp in the Ayre, the Ayre is compast about with the Skye,
and euery of them stoopeth vnder other; insomuch that of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties
ye see there procéedeth a goodly vniformitie. Séeing then
that there are not two factions, there is but one maker, and seeing
they yeeld all into one, it cannot be but also by one. In the Earth
wee see Riuers, which runne a very long race, but yet from one
head: and againe many streames, which yeeld themselues all into
one, which one is the Sea; and the Sea also being vndiuidable
passeth through the whole inferiour world. Like as they come out
of one vnitie, so doe they yeeld themselues vp into one other vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
In the Heauen wee obserue infinite diuers mouings, but yet
all obeying vnto one. There is one light which sheadeth it selfe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13215:23"/>
throughout all places, but yet it procéedeth from one onely; which
seemeth to multiply it selfe infinitely, &amp; yet cannot by any meanes
be parted: I meane one Sunne, whose beames spreading out on
all sides, doe reach from the Skye vnto the Earth, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
continue still fast knit together in one bond by one vnitie.
Now all these parts, which procéede from one and tend to one, doe
make vs to beléeue that all procéede from one most single one.</p>
               <p>Againe, in the things that haue life, as in Hearbes and Trées;
wee see a barke, a stalke or trunke, many boughes or braunches,
and an infinite number of leaues. The bodie hath no likenesse to
the leaues, nor the leaues to the fruite, nor the fruite to the blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes.
And yet doe all these come from one roote, which hath his
force vnited to it selfe; and the roote springing of a kernell or of a
grayne, (which cannot be the work of any mo then one workman)
conteyueth all the sayd diuersities in his vniformitie, and of it selfe
alone yéeldeth foorth infinite of the same kinde; and of one begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of life which is not multiplyed in it selfe, maketh it selfe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of life (as well within it selfe as without it selfe) vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things that haue life.</p>
               <p>Likewise as touching wights, wee see in euery of them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
diuers parts. Outwardly, Head, Eyes, Nose, Eares, Téeth,
Tongue, Féete, Tayle, and so foorth: and inwardly the Heart, the
Lungs, the Stomacke, the Liuer, the Bowelles, the Kidneys, the
Bones, the Sinewes, the Heartstrings, the Ueynes, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things. The beginning of this whole Masse and of all those so
manifold parts, is next cousen vnto nothing; a very small drop, of
one shape, but onely one. Yet notwithstanding, it hath the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of life and sence vnited in it selfe; which multiplyeth it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many abilities, sences, actions, and mouings: and that not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
onely, but also outwardly in infinite numbers of the same
kinde, which in processe of tyme doe fill whole Countries. So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
is this principle in nature, that all multitudes come from an
vnitie or One, and that there cannot bee any multitude, vnlesse the
same haue first bin no multitude. But wee take no héede of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee see it euery day: and yet is it giuen vs to looke vpon, to
the end we should haue regard of it. Howbeit, forasmuch as man is
both the image of God, and the Counterpane of the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
wee cannot sée this vnitie so apparantly in any thing, as in
man himselfe.<note place="margin">Man leadeth vs to one God.</note> If we looke vpon his bodie, all the parts thereof are
made one for another, and minister one to another with mutuall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13215:24"/>
dueties: and without so doing, he could not continue nor liue. The
Eyes guyde the Féete; the Féete beare the Eyes; by one part the
things that are néedful are taken in; and by another the things that
are superfluous are voyded out: and all and euery of them referre
their doings to the benefite of the whole bodie. This vnion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
operations tending al to one poynt, shewes that the framing
of man was made by one onely workemanship. And as the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
is but one, so must the workemaister also néedes bée but
one. For, like as by a building that is made by péeces and of diuers
proportions, we deeme the diuersitie of the maysterbuilders; so by
the vniformitie thereof we iudge it to be the deuise and wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of one alone. The Ueynes are spred foorth throughout the
whole bodie, howbeit from one welhead, that is to say from the
Liuer: so be the Sinewes, howbeit from the Brayne; So likewise
are the Heartstrings, howbeit from the Heart. By these thrée sorts
of Cunditpypes, are life, sence, and breath shead foorth euen to the
least and vttermost parts, and the braunches thereof are without
number, but the originall of all is onely one. But yet doth this
shine foorth more cleerely in the Soule of man. It hath life, sence,
and mouing. All these are dealt foorth, maynteyned, and guyded by
the onely one Soule. Here ye see alreadie one vnitie. The Soule
which hath his powers so diuers and so farre spred, is whole tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
all the whole bodie, and whole in euery part thereof, as
much in the least as in the greatest, and as much in the least as in
the whole. There ye see yet a streighter vnitie. Againe, the Soule
is yet more streightly shut vp into Mynde, which is the Soule of
the Soule, as the Apple of the Eye is the Eye of the Eye; and yet
notwithstanding, this Mynd (as entierly one as it is,) conceiueth
and doth infinite things, entereth into a thousand places without
remouing, passeth ouer the Seas, mounteth vp to the Heauens,
and reacheth downe to the deapth of the Earth. Lo here an vnitie
most streight in it selfe, and yet extended to the vtmost parts of the
world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hermes</hi> saith that <hi>the Sunnebeames of God are his Actions,
the Sunnebeames of the World are the Natures of things,
and the Sunnebeames of Man are Artes and Sciences.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs see whether the Artes and Sciences will guyde vs to
the same vnitie, whereunto those Actions and the natures of things
haue led vs alreadie, beginning at the lower, and mounting vp to
the higher. Grammer teacheth vs to bring the diuers parts of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13215:24"/>
spéech into oue congruetie, and the end thereof is to speake; and the
end of speaking is societie. Rhetorike teacheth to drawe mennes
minds to one selfsame opinion. Logike teacheth to sift out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth
from a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of falshods, which treuth can be but one. Their ends
then are congruetie, societie, vnitie of mind and trueth, which are
but sundrie sortes of vnitie. Arithmetick proceedeth from vnitie,
Geometrie from a pricke; and Musick from agréement of sounds;
and the end of them is to reduce things to one comon reason, to one
proportion, and to one harmonie, all which are kinds of vnitie, and
their braunches are braunches of the same. For Perspecttiue dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
all his lynes to one poynt: Masourie and Carpentrie tende
to vniformitie. The handicraft indeuereth to bring many powers
and many mouings vnder one, to ouerrule them all: All which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
are but sundry sorts of vnitie. Phisick tendeth to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
or restitution of health; and health is nothing els but a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned
vnion of diuers humors togither. The skill of Lawe
tendeth to Right, and there is but one Right, though there be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
wrongs. Then serues it but to mainteyne, restore, and bring
men backe ageine vnto vnitie. Let vs proceede further; Morall
Philosophie subdeweth many diuers passions and affections vnto
one reason, in one man. How shold gouernment bringeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men to the obeying of one householder: Ciuillgouernment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
many households into one Commonweale, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an vnitie of many people, whether it be vnder one Lawe
or vnder one magistrate; insomuch that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most popular Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales
haue (in their extremities) taken a Dictator, and in
their ordinarie course of gouernment a Consull, the one after the
other. Now then all that euer man conceiueth, inuenteth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
doth leade vs alwayes to an vnitie. Where vnitie is lost,
there things goe to wrecke, Artes are confounded, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales
are dissolued. Then like as in vnvnited diuersitie wee finde
waste and subuersion; so must we looke in vnity for the increase and
preseruation of all things. Now if man, and all that is within man
and without him doe leade vs to one alone: shall he suffer himselfe
to raunge out vnto many? And if all the Sonnebeames of man,
I meane his Arts and Sciences, tend too one vnitie: shall only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie
turne vs aside to a pluralitie of Goddes? Nay rather, by so
many vnities, she will make vs stye vp to the true and perfect vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and that vnitie is the onely one God.</p>
               <p>But let vs sée now how all things being so diuers in the whole
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13215:25"/>
worlde, are referred one to another. The Water moysteneth the
Earth,<note place="margin">The linking in of things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> the Ayre maketh it fatte with his showers, the Sunne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth
it and heateth it according to his seasons. The Earth
nourisheth the Plants, the Plants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eede the Beastes, &amp; the Beasts
serue man. Againe, nothing is séene here to be made for itselfe. The
Sunne shineth and heateth; but not for it selfe: the Earth heareth
and yet hath no benefite thereby: the Winds blowe, and yet they
sayle not: but all these things redound to the glory of the maker,
to the accomplishment of the whole, and to the benefite of man.
To be short, the noblest creatures haue néede of the bacest, and the
bacest are serued by the noblest; and all are so linked together from
the highest to the lowest, that the ring thereof cannot bée broken
without confusion. The Sunne cannot be Eclipsed, the Plantes
withered, or the Raine want; but all things féele the hurt thereof.
Now then, can we imagine that this woorke which consisteth of so
many &amp; so diuers péeces, tending all to one end, so cuppled one to
another, making one body, &amp; ful of so apparant consents of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
procéedeth from elsewhere than from the power of one alone?
When in a féeld we sée many Battels, diuers Standerds, sundry
Liueries, and yet all turning head with one swaye; wee conceiue
that there is one Generall of the field, who commandeth them all.
Also when in a Citie or a Realme wee sée an equalitie of good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior
in an vnequality of degrees of people, infinite trades which
serue one another, the smaller reuerensing the greater, the greater
seruing to the benefite of the smaller, both of them made equall in
Iustice, and all tending in this diuersitie to the common seruice of
their Countrie: we doubt not but there is one Lawe, and a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
which by that Lawe holdeth the said diuersitie in vnion. And
if any man tell of many Magistrates; we will by and by inquire for
the soueraine. Yet notwithstanding, all this is but an order set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
diuers men, who ought euen naturally to be vnited, by the
communitie of their kind. But when things as wel light as heauy,
whot as cold, moyst as dry, liuing as vnliuing, endewed with sence
as sencelesse, and eche of infinite sortes, doe so close in one compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
as one of them cannot forbeare another; nay rather to our
séeming, the worthiest doe seruice to the bacest, the greatest to the
smallest, the strongest to the weakest, and all of them together are
disposed to the accomplishment of the worlde, and to the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man who alonly is able to consider it: ought we not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to perceiue, that the whole worlde and all things conteyned
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13215:25"/>
therein, doe by their tending vnto vs, teach vs to tend vnto one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone?
And séeing that so many things tende vnto man; shall man
scatter his doings vnto diuers ends? Or shall hee bee so wretched
as to serue many maysters? Nay further, to knit vp this poynt
withall, séeing that all things the nobler they bee, the more they
doe close into one vnitie, (as for example, wee sée that the things
which haue but mere being are of infinite kynds, the things that
haue life are of infinite sortes, the things that haue sence are of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sortes, howbeit not of so many; and the things that haue reason
are many, onely in particulars): doth it not followe also that the
Godhead from whence they haue their reason (as nobler tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they)
is also much more one than they, that is to say, only one as well in
particularitie and nomber, as also in kynd?</p>
               <p>Howbeit, notwithstanding all these considerations,<note place="margin">The obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of such as mainteyne mo Gods tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one.</note> forasmuch
as there is diuersitie, yea and contraritie in worldly things; some
haue gathered vpon this diuersitie, that there be diuers Gods, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
neuerthelesse one Almightie aboue them all. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome,
in respect of the contrarietie, haue set downe but twoo
Gods onely.<note place="margin">Iulian the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata, in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus.</note> The first say, If onely one God had made all things,
there should haue bene no difference in things: but there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
and therefore it must néedes bee that there are many Gods.
Surely had these men wel considered the things afore alledged by
mée; they should haue séene that nature is wholly and altogether
against this Consequence. There is great diuersitie in one Plant,
in one Wight, in one Man: and yet notwithstanding the ground
thereof is vniforme. Yea and it is so true that onely vnitie is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that we sée how the diuersitie it selfe and that which commeth
thereof, is vtterly barrein, both in Wights, (as in Mules) and in
Plants, as in the <hi>Stergon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stergon is an herbe which groweth of an Onyon stuffed with Linseede or seede of Flax.</note> and also in all other like things. If
they consider the Sunne, hee maketh Plants to growe all at one
tyme, diuers one from another, and as diuers in themselues. Hee
maketh some of them too shootefoorth, some to rypen, and some to
wither. At one instant he both worketh drought in the Earth, and
draweth vp Clowdes out of it to moysten it: he giueth Sommer,
Daylight, &amp; fayre weather to some, and Winter, night, and fowle
wether vnto othersome: Hee maketh some folkes whyte, some
blacke, some read, and some Tawny; and yet is hee but one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
Sunne, and one selfesame Creature, which at one selfesame
instant, by one selfesame course, and with one selfesame qualitie of
heate, doth all the sayd things, not onely diuers, but also contrarie.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13215:26"/>
And hee that should say that it is any other than one selfesame
Sunne that maketh the Ethyopian blacke, and the Scotte yello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were not worthy to be answered. Now if a Creature doth by
heate (which is but a qualitie) bréede so diuers effectes; what shall
we say of the Creator, I meane the infinite Being of GOD, who
imparteth himselfe to all things?</p>
               <p>Again, if man consider himselfe, he féeleth, he séeth, he speaketh,
he vnderstandeth a thousand diuers things, without any alteration
in himselfe. Nay which more is, he conceiueth, he inuenteth, and he
performeth so diuers workes, that Nations doe wonder one at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
One man portrayeth out the whole worlde in a little péece
of Paper, peinting out all the Images of the Heauens, and all the
Climates of the Earth. Some one other counterfeiteth all liuing
wights, which Créepe, which Goe, which Flye, which Swimme.
And all this commeth but of one mynd which conceiueth and brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all these formes, because it hath no forme of it owne; for had
it any of it owne, it could not breede them, because it owne would
occupie it to the full. What haue we then to thinke of him, whose
willings are powers, and whose thoughts are déedes? Who is an
infinite mynd; in comparison of the brightnesse wherof our mynds
are but a shadowe? If we, who (to speake properly) are but in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
showe, doe things in outward showe so diuers: do we doubt
that he which is in very trueth, cannot do them also in very trueth?
Moreouer, if the diuersitie make vs to imagine diuers Gods, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
all procéeding of one alone: shall we say that he which in his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
bred the rest of the Gods with their so diuers powers, had
not the same powers in his vnitie? Againe, seeing the sayd diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was once included within the sayd vnitie; is it to be sayd that he
was fayne to hatch vp diuers Gods, for the bringing of that diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
to light? Nay, like as nature doth all things the shortest way:
so also God made all things immediatly. And if they say it was his
pleasure to make the high things himselfe, and to leaue the lowe
things to be done by the pettie Gods: we must consider that High
and Lowe, Noble and Unnoble, are but considerations of man.
For to make the one or the other, is all one vnto God; who of his
infinite goodnesse and power, hath drawne both twayne of them
out of nothing, which was no more the one than the other, as wée
shall see hereafter.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to such as haue vphilde two beginnings,<note place="margin">Against two beginnings.</note> the one
good whom they call <hi>Oromases;</hi> and the other euill whom they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13215:26"/>
call <hi>Arimanius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutark in the lyfe of Osyris and Isis.</note> which opinion men say procéeded first from <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astres,</hi>
and afterward from the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Manichies;</hi> but wee
shall finde no foundation thereof in nature. Their meaning is, that
the Elements, the Plants, Beastes, Men, yea and Spirites, were
as yee would say parted betwixt these twoo Gods, so as the one
should bee the Creator of the one, and the other of other; the good
God, of the good; and the euill of the euill. If it be so, then is there
a Ciuill warre fully furnished, of forces set in battelray on both
sides: so as there remayneth nothing but fighting, and yet after so
long tyme we see no such fight at all. And therfore let vs conclude,
that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie of beginnings is not. Unto the one, they alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Light: and vnto the other, Darknesse: vnto the one, Sommer:
and vnto the other Winter: vnto the one, Heate: and vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Cold. In very déede these are Contraries, but yet is one self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
Sunne the doer of them all, after as he goeth further from
vs or commeth neerer to vs. And his going from vs is not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
his light, but to shine therewith the neerlyer vnto others; nor
to coole himselfe, but to heate other folkes. Then if these contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
come of one selfsame one, that is to wit of the Sunne: Much
more likely is it in reason, that the Sunne himself should not come
of two. Againe, why should the one of these contraries be good, and
the other bad? Whosoeuer shall haue tryed the extremitie both of
the Heate and of the Cold, shall not be able to discerne which is the
worser. Likewise he that shall haue obserued the benefite that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of either of them in their seasons, shall not be able to discerne
which of them to take for the better. The Heate ripeneth fruites;
but it also seareth and parcheth them. The Colde starueth them;
but it also maketh them to bud. Take away either of them both,
and you take away all fruites. And like as both of them are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to one selfsame thing, that is to wit, to the bringing foorth of
fruites: so be they also procured by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course of one selfsame might,
which is the Sunne. The same Sunne is the lightner of our eyes
to our behoofe; and he is also the blinder of them if wee gaze vpon
him at the heyhth of the day. Yet notwithstanding, both in the
Sunne and in our eyes is the selffame light which they call good,
and which by his reckoning should bee to them both good and bad:
and if it be so, on which side shall they turne themselues?</p>
               <p>They adde further: Among Plants there are so many poysons,
and among liuing wights, so many noysome Beastes: that how
should a good God bee author of them? Sillie man that thou art!
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13215:27"/>
The Poysons thou occupyest in Tryacles for thy health, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Plague. And of those Beastes thou canst skill to vse the
skinnes to clothe thee against the Colde. And if thou hast an euill
opinion of some of them, because thou canst not serue thy turne
with them; as much wouldest thou haue sayd sometime of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Horse,
which as now doth thee seruice so many waies: &amp; as much might
the Satyre haue said of Fire when it burned him, notwithstanding
that as now it be so many waies necessarie. Now then they might
benefite thee, if thou wistest how to vse them: and whereas they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
thee, it is not of their nature, but through thyne owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or rather ignorance. But if they be good so farre forth as thou
hast skill of them: shall they not bee good to him which knoweth
them throughly? In the Closet of a Surgion who is but a man
as thou art, thou shalt finde a thousand tooles; and thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
esteeme him so wise, that thou wilt not thinke there is any
one of them, which serueth not to some purpose. Yea, and if any of
them doe cut thée or race thée; thou wilt not blame the toole nor the
maister thereof, but thy selfe which tookest it by the blade, whereas
thou shouldest haue taken it by the handle. And as little canst thou
say, that the toole which did cut thee, as that the toole wherewith
thou diddest cut what thou wouldest, had another maister or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Now then, wilt thou bring lesse regard with thée in this great
shop of the Creator? It is his will that some things shall serue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liuing wights which serue thée, and othersome shall serue thee
alone. Yea, and he will haue euen the harmes which thou receiuest
by them, to serue thée to some purpose: and he serueth his owne
turne better by thée, then thou canst serue thyne owne. And if thou
which art nothing, hast yet so much wit as to drawe some peculiar
good to thy self, out of another bodies workes, yea euen out of such
as thou accountest euill; as out of Poyson, health; from the Wolfe,
his skinne to couer thée; from the night, rest; and so foorth: Shall
not the almightie and infinitie Spirit much better dispose them for
the benefite of all men, yea and of all the whole world which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
so many things together?</p>
               <p>They say yet againe; But why should a good God take pleasure
in so many néedlesse things? For to what purpose serueth the Fly,
and such other things? Tell me, wouldest thou like well that thine
owne Children should speake such reproach of thy workes? Nay
rather wherein doth the Flye anoye thée? And wherfore serued the
Flye that <hi>Zeuxis</hi> paynted in his Table? It serued to make his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13215:27"/>
greatest disdeyners, (euen those which would haue had that rather
then all the rest wyped out of the Table) to confesse his arte and
excellent skill. And this serueth to conuict thée of blockishnes, thée
(I say) which haddest rather to finde fault with God and with the
Flye, then to wonder at the excellencie of him, who hath inclosed so
liuely a life, so quicke a moouing, and so great an excellencie in so
little a thing. So then, it is not for vs to chace her out of the table;
but rather to confesse our owne ignoraunce, or els to chace it away.
Hereby therefore we perceiue, that of all the things which they can
alledge, there is none which is not good and behofefull in it self; and
that the euilnesse thereof commeth onely through vs, and therfore
that the thing hath but onely one Beginner thereof, who is good.</p>
               <p>But behold, they vrge the matter yet more strongly. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the case sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (say they) it cannot be denyed but there is euilnesse
in things, seeing that they corrupt themselues, and the sinne that
is in our selues is vtterly euill: and sith it is so, from whence may
that bee? For if God be good, he cannot bee the author of euill; and
therefore there must néedes bee another author thereof. This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
shall bee handled more lightsomely when I come to treate of
Mans fall, which is the bringer in of the two euilles, namely both
of payne and fault; but yet may we assoyle it if we take heede. Wée
say that making and creating are referred to natures or substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that all natures and substances are good; and therefore that
God who is good, is the author and Creator of them. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part, we say that euill is neither a nature nor a substance, but
an income or accident which is falne into natures and substances;
It is (say I) a bereuing or diminishing of the good qualities which
things ought naturally to haue. This euill hath not any being in
it selfe; neither can haue any being but in the thing that is good. It
is not an effect, but a default; nor a production, but a corruption.
And therefore to speake properly, we must not seeke whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the doing of euill, but whence commeth the vndoing of good.
As for example, Wine is of Gods creating, and it is good. Now
this good substance falling to decay, that is to say, to abate or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
of his vertue, becommeth Uineger. Wherevpon no man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
who made the substaunce that is become sharpe, for it is the
selfsame that it was afore; but they aske whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or eagernesse, that is to say, the alteration that is befalne to the
substance. If thou say that it commeth of the foresayd euill Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the author of all euill, as the good Beginner is the author of all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13215:28"/>
goodnesse: forasmuch as euill is nothing els but a default, want or
fayling of good; it is the souereine or chiefe default or fayling, as the
good is the souereine or chiefe being. And if it be the chiefe default,
then is it not any more. For the default or fayling of a thing, is a
tending of the thing to notbeing any more the same that it was:
and the fayling of all, is a tending to the vtter vnbeing or notbeing
of the whole.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the sayd euill Beginner, which worketh not but in
the substance that is made or created by another, could do nothing
if the good Beginner wrought not first; and so should he haue the
Commencement of his power depending vpon another than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which is a thing repugnant to a Godhead. And if you aske
what is then the cause thereof:<note place="margin">Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> negatiue, canseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is the priuatiue.</note> I tell you it is the very nothing it
selfe; that is to wit, that God almightie, to shewe vs that he made
all of nothing, hath left a certeyne inclination in his Creatures,
whereby they tend naturally to nothing, that is to say, to chaunge
and corruption, vnlesse they bee vphild by his power, who hauing
all in himselfe, abideth alonly vnchaungeable and free from all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
As in respect then that things be, they be of God; but as in
respect that they corrupt &amp; tend to notbeing that which they were
afore; that commeth of the sayd notbeing, whereof they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And so they be good, as in respect of their bare being; and euill
as in respect that they forgo their formal being, that is to say, their
goodnesse: Good on the behalfe of the [souereine] Good, the father of
all substances; Euill as on the behalfe of the Nothing: And soothly
neither by nature nor by iustice ought they to be made equall with
the vnchaungeable Being of their Creator. And this is to be seene
alike in all things. An Apple rotteth, and a man dyeth. The Apple
and the man, that is to say, the natures of them are Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
As for the rottennesse and the sicknesse, they bee but abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and defaults of the good nature that was in either of them
from the good Creator. Man againe becommeth a Sinner, and
hereunto he néedeth no newe creation. It is a vanishing away of
the good nature, which loseth her taste. And therefore S. <hi>Austine</hi>
sayth, that the <hi>Latins</hi> terme an euill man <hi>Nequam,</hi> and an euill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>Nequitiam,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Naughtie</hi> and <hi>Naughtinesse.</hi>
Now, like as of rightnought there néedeth no beginner; so also is
there none to bee sought of naughtinesse or euill. And by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes
there remayneth vnto vs but onely one God the beginner and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all things, as wee haue defined him alreadie afore. <hi>Plato,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13215:28"/>
Plotin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato, in his Timaeus. Plotin, in Enn. 1. lib. 8.</note> and other great Philosophers of all Sexts, are of opinion
that <hi>Euill</hi> is not a thing of itselfe, nor can bee imagined but in the
absence of all goodnes, as a depriuation of the good which ought to
be naturally in euery thing:<note place="margin">Trisinegist in Asclepio. Simplicius vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Epictetus.</note> That euill is a kynd of notbeing, and
hath no abyding but in the good, whereof it is a default or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing.
That the cause thereof is in the very matter whereof God
created things, which matter they termed <hi>the very vnbeing,</hi> that
is to say, in very trothe no being atall, whereof the Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
still a certeine inclination, whereby they may fall away from
their goodnesse: And that in the very Soule of man, the euil that is
there is a kind of darknesse, for want of looking vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of the
souereyne mynde which should inlighten it; and through suffering
it selfe too bee caried too much away to the materiall things which
are nothing. But now that we haue doone with nature, it is good

the multitude of Gods among men, yea

those which through custome did celebrate the pluralitie of

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13215:29"/>

That there is but one GOD: That one is the roote of all
things, and that without that one, nothing hath bene of all things
that are: That the same one is called the onely good and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe, which hath vniuersall power of creating all things:
That it is vnpossible that there should bee many makers: That in
Heauen he hath planted immortalitie, in earth, interchaunge, and
vniuersally, lyfe and mouing: That vnto him alone belongeth the
name of Father and of Good; and that without blasphemie those
titles cannot be attributed either to Angels, to Féends, or to men,
or to any of al those whom men do cal Gods as in respect of honor
and not of nature. He calleth him father of the world, the Creator,
the Beginning, the Glorie, the Nature, the Ende, the Necessitie,
the Renewer of all things, the worker of all powers, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of all works, the onely holy, the onely vnbegotten, the onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting,
the Lord of euerlastingnesse, and the euerlastingnesse it
selfe; the onely one, and by whome there is but onely one worlde;
alone, and himselfe alonly all; namelesse, and more excellent than
al names. Unto him alone will he haue vs to offer vp our prayers,
our Prayses, and our Sacrifices, and neuer to call vpon any other
than him.</p>
               <p>I would faine knowe whether it bee possible for vs to say any
thing, either more, or better for the setting forth of the sayd vnitie?
In déede in some places hee speaketh of Gods in the plurall nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as when he calleth the world a God, and the Heauen with the
Planets which rule the Heauen, Gods: but that is after the same
maner which he sometymes calleth man himselfe a God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that noman can doubt of his birth and death, which are
things cleane contrarie to the true Godhead.<note place="margin">Mercurins Trismegistus, in his Poeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Chap. 3. 8. 10. 11. 12. And in his Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius. Chap. 2. 6. 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Starres</hi> (saith he,
speaking of the Creation) <hi>were nombred according to the
Gods that dwell in them.</hi> And in an other place he saith, <hi>There
are two sorts of Gods, the one wandring, and the other fixed.</hi>
But in the tymes going before, he had sayd that God is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of them, That he made them, That he is the Father and onely
good, vnto whom nothing is to bee compared, either of the things
beneath, or the things aboue. Also he saith further, That the world
is a second God, and a sensible God: and that Man is a third God,
by reason of the immortall Soule which is in him: but yet he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them Children, Impes and Creatures of the onely one God,
and most commonly Shadowes and Images of him; neither is it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13215:29"/>
his meaning to attribute so much vnto them, as only one sparke of
goodnes, or power to make the least thing that is. To be short, hée
setteth downe some Gods as principall, some as meane, and other
some as vndergouernours: But the conclusion of his matter is,
that the souereine dominion belongeth to God the souereine Lord
of them all, vpon whom alonly they depend, and from whom they
proceede, who alonly is called Father and Lorde, and whatsoeuer
holyer name can be giuen, who made both men and Gods, yea and
men (sayth he) much better and more excellent then all the Gods.
And as at the beginning of his worke he had prayed vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
so thanketh and praiseth he him alone in the ende: which thing
I thought good to set out at length, because many Philosophers
haue drawne their skill and knowledge out of his fountayne.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Epictetus in Arrianus.</note> the <hi>Stoik</hi> (whose words <hi>Proclus, Simplicius,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<hi>Lucian</hi> himselfe held for Oracles;) speaketh of only one God.
<hi>The first thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is to be learned, is, that there is
but one God, and that hee prouideth for all things, and that
from him neither deede nor thought can be hidden.</hi> He tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs to resort vnto him in our distresses, to acknowled him for
our Master and Father, to lift vp our eyes vnto him alone if wee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13215:33"/>
will get out of the Quamyre of our sinnes, to séeke our felicitie
there, and to call vpon him in all things both great and small. Of
all the Goddes that were in time past, he speaketh not a word: but
surely he saith that if we call vpon the onely one God, hee will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
vs of all things by his Angels.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca euery where.</note> he neuer speaketh otherwise. <hi>What doth God</hi>
(saith he) <hi>to such as behold him? Hee causeth his workes not
to be without witnesse.</hi> And againe, <hi>To serue God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is
to Reigne. God exerciseth vs with afflictions to trie mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and he requireth no more but that wee should pray to
him.</hi> These ordinary spéeches of his, shewe that he thought there
was but one God.<note place="margin">Seneca in his Booke of the happylyfe, &amp; in his Treatise of Comfort.</note> But he procéedeth yet f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

discouered</hi> (sayth he) <hi>wee must proceede to things vndiscoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and seeke out him that is auncienter than the world, of
whom the Starres proceede.</hi> And in the end he concludeth, that
the World and all that is conteyned therein, is the worke of God.
Also he casseth him the Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, Maker, &amp; Creator of the World,
and the Spirit which is shed foorth vpon all things both great and
small.<note place="margin">Seneca in his naturall Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and in his bookes of Benefiting.</note> And in his Questions: <hi>It is he</hi> (sayth he) <hi>whom the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truscanes
or Tuscans meane by the names of Iupiter, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
Gouernor, &amp; Lord of the whole world. If thou call him
Destinie, thou shalt not deceiue thyselfe; for al things depend
vpon him, &amp; from him comes the causes of all causes. If thou
call him Prouidence, thou sayest wel; for by his direction doth
the World holde on his course without swaruing, and vtter
foorth his Actions. If thou call him Nature, thou doest not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse:
for he it is of whom all things are bred, and by whose
Spirite we liue. To be short, wilt thou call him the World? In
very deede he is the whole which thou seest, and he is in all
the parts thereof, bearing vp both the whole World and all
that is thereof.</hi> By this sentence we may also shewe, that by the
terme <hi>Nature</hi> the Philosophers ment none other than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
accordingly as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth in another place, that God and
Nature are both one, like as <hi>Annoeus</hi> &amp; <hi>Seneca</hi> be both one man.
And whereas he sayth that God may be called the World;<note place="margin">Aristotle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is to say, All the whole.</note> it is all
one with that which he sayth in another place: namely, <hi>GOD is
whatsoeuer thou seest, and whatsoeuer thou seest not:</hi> That is
to say, whereas thou canst not see him in his proper béeing, thou
seest him in his works. For in other places also he defineth him to
a Mynd and Wisedome without bodie, which cannot be seene but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13215:34"/>
in vnderstanding. Now, of all the former things by him repeated
in many places, none can bee verified of any mo than one. For he
that maketh all, gouerneth all, and is all, leaueth nothing for any
other to make, gouerne, or be, otherwise than from himself. But he
speaketh yet more expressely, saying;<note place="margin">Seneca in his booke of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine death, &amp; in his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alledged by Lactantius. lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou considrest not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
&amp; maiestie of thy Iudge, the Gouernor of the World,
the God of Heauen and of all Gods. All the Godheads which
we worship euery man by himselfe, depend wholly vpon him.</hi>
And againe; <hi>When he had layd the foundations of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Masse, although he had spred out his power throughout
the bodie thereof: yet notwithstanding he made Gods to be
officers of his kingdome, to the end that euery thing should
haue his guyde.</hi> Now, this is after the same maner that the holy
Scripture speaketh of the Angelles. So then, he is not onely God
the excellentest of all Gods; but also their very Father, Author, and
Maker.</p>
               <p>Let vs yet further adde <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who haue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Sect taken what they thought good. Both of them speake or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
but of one God, the author and gouerner of all things, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whome they attribute all things, and in that ordinary style is
their word <hi>Nature,</hi> which surmounteth the custome of their tyme;
but yet doth their doctrine expresse much more héere. <hi>Cicero</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this matter in his booke intytuled <hi>Of the nature of the
Gods,</hi> acknowledgeth one souereine GOD, whom he calleth the
God of Gods, &amp; that is the difference which he maketh. <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                  <note place="margin">Cicero in his booke of the Nature of the Gods.</note> (sayth he) <hi>is neither mightie nor excellent;
for it is subiect to the selfesame (beit Nature or Necessitie)
which ruleth the Heauen, the Earth, and the Sea. But there is
not any thing so excellent as God, who ruleth the World, and
is not subiect to Nature, but commaundeth Nature it selfe.</hi>
And he is full of the like sentences.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Plutarke,</hi>

one is called Liberall, another Gentle, and a third the Dryuer

namely, that although the Teachers of the Heathen named many
Gods and Goddesses: yet notwithstanding they comprehended
them all vnder one, which was <hi>Iupiter,</hi> of whom the residue were
but powers and functions: And this <hi>Iupiter,</hi> is he whom such folk
worshipped vnder another name, as worshipped the only one God

But yet there is a Recantation of his in his Hymne vnto
<hi>Musaeus,</hi> which is called his Testament, that is to say, his last doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
whereunto he would haue men to sticke. <hi>Lift vp thyne eyes</hi>

seeth all and is seene of none. He onely giueth both welfare

Some worshipped the Heauen, the Plantes, and the Starres
like silly soules which at their first comming into a Kings Court,
doe thinke that the first gay apparelled man whome they méete
with is the King. Some made Gods of the Goodes which God
gaue them. Some worshipped the Beastes which were for their
benefite. And finally they made Goddes, not only of themselues,
but also of their Speares, Shéelds and Swoordes, and buylded
Temples to their owne Passions, as vnto Fearefulnes, Hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and such others; yea and euen vnto things so filthy and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
as a man may bee ashamed and abashed to heare spoken of.
Neuerthelesse, the costomable vse of such things made folke too
haue no regard of them, and the most spirituall sort of them were
so possessed with Ambition, that it filled all their myndes to the

of euery man is, as it pleaseth GOD. They call vpon him as
their Iudge, saying; God seeth it, I referre my self to God, God
requite it me. O record of a Soule by nature Christian! To be
short, in vttering those wordes, they looke vp to Heauen, and
not to the Capitoll: for they knowe that Heauen is the Seate
of the liuing God. Lactantius<note place="margin">Lactantius. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note>

constreyne them to acknowledge the truth. If there come an
Alarum, or if they be threatened with warre; they do after the
same maner: But as soone as the daunger is past, by and by
they runne to the Temples of many Gods, whereas notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW, albeit that the least things which are in Nature
and in our selues, doe sufficiently shewe vs that there
is but one GOD: Yet notwithstanding all Nature is
not able to teach vs what that God is, neither is man,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13215:38"/>
in nature able to comprehend any thing of him: and the reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is euident in both twayne. In Man, because the greater can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be comprehended by the lesser,<note place="margin">Man cannot comprehend God.</note> neither can Man haue any thing
in vnderstanding, which hath not first bene in his sences, as from
whence procéedeth vnto him the beginning of all naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And he neither seeth nor perceiueth God in himself, but only
by his effects. In Nature, because it is a thing wrought by God,
and no work or effect how great so euer it be, can perfectly expresse
the cause or worker thereof. Man is able to discourse after a sort, of
the things that are lesse than himselfe, as of Beastes, Plants, and
Stones. And yet if hee will enter into their substaunces; he must
néedes stop short, and is constreyued to stay vpon the histories of
them, confessing his knowledge to be but ignoraunce. If he come
to himself, to knowe his owne Soule by the power of his Soule:
by and by he is at his wits ende: For the maner of his discourse is
but to procéede from kynd to kynd, and to passe from one reason to
another. But on the contrary part, his mynd seeth not it selfe, but
onely turneth into it selfe, leauing not any thing empty without it
self whereunto to extend, no more than a Circle doth. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
euery thing is equall to it selfe, and measurable by it
selfe. What shall we then thinke that Man can doe, if he aduaunce
himselfe to the considering of Goddes nature; seeing that the least
Creatures that are doe put him to his trumpe? That is the very
thing which hath made the ignorant sort to ouershoote themselues
so farre, as to counterfect God by a shape like themselues: which
thing the very Beastes (sayth <hi>Xenophanes</hi>) would haue done, if
they had bin Paynters, as which cannot ordinarily conceiue any
greater thing than themselues. Ye see then how Man is of himself
too farre vnable to conceiue such a Greatnesse. Againe, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the effects, a man planteth, buyldeth, paynteth, and weaueth a
thousande diuers workes: and wee thinke it not straunge that the
bruite Beastes conceiue not thereby what Man is, howbeit that
there is alwaies some proportion of vnderstanding betwene Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Creature; but betwéene the Creature and the Creator
there is none at all. Nay, there is yet this more, that a man shall
see and feele the workes of another man, and he shall knowe from
whence he taketh his stuffe, after what maner he matcheth things
together, and what Arte he hath obserued: But shall he for all that,
knowe what the Soule or Mynd of that man is? No; nor yet his
owne Soule. For his doings come nothing néere to that which he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13215:38"/>
is, no not so néere as the heate which the Sunne sheadeth into vs
from aboue, approcheth néere to the naturall power that is in the
Sunne; the which notwithstanding wee durst not take vpon vs to
describe, if we had neuer felt it otherwise than in a Prison. But if
thou couldest haue entered into the mynde of that man at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his worke,<note place="margin">Cicero in his booke of the Nature of the Gods.</note> thou shouldest haue seene it farre more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
there: and all that euer he could do or thou say, is alwaies farre
lesse than his Conceyt; and yet the same Conceyt of his is but as a
sparke of the Mynd, whereof the same worke is a part.<note place="margin">Plotinus Enn. 6. lib. 8. cap 11 Galen in his 9. booke vpon the Decrees of Hippocrates. Although it appeare by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that it is a diuine workmayster that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created vs: yet can we not by any wit or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son conceyue, neither what his substance is, nor how he made vs. For we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that it is a farre other thing, to shew that a certeyne Prouidence made vs: than to knowe the substance, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our owne Soule, or of him that made vs.</note> Now then,
if thou being a man, canst not conceiue the mynde of a man by his
doings, though thou beare the like mynd about thée thy selfe; and if
his doings (of what sorte so euer they be) come farre short of that
which he himselfe is: darest thou be so bold as to describe God by
his works what he is, and to dispute of his substaunce? And if thou
canst not conceiue him by his workes; how wilt thou then conceiue
him, seeing thou canst not behold him otherwise? To this purpose
we haue the common Historie of <hi>Simonides,</hi> who being asked by
<hi>Hiero</hi> King of <hi>Syracuse</hi> what God is; demaunded one daies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spit

that God was the very wisedome it selfe. <hi>Xenophon, Plato, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>

notwithstanding, whereas men are not able to atteyne to Gods

names that they could deuise, as we haue séene in the last Chapter.
They considered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forasmuch as all things haue their beeing from
him, he himselfe was the souereine Béeing; and that to be so, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed
him to bee euer, and therefore they called him the Euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
And that to haue béeing without life; is nothing: and that he
which giueth life to all, must needes bee all life: and therefore they
call him the liuing God. And againe, that life without vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is dead, and vnderstanding without power is vnperfect;
and that he which giueth both of them to all, must néedes haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in himselfe for all: and therefore they call him Mynd and Myght,
attributing vnto him the perfect knowledge and infinite power of
all things. Finally, forasmuch as to Bée, to Liue, to Understand,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13215:39"/>
and to be mightie, the higher that they be, are so much the lesse to
be estéemed, if good also abound not on all partes: because men on
the other side receiue so many good turnes at his hand, they call
him Good, excéeding good, and the goodnesse it selfe; assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
that no other name doth so peculiarly fit him as that. Yet
notwithstanding neither that, nor any thing els that we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

vnto him the highest degrée of all perfections that can be, (as
in very déede he must néedes haue them at the highest pitch, seeing
that there is not any that hath measured them vnto him:) yet doe
we attribute vnto him but imperfection. For if any of them be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
then is he not infinite, as we ought to conceiue him to be: and
infinite it cannot be, because the one of them should by the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

I meane altogether déede,<note place="margin">Mercurius Trismegistus in his Poeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. cap. 2. &amp; 6.</note> altogether forme, altogether perfection

not sufficient for him.<note place="margin">Plotiri. Ennead. 7. lib. 7. cap. 38.</note> Also we call him the good, and yet is that too
little for him; for Good is the good of goodnes, as heate is the heate

for goodnes hath his being in some substance. But in God
there cannot any thing be conceiued, which is not substantially, yea
and more than substantially substance. Againe, when we say, he

when wee say, hee is héere, or hee is there, it is all one; for hee that

Insomuch that that man may bee sayd to bee most skilfull in that

a GOD which is the first mouer of the whole world. And by the

He that desireth or coueteth, desireth or coueteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which
hehath not. But God is one, &amp; al togither; neither is it possible for
him to receiue being from any other: for nothing is changed but by
some other thing, which in some respect is more mightier tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, as
Wood is changed by Fyre. But al things haue their power &amp; force
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God alone. Therfore by this terme <hi>Vnchaungeable,</hi> we deny
him to be lyke the immortall soules, which admit such passions as
we perceiue, or also to the very bodilesse Spirites, whome we call
Angels, &amp; the Philosophers call Gods; who be not vnchangeable,
sauing so farre foorth as they rest in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beholding of him which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
be changed. And it maketh nothing against the matter, that we sée
so diuers changes in all things. For it is one thing to change ones
selfe, &amp; another thing to will y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there should be a chaunge; like as it
is one thing to moue ones selfe, &amp; another thing to will y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be a
mouing. The Sunne maketh many diuers changes in the things
which we see héere beneath, he maketh things gréene, hee maketh
things yellow, he rypeneth things, he withereth things &amp; so forth,
and yet notwithstanding he changeth no whit of his heate; and had
he also a mynd (as some suppose him to haue,) he might also wil al
these chaunges without changing himself. So also may God, and
much better. He without altering his own being, willeth &amp; maketh
al the changes in the beings of things: &amp; yet it is as certeine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is
vnchangeable, &amp; that if he were not so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole chaungeable nature
should perish; as it is certaine that if he were not <hi>vnmoueable,</hi> all
mouing should vtterly ceasse. Now out of these two negatiues we
drawe a third, namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath neither beginning nor end, which
thing we call <hi>Euerlastingnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euerlasting.</note> For the beginning and ending of all
things, procéedeth of mouing and chaunge: and therefore he that is
not subiect to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can haue neither beginning nor end. Moreouer,
Time is but a measure of mouing, wherin there is both a forenesse
&amp; an afternesse. He therefore which is not subiect to mouing, is not
subiect to time, and he which is not subiect to time, hath not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by continuance of succession from one mouing to another. And
so Gods being is altogether at once, which is the peculiar proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of euerlastingnes. And whereas we say, he hath bin, and he shall
be; it is as much to say as there was neuer any tyme when he was
not, neither shall it euer come to passe that he shall ceasse to be.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Mere Act.</note> being euerlasting he is not subiect to any passiue possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie;

and in very déede, and he cannot become any other thing than he is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13215:40"/>
alreadie. For, were there any passiue possibilitie in him as from
himselfe, then should there be a chaunge in him; and if it were from
elswhere, then should there be a mouing from possibilitie to déede,
or to dooing; &amp; he is not subiect to any of them both.<note place="margin">Erom Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie into deed.</note> Furthermore,
Euerlastingnesse cannot be in way of possibilitie, but only actually
and in very déede. For euery maner of déede being simply taken is
afore the possibilitie thereof, as the cause is afore his effect, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the possibilitie is (as ye would say) quickened by the déede.
As for example, from a graine to an Herbe,<note place="margin">A grayne may become an herbe, and a kernell a tree: which they be not so long as they continue a grayne and a kernell. Vnmateriall.</note> and from a kernell to a
Trée by the power of the Sunne. But as for Euerlastingnesse, it
can abyde neither forenesse nor afternesse; and therefore looke what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it can bee, it is the same all at once, and actually or in very
déede, and euer. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it followeth also immediately, that God
is neither matter nor materiall: for the propertie of matter is to be
merely passiue; that is to say, capable of diuers formes or shapes,
and such as may in possibilitie receiue, being it selfe altogether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and such as the Philosophers describe it to bee. By these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
we come to another, which is, that God<note place="margin">God is single and vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> is not compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For whatsoeuer is so, we say is of later tyme than the things
whereof it is compounded. But God is euerlasting, and vnto him
nothing can be new. Againe, Compounding is a knitting of many
things into one; &amp; ere those things could bee vnited in very déede,
it behoued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be first in possibilitie; that is to say, to bée capable
thereof. Now, as for God, he is not a thing in possibilitie (which
is an vnperfect beeing) but altogether actually and in very déede.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee say that God made all things, and knoweth all
things. Now, if he had in him the nature of any of them, the same
would trouble the natures of the rest, as wee see that the tongue of
a sicke man that is sicke of an Agewe, is vnable to iudge of the
tast of things, because it is furred by a cholerick humor; and the eye
which hath any matter therein, can see nothing. It followeth then
that too make and too knowe all things, God must néedes bee very
single, and not holding any thing at al in him. And the more single
hee is, the more is hee capable of the innumerable multitudes of
things; like as the eye is then most capable of all colours and the
eare of all voyces; when [in themselues] the one is least troubled
with noyzes and the other with colours. Wherevpon it followeth
that seeing he is not compounded, he cannot be a bodie:<note place="margin">Bodylesse. Numenius <gap reason="foreign">

reporteth.<note place="margin">Place is to be considered, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a thing created, or as a conteyner of a thing placed.

wholly nor partly. By reason whereof, wee may say in strict
spéech, that he is no where, that is to say, that no part of him is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
within any place to be poynted at. Notwithstanding, like as
he made all things by the power of his béeing; so doth the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
enter into all things, fill all things and conteyne all things.
And forasmuch as the same is vndiuidable, it is whole in all, and
whole in euery part: and so likewise is he himselfe; that is to say, he
is euerywhere, whole throughout, in whom all things haue their
béeing, howbeit that hee is not determinatly or definitely in any
thing. Wee haue an image hereof in our owne mynd, which yet
notwithstanding is but a vayne shadowe. For, in as much as all
the things which we conceiue are lesse than we; they be in the mynd
without intermingling of the mynd with them, and the mynd after
a certeyne fashion toucheth them all, although it bée not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in any of them. Now, if all these things be in our mynd,
because they be entered into it by our sences: how much more shall
all essences be in God and he in all of them, seeing that all of them
procéede from him, and that his onely conceyuing of them hath
brought them foorth? Now then, let vs not imagine any intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
in this behalfe. The light of the Sunne continueth entierly
throughout; it cannot bee deuided intoo partes, nor shet vp in any
place, nor seuered from the welspring thereof: it sheadeth it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all places, it filleth all places, and it is present with all things
which we see, (I speake after the maner of the Diuines) in essence,
in power, and in presence. The Ayre is lightened with the presence
thereof, and darkened with the absence, and wee perceyue both
twayne of them; and yet for al that, it intermingleth not it self with
the Ayre, ne leaueth any whit of it selfe into it. And shall wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to thinke lesse of the light which is not to bee conceyued but
in vnderstanding; considering that wee see the like with our eyes?
Or shall wee thinke it straunge that GOD should bee both euery
where and nowhere, considering how wee see that from a bodie
there isseweth such a bodilesse thing, as without touching any of
them, lighteneth them all? And if a light shine in all things that
shine; shall not the souereine essence bee in all things that are? And
seeing that things could not haue bin made vnlesse Gods power
(which is his very essence) had bin present with all things &amp; with
euery of them; shall any thing let him from being present with all
things still? Now, like as the light of the Sunne hath diuers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13215:41"/>
through the disposition of mens eyes, and of the shéerenesse
of things, and the diuersities of the substances whereon it lighteth:
so is Gods presence diuers too diuers things, and yet is it without
any diuersitie in it selfe. <hi>He is</hi> (sayth S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Austin vpon the Psalmes.</note>) in himself, as the

thereof: to his Church, as a father in his House: to our
Soules, as a Bridegroome in his Chamber: to the Rightuous,
as a Helper and defender: to the Reprobates, as a trembling

to his goodnesse, and so foorth. <hi>For what place shall he
meete with</hi> (sayth he) <hi>where he shall not finde they presence?</hi>
The selfesame presence which was present at the making of all
things,<note place="margin">1. Phisic. 2. &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> is present with euery thing to preserue them all: and yet is
it neuerthelesse absent from all things and from euery thing, as it
was at the tyme that there were no things at all; because none of
them conteyneth it or any part of it, but it conteyneth all things.</p>
               <p>But we must passe yet one step further. God (say we) is present
euerywhere. Then is he infinite,<note place="margin">Infinite.</note> and yet is he not conteyned in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
place, for he is not a bodie. It followeth therefore that he is not
infinite in bodie,<note place="margin">Infinite, not by stretching or streyning out, but by sheading in.</note> but in Spirit; nor in quantitie, but in goodnes and
power, and better if better may be sayd. Wherfore, let vs not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
him to bee a huge or massie lumpe, as the ignorant sorte doe.
The massinesse of things is that (as wee see) which maketh them
vnable to doe things. Contrariwise, the more spirituall a thing is,
the more actiue it is. He then which is the action of al powers, must
néedes bee a Spirit of infinite power, and yet notwithstanding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from all quantitie, (which properly is but a weakenesse or
want of power) yea, and yet in such sort infinite, as all the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof bee comprehended within bounds as to himselfe, that
is to say, so as he finish or bound himselfe, because he neither is nor
hath any thing without himself. Thus haue we by reason (and we
may also haue it by the Deuilles in the forealledged Oracles, and
likewise by all the Philosophers) that GOD is vnmoouable, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable,
beginninglesse, endlesse, single, bodylesse, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
all which are termes whereby wee declare, not what he is, but
onely what he is not; not to make vs to conceyue him, but to kéepe
vs from deceyuing our selues by our owne vayne conceytes. And
of all these Negatiues we conceyue but one affirmatiue, as we did
at the first; namely, that God is his owne being, as he himself faith
vnto <hi>Moyses;</hi> insomuch that he is of himselfe, and all things are of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13215:42"/>
him, and he cannot be aught els than he is; insomuch also that it is
all one with him to be great and mightie, as méerely and simply to
bée; which is as much to say as that we must (as much as wee can)
conceyue him to be good without qualitie, great without quantitie,
euerlasting without tyme, euerywhere present without place, and
so foorth. And to conclude this Chapter, whereas wee cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
God in his very being, wee will indeuer to come néere to
the knowledge of him thrée waies by considering his effects; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in such sort as that we must thinke infinitely of him, aboue and
beyond the things which seeme greatest vnto vs in the perfections
which we perceyue to be in all things; as, goodnesse, trueth, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Iustice, life, vnitie, and such like; and yet conceyuing him (if
we can) to be but one only perfection comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all perfections
in one, and yet euery of them infinitely aboue the highest degrée of
perfection that we can imagine. And finally as in respect of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
which are in all things, (as chaungeablenesse, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
materialnesse, and such like,) by conceyuing them to be more
infinitely farre of from his nature, than wee can set them of in our
vnderstanding. But when wee haue or shall haue taken neuer so
much paynes in that behalfe, yet the vttermost that wee shall haue
learned, is but only not to be ignorant of our owne want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
And therefore, to the intent we lose not our selues in seeking
him, the surest way for vs is to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

helpe vs to mainteyne and prooue the things which
she of her selfe could neuer haue found out. For, reason is after a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13215:42"/>
sort in like case towards God, as our eye is towards the Sunne.
Neither the Sunne nor any thing vnder the Sunne, can well bee
seene without the Sunne: likewise neither God nor any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to God can bee seene without God, how good eyesight or
myndsight so euer wee haue. But when the Sunne shineth, then
our eye seeth the things which it sawe not afore, &amp; iudgeth of them
at his ease, notwithstanding that the eye bée but the same it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and haue but the same power of sight which it had afore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
receyuing any newe increase thereof. Likewise, when GOD
voutsafeth to vtter any doctrine vnto vs, the selfsame reason which
otherwise could neuer haue perceyued it, doth then see it, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
it, and allowe of it, without receyuing any newe power abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
or chaunge in it selfe. We haue concluded by reason, that God
is a most single essence: And we beléeue by discouery from heauen,
that in the same most single essence are thrée persons or Inbeings.
Reason of it selfe could neuer haue atteyned to the finding thereof:
for we cannot distinguish things vnlesse we conceyue them; and yet
neuerthelesse, reason will serue vs to proue it.</p>
               <p>First of all,<note place="margin">The begetting of the Sonne, or of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person</note> we haue alreadie acknowledged by Gods effects or
doings, that there is in him a working nature or power, (I must
be faine to speake in the speech of man seeing that the diuine spéech
is vnknowne to vs) which is the beginner and mouer of al things.
And in euery of his workes, wee see a singular cunning; and in the
knitting of all, both great and small together, wée see a wonderfull
order, as I haue discoursed heretofore; and wee see there is neither
order nor cunning where there is no vnderstanding. It followeth
therefore that the souereine vnderstanding is in God from whom
this great order and cunning procéede. Againe, albeit that of the
things which are in this world, some vnderstand, and some vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not; yet notwithstanding, all of them are appoynted to some
certeyne end and marke, as the Sunne to make the day &amp; to heate;
the Moone to lighten the night, and all the Planets and Starres to
marke out the Seasons; and so foorth of all other things. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: and
yet notwithstanding, the most part of them could not prescribe it
to themselues. For the beginner of all ends is vnderstanding, and
in the most of these there is no vnderstanding. Néedes must it bee
therefore, that God the maker of them did also appoynt them their
ends, and consequently that he had vnderstanding for them. Now,
the innumerable multitude of things, and the linking of their ends
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13215:43"/>
one to another as they now be, do shewe that al of them haue their
beginning from one selfsame vnderstanding. Then must it néedes
be, that this common author of their being, that is to say, the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
being, must also be the souereine vnderstanding, séeing he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
the effects of vnderstanding to so many things which haue
it not. Moreouer, the things which haue vnderstanding are the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
and orderers of the other things, and not contrarywise.
Man buyldeth, planteth, reareth vp Cattell, and maketh his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of all of them together. Of men themselues, the skilfullest
make Lawes, and take vpon them to rule others. To be short, the
things which haue no vnderstanding doe naturally serue as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to those which haue it; and the thing which hath the lesse of
it, serueth that which hath the more of it; and no part in nature dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
to the contrary. And (as wée haue proued by all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
themselues) it is God that created all things that haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
as well those which are not tyed to bodies, as those
which haue bodies; allotting to them their offices and ends, and so
consequently he is the very beginner and end of them himself.</p>
               <p>Then once againe, so farre foorth as we can describe this vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by the outward effects thereof, it must néedes be in God a
most excellent abilitie (if it may bee so named) by direction whereof
he executeth most wisely the actiue or inworking vertue power and
nature which we marke in all things in this world, howbeit, so as
the chiefe working of them doth abide and rest still in him. I haue
proued heretofore that God is infinite: which being so; nothing can
be imagined in him, which is not infinite likewise: for otherwise he
should bee as well finite as infinite both together. And infinite he
were not, if he could vnderstand or knowe that to day which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not afore. Néedes then must it be, that he from al eternitie
vnderstandeth and knoweth the things which haue bin, which are,
and which shall be; the whole, and the parts; the generalles, the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialles,
and the particulars; the originalles, the procéedings, and the
aftercommings; the doings, sayings, and thoughts of men; and so
foorth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o as this vnderstanding in God is euerlastingly infinite.</p>
               <p>Againe, vnderstanding is an inworking which abideth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
in the partie which hath it, and passeth not into any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thing. For, when we vnderstand the course of the Sunne, we
become the more skilful therof in our selues; but as for the Sunne,
he is nothing altered thereby. Also I haue told you alreadie, that
God is most single, and that there is not any thing in him which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13215:43"/>
is not his very essence or being. Whervpon it followeth, that God
not onely hath vnderstanding, but also that his vnderstanding is
his very essence [that is to say, he is the very vnderstanding it self.]
Now then, let vs see what it is that this vnderstanding begetteth.
I haue told you that God is a mere doing, and that whatsoeuer he
doth, he doth it from euerlasting; and that on the other side being
most single, there is nothing in him which is not a dooer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it followeth that this vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is euerlastingly occupyed
in doing. And wherein then is it occupyed? What is the thing that
it worketh vppon? Surely it can méete with nothing but it selfe.
God then conceyued and vnderstood himselfe; and it must néedes be
that he vnderstood himselfe, seeing that the chiefest wisedome is to
knowe ones selfe, whereof he could not fayle. Therefore it was of
necessitie, that this vnderstanding of God, should yéeld a reflexion
backe againe to it self, as a face doth in a Lookingglasse, and as our
mynd doth when it setteth it self to the considering of it owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
nature; and that it should conceyue and beget in it selfe a perfect
image of it owne selfe, which image is the same thing which in the
Trinitie we call the Sonne, the Word, or the Spéech; namely, the
liuely and perfect image and wisedome of the Father. Now, this
vnderstanding is actually euerlasting, [that is to say, euerlasting in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>éede] and euerlastingly actuall, [that is to say, euerlastingly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,]
and therefore wee say that the second person which it beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
is also euerlasting: and God in his vnderstanding had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
any thing that is lesse than himself; for it is equal with him.
And whereas wee comprehend not our selues; that commeth of the
darknesse and lumpishnesse of our flesh, which maketh vs vnlike
our selues. We say then that the Sonne is equall to the Father,
and the image of the Father. But yet moreouer, the being of the
Father and his vnderstanding are both one: &amp; his being or essence
(being vnderstoode of it selfe) is none other thing than the being of
the Sonne, who is bred and begotten by the Fathers vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or mynding of himself. Wherevpon we conclude againe, that
the essence of the Father is the essence of the Sonne, [that is to
say, that looke whatsoeuer the Father is, the Sonne is the same;]
so as they differ not but by way of relation: and consequently that
they be Coeternall, Coequall, and Coessentiall, [that is to say, of
one selfessame euerlasting continuance, of one selfesame state condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and degree, and of one selfesame substance or being;] which is
the thing that we be taught in the Church. This second person for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13215:44"/>
diuers respects is betokened, by diuers names. He is ordinarily
called the Sonne, because he is a Conception of the vnderstanding
which is in God, and a perfect resemblance of him. And here wée
haue to consider, that according to the diuersities of natures; the
maner of bréedings or begettings doe varie also. For euery life (if
I may so speake) begetteth or bréedeth a Sonne, issue or ofspring
in it selfe afore it send it out; and the excellenter that the life is, the
more inward to it is that which procéedeth or is bred thereof. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
some haue supposed the Fire to be a liuing wight, because it
bréedeth or begetteth another fire like it selfe. But howsoeuer the
case stand, like as the Elements are naturally the bacest things in
degrée, so hath Fire the bacest maner of bréeding or begetting; as
which is not able to doe it but out of it self, and by the applying of
some outward matter to him. The Plant conceyueth moysture in
it selfe, which springeth foorth into bud, from bud into flower, and
from flower into fruite; which fruite being ripe falleth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground,
and there bringeth foorth another Plant. Now, this second Plant
liued in the first Plant ere it liued in it selfe; and all liuing wights
doe liue, moue and feele in their Dammes bellies, afore they come
foorth; which is yet a more inward maner of bréeding and beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
than the other. The sensitiue life conceyueth an imagination
which hoordeth vp it selfe in the memorie: but as it procéedeth from
the Sences and sensible things; so doth it depart out of it self. The
reasonable life hath his conceptions and bréedings yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
than all the rest. For it hath his reflexion backe to it selfe; and
wée commonly terme the doings or actions thereof by the name of
Conceptions or Conceyts, after which maner the lear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed sort doe
call their bookes their Children. But yet there is this more in this
matter; namely, that in men this conceyuing procéedeth of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which is an outward thing vnto it, because nothing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the vnderstanding of man but by the Sences; and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
for that the thing which is mynded or vnderstood, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynd
or vnderstanding it selfe, are not both one in vs. But forasmuch as
onely God is altogeter life, and his life is altogether vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
which is the highest degrée of life; he hath his maner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
and begetting most inward of all.<note place="margin">Why the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person is called the Son, the Worde, Speech, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. &amp;c.</note> For, he conceyueth in
himself and of himself, and his conceyuing is a begetting, and this
begetting abideth still in himselfe, because his vnderstanding can

is. And that is the second person whom wee call the Sonne, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13215:44"/>
vnto whom that name doth so much the more properly agrée, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his resembling of him is more perfect, and his begetting or

it accomplisheth his action or working in lesse than a moment, and
with one onely act doth so fill the Reason and mynd, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13215:45"/>
to make many acts of one. And this diuersitie may euery
man marke in himself, notwithstanding that all these acts seeme to
be done together like Thunder and Lightning. Now then, the said
Conception or Conceyt which Gods vnderstanding hath concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
euerlastingly in himselfe, wee call Speech or Word; which is
the perfect image of his vnderstanding, and Gods vnderstanding,
is God himself. Also wee call it Reason, because Reason is as ye
would say the Daughter, Spéech or worde of the vnderstanding,
and we say that by the same Spéech or word, God made al things.
For, as the Craftsman maketh his worke by the patterne which
he had erst conceyued in his mynde, which patterne is his inward
word: so God made the World and all that is therein, by that sayd
Spéech of his as by his inward skill or arte. For he being but one,
conceyueth all things by conceyuing himselfe. To be short, we call
him also the Wisedome of the Father, yea, and euen meerely and
simply wisedome. For, Wisedome (euen in man) is nothing els
but a hauiour procéeding of diuers Conceyts or inward spéeches,
whereby our mynde is perfected in the knowledge of high things.
Now, God is the heyghth of all heyghthes, and by the conceyuing
of himself he knoweth himself. But yet we must take this withall,
that the thing which is a hauiour in vs, is essence in him, [that is
to say, that he is the very things themselues which wee obtey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to
haue by meanes,] and that he himselfe is the ground of his owne
wisedome, whereas the true wisedome of men, hath not any other
ground than God. Now then, can there bee any greater wisedome
in God, than to knowe himselfe? And is not that knowledge bred
of vnderstanding?</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the third person.<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Ghost, or third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> We haue acknowledged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
that in the most single essence of God, there is a workfull
power, abilitie, or nature, matched with an vnderstanding, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereuto the sayde vertue or power executeth his actions.
Now, in the selfesame essence, should there not also be a Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the sayd vnderstanding? If wee consider all the things in the
world, we shall finde in them a kynd of Will, tending to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
welfare of euery of them: &amp; the more vnderstanding they haue,
the more wil also haue they; becasue that the more their welfare is
knowne vnto them, the more also is it desired; &amp; the more it is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the more also is their will vniforme, and the lesse parted. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the sencelesse things, as Plants, Herbes, and Stones, which
haue certeine naturall inclinations, sufficiently marked by the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13215:45"/>
out of their natures. But yet it cannot bee denyed, but that
the Beastes haue a sensitiue appetite to followe the thing which
their Sence taketh hold of to be good for them. Men also doe runne
with all their harts after the thing which they suppose to bee good
for them, whether it bee honor, riches or pleasure. And the more
they knowe it or thinke themselues to knowe it, the more doe they
yéeld their will vnto it: and the more they hold and possesse therof,
the more is their hart settled therevpon. Only their vnderstanding
being bewitched by vanitie, is deceytfully driuen to choose the euill
for the good; by meanes wherof, the will which ought to be discréete
and full of wit and vnderstanding, is forced of necessitie to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into fleshly and beastly lust. The Angelles likewise (as say the
Philosophers) haue also a will, and much more simply one &amp; more
liuely than ours. And as by their vnderstanding they know the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good it self, that is to wit God; so haue they their will euer settled
on him alone, without turning it aside to any of all the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of obiects wheron we be wont to set our mynds. Now, shall
not he himself haue a will, who hath giuen will to al liuing things
and imprinted it in them? And he that hath imparted so many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
to all things, to some mo and to some lesse; hath not he (say
I) bestowed those benefites vppon them willingly? And he with
the beholding of whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blesseddest Spirits do féede their willes,
hath not he the pleasure of contenting himself throughly with him
selfe, seeing he knoweth himselfe perfectly? And what els is this
pleasure, than will fulfilled, yea euen filled to the full with the true
Good which sufficeth to himselfe, which is the onely peculiar thing
whereon the very will resteth in déede? Againe, the nature of will
is to applye all abilities to their actions. To no purpose haue wée
hearing, if wee lift not to heare; to no purpose haue we sight, if wee
list not to see; to no purpose haue wee abilitie to doe things, if wee
li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t not to doe them. And this appeareth dayly in all our doings,
which neuer come to effect, till they be quickened and put foorth by
the will. But we see that God hath applyed his power to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many things, yea of things infinite and infinitely diuers.
Therefore it followeth that he listed to doe them, and that he listed
to make one thing to one ende and another to another, and one of
them for another, and finally all for himselfe, and so consequently
that he hath a will. And this will (so farre as we be able to discerne
it by the effects) is a certeyn abilitie wherby he applyeth his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
power, when, where, and how he thinketh good; guyding and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13215:46"/>
performing it according to his owne mynd, howbeit that the chiefe
act thereof is performed within it selfe. Neuerthelesse, this is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
alwaies after the manner of men. For if we haue much a doe to
discerne the difference betwéene the abilities of Will and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in our owne Soules, by reason of the linking of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
much more reason is it that in this essence of God which is
most single, and infinitely more one than ours, we should déeme all
these things to be but one in him, notwithstanding that they differ
in certeyne respects. God vnderstandeth, but I haue told you, that
to be and to vnderstand is all one in him. Also God willeth or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth;
but too will and too vnderstand are likewise both one in him:
and so all three come into one essence [that is, bee all one thing.]
The reason hereof is very euident: namely, that willing or listing of
is no more an action that passeth into the outward thing, than Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is; but abideth still in the Willer. For by our listing of
a thing, we may perceiue some alteration in our selues; but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing
it self that is listed or willed feeleth nothing thereof. Now, I haue
proued heretofore, that whatsoeuer is or resteth in God, is his very
being; and moreouer, God willeth not any thing but as in respect
that he vnderstandeth it; for the knowne good is the ground of his
will, and he vnderstandeth not but by his essence, [that is to say,
for that he is the very vnderstanding it selfe.] It followeth then,
that in God, his Will is his very essence as well as his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
insomuch that he is both Power, Understanding, and Will
all in one.</p>
               <p>But let vs see now what procéedeth of GOD by his Will. I
haue sayd afore, that God is mere Action, and moreouer, that he is
most single: therfore he is still doing from all eternitie, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is whatsoeuer els we consider in his essence. Now, there we
haue found an Understanding, by the Inworking whereof he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
himself; and also a Will, whereby he cannot but will himself,
seeing he knoweth himselfe. And this Understanding, by a certeine
Reflexion of it selfe vpon it selfe, hath begotten vs a second person,
whom we call the Sonne and the Wisedome of the father. This
will then which worketh euerlastingly, hauing likewise none other
thing to worke vppon but it selfe, doth also by his working strike
backe vpon himselfe, and delight it selfe in the infinite good which
it knoweth there, and so sheadeth out it selfe wholly to the louing
thereof; and by this action it bringeth vs foorth a third person (if I
may so terme it) whom we call Gods Spirit and the holy Ghost,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13215:46"/>
that is to wit, the mutuall kindnesse and louingnesse of the Father
and of the Sonne; of the Father the vnderstander, towards the
Sonne conceyued and begotten by his vnderstanding: and of the
Sonne backe againe towards the Father, acknowledging all that
he hath and all that he is to be of the Father. And this sayd Will
is the essence of God himselfe, and consequently eternally actiue,
and actiuely eternall. For, in the euerlasting all things are euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;
and in a mere act, all things are act; and of such can nothing
procéede which shall not be like them. Néedes therefore must this
Spirit, this Louingnesse, or this goodwill, bee also actually euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
Moreouer, the will extendeth as farre as the vnderstanding:
for (as I haue sayd afore) will and vnderstanding are both one in
God; and vnderstanding doth perfectly comprehend the thing that
is vnderstood, namely the thing that is beloued, that is to wit God
himselfe. The will then doth by his action (which is loue &amp; liking)
extend it selfe as farre as God himselfe; and so the third Person is
equall to the second and the first. And yet doth this third Person
procéede of the will, and the will is Gods essence, &amp; of that essence
can nothing procéede which is not his essence. Therefore he is not
onely coeternall and coequall, but also coessentiall. Againe, wee see
that in vs, there goeth alwaies some act of the vnderstanding afore
the act of our will; for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause why we will things, is that we think
wee vnderstand them; and wee desire them for the good which wee
perceyue in them; &amp; the loue of a thing cannot be in the louer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but vppon his knowing of the thing loued; neither is will any
thing els than appetite, bred of vnderstanding. The third Person
therefore procéedeth from the first, not only by the will, but also by
the vnderstanding, and by the knowledge which the vnderstanding
bréedeth. And because it procéedeth of two, and not by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
but by act of Will; we terme him <hi>Proceeding</hi> and not
<hi>Begotten;</hi> which is in effect the reason of all that is taught vs in
the Church concerning that matter. Notwithstanding, whereas
wee say that the action of Understanding goeth afore the action of
Will; our meaning is not to imagine any going afore or comming
after in these persons; but onely to lay foorth this procéeding by the
order of Nature, which wee could not haue done so well by the
trueth of the matter: as if wee should say, that the Sonne is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
afore the holy Ghost, in like maner as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowing of a thing
goeth afore the desire of it, because that if they could haue had any
beginning, the Sonne had bin formost in that case.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:13215:47"/>As touching names, we call him most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the holy Ghost.

is vnknowne vnto vs: the breathing of the Heartstrings,
which procéedeth from an inward beginning that is hidden from
vs; and such other things: and to be short, because that in all things
which haue life, the inwarde force procéedeth from some kynde of
will by a certeyne Spirit. Now, as for loue, it is nothing els but
a certeyne couert forewardnesse or foorthgoing of the will towards
the thing that is loued; insomuch that the very benefite which we
receyue by his loue, is a secrete and insensible through breathing,
which worketh in vs, &amp; yet we cannot well perceyue from whence
it commeth. Againe, wee call him also Loue and Charitie, because
all the actions of will are in loue and wellyking as in their roote, in
like maner as all the doings of Gods Understanding, mée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his wisedome. For, whereas wee desire the thing which
we want, or be glad of the thing which wee haue; the cause thereof
is that we loue it or like well of it. Likewise also, whereas we feare
a thing, or lothe it; that commeth of a hatred, which can haue no
place in God, whose will nothing is able to withstand. Therefore
as we haue God of God (that is to wit, the Sonne of the Father)
by the euerlasting inworking of his Understanding; so also haue
wee God of God againe (that is to wit, the holy Ghost or loue of
them both) by the ioyntworking of the Understanding and Will
together. Wherevpon we conclude thrée distinct persons or Inbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in one essence; not to exclude the singlenesse thereof which it
behoueth vs to hold still; but to expresse the diuersitie thereof after
a sort, which ought not to bee vnknowne; namely the power of the
Father, the wisedome of the Sonne, &amp; the goodnesse of their loue;
for whom, by whom, and in whom,<note place="margin">Of whom, by whom, and in whom.</note> it hath pleased the sayd onely
one vnspeakable essence to create and to loue all things.</p>
               <p>But there is yet more, namely, that as there are thrée Inbeings
or Persons<note place="margin">Three Persons and no mo.</note> in this essence; so also there can bee no mo but thrée:
which thing may be made euident by the same reason. Whoso de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
that there is Understanding and Will in God as wee haue
seene afore, must also denye that he hath made any thing, or that he
doth any thing: for all the things which wee see here belowe, are
marked both with the one and with the other. Likewise, he that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13215:47"/>
confesseth that all things are in him, (according to their preaching
vnto vs) must néedes also confesse the Sonne and the holy Ghost,
to bee the wisedome and the loue; for they bee but actions of those
two, which cannot be without their action; neither can action bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly
any where els than in God himself. Now, as we can
not imagine God without his actions; so can wee not consider any
other than those to abyde in him, nor consequently any other Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeings
that procéede from thence; wherevpon we say also, that a
fourth person cannot be admitted. As for example, we say he is the
Creator, and we say true; and in so saying wee finde also a relation
to the Creatures. But this power of Creating procéedeth from
the power which is in the Father, and is not an action that abideth
still within him, but passeth directly into the thing created, which
in respect of the Creator, is as nothing in comparison of infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whereof it cannot haue the preheminence. Also we say he is
a Sauiour: and that is all one with the other. For his being a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
is by his Sonne, as we shall see hereafter; and moreouer, it
is an action that passeth into the thing saued, and abydeth not in
God alone. Therefore it maketh not to the stablishing of a fourth
person or inbeing; for then it ought to be Coessentiall. To be short,
all Gods operations doe eyther procéede from within him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
still in the worker and in their first ground; or els they procéed
from without, and passe into the outward effect. That worke or
action which procéedeth from within, can bee of none other essence
than the thiug from whence it commeth: for in GOD there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but essence, and in that esseuce can nothing abyde but the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
it selfe. That which procéedeth from without, is alwaies of a
sundrie essence, as are the Creatures and workes of God, which
come nothing nere the essence of the Creator. The thing which
doth the worke without, is Gods power, howbeit accompanyed
with his vnderstanding and will. And the thing that doth the work
within, is his vnderstanding and will and nothing els, as wee may
discerne in our selues, who are but a very slender image thereof.
And like as in beholding a paynted Table, or in reading the verses
of a Poet, we imagine not therefore that there was a peculiar and
immediate abilitie of paynting or versifying in the mynd or soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne
part of their Soule; but we referre those skilles and al other
like, vnto Wit and Will: euen so and much more according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
of all the workes and doings which we see done by Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
we cannot gather any other persons or inbeings in him, than
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13215:48"/>
those which procéede immediatly of his Understanding and Will;
and alonly those and none other can be Coessentiall in him. Now,
Understanding and Will in GOD, are essence; and his essence is
merely one and most single. And moreouer, the Word or Spéech
conceyueth not another Spéech, but turneth wholly vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
neither doth the Spirit conceyue another loue than the loue
of those two; but resteth and reposeth it selfe altogether in them. So
then, there can but one onely word or spéech procéede by the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
nor but only one Loue procéede by the Will; neither can
any other procéede of that Word and that Loue. And so there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
vnto vs the onely thrée persons of the Father, the Sonne,
and the holy Ghost; by the which two, the Father gouerneth and
loueth all things, because he himself alone is all things.</p>
               <p>Now, as we haue read in nature that there is but one God, as
a thing which we finde written euen in the least creatures:<note place="margin">Traces of the Trinitie in the World and in Man.</note> so may
we now perceyue the euident footsteps of the chrée inbeings or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in one e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sence, as a marke of the worker that made them, in
some more and in some lesse, according to their dignitie; which yet
notwithstanding are such, as we could not well perceine them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the doctrine thereof was reuealed vnto vs, no more than we can
vnderstand the letters of Cyphering, which wee can neither reade
nor decypher, vnlesse we haue some knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter which
they import, from other folkes hands, or by coniecture, or by some
other way. Wee finde an Unitie in all things, yea euen in those
which haue but only being. For all things are inasmuch as they be
one: and whensoeuer they ceasse to bee that one, they consequently
ceasse also to be. Againe, we see in them a forme or shape, and that
is the marke of that witfull action (that is to say, of the euerlasting
Word or Conceyt whereby God made them) which hath bred vs
the essentiall forme or shape, and all other maner of formes and
shapes. Also we see an inclination or disposition, in some more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
than in othersome; in some to mount aloft, as in fire; in some
to sincke downe towards the Center, as in a Stone; and in all, to
hold themselues vnited in their matter &amp; forme. This is the marke
of the workfull Will, wherein God hath voutsafed to stoope vnto
them; and of the vnion which procéedeth therof, wherein he loueth,
vpholdeth, &amp; preserueth all things. But euen in some of the things
of this bacest sort, there appeareth not onely a trace, but almost an
image thereof. For, the Sunne breedeth or begetteth his owne
beames, which the Poets doe call the very sonne of the Sunne:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13215:48"/>
and from them two proceedeth the light, which imparteth it selfe
to all things here beneath; and yet is not the one of them afore the
other; for neither is the Sunne afore his beames, nor the Sunne
or his beames afore the light, otherwise than in consideration of
order and relation, that is to wit, as in respect that the beames are
begotten and the light is proceeding; which is an apparant image
of the Coeternitie. Likewise in Waters, we haue the head of them
in the earth, &amp; the Spring boyling out of it,<note place="margin">The welhead, the Spring, &amp; the streame.</note> &amp; the streame which
is made of them both and sheadeth it self out farre of from thence.
It is but one selfesame continuall and vnseparable essence, which
hath neither forenesse nor afternesse, saue only in order and not in
tyme, that is to say, according to our considering of it, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to causes, and not according to trueth. For, the Welhead is
not a head, but in respect of the Spring; nor the Spring a Spring,
but in respect of the Welhead; nor the Streame a Streame, but in
respect of them both; and so all three be but one Water, and cannot
almost be considered one without another, howbeit that the one is
not the other. It is an expresse mark of the originall relations and
perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Coessentiall in the only one essence of God. The like is to
bee sayd of Fire, which ingendreth fire, and hath in it both heate
and brightnesse vnseparable. Also there are other examples to bee
found of such as list to seeke them out. In Hearbes and Plants
there is a roote, which yeeldeth a slippe, stocke or ympe, and the
same ympe groweth afterward into a Tree. It cannot well be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or deemed to be a roote, but that therewith it hath also ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
an ympe or stocke; for in that respect is it called a roote, and so
is the one as soone as the other. Also there is a sappe which passeth
from the one to the other, ioyning, knitting, and vniting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by one common life, without the which life, neither the roote
should bee a roote, nor the slip a slip, and so in effect they bee altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the one as soone as the other. Moreouer, among all liuing
wights, euery of them ingendreth after his owne kind and forme;
of whom one is an ingendrer and another is ingendred; among
men, a father and a sonne; and by and by through knowledge, there
procéedeth a naturall loue and affection from the one to the other,
which knitteth and linketh them together. All these are traces, foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps,
and images, (howbeit with the grossest) of that high miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
and also I haue told you afore, that no effect doth fully resemble
his cause, and much lesse that cause which in all respects is most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:13215:49"/>Notwithstanding, in mans Soule, (when I say Soule, I
meane there the highest power thereof) the image and likenesse of
the Trinitie is yet much more lyuely and more expresse. For first
there is in it a Nature &amp; abilitie of working, and as it were a mere
act, whereby it liueth and giueth lyfe, and is it selfe in continuall
working. The <hi>Latins</hi> call it <hi>Mens</hi> [that is to say Mynd] &amp; we call
it also the reasonable Soule, the which wee may liken to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This Mynd bréedeth an vnderstanding or Wit, by the which
we vnderstand and discerne, not onely other things, but also our
selues; and againe by vnderstanding we come to will, through the
which we loue other things, and most of them for our owne sakes.
These thrée powers are very distinct in vs: for wee worke not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
by Wit, not alwayes by Will, and yet our mynd worketh
continually. Moreouer, oftentymes wee will the thing which wee
vnderstand not, and wee vnderstand the thing which wee will not.
And therefore to will and to vnderstand are not both one. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
this Working, Understanding and Willing, are not thrée
lyues or thrée Soules in vs, but one lyfe and Soule, and that so
streitly vnited in once essence, that euen in the selfsame instant that
our mind doth a thing, it also vnderstaudeth the reason why it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it or willeth it not, in which worke both our inworking power
and also our wit and our will doe concurre all together. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
this image is farre from the thing it selfe. For these
thrée powers are seuerall in the essence of our Soule; and howe
néerly so euer they be vnited together, yet is not the one the other;
But in God who is most singly one, Being is Understanding, and
vnderstanding is will, as I haue said afore. And againe, by Gods
vnderstanding and by his will there procéede from hym two Inbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
by reasons whereof hee myndeth and loueth himselfe, and in
himselfe all things. As for our Soule there can no such thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
from it by the wit or the will, because although they be both
in it, yet they take their grounds from without themselues, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that it can neither vnderstand nor loue, vnlesse the abilities
thereof be set aworking by some outward thing. And which more
is, the more it vnderstandeth it selfe, the more doth it streine it selfe
to vnderstand and knowe another than it selfe: and the more it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it selfe through true knowledge of it selfe, the more dooth it
séeke contentment by louing another, which other it cannot loue
but by hating it selfe; that is to wit, it streyneth it selfe too behold
and loue God, and to knowe and loue it selfe but only for his sake,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13215:49"/>
to whome alonly it belongeth to vnderstand all things in himselfe,
and to loue all things of himselfe. But now it is high time hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
to sée what antiquitie will say to vs concerning this matter,
the which it wilbe better for vs to reserue to the next Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
And as touching the questions that may bee made by the
curious sort vppon this poynt, we answere them at one word; Let
them tell vs how they themselues are bred and begotten, and then
let them aske vs of the begetting of the Sonne of God: Let them
tell vs the nature of the spirit that beateth in their Pulses; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
let them bee inquisitiue at our hands for the procéeding of the holy
Ghost. And if they must be fayne to kéepe silence in so comon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which they dayly sée and féele in themselues; let them giue vs
leaue to be ignorant in many things, which are such (as sayth <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles</hi>)

were both of the Father. But yet were they diuided by a Fyre
of vnderstanding, and (as it were by destinie) distributed into
other vnderstandings. For afore the making of this sundry-shaped
world, God had conceyued an incorruptible patterne
thereof, as a world subiect only to mynd and vnderstanding:

himselfe? And it is the selfesame thing which I spake of when I
sayd <hi>light of light,</hi> and when in comparing the Sonne to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I lykened him as a streame to the fountaine, and the Sunne

               <p>
                  <hi>Rabbi Iudas Nagid</hi> whom they commonly called the Sainct

vnderstood,<note place="margin">The Epistle of the Secretes of R Nehumia the Sonne of Hacana.</note> that men were forbidden to vtter the vncommunicable
name of God, (that is to wit <hi>Iehoua,</hi>) saue only in the daies of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonementmaking;
and in sted thereof they were commaunded to

was, he answered that it was <hi>Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost.</hi>
Also being demaunded what the name of Two and fortie letters
was; he answered, <hi>The Father is God, the Sonne is God, and
the holy Ghost is God, three in one, and one in three.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This is to bee seene euen in Sainct Math. chap. 1. ver. 20. where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell sayth to Ioseph, that Mary was with child by the holy Ghost: for otherwise it had bin to no purpose to haue spoken of the holy Ghost, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had not heard any speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> Now
then, it was a doctrine receiued from hand to hand in the Schooles
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as wee see by the long continuance thereof in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession

the doctrine of the thrée Persons in the Essence of God; but

[Now ye must vnderstand,<note place="margin">The Reader must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that by three gods thei meane three Inbeeings, as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues do declare it.</note> that] whereas wee say, the Frst, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

and Third God, which thing you must marke here at once for all
the residue following. And whereas he sayth that the first of them
is the Father, and that he is single, and that they bee but one; it is
not to bee doubted but that he maketh them all one Essence, so as
the second holdeth of the first, as the Light holdeth of the Sunne.
Againe, <hi>The first God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is free from all worke, but the
second is the maker which commaundeth Heauen: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

are there two lyues, the one from the first, and the other
from the second; the one occupyed about things subiect to
vnderstanding, and the other about things subiect both to
vnderstanding &amp; sence. And moreouer, by reason of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
which goeth afore in the second, there is also a sending
which goeth afore in the first; and so there is a certeyne ioynt-mouing
from whence the healthfull order of the World is

                     </gap>,</note> Now, whereas he speaketh of mouing,
it is after the maner of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> who (metaphorically) doe
meane, that to be vnderstood or knowne is to moue, and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
or knowe is to bee moued, because they wanted words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
these déepe matters. And in the same sence doe wee reade in
the Scripture, that the Sonne is sent of the Father. And againe,

                  <hi>and God the Good is the beginner of Beeing: and the
Second is the liuely exppresser of the First, as Begetting is an
Image of Beeing.</hi> And in another place he sayth, <hi>That this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
beeing the Sonne, is knowne to all men by reason of the
creating of the World; but as for the first Spirite, which is the
Father, he is vnknowne vnto them.</hi> And surely (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering their
maner of speaking) he could not haue sayd more plainly, That the
Sonne is the Image of the Father, that he hath his being in him,
that he is one with him, &amp; that by him the Father made all things.
And it is agréeable to that which <hi>Proclus</hi> witnesseth of him, who
reporteth of this <hi>Numenius,</hi> that he woorshipped thrée Goddes; of
whom he calleth the first the Father, the second the Maker, and the
third the Worke procéeding from them both. Wherein wée ought
not so much to seeke into the default, as to commend the good that
is therein. Besides this, it is good to marke here once for all, that
these men which speake vnto vs here of thrée Gods, are the same
which confessed vnto vs hertofore, that there is but only one God.

To the intent the Reader think not any obscuritie in this or other that follow, he must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that to the first Inbeeing, (that is to say, Persone) the Philosophers giue the names of the One, The Mind, the Good, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Begetter: vnto the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Beeër or he that is, wit or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Beautifull, and sometimes Speech, word, Reason, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Sonne, and the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and vnto the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Loue, Will, Power, and the Soule of the World: &amp; sometimes, the second world, &amp;c.</note> &amp; without settling his mynd afore vnto quietnes.
And if it be demaunded how one of them begetteth another;
it is to bee considered that wee speake of euerlasting things,
and therfore we must not imagine any temporall begetting.
For this begetting which wee speake of heere, importeth and
betokeneth but onely cause and order. How commeth it to
passe <hi>(sayth he)</hi> that this Vnderstnding is begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the One?
Surely it obteyneth not his beeing by meanes of any assent,
commaundment, or mouing of the One; but it is a light shed
foorth euerywhere, streaming from the One as brightnesse
from the Sunne, and begotten of the One, howbeit without
any mouing of the One. For all things, as in respect of their
continuing of their nature, doe necessarily yeeld out of their
owne essence and present power, a cetteyne nature that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
vpon them, which is a very Image and countershape
of the power from whence it proceedeth. As for example,
Fyre yeeldeth heate, &amp; Snowe cold: and Herbes yeeld chiefly
sents or sauors. And al things whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be in their perfection,
ingender somewhat. That then which is euerlastingly perfect,
doth euerlastingly beget, yea and it begetteth a perfect and
euerlasting thing, howbeit that the thing begotten is lesse
than the begetter. And what shall wee say then of the most
perfect? That nothing proceedeth from him? Nay rather, that
the greatest next him proceedeth of him? Now, the greatest
and chiefest next vnto the One, is the Vnderstanding; the
which hath neede alonly of the One, but the One hath no
neede of it. Needes then must it bee, that that thing which is
begotten of that which is better than Vnderstanding, must
be the Vnderstanding it selfe. And this Vnderstanding, being
the very Word of GOD and the Image of GOD, beholdeth
God, and is vnseparably ioyned with God, and cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from him otherwise than respectiuely, for that the
one of them is not the other. <hi>Uerely after the same maner that
wée affirme the Father to bee one person and the Sonne another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In respect of this Third, thei call the First the Amiable, and in respect of the Second, they call him the Mynd, as shall be seene by examples.</note>
                  <hi>and yet neither of them both to be any other essence than the other.
But let vs see how God begetteth this Vnderstanding, this Wit,
or this Word.</hi> It is <hi>(sayth he)</hi> by the super abundance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And therfore this begotten Vnderstanding must needes
reteyne much of the begetter in him, and haue almost like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
vnto him, as the light hath vnto the Sunne, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13215:57"/>
so as the begetter is not the very vnderstanding it self:<note place="margin">

certeyne turning backe of the begotten to behold the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and this beholding is nothing els but the mynding or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
of the good. And like as the One is but One, so
the vnderstanding thereof is all things. For by being bred of
the First Beginner, it knoweth all things, and bringeth foorth
all things that are: namely, all Beautie of shapes, yea and al the
Goddes that are to bee discerned by insight of Mynd. <hi>These

                  <hi>As touching the third Inbeing,</hi>

                  <hi>whom he calleth the Soule of
the World, thus sayth he thereof.</hi> Like as the Vnderstanding, is
the begotten issew, Word and Image of God or of the one; so
is the Soule of the World the issew, Word and Image of the
Vnderstanding, and is as a certeyne Reason ingendred of the
Vnderstanding,<note place="margin">The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Good.</note> the substance whereof consisteth in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation;
and the same Reason is as the light of the Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and dependeth thereupon. And as there is no meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the One, and the Vnderstanding; so is there no meane
betweene the Vnderstanding &amp; this Soule of the World: but
the difference is only this, that the one of them is as the very
heate which is in fyre it self, &amp; the other is as the heate which
Fyre communicateth or imparteth vnto other things <hi>[by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them with his heate.] And that is the same thing which wee
affirme when we say, That the holy Ghost procéedeth from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Sonne, calling him the Gift of God, because that by
him (who is his Loue) he voutsafeth to impart himselfe to vs here
beneath. But we shal discerne his meaning yet better by the effects
which he attributeth vnto him.</hi> This Soule <hi>(sayth he)</hi> hath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
life into all liuing things in the Ayre, in the Sea, and on
the Land. It ruleth the Sunne, the Starres and the Heauen; It
hath quickened the Matter which erst was nothing and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
full of darknesse; and all this hath it done by the onely will
of it selfe. It is all throughout all, like to the Father, as well in
that it is but one, as in that it extendeth it self into all places.
<hi>And he concludeth thus:</hi> And thus farre extendeth the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
<hi>In déede he speaketh not so distinctly thereof, as</hi> Gregorie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13215:58"/>
Nazianzene; <hi>but yet forasmuch as he sayth that they be all thrée e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
of one selfesame substance, and differing onely in this, that
the one of them is not the other, the same may well bee gathered of
his sayings. In the residue of his booke he proueth that the same
was the opinion of</hi> Plato, Parmenides, <hi>and</hi> Anaxagoras. <hi>And
because the inward man (as he termeth it,) is the Image of God;
he taketh proofe of the thrée Inbeings, from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of our
Soule, wherein there is a Mynd, a Reason and a Life; which thrée
be (notwithstanding) all but one Soule. Neuerthelesse, he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the maner of the sayd begetting in diuers other places.</hi> The
One <hi>(sayth he)</hi> begetteth the vnderstanding, of the abundance
of himself.<note place="margin">Plotinus Enn. 5. lib. 2. &amp; lib. 3 Chap. 5. 6. 7. 12. &amp; lib 4. Chap. 2.</note> And the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is the Beeër, yea and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
being of the Beeër <hi>(marke those words for all that followeth)</hi>
and turneth backe againe to him, and is filled with him. <hi>And
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion is, that the Mynder, the Mynding and the Mynded,
are in the Godhead all one thing; and that this Mynding, which is
the first and most excellent act of the Godhead, is essentiall, that is
to say, the very substance or béeing of the Godhead, because that all
the actions of the Godhead are the very Godhead or God himselfe.
Now, by the</hi> Mynder, <hi>he meaneth the</hi> One <hi>or the</hi> First person;
<hi>and by the</hi> Mynded <hi>or</hi> Beeër <hi>he meaneth the Second; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that they be Coessentiall, [that is to say, both one selfsame
thing, which is GOD.] Againe,</hi>* There is <hi>(fayth he)</hi> a dubble
kynd of Mynding: For a man myndeth, eyther another, or
himselfe. Now, he that myndeth himself, hath not a seuerall
beeing from that thing which he myndeth, but being both in
one, he beholdeth himself in himself, and so becommeth two
parties, which yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding be both but one thing still.
<hi>Now therefore there remayneth no more but to conclude, that the
Begetter and the Begotten,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 5. lib. 5. Ch. 3. &amp; lib. 6. Ch. 1. &amp; lib. 8. ch. 12. &amp; Enn. 3. lib. 8. cap. 7. 8. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the Mynder and the Mynded are both
together, and also both one selfsame thing; and that if they bee both
one selfesame thing, the one of them is not better than the other.
Whervpon it followeth, that whereas he said heretofore that</hi> The
One is better than the Vnderstanding <hi>(which he calleth heere
the</hi> Mynded,) <hi>he ment it but in way of relation, and not in way of
béeing. For in another place he sayth againe,</hi>‖ He that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Liuing himself, is not the Mynded, but we cal him the Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And although they differ one from another, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it is not possible for them to bee disseuered. Onely
they may be discerned in vnderstanding, the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13215:58"/>
because the one of them is not the other; which maner
of discerning is no impediment but that they remayne both
one thing still. For only God is both the partie that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
in Mynd or Vnderstanding, and also the partie that
conceyueth him. Insomuch that when wee say, that the Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
beholdeth the formes or Patternes of things;<note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 5. lib. 9. Chap. 1.</note> wee meane
not that he looketh at them in another, but that he possesseth
them in himselfe, by hauing in himself the partie that is myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Or rather were it amisse to say, that the same which is
mynded is the very Mynder himselfe in his vnitie and settled
state; and that the nature of the Mynded which is behild, is
an act that isseweth from him that Myndeth, which act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in beholding or mynding him, and in beholding him
becometh one selfesame thing with him? <hi>Againe he sayth in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
other place;</hi> To bee and to vnderstand, are both one thing <hi>[in
God:]</hi> and if any thing proceede therof inwardly, yet is it no
whit diminished therby, because the Mynder and the Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
are both one same thing. For the beholding of ones selfe
in his selfe, is nothing but himselfe: But yet must there needes
be alwaies both a selfesamenesse and also an othernesse. <hi>Now
then, let vs conclude thus; that these two Inbeings or Persons,
namely,</hi> The Mynded and the Mynder, <hi>are both one thing; and
therefore that they differ not but only in way of relation: And that
forasmuch as there must néedes bee euer both a selfesamenesse and
also an othernesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 6. lib. 7. ch. 39. &amp; lib. 7.</note> (If I may so terme them) the selfesamenesse is

nothing but God; and the othernesse is in the Inbeings or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as in respect that the one is the begetter and the other is the

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer, this</hi> Plotinus <hi>calleth the begetter the Father, and
the begotten the Sonne, after the same maner that we doe.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse
<hi>(sayth he)</hi> the vnderstanding is beautifull, and the most
beautifull of all, <hi>(and therefore in diuers other places he termeth
him the Beautifull, (as he termed the First the Good)</hi> and sitteth
in cleere light and brightnesse,<note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 5. lib. 5. cap. 12.</note> and conteyneth in him the
nature of all things that are. As for this Worlde of ours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be beautifull, yet it is scarce an image or shadowe of
him; but the world that is aboue, is set in the very light itself,
where there is nothing that is voyd of vnderstanding, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
darke, but euery where is led a most blessed lyfe. Now,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13215:59"/>
lyke as he that beholdeth the Skye and the Starres, falleth by

thereof, namely who he is that begate that World, and where

the Father, and that the Father hath all fulnesse, but of himselfe:
and that the Father is not the Sonne or the Worde, but that the

in that Sonne al things, and yet holding him still in him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

we come to Nature, and of Nature againe we demaund from

be, vnlesse the Mynd be the very Wisedome it selfe. Wisedome

And so God setteth downe himself in this act of Beeing. <hi>And
this is in a maner all one with the things which I spake in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

in another place,</hi> This same GOD <hi>(sayth he)</hi> is both the lonely
and loue: and this Loue is the loue of himselfe: for of himselfe
and in himselfe is he altogether beautifull. And whereas he is
sayd to be altogether with himselfe; it could not be so, vnlesse
that both the thing which is and also the person which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

It is the first beautifull, and beautifull of it selfe, and hath the
grace of beautie of himselfe, and before all worlds proceeded
from God as from his cause, selfeborne and father of himself.
And this proceeding of his, was not as ye would say by Gods

proceeding of himselfe from God, and by his issewing of him
selfe. I say by proceeding, howbeit not at any beginning of

the better of the Word or the Lawe; he answered likewise in verse,
That men ought to beléeue in God the begetter, and in the King
that was afore all things, vnder whom quaketh both Heauen and
Earth, Sea and Hell, yea and the very Gods themselues, whose
Lawe is the Father that is honored by the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And these
Oracles were wont to be sung in Uerse, to the intent that all men
should remember them the better as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth. Now I
haue bin the longer in this Chapter, because most men thinke this
doctrine so repugnant to mans Reason, that Philosophie could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
allowe of it; not considering that it is another matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
a thing, than to prooue or allow it when it is conceyued. And
therefore aswell for this Chapter as for that which went afore, let
vs conclude, both by reason added to Gods reuealing, and by the
traces thereof in the World, and by the Image thereof shining
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13215:63"/>
foorth in our selues, and by the Confession of all the auncient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,
and by the very depositious of the Deuilles themselues; that
in the onely one Essence or substance of God, there is a Father, a
Sonne, and a holy Ghost; the Father euerlastingly begetting the
Sonne, and the Spirit euerlastingly procéeding from them both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sonne begotten by the Mynd, and the Spirit procéeding by
the Will: which is the thing that we had here to declare. And let
this handling of that matter concerning Gods essence bee taken as
done by way of preuention, howbeit that it depend most properly
vppon the reuelation of our Scriptures, which being proued will
consequently yéeld proofe to this poynt also. There may bee some
perchaunce which will desire yet more apparant proofes: but let
them consider that wee speake of things which surmount both the
arguments of Logike and also Demonstration. For, inasmuch as
Demonstrations are made by the Causes, the Cause of all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
can haue no Demonstration. But if any be so wilful as to stand
in their owne opinion against the trueth which all the World proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
&amp; al Ages acknowledge: let them take the payne to set doune
their Reasons in writing; and men shall see how they be but eyther
bare Denyalles, or Gesses, or simple distrusts or misbeleefs of the
things which they vnderstand not, and that they be vnable to wey
against so graue and large Reasons and Recordes, as I haue set
downe heretofore. And therefore, the glorie thereof be vnto God.</p>

séeing that our eysight ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abyde the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of so great a light; let it content vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
it in the shadowe. Now, this sensible
world wherein we dwell, is (as the <hi>Platonists</hi>
terme it) the shadow of the world that is subiect to vnderstanding:
for certesse it cannot be called an Image thereof, no more than the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13215:63"/>
buylding of a Maystermason is the Image of his mynd. And yet
for all the greatnesse, beautie, and light which wee see therein, I
cannot tell whether the woord shadowe doe throughly fit it or no,
considering that shadowes haue some measure in respect of their
bodies, but betwéene finite and infinite is no proportionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
at all. We that are héere in the world, doe woonder at it,
and we would thinke wee did amisse if we should beléeue that any
thing is better or more beautifull than that. For our flesh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
are proportioned after the Elements thereof, and to the
things which it bringeth foorth, as our eyes vnto the light thereof,
and all our sences too the sensible nature thereof: and those which
are of the world seeke but onely to content the sensualitie that is in
them. But as we haue a Mynd, so also let vs beléeue that the same
is not without his obiect or matter to rest vpon. And as the sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
things serue the things that haue sence; so let vs make the
sensible things to serue the Mynd, and the Mynd it selfe to serue
him by whom it is and vnderstandeth. My meaning is, that wee
should not wonder at the world for the worlds sake it selfe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the woorkemaister and author of the world. For it were too
manifest a childishnes to woonder at a portraiture made by a Pein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and not to woonder much more at the Peynter himselfe.</p>
               <p>Now the first consideration that offereth it selfe to the beholder
of this woorke, is whether it hath had a beginning or no: a question
which were perchaunce vnnecessarie in this behalfe, if euery man
would consult with his owne Reason, whereunto nothing is more
repuguant, than to thinke an eternitie to bee in things which wee
not onely perceiue with our sences, but also doe sée to perish. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
forasmuch as the world speaketh (sayth the Psalmist) both in
all Languages and to all Nations: let vs examine it, both whole
together, and according to the seuerall parts thereof.<note place="margin">The world it selfe telleth vs that it had a beginning.</note> For it may be
that the worldlings (if they distrust their owne record) will at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
admit that which the world it selfe shall depose thereof. Let
vs then examine the Elements all together: they passe from one
into another; the Earth into Water, the Water into Ayre, and
Ayre into Water againe, and so foorth. Now this intercourse can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made but in tyme, and tyme is a measuring of mouing, and
where measure is, there can be no eternitie. Let vs examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally:
The Earth hath his seasons, after Springtime commeth
Sommer, after Sommer succeedeth Haruest, and after Haruest
followeth Winter. The Sea hath his continuall ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13215:64"/>
which goeth increasing and decreasing by certeyne measures.
Diuers Riuers, and especially <hi>Nyle,</hi> haue their increasings at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
seasons, and to a certeyne measure of Cubits. The Ayre also
hath his Windes, which doe one while cléere it and another while
trubble it: and the same Windes doe reigne by turnes, blowing
sometime from the East, and sometime from the West; sometime
from the North and sometime from the South. And vppon them
dependeth Rayne and faire wether, Stormes and Calmes. These
interchaunges which are wrought by turnes cannot bee without
beginning. For where order is, there is a formernesse and an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and all chaunge is a kind of mouing, insomuch that the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
which are made successiuely one after another, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
haue had a beginning at some poynt or other; on the Land,
by some one of the Seasons; on the Sea, by ebbing and flowing;
and in the Ayre, by North or by South; and so foorth. For if they
began not at any one poynt, then could they not hold out vnto an
other poynt. The Land then by his Seasons, the Ayre by his
chaunges, and the Sea by his Tydes, ceasse not to crye out and to
preach vnto all that haue eares to heare, that there is no euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingnesse
in them, but that they haue had a beginning all of them.
Againe, when we consider that the Earth receyueth his Seasons
from the Sunne, the Sea his Tydes from the Moone, &amp; the Ayre
his Windes from an outward power that is vnseene: ought wée
not to seeke the beginning thereof aboue and not beneath, without
them and not within them, seeing that nothing héere belowe hath
mouing of it selfe? And if the Elements which are accounted for
the very grounds and beginnings of things, acknowledge a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their mouings; ought we not to acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same in all
other things? Again, if we consider how this Moone which maketh
the Tydes in the Sea, hath no light but from the Sunne which
maketh the Seasons on the Earth; doe we not conclude by and by,
that the Seasons of the Earth, and the Tydes of the Sea, and the
continnall chaunges, mouings, and (as ye would say) backebrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
of the Elements, haue one commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginning? But it may
bee that these mouings haue place but onely vnder the Moone, and
not in that fifth Quintessence of the Heauen, the substantialnesse
and eternitie whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth so highly commend. Nay,
what if the higher wee mount vp, they proclayme their beginning
still the lowder? What if the thing which we most chiefly wonder
at in the Heauen, be most repugnant to eternitie? The Sunne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13215:64"/>
there his naturall course in the Zodiacke betwéene the two
Tropicks or Turnepoynts, so as the Zodiacke is as it were his
race, and the Tropicks are his vtmost listes, both the which are so
distinguished by degrées and minutes, that hee cannot passe one
hearebredth beyond them. The poynts of his two stops are his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
bounds, the which so soone as he commeth at, by and by he
turneth head back againe. Must he not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> néedes haue had a place
to set out from, seeing he hath a place whereat to stop? Euery fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and twentie howers hee is caryed from East to West by the
mouing of the Skye: and like as by his natural mouing he maketh
the Sommer and the Winter; so by this violent moouing he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Day and Night. Can such succession of tymes and Seasons
be made otherwise than in tyme, or rather be any other thing than
tyme? The Moone likewise finisheth her course euery Moneth: we
see how she chaungeth, groweth, becommeth full, and waneth. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Planet hath his prefixed tyme and his ordinary course. To be
short, men see the rising and the going downe of the Starres, and
likewise their appearing and their tarying out of sight: and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Heauen it selfe which with himselfe caryeth all the rest about,
doth it not but by moouing. Now whatsoeuer is moued, is moued
in tyme; and all goings or whéelings about, must néeds begin at
some one poynt; like as in the drawing of a Circle, the one shanke.
of the Compasses is set fast in some place, and the other shanke is
caryed round about. What followeth the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but that the mouing of
the Heauen and of al the things which the Heauen beareth and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth
about, hath had a beginning? Then let vs not wonder at the
brightnesse and light thereof as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did; for that bewrayeth
the matter so much the more apparantly, in that it hath not that
light but by distribution of mouing; nor at his perpetuall mouing,
for that sheweth the more his streyt seruice whereto he is subiect;
nor at his Constancie, for that is necessitie; nor at his huge great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
for he is so much the more hugely bowed downe. Surely the
Skye is as the great whéele of a Clocke, which sheweth the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
the Signes, the howers, and the Tydes, euery one in their
tyme, and that which seemeth to be his chiefe wonder, proueth him
to bee subiect to tyme, yea and to bee the very instrument of tyme.
Now, seeing he is an instrument, there is a Worker that putteth
him to vse, a Clockkéeper that ruleth him, a Mynd that was the
first procurer of his mouing. For euery instrument, how mouable
so euer it be, is but a dead thing so farre foorth as it is but an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13215:65"/>
if it haue not life and mouing from some other thing than it

and in so many worlds and ages as haue bin, we perceiue
no alteration at all. Wretched man that thou art! Thy Hart and
thy Lights also haue a continuall mouing, and neuer lye still; and
thou, with all the witte thou hast, canst neither increase it nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streine
it. The Phisitions themselues feele it, but can find no cause

canst thou not tell the ende and the beginning thereof. Doest not
thou things thy selfe which men as thou art doe déeme to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

selfmouings, of whose beginnings not euen Children are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?
And yet vnder colour that the great whéele of Heauen hath
now of long tyme turned about without ceasing, wilt thou be so
childish or so bli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

O man, the same workmayster which hath set vp the Clock
of thy hart for halfe a score yeares, hath also set vp this huge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of the Skyes for certeyne thousands of yeares. Great are his
Circuits and small are thyne; and yet when thou hast accounted
them throughly, they come both to one.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the things that haue lyfe and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shoote foorth into branches, and beare both bud and fruite: but yet
either the plant springeth of the kernell, or the kernell of the plant,
and both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> procéede of a maker. Of liuing wights, some bring
foorth their yong ones alyue, and some lay Egges, and we knowe
which is ingendred of which: but whether the Egge come of the
Hen, or the Hen of the Egge; it must néedes bée confessed that the
one of them had a beginning. But I will leaue this vayne dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
whether of them was the first; which question the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will discusse in one word. Yea and nature it selfe also will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse
it, which requireth to haue the first things brought foorth in
their perfect being. For it is enough for our purpose, that they may
find themselues conuicted of a beginning throughout all things.
And I pray you, if they cannot tell whether the mouing of their
Heart or of their Loongs, began first with shutting or with ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
at the thrusting of the breth foorth, or at the drawing of it in;
(whereof notwithstanding they cannot but knowe that there was
a beginning:) ought they to be admitted to deny that things had a
beginning, because it might be douted at which poynt they began?</p>
               <p>Now if the Dumb and spéechelesse things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Soothly as touching our bodyes, we know the beginning of them;
and our so curious searching out of Pedegrees, maketh vs too
confesse it whether wée will or no. And if any thing in the worlde
might haue any true pretence or lykelyhod to boast of an eternitie;
our Soules might doe it, which without mouing themselues doe
doe cause a thousand things to remoue. They mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp vnto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and go downe to the déepe, without shifting their place. They
hoord vp the whole world in the storehouse of their memorie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
combering of any roome there. They packe vp all tymes past
present and to come together, without passing from one too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
To be short, they conceyue and conteyne all things, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a sort euen themselues also. And yet shall we be so bold as too
say they be eternal without beginning? Nay, how can that be, sith
we sée that they profit and learne, yea and oftentimes also appayre
and forget, from age to age, and from day to day? How (I say)
can that be, sith we sée that they passe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ignorance to knowledge,
from darkenesse to light, from gladnesse to sadnesse, and from hope
to despayre; and that not by yeeres, but euen in minutes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
And (which more is) wee sée them receyue great trouble
and alteration by and for the things that are mutable and transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which florish in the morning, and are withered and parched as
in an Ouen at night. Now, to be altered and chaunged, importeth
a mouing, and he that graunteth a mouing, graunteth also a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and to be moued by things mutable, sheweth an ouer great
inconstancie of nature, which is a thing tootoo contrarie vnto eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
To be short, how can y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing be eternall or euerlasting, which
cannot so much as by any imagination resemble aught that this
word eternitie betokeneth? And yet this soule of ours is the thing
which in man ioyneth Heauen and Earth togither, marketh the
chaunges in things aboue, and for the most part worketh them in
the things beneath, carying vp a handfull of dust aboue the skyes,
and after a sort bringing downe Heauen vnto the Earth. Much
more reason then is it that neither in the Heauen, nor in the Earth,
nor in all the Harmonie of the whole world which wee so greatly
wonder at, there should not be any approching at al vnto eternitie.</p>
               <p>Some man perchaunce will say vnto mee,<note place="margin">An obiection.</note> that in the partes of
the World there is no eternitie, but yet there may be in the whole.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13215:66"/>
Nay, how can a Whole bee eternall, which is composed of brittle
and temporall parts? And what call they the Whole, but the huge
frame of Heauen, whose mouing proueth that it had a beginning?
Againe, some other will perhaps say, there is a beginning of moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in the world, as well in the whole as in the parts thereof; but
yet it doth not therefore followe, that it had beginning of béeing.
Nay, if the being thereof was euerlastingly afore the mouing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
how could it be called in Latine <hi>Mundus</hi> &amp; in Gréeke <hi>Cosmos,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>A goodly or beautifull order,</hi> seeing that for the
most part, Order dependeth vppon moouing? For, take from the
Heauens their turning about, and from the Sunne his course, and
set them fast in some place where you list; and you shall make the
one halfe of the Earth blynd, and the whole Earth eyther scorched
with his continuall presence, or desert and vninhabitable by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
and ye shall make the Sea for the most part vnsayleable, and
the Ayre vnfruitfull or vntemperate. Therefore it will followe at
the least, that the World hath not bin inhabited euerlastingly, nor
the Plants thereof bin eternall, nor the liuing Creatures (no not
euen Mankynd) bin without beginning. Surely I wote not what
eyes these Philosophers had, who had leuer to eternise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Stones,
Rocks, and Mountaines, than themselues for whom those things
were made. And againe, to what purpose serued the Sunne and
the Moone at that tyme? Wherefore serued Ayre, wherefore serued
Sea, when nothing did yet liue, see, and breathe? It remayneth
then that afore mouing, it was but a confused heape, masse or lump
of things without shape, and that in processe of tyme (as some say)
a certeyne Soule wound it selfe into it, and gaue shape to that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and afterward life, mouing and fence to the partes thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he had made euery of them capable to receiue: insomuch
that the world is nothing els but that confused heape now orderly
disposed, indewed with soule and life, so as of that soule and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
lumpe together, there is now made one perfect liuing wight.
A proper imagination surely, and méete for a very Beast, to father
his so orderly essence vppon the shapelessenesse of a Chaos, that is
to say, of confusednesse remoued away; rather than vpon the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
&amp; power of a quickning Spirit. But seeing that this Chaos
could not receyue eyther shape or order, but by the sayd Soule; if
they be both eternall, how met they together in one poynt, being of
so contrary natures, the one to shape and the other to be shaped? If
it were by aduenture, how did y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Soule by aduenture so set things
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13215:66"/>
in order, and how happeneth it that it hath not since that tyme put
them out of order againe? Or if it were by aduise; of whom should
that aduise be but of a Superiour? And who is that Superiour,
but God? Againe, eyther this Soule was tyed really and in very
déede to this bodie of the world from all eternitie; or els it did but
onely pearce through it by his power, as seemed best of the owne
freewill. If it were tyed, specially to such a confused masse; by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
but by force of a higher power? And then what els could that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Chaos be to him, but an euerlasting graue? And what els al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
were that to say, than that the sayd Chaos was as a shapelesse
Child yet newly begotten and scarce set together in the moothers
wombe, which within a few daies after, by the infusion of a Soule
beginneth to haue shape, mouing, and sence; and afterward in his
due tyme is borne, and being growne vp decayeth agayne, and so
endeth, as our bodies doe? Or if a Soule pearced into it and went
through it by a freewil and power; (let vs not striue about termes;
for a Soule is so named in respect of a bodie whereto it is tyed) the
same is the liuing GOD, who at his pleasure gaue it both shape,
life, and mouing. But I will shew hereafter, that he not only gaue
the Worlde his shape, but also created the very matter stuffe and
substance thereof. But it suffiseth mée at this tyme to wrest from
them, that he is the maker and shaper thereof.</p>
               <p>Let vs yet more clearely set forth the originall of the World. I
aske what the world is of it selfe? If it moue not, it forgoeth both
his order and his beautie, as I sayd afore. And if it moue, it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it selfe vncapable of eternitie.<note place="margin">The linking of things togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> But there is yet more. These lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

temperatenesse of the aire serueth for him; and yet the aire can not
bee tempered nor the Earth lighted, without the Sonne and the
Moone: Neither can the Sunne and the Moone giue light and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratnesse
without mouing. The Moone hath no light but of the
Sunne; neither can the Sunne yéeld it either to the Moone or too
the Earth, but by the mouing of the Heauen: and the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the Heauen going about, is the very thing which wée call
the World, not estéeming these lower parts (as in respect of their
matter) otherwise than as the dregges of the whole. And whereas
the Elements serue man, and the Planets serue the Elements, yea
and the Planets them selues serue one another: doe they not shew
that they be one for another? And if they be one for another; is not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13215:67"/>
one of them in consideration afore another; as the ende afore the
things that tend vnto the end, according to this common rule, that
the <hi>Mynd</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The inwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Mynd begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at the end.</note> 
                  <hi>beginneth his work at the end thereof?</hi> Now then,
if the turning about of the Heauen serue to shewe the Planets, and
they to yéeld light to the Earth and to all things thereon: doth it
not serue for the Earth? And if it serue the Earth; I pray you is
that done by appoyntment of the Earth, or rather by appoyntment
of some one that commaundeth both Heauen and Earth? Againe,
seeing that the ende is in consideration afore the things that tend
thereto: shall this consideration be in the things themselues, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in some Spirite that ordereth them? Soothly, in the things
themselues it cannot be: for if they haue vnderstanding, they haue
also will; and the will intendeth rather to commaund than to obey,
and vnto fréedome rather than bondage: and if they haue no vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
then knowe they neither end nor beginning. Moreouer,
forasmuch as they bee diuers, and of contrary natures; they should
ame at diuers ends, whereas now they ame all at one end. Nay,
which more is, how should the Sunne and the Moone, the Heauen
and the Earth haue met euerlastingly in matching their dealings
so iumpe together, the one in giuing light, and the other in taking
it? In what poynt, by what couenant, and vnder what date was
this done, seeing it dependeth altogether vppon mouing, which is
not to be done but in tyme? It remayneth then, that the sayd consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
was done by a Spirit that commaundeth al things alike,
and that he putteth them in subiection one to another as seemeth
best to himselfe, forsomuch as he is mightie to kéepe them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and wise to guyde them to their peculiar ends, and all their
ends vnto his owne ende; and he that thinketh otherwise thinketh
that a Lute is in tune of it owne accord. Or if he say that this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is a Soule inclosed in the whole, he doth fondly incorporate the
Spirit of the Luteplayer in the Lute it selfe, and likewise the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the buylding. In effect it is all one as if a Child that is borne
and brought vp in a house, should thinke the house to be eternall or
els made of it selfe, because he had not seene it made: or as if a man
that had bin cast out newly borne in a desert Iland, and there nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vp by a Wolfe as <hi>Romulus</hi> was; should imagine himself to be
bred out of the Earth in one night like a Mushrom. For, to beléeue
that the World is eternall, and that the race of Mankinde is bred
of it selfe without a maker, is all one thing, and spring both of one
error. Doe not the two Sexes of Male and Female in all liuing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13215:67"/>
things ouerthrowe the sayd eternitie? For how should they bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly
the one for the other, seeing they be so diuers? Againe,
haue they bin euerlastingly but two, or euerlastingly mo than two?
If but two, where are those two become, seeing that eternitie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
immortalitie, and a beginninglesse forebeing from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
inferreth an endlesse afterbeing or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance to euerlasting?
And if they were many: see ye not still the selfesame absurdities?
And if ye say they be made euerlasting by succession of tyme; what
(I pray you is death) but a token that they were borne? What is
life (I speake of this our life) but a continuance of death? and what
is succession, but a prolonging of time? Thus then ye see how that
aswell by the parts of the World, and by the whole World it self,
as also by the agréement of the whole with his parts, and of the
parts among themselues; we be euidently taught that the fraine of
the World had both a workmayster and a beginning. But now
some man wil aske vs when it began? And that is the poynt which
we haue to treate of next.</p>

               <p>Let vs begin at the Liberall Sciences; and we shall reade of the
first commings vp of them all. Philosophie, which consisteth in the
searching out of naturall things, is of so late continuance, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the tyme of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the very name thereof was not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
The <hi>Romanes</hi> counted it for folly long tyme after that. And
<hi>Lucrece</hi> the Epicure singeth in his tyme, that the nature of things
was found out but late afore. Also <hi>Seneca</hi> who came long after
him, sayth that from the first comming vp of Philosophie to his
tyme, there were not full a thousand yéeres. <hi>Socrates</hi> is sayd to
haue bin the first that brought it from studie to practise, drawing it
(as they sayd) from Heauen to Earth, and from Cities to houses
and persons:<note place="margin">Austin. lib. 18. of the Citie of God, Cha. 37. Cicero: Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicus: Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius.</note> that is to say, by teaching men to knowe themselues
and to gouerne both themselues and others. And that is not aboue
two thousand yéeres agoe at the most: For he was since the tyme
of <hi>Esdras,</hi> who is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> last Historiographer of the Byble. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

we rather graunt an euerlasting ignorance in man, than a kynd of
youthfulnesse which hath learned things according to the growths
thereof in ages? And seeing that the Sciences, Artes, Honors,
and Deinties of the lyfe it selfe doe proue vs a beginning thereof:
is there any man either skilfull or vnskilfull, greate or little, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher

                  </gap> any more bee so bolde as to stand in contention
that the world is without beginning? What shall we then as now
conclude of all this discourse? First that the inuention of all things
is of so late tyme, that it is of sufficient force too make all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
(of what trade or profession so euer they bee) that it is but a
whyle ago since the worlde began. And secondly that the sayd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions
gathering together into one tyme, doe leade vs to some
one certeine Countrie as to a Centre, where mankind hath first
sprong vp, and afterward spred it selfe abroade as to the outermost
partes of all the Circle. This time is the same space that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Moyses</hi> and the vniuersall Flud: And the Countrie is the
same where mankind did first multiplie after their comming out of
the Arke: that is to wit, all the Coast from Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> along
by <hi>Mesopotamia, Syria</hi> and <hi>Phenice,</hi> vnto <hi>AEgypt;</hi> wherein wee
comprehend the land of <hi>Palestine</hi> or <hi>Iewrie</hi> as the middle thereof,
which by the auncient <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Historiographers, (who
were vnskifull in Geographie) is diuersly accounted and allotted
to the greater Countries that lye round about it, accordingly as it
bordereth vpon them; one while to <hi>Syria,</hi> another while to <hi>AEgipt;</hi>
some time to <hi>Phenicia,</hi> and some time to <hi>Araby</hi> the desert. And
therefore as touching tyme and antiquitie, it is good reason that
wee should beléeue the Histories of those Nations, and not of the
<hi>Greekes</hi> or of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who are but yong babes in respect of the
others; especially seeing that wee would thinke it a thing woorthy
to be laughed at, if a man should stand to the iudgement of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13215:74"/>
of <hi>Iewrie</hi> in the matters of the <hi>Greekes.</hi> But nowe let vs

beginning, or of so greate antiquitie as thou surmizest; how
happeneth it that it hath not alway bene knowen? whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it that it is euen yet so slenderly peopled? how comes it too
passe that it is not throughly inhabited in all places, or at leastwise
in the best places of the worlde, where euen in our tyme are found
both Iles and mayne Lands well habitable, and yet vninhabited?
It is not past a hundred yeres ago,<note place="margin">The World scarce knowen in old time.</note> since we knewe nothing at all
of more then the better halfe of the world. Wee were but at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
of the earth, and wee thought our selues to haue bin come
to the full knowledge of Geographie. We thought our selues to
haue knowen the vttermost Coastes of the world, when as we had
not yet passed the Southcircle which diuideth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world in twayne.

bene counted of most men for a foole. Yea and euen yet still at this
day, we know nothing of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mayne Land of the South, &amp; but very
little of the North. It is not past two hundred yeres ago, since the
<hi>Swedians</hi> sent the first inhabiters into the country of <hi>Groneland:</hi>
and both <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (being in our part of the world) are
yet still halfe barbarus. Ye shall reade in <hi>Caesars</hi> Commentaries,
that in his tyme <hi>Germanie</hi> was a continuall Forrest, wherein a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue gone 50. daies iourney ere he could see any end of
it, and that the people thereof were sauage and beastly, sacrifysing
their owne Children to their Goddes. He seemeth heere to speake
of the <hi>Cannibals</hi> or the people of <hi>Brasilie.</hi> It was long time after
ere the <hi>Romanes</hi> durst aduenture ouer farre in that Countrie.
Whereby it appeareth that all the auncient Townes and Citties
which stand vppon the Riuers of <hi>Rhyne</hi> and <hi>Danowe,</hi> towardes
<hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> did serue rather for a Banke or a Iettie against
the ouerflowing of the <hi>Germanes,</hi> than for Fortresses to assayle
them withall. Euen in the tyme of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> what were the people
on the Sea coast of <hi>Germanie?</hi> What were the <hi>Saxons</hi> in the
time of <hi>Charles</hi> the greate? And a feawe hundred yeeres agoe,
what were the Lowe Countryes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which at this day
be the florishingest people of all <hi>Ewrope?</hi> The same is to be sayd
of <hi>Ingland</hi> in <hi>Caesars</hi> time; and likewise of <hi>Fraunce, Italy,</hi> and
<hi>Spaine,</hi> if we mount a little higher. For seeing that <hi>Roome</hi> is the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13215:74"/>
oldest citie of the <hi>Latines;</hi> how happeneth it that <hi>Alexander</hi> (who

thereof? how happeneth it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knewe as litle also of the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of whom all the auncient Histories speake ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nothing at all, or els with wonderfull ignorance? And what
shall we say of <hi>Ephorus,</hi> whom men account the diligentest Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer
of them all? As great a Countrie as <hi>Spayne</hi> or <hi>Iberia</hi>
is; he writeth thereof in such sort, as if it were but only one towne.
Also what was <hi>Greece</hi> afore the tyme of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
who (as <hi>Thucidides</hi>

<hi>AEgypt?</hi> The holy Bible it selfe when it speaketh of the <hi>Greekes</hi>
and of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> speaketh of them as of Ilands, that is to say,
as of Countries that were furthest of from the knowledge of that

whom I call so, as in respect of the rest of the whole world, and of
the Centre and middle poynt thereof, which I haue taken too bee
from Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> vnto <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs see the Easterne Nations also. The Countrie of
<hi>India</hi> beyond the Riuer <hi>Ganges,</hi> was vnknowen in the tyme of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who notwithstanding had cast the platforme of his
Conquest, on that side of the world. And his Pylots which went to
seeke new Worlds, passed not beyond the Iland of <hi>Sumatra</hi> then
called <hi>Taprobane,</hi> which is vnder the Equinoctiall and Easterly
a great way of from the <hi>Molucques.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herodotus, lib. 4.</note> And when it was tolde the
<hi>Romanes</hi> that a Ship was found which by the commaundement
of <hi>Necho</hi> King of <hi>AEgypt</hi> had sayled about all the Coast of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike,</hi>
they tooke it for a fable: and therefore much lesse did they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come at <hi>Iaua</hi> the lesse or <hi>Iaua</hi> the more, or at the firme Land
which is next vnto them. To be short, they did not ordinarily passe
the Streytes of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> by reason whereof their greatest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
could lesse skill of the nature and course of the Tydes,
than the meanest Seamen or Sailer of our time. Now then what
is to be said of <hi>Plinie</hi> with his Dogheaded men, his Oneeyed men,
his Longeares, his Centaures, his <hi>Pygmees,</hi> and his <hi>Cyclopes,</hi>
seeing that in all the Countrie where he planteth them, wee finde
Men, Cities, and Kingdomes, no lesse whit florishing than the
same wherein hee himselfe was; and as for any lykelyhod of that
which he writeth of those things, we find none at all? As touching
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13215:75"/>
the Southcountryes and the Northcountryes, that is to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Circles of the two Poles: The fower Empyres which
haue bene so renowmed, neuer heard speaking of them but at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and much lesse extended them selues so farre; in so much that
euen we our selues know but a little of them, which Tempest and
Shipwrecke hath taught vnto vs.</p>
               <p>What win wee then by this discourse? Uerely that the World
was not knowne of all those great Empyres, and much lesse of
them that liued vnder their subiection. And that it was not peopled
all at once, but that as folke ouerswarmed in a place, and chaunced
to hit vpon a man that was aduentrus, they spred themselues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and further vnder his guyding, into the Countries next vnto
them. And (to be short) that the néerer any Countries were to our
foresayd Centre, the sooner were they inhabited, made ciuill, and
manured: which thing appeareth more plainly euen by the very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie
of the World.<note place="margin">The proceedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g or growing foreward of the World.</note> Therefore let vs take our Centre to be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the toppe of <hi>Mount Taurus</hi> where it is called <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and
where Stories report the Arke of <hi>Noe</hi> to haue rested; or els the
playne of <hi>Sennaar,</hi> where <hi>Moyses</hi> sayth that the Languages were
confounded, and folke dispersed abroade; or els some place of <hi>Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi>
(for it skilleth little in respect of the world) and by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the auncientest Estates, we shall finde the States of <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
of <hi>Syria,</hi> of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> and of <hi>Persia</hi> to haue bin nerest to our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and that the State of <hi>Assyria</hi> was the greatest of them all, and
yet in very trueth but small in comparison of the States that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded
it. From y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Assyrians,</hi> the Monarchie came to the <hi>Persians;</hi>
from the <hi>Persians,</hi> to the <hi>Greekes;</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Greekes,</hi> to the <hi>Latins;</hi>
from the <hi>Latins,</hi> to the <hi>Frenchmen;</hi> and from the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to
the <hi>Almanes,</hi> accordingly as Countries multiplyed their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that their people growing in Ciuilitie, matched their
force with wisedome? And <hi>Spayne</hi> which heretofore was counted
the vttermost part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> World, is now become y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first discouerer of
the newe World. But let vs goe on with the East parts: from the
<hi>Persians</hi> wee goe to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and from the <hi>Eastindians</hi> to the
<hi>Westindians,</hi> so long vntill wee come to their vttermost Coast,
which is the selfesame place where the <hi>Spanyards</hi> found their first
landing. And surely if two folke should kéepe on their way conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
the one on the one side and the other on the other (that is to
say, the one Eastward and the other Westward:) in the ende they
should méete both together, if there were firme land all the way for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13215:75"/>
them to go vpon. And in very déed, like as <hi>Ireland,</hi> a part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Laplond,</hi> and <hi>Groneland,</hi> being the vttermost parts of our
side of the World, are as good as sauage: so also be the vttermost
inhabiters of the <hi>Westindies;</hi> namely <hi>Canada, Baccalea, Brasilie,</hi>
and <hi>Petagon,</hi> which are descended of the <hi>Eastindies.</hi> And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise
like as in our Countries, the more they tend towards the
Centre which I haue taken, the mo tokens haue they of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie;
as, <hi>Fraunce</hi> mo than <hi>Germanie; Italy</hi> mo than <hi>Fraunce;
Greece</hi> mo than <hi>Italy; AEgipt</hi> mo than <hi>Greece;</hi> and so forth of the
rest: So the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> who in their first Conquests found but
Cotages and Bogges; did at their entering further into the Land,
finde goodly Cities wel inhabited, orderly distinction of Commons
and Nobilitie, Ministers of Iustice and men of Warre, Trades
and Handycraftes well gouerned, Histories of their doings, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
antiquities, Towers passing the Pyramyds of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> and
whatsoeuer els the world hath counted wonderfull. And out of
doubt the néerer they come to the Centre of that part, the more
shall they find still. For there is no man ignorant nowadayes what
goodly great Cities and florishing Kingdomes,<note place="margin">An History of the Realme of China.</note> haue within these
fewe yéeres bin discouered in the <hi>Westindies:</hi> And where it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to face the <hi>Eastindia</hi> with the Sea betwixt them both; there
we see the great Empyre of <hi>China,</hi> so beautifull, so florishing, and
so well gouerned in al respects; that the ciuilest tyme of all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Empyre, may well séeme vnto vs to haue bene barbarous in
comparison of that. It is in effect all one as though the Westerne
<hi>Indians</hi> making Conquests vpon vs as we haue done vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them,
should haue arriued at the first in <hi>Ireland, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Grone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
for as little could they haue sayd of vs, as wee of them. And
whereas it may be replyed, that although the people there be rude,
yet notwithstanding it hath euermore bin peopled: Let it be added
thereunto, that in following the Coastes, men haue found many
Countries euen yet vnpeopled. And also that euen in the best peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
places of all their Conquestes, they haue not found the tenth
part of so much people as the Countrie being manured were able
to beare; whereas on the contrary part, in our Countries the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

doe pester one another. And wheras our very vttermost bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are more frequented then theirs; the cause therof is, that ours
be much néerer the Centre which I set downe, then theirs bee; as
the Cosmographers doe easly perceyue. Wherevpon it hath come
to passe, that the people which haue bene spred abroade from our
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13215:76"/>
Centre vnto the vttermost Coasts of the frosen Sea, finding them
selues more multiplyed than their Lands were able to mainteyne,
and being not able to go any further for the Sea that hemmed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in; haue rebounded backe agayne vppon the next Countries, as
namely the <hi>Cymbrians</hi> vppon the <hi>Almanes</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> and
afterward the <hi>Gothes</hi> vpon <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the <hi>Humes</hi> vpon
<hi>Pannoye,</hi> the <hi>Vandales</hi> vpon <hi>Spayne,</hi> and lastly the <hi>Turkes</hi> and
<hi>Tartarians</hi> vpon all <hi>Europe.</hi> Which thing hath not happened vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the other part of the World, because of the large scope of their
Countrey, which eniptyeth the Easterne <hi>Indya</hi> nito y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Westerne;
The Westerne into newe <hi>Spayne;</hi> newe <hi>Spayne</hi> into <hi>Brasilie;</hi> and
<hi>Brasilie</hi> into the Southerne land, wherof not so much as the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast
is yet knowne. Neither befell it so vnto vs in the first ages,
because our part of the World was not yet sufficiently peopled to
ebbe backe agayne: but it befell chiefly a little afore or a little after
the comming of Iesus Christ, that is to wit, towards the perfect
age of the World. To bee short, were there neuer so much people,
yet were it no woonder to him that would take the peynes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what onely one ofspring might amount vnto in one hundred
yéeres, and how many one man might see to come of himselfe in
his owne lifetyme; which in another hundred yéere might increase
into an infinite multitude. The Empyres haue alwaies extended
their largenesse towards the North and the South, but yet more
Northerly than Southerly, because the Centre which I take, is
still afore towards the North, and in the temperatest Clymate of
our halfe Globe, that is to wit, towards the 35. and 40. degréees
(or thereabouts) of the Equinoctiall lyne, which diuideth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> World
euen in the middest; which thing I desire the Readers to mark ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly.
And truely <hi>Iseland</hi> (which in old tyme was called <hi>Thule,</hi>)
was knowne in the tyme of great <hi>Alexander,</hi> notwithstanding
that it be situate about 68. degrées North; whereas yet for al that,
the greatest part of <hi>Affrick</hi> was vnknowne to them, and the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
reach of their knowledge was the Ile of <hi>Taprobane,</hi> which
neuerthelesse are but vnder the Equinoctiall: so farre of were they
from atteyning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Southpole. To be short, the Coast of <hi>Affrick</hi>
or <hi>Barbarie</hi> &amp; of <hi>Spayne,</hi> was peopled by the <hi>Phenecians,</hi> whom

you what can bee more childish, (or rather as <hi>Varro</hi> sayth in his

the <hi>Libyans,</hi> the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and so forth; who reteyned the

Now looke in what measure these fathers of houses increased their

the whole world.</p>
               <p>But here is an Obiection which seemeth stronger.<note place="margin">An Obiection of Fluddes taken out of Plato.</note> These rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(say they) do bring vs vp to the Flood; but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Flud brought
mankynd to that small number, whereby the World was by little
and little renewed agayne: So may it be that there were other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Fluds, that had done the like afore; so as this latter Flud was
rather a renewing of the World, than a first beginning therof. And
to this purpose they will alledge this saying of <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi>
that the ouerflowings of waters and the burnings by fire,
doe from tyme to tyme refresh the World, and destroy the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
of the former ages, and also of all Artes, Sciences, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inuentions. This is worthie of some examination. Surely
of Burnings eyther vniuersall or any thing great in respect of the
whole world, there is no mention found in any Storie. Also of any
other generall Flud, than that which wee take to bee the first, and
last, there is as little to be found, vnlesse they will apply that name
to the ouerflowings of Riuers in some final quarter, or to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Sea by force of his breaking into some Countrey a
League or twayne, which can nothing serue to this purpose. And
if their alledging of it in that behalfe be vnfeinedly and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
as I beléeue it is; well mought they fare for their confession.
For then will I aske them whether this Flud were vniuersall, or
particular but to some one Countrey. If it were particular; how
commeth it to passe that all Nations confesse it to bee vniuersall?
And how commeth it to passe also that the Countries which had
no part thereof, haue no incling thereof eyther in memorie or in
writing? Or if it were vniuersall; did any men escape from it, or no?
If none escaped, how then come wee to the knowledge of it? And
whence are we also, but of a new Creation? And he that was able
to create vs agayne, why was he not able to create vs also afore?
If some escaped, as all of vs do consent that there did: why beléeue
we them not as well in the things that went afore the Flud, as we
beléeue them concerning the Flud it selfe? And who bee those that
escaped but <hi>Noe</hi> and his issew, who leade vs to the first beginning
both of the World and of men? For in al the Histories of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
what finde wee thereof woorth the alledging? Againe, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
whether this sayd Flud and others which they pretend to
haue abolished the rememberance of the former tymes, befell by
chaunce or by prouidence? If by chaunce; was it not possible, that
of so many which may perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce haue bin eyther from euerlasting
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13215:78"/>
or of very old tyme, perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not so much as any one should haue
escaped? Or if by Prouidence; by whose prouidence should it be but
by Gods? or who could haue power to vndoe and confound this
worke, but only he that made it? And what warrant hast thou that
he destroyed it more than once, seeing thou art inforced to graunt
that he made it but once? Nay, it may be that it befel through some
Coniunction of the Starres. And who told them so? And if they
knowe so much thereof, let them tell vs what Starres. I omit to
tell them that such Coniunctions (as they themselues teach) threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
not the whole World, but some small part thereof. After this
maner did the Astrologers say, that in the yéere 1524. there should
méete the like Coniunction as was at the generall Flud, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof the whole earth should be couered with water: and yet
as <hi>(Viues</hi> sayth) a fayrer yéere was neuer seene. To bee short, all
things will goe for payment with these folke, sauing the trueth.</p>
               <p>But sée here their last Ankerhold. How happeneth it (sayth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrhois</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The obiection of Auerrhoes.</note>)
that God forbore so long, and where had hee that newe
deuice of making the world? Silly soule that thou art! which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
in asking Questions whereas skill consisteth in answering.
Thou wilt néedes prooue the world by thy reasons to bee without
beginning: and yet in thrée woords which thou hast spoken, thou
shewest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou knowest not what eternitie or euerlastingnes is. In
eternitie (fréend myne) there is neither length nor shortnes of time:
the euerlasting prouidence is not tyed to new casualtie. Consider
that thou art a man. The Plants cannot iudge of Sence; the
Beastes cannot iudge of the drift of Reason; neither canst thou

                  </gap>biect to tyme, iudge of eternitie which is without time.
For if euen thy litle Babe which is in time, cannot conceiue what
tyme is: how shall hee that is but in tyme, vnderstand the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingnes
of the euerlasting? After that maner the brute beasts (if
they had speech) would decipher the reache of thy wit according to
their owne imagination. And thou wouldest mocke at them if they
should goe about to describe what thy memorie is, which ioyneth
past, present, and to come all in one. And how thinkest thou thy self
able to iudge of eternitie, which alterest with the Winds, with the
Moones, and with the seasons of the yere; euery day, euery howre,
and euery minute? Askest thou why God forbore so long tyme?
Nay rather, aske why God listed to make the tyme it selfe; for in
one vndeuidable moment is eternitie ioyned both too y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning
and to the ende of tyme. Learne this also, that where there is any
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13215:78"/>
bound orend, there is no long tyme. The long time of a Worme,
is a mooneth; of an Ant, a yere; of a Horse, thirtie yeres; of a man,
a hundred yeeres; of all mankind, certeine thousands of yeres; of
tyme it selfe, a certeine space of tyme; and the terming of any of all
their times long, is in respect of the long continuance of their life in
time; but vnto him that made tyme, nothing indureth lesse whyle
than time. Put the cace that the world haue lasted a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeres, or (if ye will) tenhundred thousand, what shall ye gaine
by that? That the world shall haue bene of the greater antiquitie.
But in respect of whom? of God, or of thy selfe? of a Woorme, or
of a Spirit? of eternitie, or of tyme? And what is all that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of infinitenesse? Is not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Question all one still? Whence
is this deuice? whence is this chaunce? as well in a hundred; as
in a thousand, and as well in a thousand as a thousand thousand?
Yet was the deuice and purpose eternall, notwithstanding that the
execution thereof be in tyme, insomuch that he hath brought forth
tyme, and tyme is measure of mouing, and mouing proueth a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and the beginning which it taketh is euer newe. Thou
then which by a mouing hast a beginning proued vnto thée, giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thy surmised eternitie and confesse a newnesse of tyme, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is newer than tyme. With like reason myst thou demaund
why God made the World rather here than elswhere. For these
distinctions of time and place were created and brought forth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at one instant with the World, so as they be neither without
it nor afore it. He that is without tyme and without place, made
both tyme and place; and if he had bin subiect to tyme and place, as
thou imaginest; he could not haue made eyther place or tyme. Yea,
but what did hee then (sayest thou) afore the worlde and out of the
world? Once agayne amend thy plea. For in God there is neyther
afore nor after, within nor without. But surely it is a goodly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and welbeseeming a great wit. Afore thy Clocke or thy buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was made, thou diddest not ceasse to liue and to delight thy
selfe in the perfectnesse of thyne Arte; and afterward thy building
added nothing vnto thée, but thou vnto thy building. Thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
haue bin ashamed to haue asked of <hi>Scipio</hi> what he did at home
in his house in the Countrie, after he had giuen ouer the affayres
of the Commonweale and the warre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was neuer lesse ydle than when he was ydle, nor lesse

God greatly on ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to make this goodly place of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> world for thée,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13215:79"/>
and to harber such blasphemers as thou art therein, as if he could
not haue forborne thée, or liued without thy companie. God did the
same thing without the world, which he doth still with the world:
that is to wit, he is happie in himselfe. The world hath nothing at
all augmented his felicitie or happinesse. But to the intent (as y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
would say) to shed foorth his happinesse out of himselfe; it liked him
to create the world. Yea, but why did he it no sooner? What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of faults are heere in one spéech? Thou wilt néedes be priuie to
the cause of Gods will in al things, and yet is Gods will the cause
of the causes of all things. By eternitie thou haddest not bin able to
haue knowne his power; for the Maiestie therof would haue made
the darke; and it is so bright that thou couldest haue séene lesse, than
thou couldest see now if thou wert lodged in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of the Sunne.
Now he maketh thee to perceyue his power, by the creation of the
world; his eternitie, by comparison of tyme; &amp; his glorious bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
by the shadowe thereof. By eternitie, thou couldest not haue
knowne his wisedome; for thou wouldest haue déemed all things
as wise as he, seeing they had bin as euerlasting as he. And what
wisedome had remayned in him, if all things had bin of necessitie,
and nothing at his owne choyce and libertie? But now thou seest
his wisedome in the Stones, in the Herbs, in the dumb creatures,
yea and euen in the workmanship of thy selfe. Thou seest it in the
order, in the succession, and in the bréeding of all things. Thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
at it in the greatest things, and thou wonderest at it in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest;
as much in the Flye and the Ant, as in the whole Cope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
wheras the eternitie of things would haue caused thée to haue
attributed Godhead to the Skyes, the Starres, the Earth, the
Rockes, the Mountaynes, and in effect to all things rather than
thy selfe, as they did which were taught so to do. Also by this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
thou couldest not haue conceyued his goodnesse, because thou
wouldest haue thought that GOD had had as much néede of the
World, as the World had of him. Thou shouldest not haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
thy selfe to bee any more beholden to him, than to the fire for
heating thée or to the Sunne for giuing thée light, because they
should no more bee eyther fire or Sunne, if they forwent that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But he sheweth thée by the creation, both that he himselfe is
euer, and that thou hast had thy being since the tyme that it pleased
him to create thée: that he without thée is eternall; and that thou
without his goodnesse haddest neuer bin that little which thou art:
and to bee short, that he is not tyed to any néede or necessitie as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:13215:79"/>
God is, (which could not refuse to driue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mill, but was
tyed to it whether he would or no:) but that his doing of things is
altogether of his owne infinite goodnesse, wherethrough he vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
to impart himselfe vnto others, by making the thing to bée
which was not; yea and by making the thing happie, which of it
selfe could not so much as be. Now, had man any will or skill to
acknowledge the power, wisedome, and goodnesse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his God? [I
thinke not.] Then was it for thy benefite and not for his owne,
that he made not the World eyther of greater antiquitie, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For had he made it eternall; (let vs so speake seeing ye will
haue it so,) thou wouldest haue made a God of it, and thou canst
not euen now forbeare the doing thereof. And had he made it of
more antiquitie; thou wouldest haue made it an occasion to forget
thy God; and for all the newnesse thereof, yet wilt thou not beare it
in thy mynd. Then seeke not the cause thereof in his power. The
cause thereof is in thy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his goodnesse, in that he intendeth to succour thyne ignorance.
And so, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al their obiections, we shall by this meanes
hold still our conclusion, to wit, That the World is but of late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;
That it had a beginning; and that concerning the tyme of

were mingled together vntill God had spoken; and then by and by
eyther of them tooke his place by himselfe. After the same maner
<hi>Mercurie</hi> sayth that those two Elements lying erst mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
seuered themselues asunder at the speaking of the spirituall
word which inuyroned them about. What more? God (say both of
them) created the Starres and the Planets.<note place="margin">Mercury in his Poemander, the. 1. &amp; 3. cap.</note> At the voyce of his

not this a setting downe nor only of one selfsame sence, but also of
the selfesame termes and words? But when as <hi>Mercurie</hi> addeth

it was done: that the Sea and Land should bee seuered asunder;
that the Starres should be created; and that Herbes should growe
vp euery one with his seede, by force of the same worde. Also that
the World is but an alteration, a mouing, a generating and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting

               <p>Now let vs go on with the auncient Philosophers. <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>

God, of it owne nature corruptible, because it was sensible and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily;
but yet that it is not corrupted, because it is vphild and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
by his prouidence. The same thing doth also <hi>Diogenes

                  <note place="margin">Varro in his second booke of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</note> sayth that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged

                  <hi>Of all liuing Wights man is bred most wise
of capacitie to consider things, and to atteyne to knowledge,
and to iudge of them all. For GOD hath printed in him the
fulnesse of all Reason. And like as God hath made him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of all Voyces, Sounds, Names and vtterances; so also
hath he made him the instrument of all vnderstandings and
conceyts, which is the workmanship of wisedome: And euen
for that cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe I thinke that man is of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and hath receyued his instruments and abilities at his

                  <note place="margin">Laertius in the lyfe of Thales.</note> one of the seuen Sages hild opinion, that all things

was sooner by one day:</hi> as if he had ment to say, that afore God
had created the light, it must néedes bee confessed that out of him
there was nothing but darknesse. Now this Philosopher also as

               <p>
                  <hi>Timeus of Locres</hi> termeth Tyme the Image of eternitie, and
sayth that it tooke his beginning from the creating of Heauen and
Earth, and that God created the very Soule of the World afore
the World it selfe, both in possibilitie and in tyme. To bee short,
<hi>Plutarke</hi> affirmeth that all the naturall Philosophers of old time,
hild opinion that the begetting or creating of the World began at
the Earth as at the Centre thereof: and that <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>Simplicius,</hi> to affirme that God (whom he calleth <hi>Mynd</hi> or
<hi>Vnderstanding</hi>) created the Heauen, the Earth, the Sunne and
the Starres; and scarsly is there any one to bee found, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

               <p>Some of <hi>Platoes</hi> latter Disciples, (as namely <hi>Proclus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against the Christians) would néedes beare their Mayster
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13215:82"/>
downe, that he beléeued the world to haue had no beginning. But
if wee may beléeue <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aristole in his eightth booke of naturall Philosophie. Epicurus in Cicero.</note> who was a scholler of his a two and
twentie yéeres; he taught that the world was created; and it is one
of the chief Principles wherein they most disagrée. <hi>Philo</hi> who was
as another <hi>Plato,</hi> saith that <hi>Plato</hi> had learned it of <hi>Hesiodus.</hi> And
<hi>Plutarch</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutark in the Opinions of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and in the creation of the Soule.</note> who sheweth himselfe to haue perused him throughly

<hi>some studyers of Plato, which by racking his wordes, indeuer
by all meanes to make him deny the creation of the World
and of the Soule, and to confesse the euerlastingnesse of time,
notwithstanding that in so doing they bereeue him of that
most excellent treatise of his concerning the Goddes, against
the despysers and skorners of whom in his tyme he wrate.
And what needeth any thing to be alledged for proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
seeing that his whole booke of Timeus is nothing els but
an expresse treatise of the Creation of the World?</hi> The same

that <hi>Plato</hi> taught not the Creation of the World, considering that
he hath made descriptions, both of all the parts thereof, and of the
Gods themselues? And also that he sayth that the world was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
corruptible of it selfe, but yet abode immortall and vncorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
through the grace of God which vpholdeth it? But let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
the racking which <hi>Proclus</hi> offereth vnto him. <hi>Plato</hi> (saith he)
<hi>affirmeth in his Commonweale, that whatsoeuer hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
hath also an ende: Now the World, as he sayth in his
Timeus, shall haue no end: Therefore it followeth that it had
no beginning.</hi> If another man should reason after that maner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Proclus, Proclus</hi> would laugh him to skorne: for he shifteth
the termes: and yet our Soules which he concludeth to be without
end, faile not to haue had a beginning. But though we were neuer
so wel contented to let him passe: yet doth <hi>Plato</hi> assoyle him in one
word. The world (saith he) is corruptible of it selfe, for euery thing
that is compounded, may also be dissolued: but it is not Gods will
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13215:82"/>
that it should be corrupted. <hi>And myne ordinance (sayth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting)
is of more power to make thee to continue, than
thine owne Nature is to make thee to perish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato in his common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</note> The which thing
he speaketh yet more shortly in another place, saying that the world
hath receyued an Immortalitie at the hand of the workmayster
which made it.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> Now then, seeing that by Nature it may perish;
surely by Nature it had a beginning: and the power that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
it from perishing, is the very same that made it to bee. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi>
addeth: <hi>Plato propoundeth a Question</hi> (sayth he) <hi>whether
the World was created after the patterne of a thing forecrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or of a thing without beginning. Therefore he dowted
whether it were eternall or no.</hi> What a conclusion was this for
a great Philosopher? I aske whether men bee bred of themselues
or created of another; therefore I vphold that they be bred of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
as who would lay that in disputing, it were not an ordinary
matter to set down both the Contraries, for the affirming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one
and the denying of the other. Agayne, if it were begotten or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of a thing aforecreated, could it be beginning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
seeing that the patterne thereof had a beginning? And if it
were created after the example of a thing vncreated, can it come to
passe that it should be euerlasting, séeing that it is not the very pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
it selfe? No: but as I haue sayd afore, wee admit horned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
against the trueth, whereas in defence of the trueth the
perfectest demonstrations suffize vs not. Also in another booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytled
of a String he sayth thus: <hi>Plato in his booke of Lawes
sayth that Commonweales and Artes haue infinite tymes bin
vtterly destroyed by Waterfluds and Burnings, and therefore
that men cannot certeinly say from what time men haue first
growne into Commonweales: Ergo, he beleeued that the
World had no beginning.</hi> Nay, he sayth these things in his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi>
which is the booke whereof thou canst not dowt, but that he
treateth there expressely of the Creation of the World. And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth
the same agayne in his booke of Commonwealematters,
hauing sayd afore, that God created Heauen &amp; Earth, the Starres
and Gods. Now then, seeing it is one selfsame Author that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
these things, and in one selfesame place, and one immediatly
after another: is it not certeyne that he ment not to match cleane
contrary doctrines together? What is to be sayd then, but that he
spake there after the maner of the common multitude, who (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
sayth) doe call the things infinite, which they be not able to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13215:83"/>
number? Or as <hi>Moyses</hi> himselfe speaketh, who calleth the things
eternall, euerlasting or endlesse, which are of very long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance,
notwithstanding that he make a booke expressely of the Creation
of all things? But in déede it was a surmize of the auncientnesse of
the World, which <hi>Plato</hi> (as it should seeme) had brought home
out of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> accordingly as the report of <hi>Solon</hi> sufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
who telleth him that the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> had Registers of nyne
thousand yeres, that is to say (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> interprets it) nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Moones.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Agenist Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles Eterniti.</note> to whom this opinion doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong. For although some of his Schollers being ashamed
on his behalfe, would fayne beare him on hand that he was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion, or at leastwise that he hild it as a doubtfull poynt; yet
notwithstanding his sentences in that case are too certeine, too clere,
and too manifest,<note place="margin">Aristotle in his. 1. 3. &amp; 8. bookes of na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie; In his first booke of the Heauens. and in his first booke of the breede of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing things.</note> for them to goe about to cloke his opinion. But
seeing he was so bold as to remoue the former bound fettled by the
authoritie and beléefe of all that went afore him: néedes must it bée
that he had very expresse termes, and very certeyne Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
And I pray you let vs see what maner a ones they be? From
the mouings that are here beneath, he leadeth vs to the mouings
that are aboue, and from them to a first mouer. Hetherto he is wel.
But afterward he will haue this first mouer to moue euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and therefore that tyme should be euerlasting also. Neyther the
ground nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> consequence of this argument are aughtworth. How
will ye proue that the first mouer moueth eternally? Nay contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
mouing argeweth a beginning. For in mouing there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
poynt from whence the mouing is made, vnto another poynt
wherto it tendeth: and euen according to <hi>Aristotles</hi> owne doctrine,
forenesse, afternesse, and continuance of tyme do followe forenesse,
afternesse, and continuance of mouing: and that implyeth a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
contrarietie to the definition of mouing from place to place.
And that tyme should be beginninglesse, what els is it to say, than
that tyme is not tyme, and (as ye would say) an implying of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in the very word it self? For what els is tyme according
to <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe, than the number of mouing by forenesse and
afternesse, by past and to come. And if it be a number, where is the
infinitenesse thereof become? And if there be afore and after, where
is the eternitie thereof? In another place he sayth, that mouing is
eternall because tyme is eternall; and that the cause why time is so,
is that it is alwaies ioyned to that which is past. I pray you what
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13215:83"/>
a childishnesse is this? By the same reason I may say that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of a Mill, or the stirring of any liuing wight is eternall: for in
those cases euery instant followeth immediatly in the necke of that
which is past, no lesse than in the mouing of tyme; and yet wee bee
not ignorant that they haue a beginning. But like as there is a
certeyne first forthsetting in those, so is there also in the mouing of
the Heauen, who is the bréeder of tyme. And <hi>Algazel</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Algazel.</note> answereth
<hi>Auerrhois</hi> very well vpon this poynt; That looke what a poynt or
pricke is in things that hold on whole vnbroken of; the same is an
instant or moment in things that immediatly or continually suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
one after another: and that as a poynt or pricke is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a lyne, so an instant is the beginning of tyme: &amp; <hi>Auerrhois</hi>
could not disproue this reason, otherwise than by flowring him for
it. He replyeth yet agayne, and sayth; Yea but if the World had a
beginning, how shall the maker thereof be voyd of alteration? To
such a question as this is, me thinkes he himselfe should answere
thus: That the alledging of an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience assoyleth not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
But good Sir Philosopher! By your seeking to bring vs to
this inconuenience, you graunt at leastwise that God created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And is it not a straunge ouersight in you, that you will néedes
tye him to the lawes of Nature, which is the maker of Nature?
and measure the power and libertie of the Clockmaker, by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
of the Clocke vnto him? Art thou not ashamed to yéeld lesse
preheminence to GOD, than thy King whom thou exemptest
from subiection to his lawes, because he is the maker of the lawes?
I pray thée what a thing were it, if thou shouldest vndertake but
only to measure Nature by thyne owne wit? What a number of
tymes hast thou found thy wit to stumble at the least things? How
often hast thou found it against thy selfe? Now, if Nature goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the reach of thy wit, how farre shall the very maker of nature
outgoe it? Thou canst not shift thy place without remouing; and
therefore thou déemest the like of God. But consider at leastwise
that they Soule or Mynd not being limited within any place, is the
place of a thousand things, &amp; that a thousand things are the place
thereof. Againe, thy Soule cannot conceiue any thing, without
passing from contemplation to action: no nor abyde in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without chaunge. Now thy desire is to haue GOD like thy
self in this behalf. But if thou wilt not yéeld thy self to other mens
reasons; at leastwise yéeld thy selfe to thyne owne reasons. For
wheras thou sayst, that beyond the Heauen<note place="margin">Aristotle in his first booke of Heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap. 9.</note> there is neither empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13215:84"/>
nor tyme; but that whatsoeuer is there, is exempted from all
maner of tyme, mouing, chaunge, and passibilitie; and that in that
vniuersall eteruitie all things doe leade a most happie and welcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
life: darest thou say lesse of God, whom thou thy selfe doest
place farre aboue all those things? The very brute Beastes would
bable after that maner of the nature of thy Soule, yea and more to
the purpose too. For wheras there is no comparison betwéene God
and thée; they yet haue a thing that doth somewhat resemble thée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For thou chaungest in doing, because thy doing is another thing
than thy being; and the thing that thou amost at is out of thy selfe;
which thing cannot chaunge for thée, and therefore thou art fayne
to chaunge for it. Also thou chaungest in beholding; for the thing
which thou beholdest, and thou which beholdest it, are two: and to
bee short, in beholding, thou doest after a sort suffer at the thing
which thou beholdest, &amp; in doing, thou sufferest at the thing which
thou doest: but vnto him which is the maker of al things, to be and
to behold, to behold and to doe, to doe and to will are all one thing.
For euen in willing a thing he hath done it, and his willing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is after a certeyne &amp; determinate maner, (I vse humane wordes
for the vttering of my meaning). To bee short, vnto him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
all things in himselfe, nothing can spring vp that shall bée
new. Let vs now put the case, that the forealledged inconuenience
be most to purpose; and let vs see at leastwise if thou canst skill to
auoyde it in thyne owne opinion. If God (sayst thou) do make any
thing new, he must néedes chaunge his mynd. And yet thou sayest
therewithall, that in all things which are done here beneath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causes,<note place="margin">Proclus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Influence of the first cause.</note> there is a certeyne influence of God, at leastwise of
the vniuersall influence vnder the which thou puttest all things.
So speakest thou, so speaketh <hi>Auerrhois,</hi> so speaketh <hi>Proclus</hi> and
the rest of you thereof. Now, seeing that GOD doth euery day a
thousand newe things here beneath; I demaund of thée whether he
doth them vpon new deuise, or vppon euerlasting forepurpose? If
he doe them vppon newe deuise, thou stumblest at that which thou
wouldest eschewe: for (by thy reckoning) God doth that which he
did not afore, namely, in sheading foorth his influence anewe, and
in producing (by that influence) the thing that was not afore. Or if
he do them vpon euerlasting forepurpose; then confessest thou that
which thou meanest to denye; to wit, that God determined euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly
to make or doe things by his power, and that according to
that determination, he giueth to euery thing in their tymes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13215:84"/>
hée had foreallotted them of his goodnesse. For what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
makest thou in the cace betwéene one Plant, and all Plants?
betwéene the Plant that is newe sprong vp to day, and the Plant
that was withered a thousand yeeres agoe? betwéene the whole
World, and the least thing conteyned therein; if thou be fayne too
admit a new deuice, as well for the least thing as for the greatest?
Nay thou hast deuised thée a God that is turned about vppon his
Whéele, a God that hath but a little more wit than thy selfe, and a
little more strength than thy selfe: and yet such are thy spéeches of
him sometime, that I cannot tell whither thou wouldest be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be likened to him or no.</p>
               <p>Let vs sée his other Reasons. <hi>All the auncient Philosophers</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>sauing Plato, beleeued that tyme is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
A strange case, that he which taketh so great pleasure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling
all men that went afore him, will now néedes shéeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vnder them! But I haue alreadie prooued that that saying of
his is false. And againe what greater contraries can there be, than
tyme and eternitie? Also, <hi>The Heauen</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is a diuine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
vncorruptible, the dwelling place of the Goddes, wherein
there hath not any corruption bin seene that can be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred:</hi>
Ergo <hi>it is eternall.</hi> But how will he proue this Diuinitie,
and this Quintessence of his? Whence will hée prooue this vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
nature? What wil he answere to this saying of his owne,
that the Goddes and Godheads dwell aboue Heauen, and vtterly
without the compasse or reache of tyme? Is not this a setting
downe of that thing for a ground, which is the thing that resteth
to be proued, and (to speake after his owne maner) a crauing of the
principle? But if we beléeue <hi>Plutarke,</hi> who affirmeth that <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>

none other disproofe than bare denyall, and which would be as hard
for him to proue, as to proue the eternitie it selfe. What is to bée
thought then, if euen by the propositions of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proclus in his second booke vpon Timeus. Aristotle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> himselfe and
of his Schollers, wee proue against him and his Schollers, that
the World had a beginning? The World (say they) is eternall,
and yet as eternall as it is, it dependeth vpon God. In that poynt
they all agráe. The disagréement among them is in this, that some
of them make the depending thereof vpon God to bee as vpon an
efficient cause, and some as vpon a finall cause, and euery of them
draweth <hi>Aristotle</hi> to his side as much as he can. Now, if it depend
vpon GOD, as an effect dependeth vpon his efficient cause; who
séeth not that an effect is after his cause, and that there went a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
power afore the effect distinguished essentially from the cause
therof. And where is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this goodly ground of theirs become, that
the World is eternall because no foreworking power went afore
it?<note place="margin">As in way of end.</note> Or if it depend vppon God as the finall cause thereof, that is to
say, if it were for him and not from him; so as it was not a thing of
his making, but a thing that he could not conueniently forbeare:
wheresoeuer an ende is intended, is there not also a forecast? And
where forecast is, can chaunce and necessitie beare there any sway?
And if God had no néede of the World, was it not at his choyce
whether it should be or no? And being at his choyce, can it bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninglesse,
seeing that the being therof dependeth vpon another
than it selfe? Againe, if the World depend vpon God as vpon the
end thereof; the working power which they themselues require in
the creation of all things, shall eyther haue gone afore it or not. If
it must néedes haue gone afore it; then was it not from euerlasting;
for this word <hi>forego</hi> being a betokener of tyme, excludeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
from eternitie or euerlastingnesse. Or if there néeded not any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working
power to haue gone afore the world, but that it be simply
an issewe procéeding from the force of the cause; why should it not
procéede as well in tyme as from euerlasting, seeing that the sayd
force or power is directed by Reason and by Will? And why then
hold they this principle, That the World cannot be of creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that if it were so, some cause must néedes haue gone afore it?
Again, whence hath the Skye his beginning of mouing, but from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13215:85"/>
an Instant? And whatsoeuer could be neuer so little a while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mouing, why might it not be without mouing a longer while,
seeing that the respect is all one, both of eternitie vnto all tymes,
and of infinitenesse vnto all places? Therefore whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi>
sayth that the World (notwithstanding that it is eternall) depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vpon God; he graunteth consequently that it is not eternall.
Secondly, contrary to the teaching of all that went afore him, he
deliuereth vs thrée first grounds; namely, Matter, Substance, or
Stuffe, forme, shape, or fashion, and Priuation, Want, or berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ing;
and his Schooles are so greatly delighted therwith, that there
is nothing els to bee heard spoken of in them. But if these be the
first beginnings or grounds of things; where is then their eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
And if they kéepe a circuit in going round about; how can it bee
that they had not a beginning? Also how can a substance be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be without forme, shape, or fashion; or forme, shape, or fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be without a substance; seeing that euen mishapennesse it selfe is
a kynd of shape, and also that a shape is nothing els than the forme
or fashion of a substance? Moreouer, what greater absurditie can
there be, than to make that a beginning of being, which hath by it
selfe no being at all, nor can haue any being but in another thing,
as if a man would make blindnesse to bee the beginner of sight, or
darknesse the beginner of light? Agayne, seeing that neither sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
nor shape haue of themselues any being at all: how can they
cause other things to bee? Or how comes it to passe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> two things
which haue had no being at all, doe méete together in one essence

determined that it should be so? And if his willing or determining
be the cause of the being of them; who is he that did set or appoynt
him the terme wherein to doe them? But to excuse one vntrueth, a

that there was no beginning of liuing things, or that liuing
things haue bene from euer without beginning. Also in another
place he sayth, that there was such an alteration at the same tyme
that liuing things were first brought foorth; and that if it behoue
Nature to bring foorth any mo of them, there must be such another
alteration going afore, namely, by a rare Coniunction of some
Starres.<note place="margin">Aristotle in his third booke of the breeding of liuing wyghts. Lucrece: The Wombes of the Earth grew fit for rootes.</note> And in another place he sayth further, that if Man and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liuing wights had a beginning; it was eyther in egge, in séede,
or in woorme, and so foorth. What a number of Monsters are héere
for the stablishing of one Monstar, and yet he hath not alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing which is not against himselfe. The lesser Coniunctions
(sayth he) doe bréede the smaller liuing things, the meane bréede
the meane, and the great ones bréede the great. Well, be it so. Yet
these Coniunctions méet not but by the course of the Starres; and
that course is a mouing, and euery mouing hath a beginning: and
therefore it followeth that wights had a beginning. Againe, if the
mouing of the Skye and of the Starres be euerlastingly; the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions

and so on the contrary. For if it haue turned about from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting,
the Coniunctions haue likewise incountred from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
But euerlastingly they could not incounter: for the small
ones, the meane ones, and the great ones are not all at once toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but they come seuerally one after another with the space of
certeyne hundred yéeres, &amp; with diuers reuolutions betwixt them:
whereas if they were eternall, none of them could goe or come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
another. Therefore it followeth that there is a beginner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wights, and a beginner of the goings about of the Skye and
of all the whole order which we see: And that is euen God himself.</p>
               <p>How much better had <hi>Aristotle</hi> done,<note place="margin">Aristotle in his second booke of Generation and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Cap. 10. and in his bookes of Comonweale.</note> if he had hild himselfe to
that which he sayth well in other places; namely, that forasmuch as
most things cannot haue a perpetuall continuance in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that is to say in themselues, by reason of being too farre distant
from their beginning: therefore God hath continued them by the
spreading foorth of their kind; and to that end hath made them male
and female and ordeyned copulation betwixt them. For if we make
the liuing things without beginning, doe we not make them to be
euerlasting? And if we ground their beginnings vpon some reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13215:86"/>
of the Skyes; can those Reuolutions be euerlasting? Also,
how shall they haue bene brought foorth, in full growth, or young,
seeing that at the bringing foorth of al things, the things are tender
and vnperfect? And if the things be not euerlasting, where then is
the euerlasting mouing of the Heauen: that is to say, where is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi>
eternitie become? The same followeth also of that which
he sayth in another place; namely that he which did first gather men
together, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of very great good. For in acknowledging
that there was a tyme wherein folke liued like the men of <hi>Brasilie,</hi>
or like the wandering <hi>Nomades;</hi> he acknowledgeth also an infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the World. For els what should let that men haue not bene
either euerlastingly dispersed, or els euerlastingly vnited together?
And how comes it to passe O <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that there haue not bene
<hi>Aristotles</hi> from euerlasting? Agayne, who shall choose out the very
instant in eternitie for the bréeding and bringing foorth of any thing
perticularly, but he that is the Lord of eternitie it selfe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Moralles commendeth godlinesse, and be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
blessednesse to them that followe it; teaching vs that it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in Contemplation. Now, seeing that this Contemplation or
beholding is the meane to make vs blessed; it must néedes bee the
beholding of a thing that is right blesfull: but blesfull it cannot bée,
if it consist in these inferiour things which are base and subiect to so
many miseries and turmoyles: Therefore he meaneth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
which is the beholding of the only one God. Also in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places he sayth that our Soules are of a diuine nature, that
they be immortal, that they come into vs from without, &amp; that they
be (after a sort) a kin to the Gods: and his Disciples would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at him that should say, that their Mayster dowted of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
of the Soule. And whereto is all this, if the World bée
eternall? If it be eternall; eyther our Soules also be eternall, that
is to say without beginning, or els they be not eternall. If they be;
how happeneth it that they haue imprisoned themselues in these
our bodies? Or if they bee so imprisoned at the appoyntment of an
other: who shall that other be but God? And if God appoynt or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
them to this newe state in tyme certeyne; who hath made one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie
subiect to another? And what is then become of this Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mée
of theirs, that the World is eternall because God maketh not
any thing there a newe? Moreouer, if they be euerlasting; who hath
made them proportionable to their bodies; that is to wit, infinite
Soules to infinite Bodies? And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what becomes againe of this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13215:87"/>
other Rule of theirs, that Nature cannot abyde any infinitenesse?
Or if they bee euerlasting and yet of some certeyne number, going
and comming into newe bodies by course: is not that the opinion
of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth so greatly mislike? And if our
Soules at their departing out of our bodies, doe goe to the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the blessed immortalitie; doth it not followe, that from after
the passingouer of that reuolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, men must moue without Soule,
dispute without reason, and iudge without mynd; yea and that euen
<hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe speaketh and reasoneth without wit? To bee
short, what hooteth it to bee godly or religious, if our Soules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
no better thing than themselues? What auayleth it to
looke for the blessed Contemplation, if they bee perfectly blessed of
themselues? But perfectly blessed they be, if they be eternall. And
whereto then serueth the rewarding of them with immortall life; if
they haue the eternitie or immortalitie alreadie? What els then is
his vpholding of the world to be eternal, than a turning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
world vpside downe? But there are (sayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) Godlinesse,
Blessednesse, &amp; Immortalitie: then doth it follow that our Soules
are not eternall. And if they be not eternall; then haue they a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and that beginning haue they, either of God, or of the world.
Of the world they haue it not: for (as I haue sayd) were the world
eternall, the Conuersions or turnings about thereof should bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
too, and consequently so should our Soules be also, as which
should be bred of their power. But now are all things mortall that
are ingendred by those Conuersions, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
But we put the case that they haue an originall notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they be immortall. Therfore it remayneth that the same
is from God. Now, they could not procéede from God as beames
of his substance: for all of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philosophers vphold that he is a single
and vndiuided substance, vnited in it selfe and most perfectly one:
but we be subiect to alteration, to ignorance, to euill affections and
such other things. It remayneth therefore (and otherwise it cannot
bée) that our Soules are the worke of Gods power. Now, if our
Soules (which after a sort doe comprehend the Worlde and all
things therein) bee the effects of Gods power, which through his
goodnesse vttereth it selfe when he listeth: shall not the world it selfe
and the senslesse and transitorie things which serue vs, yea and our
bodies also which are but the Cotes or Instruments of our soules
be so in likewise? Now then, let <hi>Aristotles</hi> Disciples choose whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will giue ouer the eternitie of the world, or the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13215:87"/>
of their Soules: the euerlasting turning about of a whéele, or
the immortal settlednesse of blessed state: for both of them together
cannot stand.</p>

stuffe nor newe aduisement, but that like a most perfect work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
hauing all things in a readinesse, he tooke his owne leisure for
the performance of his worke when it pleased him. And yet it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that <hi>Aristotle</hi> towards the ende of his life repented him of
that doctrine: insomuch that in his booke of the world, he sayth that
GOD is the bréeder and preseruer of all things in the world after
what maner soeuer it be. And euen in his Metaphisicks, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
the opinions of many men concerning these things; he sayth
thus.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>He that sayth that GOD or the souereyne Mynd is the
Cause &amp; Author not only of liuing things, but also of Nature
it selfe and of the World, and of all the order therein; seemeth
to speake discreetly and wel aduisedly; and they that speake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
speake vnaduisedly. And they that are of the former
opinion, haue very well set downe that Cause for the ground
of all things that are, as the which is such a beginning as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
mouing to all things.</hi> And in his booke of Wonders, (if it
be his) he speaketh yet more euidently: saying, that naturally the
Sea should couer the Earth as higher than it; but that God hath
caused the Sea to withdraw it self, that the Earth might be vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
for the vse of man and of other liuing wights. And this is
in effect a commingbacke to the opinion of his predecessors, from
the which he would so fayne haue departed afore. Howsoeuer the
case stand, all the auncient Philosophers doe eyther conclude the
Creation of the world with vs, or els yéeld vs arguments into our

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> who was the first that stepped out of the high way,
sayth that the world is without beginning, he seemeth to bee <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
no more; he doth so often gainsay himself and offend against
his owne rules. And where he chaunceth to say that the world was
created, he seemeth to be minded to yéeld himself to vs. And where
the case concerneth not (at leastwise expressely) the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
he leaueth vs many Conclusions, which doe quite ouerthrow

And (</hi> as sayth <hi>Pythagoras) so was he which did first
giue names to things, and which first comprised within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne

Corne, Cloth, building, defences against wilde Beasts, and the

from euerlasting, did they not from euerlasting speake? Did they
not from euerlasting giue names to things? Could they not inuent
euery thing from euerlasting. Yes: and therfore he concludeth, <hi>We
be not created by haphazard; but surely there was a certeyne
Might or Power which had a care of Mankynde, and which
would not haue begotten him to fall into the mischiefe of
endlesse death, after hee hath outworne the great and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable

the sayd power had a care of vs, eyther when as yet wee were not

is become weary, and sometymes that it is wexed barreine in yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

place he sayth expressely, that mens bodies by little &amp; little become
of smaller stature by reason of the witherednesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world which
wexeth olde. And is not this a reporting of the Skye to bee like a
whéele, which gathereth heate and chafeth with rowling and whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

also (as ye would say) a birthtyme? What meaneth the wearing
thereof away, but that it had erst bene newe? What is ment by the

World be eternall; why is not the whéele thereof eternally in one

<note place="margin">The Stoiks.</note> To bee short, the <hi>Stoikes</hi> (as <hi>Varro</hi> witnesseth of <hi>Zeno</hi>) taught

                  <note place="margin">The Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks.</note>
say in their conclusions, that it is without beginning;
and in their premisses they vtterly deny it. The greatest despisers
of God, as <hi>Plinie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> and such other like, doe write in their Prefaces,
That the world is an euerlasting God; and throughout the whole
treatises of their bookes, they vnsay it agayne. Now then, after so
many graue witnesses, and after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessions of the parties them
selues, is there yet any of these pretensed naturalistes to be found,
which dareth thinke the contrarie still?</p>
               <p>But now since the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ into the
earth,<note place="margin">The opinions of the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes.</note> this doctrine hath bene receyued throughout the world, so as
the thing which had aforetymes bene disputable among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
is now admitted as an article of faith, welnere among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and sects on the earth. It may bee that the myracles which
were seene then in Heauen, in Earth, in the Sea, vppon men, and
vpon the very Féends, made the world to perceyue that there was
a Creator of the world. For who could doubt that the creating of a
newe Starre, the restoring of a deadman to life, or onely the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a blindman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to see, was not the worke of an infinite power,
yea euen as well as the buylding of the world; considering that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
béeing and not béeing, betwéene life and death, betwéene the
hauing of a thing and the nothauing, the distance is infinite? And
it may be that the signes which we haue seene from Heauen in our
tyme, doe serue to make the blasphemers vpon earth vnexcusable.
But wherof soeuer it came, the very Philosophers themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded principle therof: insomuch that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Greekes,

<hi>Mahometists,</hi> did put it into their beléefe as a thing out of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie.
To be short, there is not at this day any ciuill or well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
people, which haue not their Chronicles and Histories of
tymes, begun alwaies at the Creation of the world, wherein they
doe all hold of <hi>Moyses,</hi> and agrée all with vs Christians, sauing in
the controuersie of some fewe yéeres.</p>
               <p>Of all the Philosophers, only the <hi>Platonists</hi> continued in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
and all men reiected the newfound opinions of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:13215:89"/>
and they stood at defiance, rather with the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> than with the
Christians. Sainct <hi>Austin</hi> sayth concerning the Philosophers of
his tyme, that their opinion was, that God was afore the World,
howbeit not in time, but in order and by way of vndersetting only:
like as <hi>if a foote</hi> (sayth he) <hi>were euer in one place, the print
thereof should also be euer there.</hi> Unto whom it may be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in one word, that like as abilitie and intent of going went afore
the going it self, both in the man and in the foote; so in God also, the
power and intent of creating, went afore the Creation. But it is
best to heare their owne words. <hi>Plotin</hi> in his booke of the World,
findeth himself not a little graueled in this case, and he maketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little account of all <hi>Aristotles</hi> supposalles.<note place="margin">Plotin. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nead: 2. lib. 1. cap. 1. and. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>If we say</hi> (sayth he)
<hi>that the Skye is euerlasting as in respect of the whole bodie
therof: how can that be, seeing that the liuing Creatures dye,
and the Elements passe from one into another, and that (as
Plato affirmeth) the Skye it selfe is in continuall wheeling? If
we say that the Elements and the liuing wights co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue their
perpetuities in their kynds: why doth the Heauen continue
his perpetuitie rather in number and particularitie? If the
cause thereof bee, that nothing can slippe out of it because it
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth all things: how can that reason agree to the Starres
and Planets, which doe not conteyne al things as the Heauen
or Skye doth, and yet we affirme them to be euerlasting? And
if nothing impeach it without; what should let that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may not impeach it within, seeing that all liuing wights
doe naturally perish through the distempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their parts,
notwithstanding that they liue euen while they bee a dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing?
And what inseweth hereof, but that both sortes of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as well Coelestiall as terrestriall, doe perish? yea and both
Heauen and Earth likewise, sauing that the Coelestiall indure
a longer tyme, and perish more slowly than the Earthly? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynly</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>if we tooke this word eternitie (as well in the
whole world as in the parts thereof,) not to betoken an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingnesse
[that is to say, a perpetuitie or continuance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beginning or end,] but only a difference of continuance;
there would be the lesse doubtfulnesse in the matter. But all
shall be out of doubt, if we father the same eternitie vpon the
will of GOD, which of it selfe is able enough to vphold the
World; for so shall things haue their continuance according
to his pleasure, some in their kyndes, and some particularly in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13215:90"/>
themselues.</hi> Now, if the World were eternall; were it not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that it should be otherwise than it is? But if it haue this being
from the will of GOD; is it not discharged of that necessitie? And
what shal then become of this saying of his, which he setteth doune
in diuers other places, namely that the World is of necessitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it would behoue a second Nature to accompanie the first; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we vnderstand it to be spoken of the necessitie that is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and not of the necessitie that is absolute as they terme it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the same will which made the World to bée, and hath giuen
continuance to the parts thereof, some after one sort and some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, and hath disposed of them as it listed it selfe; shal it not
also haue made them when it listed it selfe? Whosoeuer then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the béeing of the world, as well in the whole as in the partes,
dependeth vpon the will of God, taketh from the world all necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of béeing. And hee that sayeth that there is no necessitie that it
should haue bin from euerlasting, (let vs vse those words for want
of other,) sayth therewithall that it is not euerlasting.</p>
               <p>In his booke of Eternitie and of Tyme,<note place="margin">Plotinus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nead. 3. lib. 2. Chap. 2.</note> he sayth that eternitie
and tyme differ in this respect, that eternitie is verifyed but of the
euerlasting nature, and tyme is to be verified of the things that are
created: So as eternitie, is and abideth in God alone, whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

and tyme abydeth in the worlde that is subiect to the sences:

then if a man will vnderstand, how tyme proceeded first from

shall he haue to call the Muses too his helpe, for the vttering
therof: For it may be that the Muses also were as then. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

let vs say thus; Afore such time as Forenesse issued foorth
and had neede of afternesse; Tyme, (which as then was not,)
rested in God with the residew of all things that now are. But
a certein nature bent to many doings, that is to wit the Soule
of the world, beeing desirous to haue more than the present,
began to moue it self, and so from thence immediatly issewed
tyme, which passeth on continualy and is neuer the selfsame.
And we beholding the length therof, haue imagined tyme to
be the image of eternitie.</hi> And what is ment by all this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
but that a certeine Soule or mynd proceeding from God,
that is to wit the Spirit of God, did mooue and cary the worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
That with that mouing and of that mouing, tyme was bred
and brought foorth? That afore that moouing, there was a settled
state or rest, as eternitie afore time? And that (as he himselfe saieth
there) Tyme and Heauen were made both at once, and eternitie
was afore them both.</p>
               <p>As touching that it is demaunded what God did afore the

lyke concluded by the godly doctrine of Gods prouidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he treateth in bookes expresly bearing that tytle? for if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for the World to be eternall as well as God: where then can
there bee any prouidence? For what else is Prouidence, than the
will of God vttered foorth with Reazon, and orderly dispozed by
vnderstanding? And if Gods will bee required: where is then the
necessitie of béeing, which in other places hee attributeth too the
world? Also where is this saying of his become, that our Soules

that it is our dewtie to magnifie God by prayer and sacrifize, and
that it is planted euen in nature to offer sacrifize; is he not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to himself? for to what end reuerence we God, if we be nothing
beholden to him? neuerthelesse my alledging of these things is not
as though I knew not well that the <hi>Platonists,</hi> yea and euen these
aformentioned philosophers also, do call the world euerlasting and
vnbegotten: but to shew that the very surest of them haue wauered
in this opinion: insomuch that they haue left vs principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13215:91"/>
to their conclusions: and after all their long skirmishes, they
find no rest but in our Camp. And soothly the most part of them be
driuen to acknowledge certeine Degrees of eternitie. Wherof the
first should be, that which is measured by the continewance of that
which is euermore of it selfe, and becometh neither the longer for
aught that is to come, nor yet the shorter for aught that is past;
and that is it which is to be ascribed alonly vnto God. The second
as the measure of such things as haue a fixed and béeing stable, and
yet haue also a certeine succession in their operations, of which sort
are the vnderstanding spirits or Angells; and this is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Aynesse. The third as the measuring of durablenesse continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by forenesse and afternesse, hauing a beginning but not an end,
and this they call Tyme, attributing it properly to the World.
And what else is this than to speake that thing by circumstance,
which we vtter in one word? For to what purpose cal they a thing
eternall or euerlasting, if by the termes <hi>Eternall</hi> and <hi>Euerlasting,</hi>
they meane temporall? After which maner the Emperour <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>

bee able to doe much more? And seeing that a thing of
nought is able to doe so much, shall any thing be vnpossible to the
maker of all things? But although this which I haue sayd might
suffize the discréete, yet notwithstanding let vs discusse more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this matter concerning matter or stuffe.</p>
               <p>Soothly if God néeded matter or stuffe to worke vpon; either he

he made it, he made it of nothing: for in seeking the matter of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ye shall procéede to infinite; and so haue I the thing I would
haue. If it were from euerlasting, then were there two eternalles
together; which is a thing repugnant to all reason and contrary to
it selfe. For nothing can bee more contrary to eternitie, than to say
that there is a matter or stuffe which attendeth or wayteth to haue
his shape forme or fashion at some workmaster hand; or that there
is an eternal thing which hath not any other life or being, than such
as another eternall thing hath voutsafed to giue vnto it. For let

so as the matter should haue no beeing at all, but by reason of the

be without forme, seeing that euen deformitie it selfe is a kynd
of forme? Or how can matter be alone by it selfe, seeing that forme
is the thing that giueth being vnto it? Now then, to say that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is without forme, is all one as to say that it is and is not; which
were the saying of a madman.</p>
               <p>Yea (say they); but how is it possible for somewhat to be made
of nothing, sith there is an infinite distance betwixt somewhat and
nothing? Nay, I say rather, what is it which is not finite, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13215:94"/>
of him that is infinite? I meane in respect of him whom thou

                  </gap>rmest to haue bounded the selfesame matter which thou
doest take and teach to be infinite? But if thou listest to consider it,
thou shalt perceyue that thou confessest a thing no lesse vncredible
to thyne owne sence, than is the same which thou reiectest by thy
sence. For when thou imaginest a matter without forme, and a
forme without matter, thou speakest things that destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But whereas I say that God created the World of nothing,
that is to say without hauing any thing wherof to make it: in déede
I say a thing that is wonderfull, howbeit which hath not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

aboue reason, and against reason. For trueth and mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are not inclosed within the like and selfesame bounds. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as thou hast graunted that God is the author and worker
of Nature, I would fayne knowe how thou canst be so bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,
that he hath put life and mouing where none were afore, and
that he hath made both sight and light, hearing and sounds, spéech
and vnderstanding, where erst was more than death, more than
blindnesse, more than dumbnesse, and more than dulnesse; that is to
say, more than the bare priuation or bereuing of those things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that neither to bee nor euer to haue bene, are much more
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts than simply not to be. Now, betwéene liuing and not liuing,
seeing and not seeing, and so foorth, there is an infinite distance as
well as there is betwéene being and not being, which distance can
not be filled vp but by an infinite power: and looke where an infinite
power is, it is alike mightie towards all things. Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that sith thou attributest vnto him the making of thy sight,
of thy life, and of thyne vnderstanding; thou canst not deny him the
creation of the things that haue light, life, and vnderstanding in
them. Which if thou graunt in one thing, néedes must thou graunt
it alike in all. For to giue life, and to giue béeing; to giue forme or
shape, and to giue matter; and to giue them to one thing, and to
giue them to all things; are all workes of one selfsame power, how
diuers soeuer of degrées of them seeme vnto thée at the first sight.
He therfore that confesseth God to be the former or giuer of shape,
doth also confesse him to bee the creator of all things. Nay, I say

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:13215:94"/>If we looke into nature, the thing that holdeth the first place in

selfe, and by imparting it selfe to them is still increased: insomuch
that the striking of a Flint inforceth the castingforth of a thousand
sparkes, whereof euery one were enough to set the whole World
on fire. In light some things, one light lighteth another, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting

how transitorie and fléeting they be alreadie, how short a time
could the world indure; or rather how long agoe had it come to an

thou shouldest rather say thus: I see that the Trées, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Beastes, yea and men themselues doe spring as it were of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and are resolued agayne into as good as nothing. I see them
multiplye, liue, and do wonders. Of one selfsame seede I sée spring
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13215:95"/>
both flowers, leaues, and fruite, and of another, the wonderfulnesse
of eyes, the substantialnesse of bones, and the finesse of vitall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
Agayne, I see all these things vanish away I wote not how,
so as there remayneth nothing of them but a handfull of dust. And
shall I now be so blockish as to say, that he which of so little and in
so little hath made so many wondrous things that were not afore,
could not make the little it selfe? Or that he which created the life
the sence and the mouing, could not create a drop of water, a blast
of ayre, and a handfull of earth? Nay, I will reason thus rather:
That if God were not able to create the very matter of matter it
selfe, surely he could neither giue forme or shape to the matter, nor
create such things of the matter. Yes will they say: for it appeareth
that all things returne as it were into one commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matter, whether
wee followe the auncient Philosophers which reduce them to the
Elements, or that wee followe the late writers which reduce them
into Oyle, Salt, Water, &amp;c. Bee it so: and then oughtest thou to
conclude therevpon, that seeing there is but one matter, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
but one God; vnto whose power thou oughtest not to déeme any
thing vnpossible, seeing that of that one thing he maketh so many
things, not only diuers, but also contrary. For he that of one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
thing maketh both fire and water, doth he lesse than he which
maketh that one thing it selfe?</p>
               <p>What wilt thou say then if I make thée to see that there is not
that thing which hath not in it self a peculiar creation, or a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
created,<note place="margin">The particular Creation of all things.</note> which cannot be attributed to the matter wherof it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,
but is a greater thing than the matter it selfe, without the
which, neither the matter, nor the elements, nor all the things that
thou drawest out of them were any thing at all? And sith thou wilt
néedes play the Philosopher afore thou doest beléeue; I demaund
of thée whether things in their nature haue their béeing from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or from forme? If from matter: why is a Plant rather a Plant
than a mettall, seeing that (by thyne own saying) matter being but
one, is no more one thing than another, ne inclyned to one thing
more than to another, nor bounded within any one particular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
otherwise than by forme or fashion? And forasmuch as thou
hast taken so great paynes in resoluing or bringing things backe
agayne into their first matter; whence commeth it that thy extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or the things which thou drawest out of it, haue so diuers or
contrary operations, if besides the matter it selfe there be not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
substance which giueth them theirs?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:13215:95"/>If things haue their being from forme; I demaund againe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forme bee a substance or no. If it bee not a substance, how can
that which is not a substaunce make a substaunce, and how may an
accident or income make an essentiall difference, &amp; cause life, sence,
and mouing to be where they were not afore? And if it bee a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
(as most Philosophers teach in expresse wordes) yea and a
very perfect substance, as which perfecteth the matter and maketh
it to be that which it is named to be: must it not néedes follow, that
he which gaue this forme shape or fashion to the matter, created a
substance which was not afore, yea aud a much more excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
than the matter which thou surmisest to haue bene afore it?
Now, why should not he that was able to create the better, be also
able to create the lesser good? Rightly therefore doth <hi>Aphrodiseus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aphrodisaeus in his first booke of the Soule.</note>
in his booke of the Soule say, that the forme shape or fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
the Craftsman giueth to his work, is no more a substance than the
arte, craft, or cunning whereby he giueth it: but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme which
Nature giueth, is no lesse a substance than Nature it selfe is. Let
vs procéede further. Of the Mettalles, thou estéemest Gold &amp; Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
of the Hearbs, thou estéemest some for foode, and some for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke:
of the Beastes, thou estéemest some to eate, and some to serue
thée: of men, (which yet notwithstanding make all but one kynde)
thou admittest and acceptest some for one purpose and some for an
other. Now, if thy estéeming of them bee for the matter whereof
they consist; how is that matter but one? Or if it bee for the forme,
as in respect wherof Gold is not the same that Leade is; is not that
forme a substance? And if it be a substance; shall it not followe that
he which gaue that shape forme or fashion to the matter, is also the
Creator of the matter it selfe? And seeing there is such difference
of Mettalles, Hearbes, Beastes, and Men; doth it not followe that
there are as many diuersities of Creation? And whereas he hath
created all these diuersities of substances, wouldest thou make him
to fayle in that one the bacest of all? What shall I say to it, that
some one thing shall haue diuers powers, vertues and operations
in diuers parts thereof; so as it shalbe cold without and hot within,
white in the outside and red in the substance, colde in the leafe and
hot in the roote, laxatiue in the pith and costiffe in the barke? As for
example, the rynde of the Orrendge is hot, and the meate within it
is cold; the leaues of flowers of the wyld Vine doe coole, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
part of them doth burne. Phisitions report that the Lungs of
a Hare healeth folke that are shortwinded; that the bloud of him
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13215:96"/>
breaketh the Stone, and that the heare of him stauncheth bloud.
Haue not these diuers parts diuers formes, besides the vniuersall
forme of the thing whereof they bee the parts? And are not these
diuers formes as many diuers substaunces, and consequently as
many Creations? The Adamant or Lodestone draweth yron to

Melancholie. If these operations come of the matter alone,
tell me how that may bee. And why bee not the same operations
common to all things? Or if (as thou sayst) they come of a secrete
propertie; doth it not then come of the substantial forme, séeing that
nothing can bée sayd to bee that which it is, or to haue any peculiar
propertie, but by reason of the substantiall forme? Thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
say, that it is the mingling of the Elements together that
giueth forme or shape. Nay: for if it bee that mingling, where is
then the foresayd common matter become? and what mingling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
or what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dley or mixture can bee made of one selfesame
thing? And if thy meaning bee that the foresayd matter is a diuers
composiding of the Elements together; then is thy matter a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forme
compounded of diuers formes. For wherein do the Elements (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so contrary) differ one from another, but in their essentiall
formes? And if it bee a mixture or Composition, where is then the
eternitie thereof? Moreouer, wee see that in Plants, Beastes, and
Men, the Compositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is made of the mixture of the elements,
abydeth euen when they be cut downe or killed. For put a blocke
into the fire, and the moysture that was in it when it grewe a Trée
boyleth out with the heate, the aire therof steameth vp into smoke,
the firie matter thereof burneth out in an oylie substaunce, and the
earthly parts thereof falleth downe into as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hes. And in all liuing
wights aswell as in man, the outward lump (which thou wilt haue
to be composed of the mixture of the Elements,) remayneth whole
after they be dead. But as for the Soule whereby the things haue
their life, sence, and reason; which Soule is the peculiar forme both
of Trées, Beastes and Men each after their kynd: that appeares
no more when the thing is once dead. And therefore it followeth,
that besides the matter (which is liuelesse) and the mixture of the
Elements, there is also a substantial forme, which maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing
to be a Trée, a Beast, or a Man; and without the which it is not a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13215:96"/>
Trée but a blocke, nor a Beast or a Man, but a dead Carkesse or
Carrion. Furthermore, when a Trée is dead, there remayne still
certeine vertues both in the bark, and in the wood, and in the leaues
thereof; which vertues are not only diuers, but also sometyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
and those vertues procéed not of the matter, but of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
forme. Whereof it followeth, that besides the forme of the
Plant which fadeth by the death of the Plant it selfe, there are also
other formes peculiar to euery part thereof, which abyde after that
the forme of the whole Plant is perished. Now, if the mixture of
the Elements cannot make the forme whereby the vpperkyndes
differ one from another, as the sencelesse things from the things
that haue sence; and the things that haue but only sence, from the
things that haue reason too; can it make the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
the vnderkynds that are comprehended vnder euery of the
vpperkynds; or betwéene the particulars that belong to euery vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derking;
or betwéene the seueral parts that are in euery particular?
If the mixture of the Elements (say I) make not a Trée to liue,
that is to say to bee a Trée; shall it make it to heale, both some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
diseases, and also some certeyne parts of it, some certeyne
parts of man? And if it make not a Beast to haue sence, that is to
say to bee a Beast: can it make it to bee a Lyon, an Elephant, or a
Stagge? And if it make not a man to haue life, sence, and mouing;
can it make him to speake, and to reason, one of one thing and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of another, each man according to his seuerall inclynation?
But how should the Elements giue life, which they themselues
haue not? or free mouing, they themselues being caried vp &amp; doune
whether they will or no? or also sence, being themselues but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of our sences? Then must wee conclude that the difference of
the vpperkynds from the vnderkynds, of the vnderkynds from the
Particulars, and of their parts one from another, consisteth not in
the matter whereof they bee made, but in their forme; and that the
same forme is the peculiar substance of euery thing; and that looke
how many sundrie sorts of formes there are, so many sundrie sorts
of creations there haue bene, all procéeding from the power of the
Former or giuer of them. And so, he that attributeth vnto God the
forming or fashioning of the World, must whether hee will or no
attribute vnto him the power of creating it also. For without crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a new substance (what matter soeuer ye presuppose to haue
bene afore) he had not created the World in such sort as it is. And
he that was able to create any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was able to create them
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13215:97"/>
all. For like might and power is requisite to the creating of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
as of an Elephant, of a Ponde as of the Sea, of a péece of the
world as of the whole world.</p>
               <p>They procéede on still with their Chimere.<note place="margin">The Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks.</note> God (say they) dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the forme out of the Abilitie of the matter. Let vs examine
this doterie yet further. Abilitie (sayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) is the beginning
of mouing and of chaunge. Also there are (say his Disciples) two
sorts of Abilitie: the one which worketh the sayd beginning in the
other, and that is God; and the other which suffereth the mouing
and chaunge at the others hand, and that is matter or stuffe, which
by the mouing wrought into it by the other, receyueth his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is termed Forme. Now, I demaund whether this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
Abilitie of the matter, bee a qualitie or a substance. They dare
not say it is a substance; for were it a substance, then euen by their
owne doctrine it were a forme also: and wheresoeuer is a forme,
there is also an act, and that is more than an abilitie: but matter (as
they say) is a mere abilitie. And if they say it is a Qualitie, (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
himselfe affirmeth): then followeth it that God draweth a
substance out of the qualitie of an accident. Now, he that draweth
the very Essence or béeing of things out of the passiue abilitie of an
other, can much more drawe it out of his owne actiue abilitie or
workfull power. For shal he be barraine of himselfe, which maketh
a qualitie (yea and lesse than a simple qualitie) fruitfull in bringing
foorth so many things? And seeing that Qualitie and Substaunce
and all the highest kynds of Contraries bee (as they teach) further
differing one from another than fire from water; and also that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and accident are nothing of themselues: shall it not follow that
God is able to create substances of nothing? Surely it is the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Trismegistus</hi> in many places, that God created the World
and all that is therein; and man with al his parts by his most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
word: and also that the will of God was the bréeder of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> and all the old Diuines affirme, that God or
the only One is the beginner of al things, yea euen of the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as <hi>Simplicius</hi>

and consequently also voyd of all being.</p>

                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:13215:97"/>As touching <hi>Aristotle,</hi> he maketh matter to be the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

according to his owne teaching; where is this beginning
become? Also he disprooueth the Chaos with very lyuely reasons;
and to scape that, he holdeth himself to the eternitie, which is quite
and cleane ageinst him. But howsoeuer the case stand, it is fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed

things from without, euen from the souereyne mynd: doth he not
iumpe with vs, which say that GOD created all substances of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
And if he could create that which was, and giue vnto it both
being and life: could he not also forbeare the thing that was not,
that is to say matter? <hi>Atticus</hi> and his adherents would néedes
beare <hi>Plato</hi> downe by reason of certeyne sentences of his <hi>Timeus</hi>
and of his Commonwealematters misunderstood, that matter was
eternall as well as God, howbeit that the same being voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
was brought vnto reason by him that is the very reason it self.
With these fellowes wee our selues shall not néede to deale, but
only heare <hi>Porphyrius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Porphyrie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Timaeus.</note> disprouing them after this maner. <hi>If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be of Matter, nor Matter of God, but both
of them be Beginnings alike; whereof then commeth it that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13215:99"/>
there is so great ods betwixt them, sith we hold opinion that
God is Good and the very worker or Doer, and contrarywise
that Matter is Euill, and but only a Sufferer? The cause of this
difference cannot proceed from the one to the other, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if our saying be true: namely, that the one of them is not
of the other. And much lesse proceedeth it of any third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that wee acknowledge not any higher cause: which
beeing admitted, it followeth that these two so disagreeable
Beginnings met and matched together by chaunce, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that all things are tossed and tumbled together by
Fortune.</hi> Agayne, <hi>If God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>bee apt to the beautifying
and orderly disposing of Matter; and Matter be apt to receiue
beautie and orderlines at Gods hand; I demaund fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
this mutuall aptnesse and disposition commeth? For conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that they bee so disagreeing and so full contrary one to
another; surely they could neuer haue agreed of themselues,
but must of necessitie haue had a Third to make the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
betwixt them. Now I am sure you will not say that there
was any third to commaund them: Neither wil I beleeue, that
they fell to greement by aduenture. To bee short, seeing that
Matter is not sufficient of it self to be in happie state, but nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Gods helpe thereunto; but God is of himself abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sufficient, both to be, and to be happie: who seeth not that
GOD is of more excellencie than Matter, and that Matter is
not of it selfe so much as able to be? For were it able to bee, it
were also able to be happie. And therefore it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
but that he whom wee confesse to haue perfected Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was also the very first maker and Creator of Matter.</hi> But
how could he make it of nothing? Let vs heare once agayne what
the sayd <hi>Porphyrie</hi> sayth vnto this poynt. <hi>Handycrafts</hi> (saith he)
<hi>haue need of instruments or tooles. For their working is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>,
and they haue not their matter or stuffe at commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the naturall Powers as more perfect, &amp; being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
things, doo performe all their doings by their only being.
After that sorte the Soule by his essentiall life, doth nourish,
growe, ingender, breathe, feele, and so foorth. So likewise the
Imagination, by the only one Inworking of it selfe, giueth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
qualities and mouings to the bodie, all at one instant. So
also the bodilesse Spirites themselues, (as the Diuines report)
doe worke wonderous things by their imaginations, without
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13215:99"/>
instrument or action. Much rather therefore shall the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayster
of the whole world who is a Mynd, giue substance to
the whole by his owne only being, that is to wit, to this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
world, himselfe being vndiuidable. For why should it be
thought strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that a thing which is without a bodie, should
produce things that haue bodies, considering that of a very
smal seede there groweth so great a Beast, composed of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
so great, and so differing parts? For though the seede bee
little, the reason of the seede cannot bee small, seeing it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
so great things: neither on the other side can it be great,
forasmuch as it vttereth and sheweth it selfe euen in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
percelles. Now, this reason of the seede needeth matter to
worke vppon, but so doth not the Reason of God; for he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not any thing, but maketh and frameth all things; and
notwithstanding that he bring foorth and moueth all things,
yet abydeth he still in his owne proper nature.</hi> Now, when as
the sorest and learneddest enemie that euer Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
this doctrine in good faith and in so expresse wordes who
dareth open his lippes any more against it? Dare the Epicures
with their motes doo it? How can they alledge any reason for them
selues, being by their owne opinion made by haphazard at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without reason? Or shal the naturall Philosophers do it, with
their temperings and mixtures? First let them examine their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Galene,</hi> concerning the things which I haue alledged out of
him in the former Chapter: and if that will not suffize them, they
shall heare him yet agayne in this Chapter. Certesse as it cannot
bee denyed, but that as he laboureth by all meanes possible, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the causes of all things vppon the Elements, and vppon the
mixture of them together: so is he driuen at euery turne, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
somewhat in them which he is ashamed to father vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.
In discoursing how the babe is formed in the moothers wombe, he
findeth himselfe turmoyled with many opinions.<note place="margin">Galen in his booke of the fashioning of infants in their moothers wombe.</note> But yet in the
end, <hi>Soothly</hi> (concludeth he) <hi>I see so great a wisedome, and so
mightie a Power, that I cannot thinke that the Soule which is
in the child that is begotten, maketh the shape thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that it is altogether voyde of reason; but rather that
it is formed by that which we call Nature.</hi> In his booke of the
tempering of things, a place that serued best for the exalting of the
powers of the Elements to the vttermost;<note place="margin">In his second book of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings.</note> he very sharply repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
those which father the cause of the forming of the parts of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13215:100"/>
bodies of liuing things, vpon the qualities of the Elements. <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that these Qualities be but instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and that there bee another that is the framer or fashioner of
things.</hi> In his booke of the opinions of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
he maketh the vitall spirite to bee the excellentest of all things that
haue a bodie: and yet for all that, he will not haue it to be eyther
the substance or the dwelling place, but only the instrument of the
Soule. And in his booke of Flesshes he procéedeth further, &amp; sayth
that in treating of Leachcraft he spake often according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion: but that if it came to the poynt of vttering the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that he himslfe hild, he declared that both man and Beast haue
their beginning from aboue, and that their Soules are from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and finally that the Soule procéedeth neither from the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Elements, nor from any of all the things that wee see
here beneath. Now, if the Soule of man, or of the very Beastes,
procéede not of the Elements: how should it possibly procéede of
the Matter? And if it procéede not of the Matter, must it not néedes
procéed of the forme, or rather must it not néedes be the very forme
it selfe? And what els is so excellent a forme, than an excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?
And from whence is that (by his owne saying) but from a
former fashioner or shaper? And what els shal that former be, than
a Creator, seeing that euen shaping, is a creating of a substance?</p>
               <p>Now therefore, let vs conclude for this Chapter, both by vnso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
reasons, and by the testimonies aswell of our enemies as of
our friends; that God both was able to create and also did in déede
create the World of nothing, that is to say, by his owne onely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
without the helpe of any thing whereof to make it. And (to
comprehend in fewe wordes whatsoeuer I haue treated of hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
that GOD of his owne goodnesse wisedome and power, did
make, shape, and create the World: that is to say, That (if a man
may so say) he is the efficient formall and materiall cause thereof,
without that he néeded eyther helpe, patterne, or stuffe to make it
withall. And now let vs consequently see the finall cause: that is to
wit, how and to what ende he guydeth it: which shall serue for the

their father &amp; moother be to be honored; &amp; such
are not worthie to be disputed with, but rather to be rebuked right
sharply. And others desire to haue it proued to them by apparant
reasons, that there is a Prouidence which ruleth the world. Such
kynd of folke (sayth he) should be answered by a whippe or a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and not by a Philosopher. His meaning was in fewe words,
that there is not any thing so sensible and naturall, nor any thing
whereof the feeling is so fresh in our sences, or so déepely printed
in our nature, as Gods prouidence ouer the world: and that wee
ought to thinke it more sure, than the things which wee feele with
our hands, or than the things whereof our owne Conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicteth
vs. For in that he ordeyneth a greater punishment for him
that doubteth of Gods prouidence, than for him that resisteth sence
and nature; he doth vs to vnderstand, that the fault is vntolerable,

And in very déede, if the denying that there is any God, bee a bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a mans owne sences, and of his owne nature, and of all the
whole world it self, as I haue sayd afore: I cannot say but that the
graunting that there is a God, and yet notwithstanding to denye
him the gouernment of things, is more vntolerable than the other;
considering how great iniurie is offered vnto him in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing him
after such a sort, as to attribute vnto him eyes without sight, eares
without hearing, might without mynd, mynd without reason, will
without goodnesse, yea and a Godhead without properties peculiar
to a Godhead: In respect whereof the auncient Philosophers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the Godhead it self <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>ay God or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
becaue the one cannot bee imagined without the other.
And therefore in their iudgement, as much an Atheist was he that
denyed Gods prouidence, as he that denyed the Godhead it self. I
demaund of any man which confesseth that there is GOD, I say
euen of the sauagest of them all, whereby he knoweth it? Hée will
answere, by the orderly conueyance of things which he seeth both
aboue and beneath; by the order which they kéepe without fayling,
and by the tending of so innumerable contrarieties to one marke;
the Heauen heating the Earth, the Ayre moystening it, the Earth
bringing foorth Hearbes, the Beastes feeding vppon the same, and
all seruing for the vse of man. It is all one therefore as if he should
say, that he knoweth him by his Prouidence, and by the interlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of all things together which he hath marked in them all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he will say he hath perceyued, in Mettalles, (as ye would
say) certeyne wombes which nourish them and bring them foorth;
in Plants, a certeyne vertue which draweth their nourishment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the earth, and with very good proportion distributeth the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade
from braunch to braunch, and from leafe to leafe; and which
(as though it had a kynd of vnderstanding of the owne mortalitie)
bringeth foorth a seede at such tyme as the decay therof approcheth:
and in Beastes also, that one member doth for another, and euery
of them for the whole; a desire to increase their kynd; Doogges to
giue sucke; and a skilfull care to nourish and preserue their young
ones: And he hath considered that none of all this could bee so layd
for aforehand by it selfe, and therefore that there was some other
thing aboue them. Thus must it néedes be, that he is led againe by
the consideration of the prouidence, to the knowing of God. Now,
if the prouidence which wee haue marked, doe make vs to say that
there is a GOD by mounting vp from the effects to the causes of
them; doth it not followe that Prouidence is the peculiar effect of
God, and that he which denyeth that, denyeth the Godhead it selfe,
forasmuch as the Godhead is not to be knowne but by the Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
               <p>If God haue no care of the world, I aske of thée whether it bée
for that he cannot, or for that he will not? If he cannot, how canst
thou say he is almightie? Or how canst thou say he is infinite, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thou knowest the bounds of his power? Agayne, how canst
thou call him wise, sith it is the propertie of wisedome to guyde
things to some certeyne ende, and not to leaue any thing subiect to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13215:101"/>
fortune? And seeing that his power and wisdome haue extended
to all things for the creating of them, who shall keepe them from
extending to al things for the ordering and mainteyning of them?
Besides this, the Plant hath no reason to guyde it selfe, nor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
it selfe against that which is to come, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thou seest there a mynd which furnisheth out all the partes
thereof, and a wisdome which watcheth ouer it against that which
is to come. The Beast also hath no more reason than the Plant,
though it both feele and mooue. Yet is there an Inwit in it which
the Beast knoweth not of, which Inwit concocteth, digesteth, and
distributeth that which the beast hath eaten, and disperseth it foorth
into his parts by iust proportion, watching for it when it sleepeth,
and thinking vppon it when it thinketh not thereon. It perceiueth
(I wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lay the yong ones in: it prouideth aforehand for the tyme to come,
and shiftety countries according to the seasons of the yeere, cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them out naturally, without fayling at any time. In all these
things there shineth foorth a certeyne prouidence, which yet for all
that, the beast neither knoweth nor conceiueth. Thou thy selfe
which art indewed with reason, hast a forecast, and by that forecast
doest the things which other wights doe by nature, or rather which
nature (that is to say the foreordinance of the Creator dooth for
them,) the more whereof thou hast, the more also doest thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
aforehand. For as little a worme as thou art, thou inuentest a
thousand trades and artes, which are euerichone of them so many
poynts of wisdome, and consequently as many prouidences. As
much as thou canst, thou makest all things to stoope to thy lur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
thou applyest the rayne and the drought, the heate and the cold, to
thyne owne commoditie: thou turnest the doings of thy neighbors,
of the Cittie and of thy Commonweale to thine owne profite and
honor: yea and if it were possible, thou wouldest apply the heauen,
the earth, the sea, and oftentymes euen God himselfe to thine own
benifite. Now then who prouideth for the Plants and for the brute
beastes in whom thou seest so great prouidence though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
haue none at all, but onely he which made them? Or who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
the Arrowe to the marke, the Arrowe (I say) which seeth
not the marke, but the Archer who hath eyes for it? And cannot he
prouide for all, which giueth prouidence to all? And he that giueth
it thee in such sort as thou the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom thou scarsly knowest the names, is not he able to gouerne
euery one of them according to their nature, and too direct them,
yea and thee too, vnto the end that he hath purposed, seeing he hath
made them? Againe, if God be not able to prouide for things, and
to direct them to their end, how say we that he surmounteth all that
euer we can imagine, sith we cannot deny, but that hee which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
aforehand is of more abilitie than he that cannot. And if wee
can imagine any thing to be greater then hee, why should not wee
our selues be that thing? And if euen in man, the abilitie of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be better then the vnabilitie, seeing we vphold that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is excellent in our selues, (which yet notwithstanding is but in
measure and by perticipation,) the same is infinitely and original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in God: Why doe we not graunt that God by his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
can direct all things to his ende, as well as euery thing can
by their particular wisdom which he hath printed therein, prouide
for the things which the nature thereof requireth? Too bee short,
seeing that Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<note place="margin">What Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is.</note> is nothing els but a wise guyding of things
to their end, and that euery reasonable mynd that woorketh, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

the workemaister of all things, hath (or to say more truely) is the
souereine mynd,<note place="margin">All working of an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing mind is to some end.</note> equall to his owne power: doth it not follow that
God in creating the worlde, did purpose an end? And what other
could that end bee, than himselfe and his owne glory, considering
that the end wherevnto a thing tendeth, cannot be lesse good than
that which tendeth vnto it? and againe that as farre as his power
extendeth in abilitie to create the world at the beginning, so farre
doth his wisdome extend in abilitie to guyde aud direct it to that
end? And seeing that the beginner and the end of things (the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
(I meane) and the marke that he shootes at) are both one, that
is to wit God himselfe: can any thing crosse him or incounter him
by the way, to hinder his atteyning therevnto? Well then thou
seest now, that thou canst not deny GOD the gouernment of the
world, vnder pretence that he is vnable.</p>
               <p>But you will say, that he will not voutsafe to haue a care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
How come you I pray you to be so priuie to his will? Hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taught you? Nay, thou seest, in the Plants a certeine inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to nourish all their parts; in beastes, a charishnesse to bring vp
their yong; in men, a desire to prouide for their children and house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
and in all folkes a regard to the mayntenaunce of the things
which they haue either made or manured. And him that doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13215:102"/>
thou estéemest to bee, not a barbarous persone or a wylde
beast, but a very block or a stone. Now then shall not he which hath
giuen such inclination to all things, yea euen to the very sencelesse
creatures by his touching of them, shall not he himself (I say) haue
it for them all? Darest thou beréeue him of that which thou takest
to bee a prayse to thy selfe? or darest thou father that vppon him,
which thou takest to bee an iniurie to thy selfe? Nay, like as this
care is a sparke of goodnes, so he that is the goodnes it selfe and the
welspring of all that euer is good in all things, sheadeth foorth this
care into all things by his goodnes. He say I which hath voutsafed
to create vs, will not disdeyne to preserue vs. But forasmuch as it
was his will to create vs to some purpose, (for if nature doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

will also guyde vs to that purposed end, by his wisdome.</p>

néedes gather that there is no prouidence, no nor (if he durst say it)

Mountaynes occupie any part of the Earth? why should there bée
any wyld beastes? why should there be any Sea? And of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
dry ground that is, why should two parts be vninhabitable, the
one for ouer great heate, and the other for ouer great cold; and the
third part be in daunger to be vnhabited also, were it not that men
plucked vp the Bryers and Thornes that woulde ouergrowe it?
Why falleth the Snowe vpon the Corne, and the Frost vpon the

short, why happen sicknesses and diseases according to the seasons
of the yere, and finally death? And at a word, why is man borne in
worse case than the least thing that creepeth on the earth, and hath

               <p>Nay, he should rather haue sayd, I sée a thousand mouings in
the Heauen, whereof euery one hath his peculier end, and yet tend
all neuerthelesse to one selfsame generall end. I see them all caryed
by one vniuersall moouing, notwithstanding that euery of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
themselues to the contrarie by their owne proper courses; and
that this vniuersal motion is moued by one Moouer, which moouer
so ouerruling them, must néedes be of sufficient power to rule them
all, considering that euen with one twinckling of an eye, hee ruleth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13215:103"/>
euen the same Heauen that caryeth all the rest about. It followeth
then that there is one principall moouer, which gouerneth the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

but a litle point, or (as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> said) but as one of the least
Starres: that the Moone ruleth the Tydes of the Sea, and the
Sunne the seasons of the Earth, and they both are disposed by the
course of the heauen. Wherevpon I conclude, that he which ruleth
the Heauen, ruleth both the Sunne and the Moone, and that hee
which ruleth them, doth also rule both the Sea and the Earth. For
how is it possible that he which ruleth the whole, should come short
in ruling any part of the whole? Or howe should the force of hym
be impeached by the Earth, which gouerneth those by whome the
earth hath her force? Insomuch that if (to my séeming) his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
appere more lightsomly in the Heauen than in the Earth,
(which yet notwithstanding is not so,) and I cannot yéelde a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all the things which I sée: I will consider with my selfe that
I haue séene many instruments made by men as I my selfe am,
whereof I sée plainly the effectes, but I conceiue not the causes of
them: Also that in other some I perceyue well the vse of some
partes of them, namely of the greatest and notablest parts, but as
for the smaller parts, as the Uices, Nailes, Pinnes, Riuers, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
and such like, I haue thought them to be but bywoorks, and
yet without them the residue could not hold togither, nor performe
that which they were made for: and although they were taken all
a sunder, and shewed mée seuerally one by one; yet could I hardly
conceiue them. Yea and moreouer that I my selfe haue made
some, whereof my Seruants and Children haue not perceiued the
reason at all, but would haue burned them in the fire as seruing to
no vse. And therefore I will prayse GOD in the things which I
knowe, woonder at him in the things which I conceiue not, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinke my selfe (who am as nothing) to want wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
than misdéeme him that is the maker of all things too bée
faultie in his prouidence. But sith fooles must be answered to their
follies, least they should thinke themselues wise; and that the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of these folke consisteth all togither in putting foorth questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in answering to nothing: let vs examine these goodly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
ouer from poynt to poynt.<note place="margin">The obiection of Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines.</note> If there be a Prouidence (say
they) whereto serue the Mountaines? Nay, say rather, if all were
of one sort, where were then Prouidence? For what els is Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13215:103"/>
but a disposing of many sundrie things to some one ende?
And how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any such disposing be, where there is but one selfsame
thing euerywhere throughout? Bruite beast that thou art! So
would an Ant speake of thée. It would aske whereto serued the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of thy nose aboue thy face, or of thy browes aboue thyne eyes,
or of thy ribbes aboue the rest of thy bodie; all which are higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
thy bodie, than the Mountaines are aboue the Plaines of the
earth. Thou estéemest greatly of the beautie that is in thy face, and
of the proportion that is in thy bodie; insomuch that thou fallest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in loue with them in another; and yet thou wilt finde fault with
it in the whole world, as a deformitie and want of order. But thou
<hi>Lucrece,</hi> durst thou (I pray thée) bee so bolde as to speake so of a
Painter? Or would it not offend thée if another man should speake
so grossely of thy bookes? If a man should finde fault with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
of a picture in a table; it would be answered that the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
ought not to presume aboue the Pantople. For without the
blacke, the white could haue no grace; neither could the bright bée
set out, without a dimming; nor difference and proportion of parts
appeare, without a medley of contrary resemblance; nor finally the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unning of the Painter be perceiued, without diuersitie of colours.
Also he that should finde fault with the art of thy booke, hauing red
but some péeces of it here and there; should by and by bee answered
by the Lawyer, That a man cannot iudge of the Lawe, without
reading it wholly throughout. And if there happen any absurditie;
by and by there starts me vp a whole world of Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marians, which
inforce their wittes to the vttermost to excuse it, and to finde some
elegancie in thyne vncongruities. Alledging that that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly
in the part, beautifieth the whole worke, and the shadowe
more than the perfect colour, and the dimme more than the bright,
when they be fitly placed. All the commendation of these paynted
things, consisteth in their diuersities. Insomuch that if thou see a
Playne ouerhanged with a shadie Rocke, or a dankish denne at the
head of a Riuer springing out of it; thou likest the better of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for it, and praysest the Paynter the more for his skill. Surely
it is not possible that the Playne should please thée more than the
Hilles, or the Riuer more than the Rockes, but that neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other could please thée at all. Now, if thou diddest consider the
World as the worke of God, and the Mountaines and other parts
which thou mislikest, not in themselues but as they be small péeces
of that worke; doubtlesse thou wouldest say as much thereof. And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13215:104"/>
therefore sith thou canst not at one view behold all the whole world
together, to iudge of the proportion of the whole masse and of the
seuerall parts thereof at one instant; learne to commend the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the workmaister in the things which thou thinkest thy selfe
to vnderstande, rather than to call it into question, for the things
which thou vnderstandest not.</p>
               <p>But let vs sée further what reason thou hast to complaine. Thou
wouldest shunne both Rayne, Hayle, &amp; Frost. Behold, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
furnish thée with wood and Timber to house thée, to shelter
thée, and to make thée warme. Thou followest the commoditie of
Traffick; and behold, they serue thy turne with Riuers from East,
West, North, and South, making way from the middest of the
Land to the Sea, and ioyning the Coastes of Sea and Land to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The ambition of thy neighbours is suspected of thée, and
thyne perchaunce is noysome vnto them: the high Mountaines are
as bounds to separate Nations asunder, and to kéepe them from
incroching one vpon another. I omit the Wines and fruits which
they yéeld foorth, the clere waters which they shed out, the flockes
and heards of Cattel which they feede, and the pleasant dwellings
which they conuey in them. If thou couldest finde as many things
in thy bare Playne alone, I would giue thée leaue to complayne of
the Mountaynes. Nay, on the contrary parte, if thou haddest felt
the discommodities of the Playnes of <hi>Lybie;</hi> or but onely of the
Playnes of <hi>Beawsse,</hi> or of the Desert of <hi>Champayne,</hi> thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
by and by wish that all were Mountaynes; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if all were playne, or al were hilground, thou couldest not
tell how to commend or discommend eyther of them both. Now
then, let this stand for an answere to all those Philosophers which
take vppon them to controll the parts of a worke which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
not whole. For, to blame the whole World for the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
sake, or the Mountayne for the Woods that grow thereon,
is all one as if ye should finde fault with the whole man for lesse
than a wert or a heare; when as yet notwithstanding, in an old man
thou honorest the same heare which the Barber cutteth off and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
into the fire, yea and thou honorest the olde man for the very
same.</p>
               <p>But let vs procéede with the rest of their arguments. Thou
complaynest of the wilde Beastes;<note place="margin">Wyld Beastes.</note> And who hath made them wild
but thy selfe? Nay rather, thou shouldest wonder at the prouidence
of God, who (as <hi>Apollonius</hi> hath well marked) hath printed such
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13215:104"/>
an awe of man in them, that they hurt him not vnlesse they bée as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
or pinched with extreme hunger. And therein what do they
more than man would do in like extremitie? But thou hast yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause to wonder at his prouidence, in that the Beastes which
might hurt thée, go single alone by themselues, and haunt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts
and Caues of the earth, and make but small increase; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Beasts which are for thy benefite, how huge and strong soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they be, come home familiarly to thée, submitting themselues
in whole flockes and heards to a Childe, and increasing into thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
within small tyme. Tell me in good earnest, is it a worke of
fortune, that the Beastes which may anoy thy life doe shunne thée,
and that those with whose life thou maynteynest thyne owne life,
should come and offer themselues vnto thée?</p>
               <p>But the Sea displeaseth thée for occupying so much of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earth.
Wart thou a dweller in the Sea as thou art on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Land, the Earth
would displease thée for occupying so much of the Sea.<note place="margin">The Sea, Aristotle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the earth is vncouered, which the Sea as the hygher element wold else ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme. In his booke of Woonders.</note> And yet
what a deale thereof is still emptie, which were sit to be inhabited?
Know thou, that thou art beholden to it for the great number of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wights which it fostereth for thée, for the great number of
Townes and Cities which it inricheth for thée; for the Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whereby it shorteneth thy way and yéeldeth thée Trafficke;
and for his vapors wherwith he mainteyneth the ayre and maketh
the earth fat. For put the case that the Sea were dryed vp at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
what a number of Cities thinkest thou should be seene deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and Nations desert, when men should bee in case with the
drought, as Fishes are that be left on drye ground at the going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of the tyde? Why shouldest thou not rather commend the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficialnes
thereof the more, in that not thinking it enough to lend
it selfe to thée to doe thee seruice otherwise: it also teacheth thée the
mightie prouidence and prouident might of him that made it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou seest it ouerdreepe the earth, and threaten it with drowning
euery minute of an hower, and yet is not able to passe his bounds:
or when thou seest it seeke to inuyron a great Countrey round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
as though it were to imbrace it; and yet to stay at a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
balke, or els to winde it selfe into the bowelles of the Land
at a narrowe chanell; whereas notwithstanding an infinite sort of
little Iles are settled in the middest of the déepe, like a sort of small
motes in a Pond. For, seeing that thou seekest thy commoditie
and profite thereby, thinkest thou not that he also seeketh his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
And though thou haddest none other profite by it, were it not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13215:105"/>
very much for thée to haue had it as a ground and matter wherfore
to magnifie him?</p>
               <p>The Windes<note place="margin">The wynd</note> perchaunce do make thée to hate it: for thou must
néedes haue a saying to them too; and yet on the other side, if it hold
calme, thou art weary of it. But couldest thou without them haue
knowne the tenth part of the Earth? How couldest thou haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
the Land of <hi>Perow</hi> and the Iles of <hi>Moluckes?</hi> Nay, how
couldest thou haue come to the nerest Iles vnto thée, without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
Now, if thou like of the Wind when it is fauourable to thée; why
should not another man that hath to doe in a contrary Coast, like
well of it when it is contrary to thée? And if both of you finde fault
with the storminesse thereof; knowe ye that he which made it wilbe
glorifyed thereby, in that he doth thée to vnderstand, that he is able
to méete with thée both on Sea and Land, and thou art taught to
call vpon him, when the selfesame winde which hath caryed thée at
thy pleasure, is readie to dash thée against the Land.</p>
               <p>But of that little of the drye ground which remaineth, two parts
(sayst thou) be vnhabitable.<note place="margin">The Earth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable.</note> Who tolde thee so? Nay rather, why
doest thou not couclude therevpon, that there is a Creator; seeing
that euen in thy tyme those parts were not inhabited? Surely the
Winds whom thou blamest so much, haue taught vs that in those
Clymates are goodly Countries, people of better health and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
strength than wee, more beautifull Cities, and more delicate
fruites; and wee finde them so temperate, that we forsake the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratest
Countries here, to goe thether. The daies and yéeres are
measured otherwise in one Countrie than in another: but yet in
this varietie there is a constancie: and the one selfesame Sunne
which maketh so many diuersities, doth thée to vnderstand, that he
which made the Sunne could well make the other things. To bee
short, there is so great eunning in all these things, that thou hast
bene inforced to make an Arte for the learning of them. And what
els is an Arte, but the setting of diuers Rules in order together?
And if Arte bee so néedfull for the knowing of them; who will not
say that there is much more Arte in the thing it selfe?</p>
               <p>Thou blamest the Thornes Bryers and Bushes for couering
the earth: but thou considerest not into how many mischiefes ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
plungeth thée. Thou blamest the Frost and Snowe for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thy Husbandrie, whereas in déede they twitch thée by the
eare, to put thée in mynd that the foyzon of the earth commeth of
God. Thou blamest the Rayne for wetting thée; whereas yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13215:105"/>
it moysteneth thy grounds and makes them fat. At
a worde, thou playest the babe, who thinkes his Nurce does him
wrong when she kembes his head or puts on his cloathes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when sometymes she plucks a firesticke from him, or takes a
knife out of his hand: that is to say, thou misconstrewest al the good
which the bountifull prouidence of God doth vnto thée.</p>
               <p>But in the end (sayst thou) why be we not able to help our selues
assoone as we be borne?<note place="margin">The birth of Man.</note> Why bee wee subiect to so many diseases,
and in the end to death? I will not now presse thée with that which
I will speake of hereafter: namely, that for all these things none is
to blame but thy selfe: for euen in the same things which thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
fault with, I will shewe thée still to thy face, the prouidence of
God. The babe is borne without abilitie to helpe himself, and hath
none other skill at all but to crye. Contrarywise the bruite Beast
is no sooner come from his Damme, but he is able to goe. Be it so.
Yet notwithstanding, of all these babes (which to thy seeming are
but as forlorne things) none dyeth for want of nurce or nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though there be nothing but payn and care in bringing them
vp. Therfore it must néedes follow, that euen from the beginning,
a certeyne prouidence hath watched ouer them, which hath ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
this kindly affection and carefulnesse in the mothers breast; and
the lesse that babes can do for themselues, the more manifestly doth
Gods power shine foorth in prouyding for them. As for the bruite
Beasts, it was not requisite for them to be brought into the world
in that sort, forasmuch as being vnable to conceiue reason, they had
no interest at all in the knowledge of those things.</p>
               <p>As touching diseases,<note place="margin">Siknesses and Diseases.</note> if thou blame the seasons of the yeere for
them; thou mayst as well blame the fire for burning thée, which yet
notwithstanding thou canst not forbeare: For the fault is in thyne
owne vndiscréetnesse, and not in their nature; and in thyne own vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulinesse,
and not in their distemperance. The selfsame heate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thou findest fault, ripeneth the Corne, Wine, and Fruites
wherewith the most part of the world are fed. And if thou thinke
that any man be therby cast into an Agew; he might haue forborne the
to haue gone into the Sunne, but he could not haue forborne the
shining of the Sunne vpon the earth. But if fathers of housholds
haue roddes at hand to correct their children withal, and that a part

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13215:106"/>
of diseases, which are as certeine fruits of some vices &amp; sinnes?
as one of Drunkennesse; and another of Lecherie, and so forth? Or
what wilt thou say to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himselfe, who speaking of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
sores and diseases, inioyneth the Phisition in any wise to
consider well, whether there be any peculiar stroke of God in them
or no? that is to say, whether the sicknesse or disease bee extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
so as the proper and nerest cause thereof, be the hand of God
vpon the party? Now furthermore, if there be nothing but disorder
and wretchednesse in this World; why blamest thou death, which
maketh thée to depart out of it? If it bee because thou hast goodes
which thou art loth to forgo: thou must consider that if thy parents
had not giuen place to thée by order of Nature, those goodes had
now bene none of thyne. If it be because Death maketh cleane rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of most things; thinke also that in so doing it maketh place
for other moe that are to spring vp in their place. But yet if thou
wouldest consider how often men goe to seeke Death where it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be doluen most déepe, and yet finde it not; how many méete
with it at Bankets, at Feastes, at Mariages, at Triumphes, and
where they would most faynest forget it; how many there be which
dye yoong and in good health; and how many liue fore diseased euen
to the depth of olde age; how many returne safe from most cruell
Battels, to dye in their beddes; and how many dye in battell or in
some fray, which haue shunned strife and tumult all their life long:
thou shalt easely perceyue that our life and our death are not in our
owne hand, ne yet depend vpon fortune, forasmuch as we scape so
many places where fortune seemeth to reigne; and that much lesse
doth our life and death depend vpon Nature, seeing it is not with
vs as it is with Trées and other liuing things to whom there is
set a certeyne terme, which for the most part they fulfill and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
it not: but that our life and death depend vpon a higher cause,
whose onely will disposeth and boundeth them, accordingly as is
expedient for his owne glorie, for the order of the whole, yea and
for our selues too.</p>
               <p>Had it not bene better then (sayst thou) that man had bene made
immortall rather than mortall? And had it not bene much better
also (I say) that the earth had rather bin fire than earth, or that the
eare had rather bene eye than eare, seeing that the one is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than the other, and in the opinion of the Philosophers it is
better to haue qualities actiue than passiue? Had the earth bin fire,
where couldest thou haue rested? And if thyne eares had bene eyes,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13215:106"/>
what had become of thy spéech, yea &amp; of thy reason too? Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my friend, giue this world leaue to be a world, that is to wit a
disposing of diuers things, and an order of many degrées. Euery
kinde of thing hath his bounds and buttelles, accordingly as God
hath listed to appoynt thereto. The Plant is a Plant because it
doth but liue and grow; if it had sence also, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should it be a Beast.
A Beast is a Beast, because it liueth and hath sence: if it procéeded
so farre as to haue reason also, then were it a Man. Man reasoneth
and discourseth because he is Man; and were he therto vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
he were a God. He therefore that demaundeth why the Plant
hath no sence, and why Man is not immortall in this World; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
why the Plant is a Plant, and why Man is Man. To
be short, the cause why it is so, is that it hath pleased God to set as
it were the diuers strings of the World in tune to make one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
insomuch that whosoeuer taketh away the diuersitie of
things, taketh away the World it selfe.</p>
               <p>But this is a poynt whereon they greatly stand. Well say they,
Admit that the diuine Prouidence haue stablished the World, yea
and that it haue an vniuersall care thereof: Yet to toyle it self in the
carke and care of so many particular things,<note place="margin">Obiection of base and vyle things.</note> specially in this sinke
here beneath, I meane in this elementall world which is subiect to
so many chaunges; seemeth rather woorthie of dispraise than of
praise. Nay say I, but if it be a praise vnto God to haue created all
things as well beneath as aboue; what discommendation can it bee
vnto him to preserue them all? And seeing he made them all of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
whence procéedeth their woorthinesse or vnwoorthinesse but
of his will? Why should the cloth of Gold be of more account than
the cloth of Hempe, or the Silke of more account than the Linnen,
to the Paynter that paynted them both? If God gouerne the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
why should he not also gouerne the Earth, whereon doe go so
infinite sorts of liuing things, in euery of the which, yea euen in the
Flye and the Ant, the greatnesse of the Creator shineth forth more
than in the very Heauen: as namely in their so liuely life, so readie
vse of sences, so nimble and free mouing, yea and in the very little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of them, which in so small roome conteyneth so many great
things together? For wee wonder more at the Clockmakers cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in making a Clock which a Flye may couer with her wings,
than in making a Clocke of great compasse, where the very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
if selfe diminisheth the estimation thereof. If thou bee afrayd
least y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of God should soyle it selfe in these corruptible things;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13215:107"/>
remember that looke with what mynd <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> commaunded
his men of Warre and ruled the Commonweale, with the very
same mynd did he both till and dung his ground, and yet thou cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
him neuer the more defiled or imbaced thereby. The selfesame
Sunne which giueth light in the Skye, pearceth through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darke
Cloudes and foggie Mistes, dryeth vp drawghts and Sinks, and
sheadeth foorth his beames euen into the things which seeme most
filthie and lothly; and yet he himselfe is not blemished or defiled
therewith. Now then, art thou afrayd least God who careth for all
things without care, moueth them without touching them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth
to them without putting himself foorth, is not able to wéeld
these lower things without defyling himself by them? But it were
more conuenient (sayth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) that God should deale with the
great things himself, as the King of <hi>Persia</hi> doth in his priuie Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and that he should leaue the care of the smaller things to his
Princes. As who would say, that the Gardyner which hath sowed
both the great Cabbage and the little Turnippe, both the Gourd
and the Melone, should make more account of the one for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
therof, than of the other for the smalnes therof. Or as though
thou wouldest not also the more woonder at the King, if without
stirring out of his priuie Chamber, he could appoynt all things to
be done, or rather doe all the things himselfe which other men doe.
What is the thing (I pray thée) which thou commendest in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
but that he could call all his Souldiers euery one by his

and for fodder for their Beastes? Or in the great Captaynes
of our tyme; but that they can skill, not onely to make Warre and
to order their Battelles, but also to set downe what the dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of their Armies will come vnto, euen to euery loafe of bread
and euery bottle of Hay? and welnere within one or two shot, how
many shot of the Cannon will make a breach in such a wall or such
a Bulwarke, and so foorth? Or finally in this Captayne or that, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that this Captaine could skill to set the Sunne vpon the face
of his enemies; and another to cast the winde, the dust or the smoke
in their eyes; and another to serue his owne turne by a Marris; and
some other to drawe his enemie into a myrie and dirtie Countrie?
And what viler or baser things can there be than these aforerehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
Finally what is it that ye commend in the skilfullest Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of them al, but that they could skill to serue their own turne?
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13215:107"/>
Or in the most glorious Conquerours, but that they gat the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in the ende? And so thou must néedes graunt that whereas the
Counterparties fayled to doe the like, it was not for want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
or goodwill, but for want of power or skill. Now, whatsoeuer
is in the whole World, is the Armie or Hoste of God, an Armie or
Hoste (I say) not which he hath gathered of his neighbours, but
which he hath created with his owne hands? He knoweth all the
Starres by name; for he made them. He hath prouided foode for all
liuing things, and one of them is no greater to him than another:
for they haue no being at all any longer than he listeth. If he make
warre here beneath, all his Armies are readie to do him seruice and
to wage battell vnder his Banner, yea euen the ambitiousnesse of
Princes to punish themselues one by another. If Nations wexe
proud; he armeth against them the Grashoppers, and the Locusts,
the Horefrostes and the Blastings, the Windes and the Uapors
of the Earth. In euery of vs he hath his inlookers to chastize vs; in
our flesh, our corruptions; in our mynde, our passions; and in our
Soules, our sinnes and disorders. There is not so small a thing,
which serueth not him to very great purpose; nor thing so vyle,
which serueth not his glorie; nor thing so enemylike, which figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not to get him the victorie; nor thing so wrongfull, which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth
not his Iustice; nor thing so much against him, which hitteth
not the marke that he ameth at. Therfore pleade not in this behalf
vnaduisedly for Gods glorie. For, the more stirring, the more
chaunge, the more disorder there is here beneath; the more doth he
shewe the vnmouable decree of his euerlasting Prouidence, which
(will they or nill they) directeth all the vncoustancies of this world
to one certeyne end. And if perchaunce thou be afrayd least GOD
should bee tyred with the payne and trauell: (for he hath néede of
thyne vngodlines to reléeue him) consider how thyne own Soule,
without any toyle to it selfe, and without thy priuitie, doth at one
selfesame instant both prouide for the susteyning of thée, and make
all thy parts to grow, euery of them according to his peculiar por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and proportion, giuing sence euen to thy nailes and the heares
of thy head, which are but outgrowings and not parts of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
And if thou wilt know how this Prouidence is occupied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
toyle; consider how that thy Soule (notwithstanding all the
businesse which thy Soule doth without thy thinking theron) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth
not also in the meane while to mount vp euen vnto heauen,
and by the discourses thereof to turmoyle the whole Earth; to lay
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13215:108"/>
for the maintenance and defence of innumerable howsholds, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for the decay and ouerthrow of as many others; and to search
into the dealings of the enemie, to make them to serue his owne
turne; to treate both of Warre and Peace together at one tyme,
and with the selfesame persons both at once. And darest thou now
thinke that God is toyled in the things which thou thy selfe doest
without toyle? Or that he is tyred with the gouernments wherein
thou wouldest take pleasure? Or that he being a free and infinite
Spirite, doth not that in a limited bodie, which thy Soule being
finite in it selfe, doth in thy bodie where it is as in a prison? To bee
short, seeing thou presumest to doe thy will with the things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
thou canst not make one heare; shall GOD be vnable to doe his
will with the things which he of his owne only wil hath made and
created? The vertue that is in a kernell or a Plant, sheadeth it selfe
from the roote to the vttermost braunches, yéelding nourishment
seuerally to the stocke or stalke, to the pith, to the barke, to the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
to the leaues, and to the fruite, to euery of them according to
the proportion and nature thereof. The Sunne it selfe in kéeping
his course, and without mynding any such thing, yéeldeth heate to
innumerable Plants, and to innumerable people; and yet heateth
not himself one whit the more. Now, if a creature doe so: what shal
we say of the Creator? What shall we say of him which is not the
Soule of the Plant, or of the Beast, or of Man; but the maker of al
things, yea which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nothing, who is not (as some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
haue vphild) the Soule of the World; but rather (if he
may be so termed) the very life and Soule of all life and Soule in
the World? But as we see dayly, if the Counsell of a Realme can
not ceasse one wéeke, without confusion of the Commonweale; nor
the Soule of a man or a Beast, forbeare woorking bee it neuer so
little, without the death of the partie; nor the life that is in Plants
stay without withering of the Plant; nor the Sunne goe downe
without procuring darknesse, or suffer Eclips without some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge: much more reason haue we to beléeue, that if the world
and al that is therein were not guyded, vphild, and cared for by the
same power wisedome and goodnesse that created it and set in such
order as it is: it would in one moment fall from order into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and from confusion to nothing. For, to haue no care of it, is to
mislike of it: and to mislike of it, is in God to vndoe it, forasmuch
as Gods willing of it, was the very doing of it. Now, if Gods
Prouidence extend it selfe throughout to all things, aswell in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13215:108"/>
as in Earth: wee cannot doubt but that it extendeth also vnto
man. For what thing is there of so greate excellencie, either on
Earth as mans body, or in Heauen as mans Soule? And in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it selfe to man, it must needes extend it selfe equally to all
men. For who is either greate or small, poore or riche, in respect of
him which made both of nothing? Or what oddes is there betwixt
them, sauing that whereas both of them bee but slaues to him that
setteth foorth the tragedie, he appareleth the one in Cloth of Gold
to play the King, and the other in a course Pilche to play the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
making them to chaunge their apparell when he listeth?</p>
               <p>But hehold, here commeth almost an vniuersall grudge. For if
there be (say they) a Prouidence; how commeth it too passe that ill
men haue so much prosperitie, and good men so much aduersitie?
that some be so long vnpunished, and othersome so long vnrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
And to be short, that one for his wickednes commeth to the
Gallowes, and another for the same cause obteineth a Diademe or
Crowne?<note place="margin">This fellowe for his leawd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes gat a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, He a Crowne.</note> This question hath combred not onely the most vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

notwithstanding that all things togither can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

vs say concerning Prouidence, That in all
things wee see a manifest Prouidence; but yet
to séeke out the cause thereof in euery thing, is
as much as to sound a bottomlesse pit, if it be not much worse, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the will of God is the cause of all causes. Surely if a man
will blame Gods prouidence, because it agreeth not with his owne
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13215:109"/>
opinion; he is a thousandfold too bee more mislyked, than hee that
should find fault with the maister of an household for the order of
his house, where hee hath not lodged aboue one night; or controll
the Lawes &amp; Counsell of a straunge countrie, wherof he hath had
no further experience than by resorting too the Tauernes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

to iudge of the determination of a Court of Parliament, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence that he had hild some mans Male at the Palace gate:
or (I will say more) than the brute beast that should vndertake too
déeme of the dooings of men. For what are wee to be admitted to
the Counsell of God, which cannot so much as abyde the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his face? And what vnderstand we further of him, than he
voutsafeth too reueale vnto vs? What Princis Counseler is so
wyse, that he can giue his Lord good aduice, vnlesse his Lorde doe
first make him priuie to his purpose as well present as past, and to
all the other circumstances perteyning thereunto? Or what Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
comming from a farre, will presume to vnderstand bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what tilth, what séede, what compost, and what time of rest such
or such a péece of ground requireth; than he that hath bin acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it all the dayes of his lyfe? And how farre greater thing
is it to create, than to till? But forasmuch as God is reason it self,
and we through his grace haue some sparke thereof: let vs sée whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee not so euident in all his dooings, that in this poynt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth
euen the darknesse of our reason. And if wee perceiue it
not so cleerly in all things, let vs acknowledge our selues to be but
men, betwéene whom and God there is no comparison, whereas in
very déede there were no difference betwixt him and vs, if we could
throughly conceiue all his deuices.</p>
               <p>Now then whereas it is sayd, that if there be a prouidence, why
haue good men so much euill, and euill men so much good, afore wée
deale with the matter, let vs agree vpon the words. I aske of thee
which men thou callest good, and which thou callest euill; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
what things thou meanest to bee properly good or euill. If I
should aske thée why healthy men haue so many diseases, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
men so much health, thou mightest with good reason laugh
mée to skorue: for health maketh healthy, and sicknesse maketh
sicke. But whereas thou askest mée why good men haue so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and euill men so much good, pardon me though I cause thée to
expound thy meaning: for naturally I cannot conceiue, that either
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13215:109"/>
good men haue euill, or euill men haue good. For if by good men you
meane rich men, men of honour, and men that are healthy; and that
ye take riches, honour, and health to bee the good things: then is
your question absurd. For it is al one as if ye should demaund, why
hearded men haue heare on their chinnes, and beardlesse men haue
none. But if (as I heare thée say) thou estéemest <hi>Solons</hi> pouertie
to be better than the gold of <hi>Crassus;</hi> and <hi>Platoes</hi> honestie better
than <hi>Dennysis</hi> tyrannie; and the Collick and the Stone of a wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with his wisedom, to be better than the health and soundnesse
of bodie of the foole with his follie: then art thou deceyued with the
fayre name of Good: for it is another thing than these goodes, which
causeth thée to preferre them and to estéeme them the better. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs say that the good are those which séeke after the true good
things, and that the true good things are Godlinesse and Uertue:
and contrarywise that the euill folkes are those which are wedded
to the things that are euill in déede, that is to say, to sinne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse;
and let vs not confound things together, the good with
the bad and the bad with the good. For what goodes soeuer a man
can haue, or (to speake after thyne owne maner) whatsoeuer euilles
he can méete with; he cannot bee good though he haue all the goodes
in the world, so long as he himselfe is not good; neither can he be in
euill case, as long as he himself is not euill. As for the goods which
goe about to beguyle vs vnder that attyre; let vs say they bee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, common to the one sort as wel as to the other, for the
which a man can no more bee termed good or bad, blesfull or wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
than he can bee called wise or learned for wearing a rich gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And contrarywise that as all these false goodes are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the wicked to make them woorse, (as riches to corrupt
both themselues and other men; authoritie, to doe vyolence; health
to make them the lustier and stouter to doe mischief, and so foorth:)
so the euilles which thou termest euilles, are helpes to good men to
doe good, and furtherers of them in the exercise of vertue, as pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to bridle their lustes, bacenesse to humble them, sicknesse to mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them, and all maner of comberances to driue them to flee vnto
GOD, and to teach them to succour their neighbours in the like,
when God shal haue drawne them out of them: euen after the same
maner that a sickly bodie turneth all things that are ministred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, into the vnsound humor which getteth the vpper hand; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the other side, the sound &amp; healthy bodie turneth to his nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
euen the meates that are worst of digestion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:13215:110"/>Now then, let vs come to the poynt. Wilt thou knowe why ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and honour are common both to good and bad?<note place="margin">That the false goodes are comon both too good and bad.</note> It is because
that God (euen in spight of the wicked) cannot but bee good; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he maketh the showers to rayne and the light to shine
vpon the one as well as on the other, notwithstanding that the one
sort doe curse him for wetting them or for making them to sweate,
and the other sort doe blesse him for moystening and ripening the
fruites of their labours. It is because God déemeth it not agréea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eyther to his owne honor, or to the greefes and trauelles of his
seruants, to reward them with trifling things, least they should set
their myndes vpon them; like as a father that kéepeth his heritage
for his sonne, thinketh it not to bee for his behoofe, to apparell him
in the liuerie of his seruants and slaues. To bee short, it is because
he dealeth like a Prince, who maketh his pay common to all his
Souldiers: but as for the Garlond of Oke, he giueth it only to such
as are the first that in scaling doe enter the breach, or get vp vpon
the wall of a Towne that is assaulted. Likewise Kings doe cast
their largesse at aduenture among the people; but as for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and dignities, they bestow them vpon those whom they espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
fauour. It misliketh thée that this man tilleth his ground
with moe Ploughes than thou: but aduise thy selfe well, whether
thou couldest find in thy hart to exchaunge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inward gifts of grace
which GOD hath bestowed vppon thée, with his Oxen and his
Ploughes. Another is in greater reputation and authoritie with
the Prince than thou art. But consider thou therewithall the hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytings,
the enuie, the hartburnings, and such other things which
he indureth; and see whether the meanest degrée in Gods house
where thou seruest, being free and exempted from all those things,
be not much better than the best roome about any King. The King
for his seruice done by him, rewardeth him with Lands, fees, and
offices: but if thou be so bacemynded and wrongfull to thy selfe, as
to foster thy body with the seruices and charges of thy Soule; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that God being liberall and iust, intendeth to reward spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
incounters with spiritual Garlonds, and to recompence thée ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own honor, and not according to the bacenesse of thy
heart; and that so much the more, because that in very déede, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth
not thy workes, but his owne workes in thée. Moreouer,
the reward is giuen, not according to thy desart, but according to
the worthinesse of him that bestoweth it. The recompence of one
selfsame seruice, is farre other at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of a King, than of a meane
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13215:110"/>
Lorde. If thou say thou couldest bee contented with a thousande
French Crownes, <hi>Alexander</hi> would answere thée, that it might
perchaunce be enough for thée to receyue, but not enough for <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
to giue. And if thou wouldest haue GOD to giue thée no
greater reward than plentie of Wine and Corne, if thou knewest
him well, thou wouldest bee ashamed of thy selfe: for it is the foode
that is common to all men, and not peculiar to those that are his.
Neuerthelesse, if thou step not so farre, but art desirous to knowe
what be the goodes which good men haue in this world, (I speake
of them that seeme not to haue them) <hi>Seneca</hi> telles thée, that they
make their life allowable to God who knoweth them; in him they
repose themselues, they haue peace in their Consciences; if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
not their present state, they also doe abate their desires; their
enemies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend their vertue, all the world bemoaneth their want,
and those that haue the distributing of goodes and honors, are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for leauing them vnconsidered. To bee short, the very asking
of that Question (be thou a Christian or an Heathen man) is vnto
them an inestimable reward; namely, that whereas concerning the
most part of other men, it is wont to be demaunded wherfore they
be aduaunced to riches, honor, and authoritie, and they themselues
are oftentymes ashamed to tell how they came by them; euery man
asketh how it happeneth that the good men are not rich, honorable,
and in authoritie. Now, if thou haue the courage of a man, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou not choose as <hi>Cato</hi> did, that men should rather aske why
thou haddest not an Image of thyne set vp in the open place, and
why thou wast not admitted to that honour, than otherwise? Yes
sayst thou: But if God listed not to giue mee them; why haue I at
leastwise forgone those which I had? Why hath hee taken them
from mée? It may be (sayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) that if thou haddest not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
them, they would haue fordone thée. I tell thée that if hée had
not taken them from thée; they would haue taken thée from him. I
pray thée how often hast thou taken from thy Childe a puppet or
some other toye that he played withall, to see whether he would be
stubborne or no? How oft haste thou plucked the knife out of his
hand, euen when he cryed to haue it still? And what euill meanest
thou towardes him, when thou weanest him from his Dugge?
Now then, thinkest thou it straunge that GOD should cast thy
goodes into the Sea, which els would haue helped to drowne thée
in destruction? O how greatly did <hi>Platoes</hi> Shipwracke aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
him, to make him wise? Or that he should plucke the Sword
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13215:111"/>
of authoritie out of thy hand wherof thou art so desirous, which els
(peraduenture) had slayne thyne owne Soule? Or that to prepare
thée to another life better than this, he should serue thee with such
fit meanes, as might make thée to bee in loue with it? Thou wilt
say that thou wouldest haue vsed them well: but what a number of
men haue bin seene, which vnder the chastisement of pouertie were
good men, whom riches and honor did afterward marre &amp; corrupt?
Thou sufferest the Phisition to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thée some kynds of meates
which thou louest well, and to abridge thée both of thy fare and of
thyne exercises, and of thy pleasures, because he hath seene thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or felt sometymes thy pulse: and wilt thou not suffer God (who
hauing created thee and shaped thee, feeleth euerlastingly the pulse
of thy Soule) wilt thou not suffer him I say, to bereue thée of some
outward thing which he himselfe made, and which would worke
thy destruction? Thou commendest the Captayne, who to make
his iourney the speedier against his enemie, dispatcheth away all
bag and baggage from his Armie, that his Souldiers may go the
lighter, and that the breaking of a Chariot may not stay him by the
way: and canst thou not finde in thyne heart that he which made
thee and gouerneth thée, should dispose of thy baggages: that is to
wit, of thy purchases or inheritances which thou hast gotten heere
belowe, to make thée the nimbler against vice, and against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
temptations of this world?</p>
               <p>But Enuie pricketh thee. Why taketh he them not (sayst thou)
aswell from this man and that man, as from mée? And why loueth
he thée perchaunce better than them? Tell mée why the Phisition
appoynteth thee a greater portion of Rhewharbe, than him? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such a one is more moued with one dramme, than another is
with three. One is better purged with a single Clister, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is with a very strong Purgation. One man is sooner warned
of God by the losse of his cropp of Grapes or Corne, than another
is by the burning of his house, the losse of all his goodes, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his Children prisoners. So <hi>Iob</hi> sawe the losse of his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
the burning of his houses, and the death of all his Children,
and yet for all that, he praysed God still. That which was constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in him, might haue seemed blockishnesse in another. But when
God came once to the touching of his person, he could not then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to dispute with him. Now then, séeing that the things which
thou termest euilles and mischiefes, are in very déede both Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
and Salues; wilt thou not haue them ministred according to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13215:111"/>
the complexion of the patient? And thinkest thou thy selfe wiser in
discerning the disposition of thy Soule, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he that created it, thou
I say which darest not trust to thyne own knowledge in the curing
of thy bodie? The same is to bee sayd of diuers Nations, whereof
some one may happen to be afflicted a longer tyme &amp; more sharply
with the Plague or with Warre, than another, and oftentymes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
euen for the selfesame causes. For God knoweth both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature of whole Nations, and the peculiar natures of euery
seueral person. Some nature, if it should not sée the scurge alwaies
at hand, would become too too proude and presumptuous: Another,
if it should see it continually, would be quite out of hart and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
dispayre. If some were not kept occupyed with their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities,
they could not refrayne from working mischief to others.
Another agayne beeing more giuen to quietnesse, is contented to
sweate in tilling his grounds, &amp; in trimming his Gardynes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
coueting other mens goodes so he may keepe his owne. In like
case is it with Plants: some require dunging, some rubbing to
make them cleane, some proyning, some new graffing againe with
the same to take away the harshnesse of their fruite, and some to
haue their head cropped quite and cleane off. One selfesame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyner
doth all these things, and a Childe of his that stands by and
sees it, woonders at it: but he that knoweth the natures of things,
will count him the skilfuller in his arte.</p>
               <p>Yea sayst thou, but though these euilles may be Medicines and
Salues, how may death be so? For what a number of Innocents<note place="margin">The murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse persons.</note>
doe wee see slayne in the world? What a number of good folke doe
we see put to the slaughter, not onely good in the iudgement of vs,
but also euen in the iudgement of those that put them to death?
Nay rather, what is death but the common passage which it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs al to passe? And what great matter makes it, whether thou
passe it by Sea or by Land? by the corruption of thyne owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
or by the corruptnesse of thy Commonweale? Agayne, how
often haue Iudges condemmed some man for a cryme, whereof he
hath bene giltlesse, and in the denyall whereof he hath stoode euen
vpon the Scaffold, and yet hath there confessed himselfe faultie in
some other cryme, vnknowne both to the Iudges and to the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by? a manifest reproofe either of the ignorance or of the vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Iudges, but a playne acknowledgement of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and iustice of the eternall God? And if God hring them to
that poynt for one fault, and the Iudge for another; what vniustice
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13215:112"/>
is in God for suffering them to bee condemned wrongfully by the
Iudge, yea and to be punished with death or otherwise, for a cryme
whereof their owne conscience cleareth them as giltlesse, when as
God and their owne conscience doo iustly condemne them for some
other? As for example, The Iudge condemneth them for conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
against the commonweale, whereas God condemneth them
(perchaunce) for behauing themselues loosely in defending the
commonweale. The Iudge vnder colour of offence giuen to the
Church, and God for not rebuking the Churchmen freely inough.
For I speake as well concerning Heathenfolke, as Christians in
this behalfe. And what a nomber doe wee see, which confesse of
themselues, and witnesse of their familiar freends, that by thy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of them, wherewith thou being the Iudge mentest to haue
put them in feare and too haue restrained them, they haue taken
warning to amend, and bin the more quickened vp and incoraged?
And what els is this, but that as in one selfesame deede, God had
one intent and thou another, so also he guyded it to the end that he
himselfe amed at, yea and to a contrarie end to that which thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
purpose? But what a thing were it if thou sawest the fruite
that GOD draweth out of it? The Childe that beholde his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
treading of goodly Grapes, could find in his heart too blame
him for so doing, for he thinketh that they should bee kept still, and
cannot conceiue to what vse the treading of them should serue: but
the Father knowing the goodnes of the Fruite better then the
Child, (for he planted them, tended them, and proyned them) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
also that within two moonethes or little more, they would
wither and dry away, and therefore to preserue the vertue of them,
he maketh no account of the eating of them, but treadeth them in a
Fatte to make Wyne of them. And when the Child comes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to discretion, he museth at his owne folly, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that at that tyme he played the very Child, notwithstanding
that as then he thought himselfe wyser than his Father. And after
the same maner doth he when he sees him make conserue of Roses,
of Uiolets, or of other flowers. He is sory to see them mard (as hee
thinketh) and is ready to weepe for it, and he cannot be quieted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would make Nosegayes of them, which anon-after would
wither, and he himself would cast them away by the next morrow.
Now consider I pray thee, whither without any further induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thou find not thy selfe too resemble this Child. GOD who
made the good men that which they be, hath no lesse consideration
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13215:112"/>
and loue toward them, than those which bewayle them. Hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to what ende their lyfe serueth in this worlde, also hee knoweth
when it is time to gather them, and to put to his Hooke or Sickle,
to cut them downe, that they rotte not vppon the tree or vppon the
ground, and how long they may be preserued in their kinde. And
thinkest thou it straunge that hee should take some when they bee
fresh and greene, too preserue them all the yeere long, or that hee
should make Conserues of their flowers to bee kept a long time,
or that hee should of their grapes make Wyns? Thinkest thou it
straunge say I, that he should after a sort make their sauour, their
sweete sent, and their strength, that is to say their godlines, their
vprightnes, and their vertue too liue after them, which otherwise
should bee buried with them? And that they which for themselues
could not haue liued past three or fower yeres, should liue to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of the Church and the commonweale, not yeres but worlds
of yeeres? If thou bee a Christian take for mee example the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and a great nomber of the Martyrs which haue suffered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution:
doest thou not euen yet still drink of that liquor of theirs?
doth not their constant confession make thee also to confesse Christ,
and their death helpe thee too the endlesse lyfe? Could <hi>Ignatius</hi>
and <hi>Policarpus</hi> haue liued aboue fiue or sixe yeres more than they
did? And yet what part of all their ages hath lasted so long or done
so much good, as the last halfe howre wherein they dyed? Or if
thou be a Heathen man, consider mee the death of <hi>Socrates</hi> or of
<hi>Papinian?</hi> If <hi>Socrates</hi> had not droonke the iewce of Hemlocke
without gilt, haddest thou had those goodly discourses of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the immortalitie of the Soule? Or wouldest thou haue
beleeued it so easely? and therevpon haue bene contented to forgo
thy lyfe so freely for the defence of thy Countrie, or for the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the trueth? And if <hi>Papinian</hi> had not shewed how hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a thing it is to dye for doing right, and how farre the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
magistrate is to be obeyed, should we not bee bereft of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
goodly example of stoutnesse and rightfull dealing? What
thing did they in all their whole lyfe, either so much to their owne
honour, or so beneficiall to them that were to come after them, as
their dying in such sort? Now therefore, let vs say we be but babes.
And forasmuch as we perceiue the wisdome of our Father t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as our owne ignorance is so grosse, whereas wee boasted of
wisedome, let vs rather confesse our weakenesse in all cases, than
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13215:113"/>
presume to doubt of his sage prouidence in any thing.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cato</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Goddes allowed that case which had the vpper hand. But Cato with the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, ageinst the Goddes did stand.</note> of <hi>Vtica</hi> would needes that God should yéeld him a

veriest rascall in the Realme, should commaund the high Court of
Parliament to yéeld him account, why his case was ouerthrowen.
For all our great Quarels and Complaints are lesse before God,
than the least case of a poore Uillaine is afore the greatest Monark
of the world. Nay, hee should rather haue considered that priuate
States are punished by order of Lawe, and Commonweales and
publik States by ciuill warres: And that the Commonweale of
<hi>Rome</hi> was (euen by his owne confession) so corrupted in maners,
in gouernment, and in the very Lawes themselues; that he might
haue had much iuster cause to haue doubted of Gods prouidence, if
after her punishing of others for the lyke things, she her selfe had
scaped vnpunished: That the Greate men, what part so euer they
mainteyned, were the members most infected, in so much that the
wisest men of that age said, <hi>We see what part we ought to shun,
but not what part wee ought to take:</hi> And that as <hi>Caesar</hi> made
warre openly against his Countrie, so <hi>Pompey</hi> couertly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand made his partakers too fight for the mayntenaunce of his
owne ambition, which was paraduenture discountenanced too the
common people, but could not be counterfetted before God, who
seeth the very bottom of our hearts. Now then shall wee thinke it
straunge, that to the intent to shewe the common people how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they bée subiect to be deceyued vnder pretence of good fayth; and
to teache great men how fore he mistiketh that they should shrowd
their leawde lustes vnder the Cloke of Iustice; God should suffer
<hi>Pompey</hi> to fall into the hands of his enemies? And that to punish
the pryde of the Senate and the whole state; hée should cause their
Army to bee vanquished, and let them fall into the hands of their
owne Countryman their naturall Subiect? Nay how could God
haue shewed his prouidence more manifestly, than by ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that State by her owne force, which thought there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Power in the worlde able too punish her? and by making her a
bondslaue to her owne Seruant, which had brought so many Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Commonweales &amp; Kings in bondage vnto her? But it may
be that <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe scapeth vnpunished. Nay: To shewe vnto
Tyrannes that the highest step of their greatnesse is tyed to a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that they be but Gods scourges which he will cast into the

Were wee now as diligent in marking the procéedings of things
done in Histories, as we be in noting the maner of spéeches, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

should find the lyke prouidence of God<note place="margin">The cause why men find fault with Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> in the chaunge of all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
But I content my selfe with this one afore mentioned, as the
which is best knowen too all men, except I were mynded to take
some example of our present age to inlighten the matter withall.
Now then, whereas <hi>Cato</hi> slewe himselfe through impatiencie,
thinke ye not that if he had liued still, he would haue ceassed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with God, and haue commended his Iustice, and haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bookes of his singular prouidence? Yes: But the mischief is,
that whereas we would not iudge of a Song by one note, nor of a
Comedie by one Scene, nor of an Oration by one full Sentence,
we will presume to iudge of the Harmony and orderly direction of
the whole world, and of all that is therein, by some one action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Againe, in Musik we beare with changes and breathes, with
pauses and discordes; In Comedies, with the vnmeasurable bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
cruelties of an <hi>Atreus,</hi> the wicked presumptions of an
<hi>Ixîon,</hi> and the lamentable outcryes of a <hi>Philoctetes:</hi> and all this
is (if we will say the trueth) because we haue so good opinion of the
Musician, that we think he will make al to fall into a good concord:
and of the Comediemaker, that all his disagréements shall end in
some mariage: and of the Tragediewryter, that ere hee leaue the
Stage, he will tye the wicked <hi>Ixîon</hi> to the Whéele, or make the
féends of Hell to torment the <hi>Atreus,</hi> or contrariwise cause GOD
to heare the wofull voyce and pitifull cry of the poore <hi>Philoctetes.</hi>
And if God seeme erewhyles to hold his peace, and to suffer men
to play their partes; ought wee not too haue so good opinion of his
wisdome, as to thinke that he can tell when it is tyme to pay them
their hyre? And that although he let the wicked walk at large vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the stage, and the godly to lye in prison: he can also prouide to
end the braueries of the one sort with iust punishment, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Tragedie is playd afore thée, thou art not offended at any thing
which thou hearest. Why so? Because that in two howres space:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13215:114"/>
thou hast shewed vnto thee the dooings of a ten or twelue yeres, as

that although thou bee not acquainted with the storie, yet the arte

thou wouldest thinke to be both vniust, and also cruell in

for an hundred yeres, which were lesse than the interuiewe of two
Seruaunts in a Comedie? Thou hast seene <hi>Pompey</hi> ouercome.
Loe here a discord that offendeth thine eares. Thou hast seene <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
to bring home his Sword bathed in the bloud of the <hi>Senate.</hi> If
thou be a Child, thou weepest at it: but if thou beest a man, thou
pacifyest the Child and attendest for the knitting vp of the matter,
and for the iudgement of the <hi>Poët:</hi> Herevpon the <hi>Chorus</hi> singeth,
and then maketh a pawse. All this whyle the <hi>Poet</hi> seemeth to haue
forgotten Iustice, and if thou depart out of the company at that
poynt, thou canst not tell what to make of it. But tarry a whyle
and hearken to the note that followeth. <hi>Caesar</hi> is put to death by
his owne men. See here how the discord is turned into a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
Thy Childe seeth that this prowd Peacocke which vaunted
himselfe aboue all the world, is in one day stabbed in with infinite
wounds. Whereby, how little a one soeuer thy Child be, he hath
some perceiuerance of the forecast of the <hi>Poet.</hi> Doest thou not see
then againe, that wee bee like Children, which would controll the
Song of all ages by one Note, or a long Oration by one Letter,
wheras notwithstanding, our life as in respect of the whole world,
is lesse then a short Minim in comparison of a whole song? If thou
be a Christian, thou readest the History of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> When thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
how he was sould into <hi>AEgipt,</hi> thou canst not be angry inough
with his brothers, nor sufficiently bewayle his poore olde Father.
Againe, when he is cast into the deepe Dungeon in recompence of
his chastitie, thou couldest find in thy heart to blame, not only <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,</hi>
but euen God himself. But when thou seest him taken out of
Prison to reade the Kings Dreames, and (within a fewe dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13215:114"/>
as a King in <hi>AEgipt;</hi> a succour to his father in his old age; and
the rayser vp agayne of his whole house at their néede: then thou
perswadest thy selfe that he which made him to reigne in <hi>AEgipt,</hi>
did suffer him to be sold to the <hi>AEgiptians;</hi> that he which made him
the deliuerer of his house, did also make him to bee solde into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
afore by his brethren: and to bee short, that the discord which
offended thée and the harmonie which delighteth thee agayne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
both from one selfesame Musition. Howbeit, afore wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this matter, see once agayne how much more vpright thou
art towards thy Prince, than towards God. Thou seest a great
number of his Armie come home wounded: if thou bee a man, it
must needes greeue thee. Anon one brings thee home thyne owne
Sonne dead: if thou bee a Father, thou canst not forbeare teares. A
neighbour of thyne assureth thee that he was slayne in doing his
duetie, in getting victorie to his Countrie. Though thou take not
comfort in it at the first brunt, yet at leastwise thou wilt not bee so
mad as to lay the blame in thy Prince. Within a while after, when
thou fallest to considering the fruite of the victorie; then as it hath
greeued thee to forgoe thy sonne, so wilt thou thanke God that he
dyed in defence of his Countrie, and that he did his part in so noble
a seruice. Shall not God then haue as great preheminence in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
foorth his glorie, as Kings for the obteining of their victories?
God ouer his Creatures, as Kings ouer their Subiects? Or shall
not we haue as much patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the death of those whom we bring
vp, when they dye for his seruice, as when they dye for the honour
of our Prince? Or shall wee haue lesse trust in him as touching his

and Captaines, which knowe not the issue of their owne enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,
or at leastwise for the most parte knowe it not, ne haue any
care of the life or death of them that serue them? Let this suffize for
answer to such as vexe themselues either for their owne afflictions,
or for the sodayne death of those whom they loue and estéeme. And
let vs now consequently see, if we can satisfie those which are grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
at the prosperitie and slowe punishment<note place="margin">The slowe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the wicked.</note> of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Thou sayst that the wicked haue welfare at will. King <hi>Cyrus</hi>
was not of that opinion, when for a punishment to the people of
the Citie of <hi>Sardis,</hi> he commaunded them to spend their tyme in
gaming &amp; feasting. Nay, thou shouldest rather say, that they haue

what they abyde in the very doing therof; and what a turmoyle

and thou shalt see that it is a continuall Feuer, a straunge vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

he went to bed with his wife, searched her whether she had not a

is in the disease. The partie (sayst thou) was vnruly in his youth.
The Wine that is now milde and good, was a two moneths agoe
both hard and sharpe, and it will growe riper yet in tyme. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
let the offender flee as farre as he list, yet is he in safe prison
and vnder sure garde. God stands in no such doubt as thou doest:
The offender can neuer scape his hands. No: but thou wouldest
that God should at leastwise brond him with the broade arrowe.
Where? In the forehead. Why, art thou afrayd that God could
not knowe him agayne, if he had once shifted his apparell in some
other priuie place? And doubtest thou that his bronding yron can
not pearce euen to the heart, which thou seest not? Nay rather, the
selfesame Land which for want of tillage and husbanding brought
foorth Bryers and Thistles, that is to say, vyces and enormities,
may by good husbanding beare good Wine and good Corne, that is
to say, Godlinesse and Urtue. And haddest thou once shamed him
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pillorie or by Carting; might it not gréeue thee to haue made
him past grace? If the <hi>Athenians</hi> (sayth <hi>Plutarke</hi>) had killed or
dissamed <hi>Themistocles</hi> for the outrage of his youth; or <hi>Miltiades</hi>
for his rebelling in <hi>Chersonesus;</hi> where had the goodly Uictories
become, which they obteyned in the Playnes of <hi>Marathon,</hi> on the
Coast of <hi>Artemisia,</hi> and at the Riuer <hi>Eurymedon?</hi> Or had <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
also bene rigorously punished, for the crueltie wherewith
his former yéeres were disteyned, and that thou haddest then kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
aforehand, what things he was to doe afterward for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement
of Christianitie; thou wouldest haue bewayled him.
And why sauest thou some from punishment for great crymes, in
respect that one is a good buylder, another an excellent Musition,
and a third a man of learning; whereas thou knowest not what they
will proue afterward; &amp; yet thinkest not that in so doing thou doest
any hurt, but rather good seruice to thy Commonweale? But as
for God, he knoweth which ground is euill of it selfe, and which it
is that beareth Brambles and Thistles for want of husbanding.
He knoweth what is in euery of our mynds afore wee our selues
knowe it. The things which we are to doe in tyme to come, bee as
present in his sight, as the things that we haue done alreadie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:13215:116"/>
with the wicked disorder of his yoonger tyme, could beguyle God,
though thou which seest but the outwarde man, callest the one the
Father of his Countrie, and the other an vnkindly Murtherer. He
knoweth when the tamed Woolfe will turne agayne to his kynd,
and when the churlish Dogge will put off his churlishnes. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweth
mens natures in the very seede, whereas we scarce know
them in the flower. Whereas wee play the blinde Barbers of the
Countrie, in hauing recourse at euery instant to searing, cutting,
launcing, and sawing for euery fore; he hath a thousand receyts to
heale vyces withall, and a thousand kynds of scurges to correct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
withall, according to euery of their complexions. And thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
thou then that he neglecteth his cure, because thou seest not the
fearing yron in his hand? Or that his potentials (as the Surgions
terme them) are not stronger than thyne actuals? And when thou
seest the sinfull person cured after that maner without launcing,
yea and without scarce; oughtest thou not to commend the curing
thereof so much the more?</p>
               <p>But there are which amend not a whit the more for the delay of
their punishment. Admit it be so: Yet what a number also are there
which doe amend? Nay, consider yet further, whether they bée not
suffered to liue to punish thée; thée I say which hast bene scurged
by them alreadie, and yet art neuer a whit amended. Thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
haue thy father to throwe his rodde into the fire, and thou hast
still a curst heart that cannot yéeld and aske forgiuenesse. Blame
thyne owne stubbornnesse that he burneth not the rodde. Consider
also whether it bee not a greater punishment to them to liue after
they haue done amisse, than to haue dyed in the déede doing, forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they see that their slaughters haue not successe according
to their willes, but that all the mischiefe which they haue wrought
is in vayne, so as they haue but prouoked God &amp; the whole world
against themselues to no purpose, and haue gotten nothing therby
but shame and reproach and torment of mynd; And whether God
doe not by that meane compell them to crye out, <hi>Wee haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
our selues in the way of wickednesse, vntill wee can no
more?</hi> If God (say I) by his seeming to be flowe, doe both amend
thee and punish the other both at once; doest thou not perceyue a
woonderfull worke of Prouidence? Moreouer, what is the whole
continuance of all a mans life in respect of God, but one moment?
shorter than the tyme betwéene the drinking of the Hemlocke, and
the death of him that drinkes it? and much shorter than betwéene

the killing of a man in the morning, and the being hanged for it in

That no man can prescribe time for his wickednesse ageinst Gods

               <p>And if thou think it not ynough that <hi>Lyciscus</hi> doe rotte aboue

maner of worldly Iudges, namely to content them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue suffered
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13215:117"/>
wrong, or to satisfie thy mynd desirous of reuenge, or too purchace
himself the report and estimation of a good Iudge at thy hand: but
bycause he hateth the euill, which he intendeth to correct, and will
also drawe good out thereof. And lyke as a discreete father, when
his Chyld complayneth to him of some wrong doone vnto him by
one of his Seruants, doth not by and by ronne vpon his Seruant
with a cudgell, (for so should he make his Chyld cockish, and cause
him not onely to doo the lyke for euery tryfle, but also to take the
staffe in his owne hand &amp; to lay about him, whereas he would haue
him to bridle his passions, and to referre the redresse of his wrongs
to him being his father;) but rather taketh his seruant aside, and
chastyzeth him eyther before his fellowes, or before others of his
children which beare him not so much grudge or ill mynd: euen so
it is not to be thought straunge, if God do oftentimes chastyze the
wicked farre from the view of the woorld, yea and sometymes also
euen after the deceasse of them that made complaynt ageinst them.
His intent is to punish their passions, but not to gratifie thine. He
will teache me his Iustice, but he will not haue thee too think that
thou shalt haue him at thy commaundement, to strike whensoeuer
thou wouldest haue him. If he should stryke at thy appoyntment,
then should he bee but thy Executioner, and thou shouldest bee the
Iudge. But knowe thou that he executeth his owne Iustice and
not thyne.</p>
               <p>Yea (sayest thou) but what Iustice is it, that Children should be
punished for their fathers? And (say I) what vniustice is it, if the
Children be not considered for the good seruice of their fathers? A
Prince giueth priuiledges too some Citie, for the faythfull seruice
which it hath done vnto him: and who will not blame his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
which shall take them away ageine a hundred yeeres after? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Prince bereueth a Citie of their Liberties and fraunchizes,
for rebelling ageinst him: who will think it any rigor, that their
Children which come after them should be in the same state? The
Prince dooth it for feare least the Children hauing the same terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
should rebell as their fathers did. God standeth not in feare of
men, but he seeth what they bee: and his knowing of them is not
as we knowe the Aspworme by his stinging of vs, or the Uiper by
his byting of vs; but he knoweth them afore they bee eyther Asp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorme
or Uiper; and may he not then by that reason sometymes
punish the Children, in the same respect that hee punished their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
As for example, by taking away their authority if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13215:118"/>
tyranny, least they myght abuse their authoritie still? Or
by taking away their goods which they spent in ryot and excesse,
least they should set their mynds vpon these vices still? and so forth
of other things? But why doo I terme it punishing? I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terme it curing. For what more is all this, than wee see dayly
done by Phisitions, who in caces where the fathers were diseased
with the Stone, the Gout, or the Dropsie, doe forbid the Children
the same things which they forbade their fathers, although the
Children be not yet trubbled with the same diseases? And what els
are sinnes and vices, but diseases and siknesses of the Soule? And
what straungenesse is there in Gods dooing, sith that thou thy self
dooest the very same? Thou Disinheritest the Children of them
that haue attempted treason ageinst the Prince: and if the Prince
may do it for the defence of his state; how much more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable
is the doing therof, for the preseruation of the parties themselues?
But yet in this appeareth the mercifulnes of God, that if the Child
of the wickeddest man in the world, refuse to be heire of his fathers
sinne, and wickednes, and follow godlynes and vertue; God doth
not only release him the debte due to such succession, that is to wit,
the peyne and penaltie which is an vnseparable appurtenance of
sinne; but also adopt him into the nomber of his owne Children, to
make him partaker of his heauenly heritage. Nowthen, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

haue we to complayne, eyther of the prosperitie of the wicked, or of
the aduersitie of those whom wee account to be good men, seeing
that all these things tend, not onely to Gods glorie and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the Comonweale, but also to the welfare and soulehealth of
those whom we bewayle? And if we did consider yet further, how
many there be whose miseries we bewayle, which foster a festered
sore in their bosom; how many there be whose prosperitie we enuy,
which haue much cleaner hearts than the other, and doe spit out all
their venome outwardly; how many there bee which haue their
nayles whole, and yet doo but little harme with scratching; how
many there be which wold teare al things in peeces, if their nayles
were not pared verye short; who for want of powre (I meane) or
for want of corage to execute their naughtynes, seeme for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time good men, and a thousand other such circumstances which
are to be marked in euery particular persone: surely they which do
so lightly charge Gods prouidence, would chaunge their opinion;
and where it seemeth to them most worthy of blame, there would
they the more woonder thereat and commend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:13215:118"/>But this is yet the greatest poynt of all: That although God

sinne or vyce is euill. Now if hee be altogither good, how can he
forbeare to hate it? And if hee bee Almightie, how can hee suffer
it? And if hee order and dispose all things, how dooth hee permit
it? This Question shall bee the clearelyer discussed, where wee
prooue how euill came first into the World; namely by the fall of
man. And then shall wee haue wherefore too woonder at Gods
Prouidence, who hauing punished vs by our owne naughtynes,
coulde skill too turne the same both to his owne glorie, and too the
welfare of mankynde. To glaunce at it in feawe woords; by
the way, It was requisite (and otherwyse it could not bee) that
there should bee some difference beetweene the Creatour and
the Creature, to the intent that the Creature should acknowledge
it selfe to be a Creature, and yeeld honor to his Creator who had
made him of nothing. Now the Creator is the good that is infinite
and vnchaungeable: and therefore the goodnesse that is in any
Creature, could not but be finite and chaungeable, sauing so farre
foorth as it consented to depend vppon him alone. God therefore
created man good, howbeit chaungeably good; free from euill,
howbeit so as he myght choose the euill; and he created him right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mynded, howbeit in such sort as he myght also go a stray. And
this man by turning away from the Welspryng of goodnesse, did
thereby fall away from his owne goodnes; and by following his
owne will in sted of Gods Will, he left his freedome and became
a bondseruant vnto euill. All they that are borne of this corrupted
seede, reteyne the faultynes of that first fault, and cannot wyt it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
any other than the first man. Therfore if it be demaunded why
God created man free, and not vnfree, seeing his freedome made
him bond, it is all one as if it were demaunded, why hee created
fyre to be light and suttle, that is to say Fyre, or why hee created
water moyst and colde, that is to say, Water, or the World full of
so many varieties, that is to say, a World, and to bee short, euery
kind of thing, to be of this or that nature. For to haue free mouing
and capable of Reason, is to be a man, and if we had not had it so,
we would haue complayned. Again, to haue free moouing and such
as cannot be but reasonable, is to be reason it selfe, that is to say,
to be God. Now God ment not to create a God, but a man to serue
him, lyke as when he intended to create Beastes for the seruice of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13215:119"/>
man, he created them Beasts and not men. But wherein wilt thou
more woonder at the prouidence of the euerlasting GOD, than in
that he not only ordereth &amp; disposeth the things that he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but also the thing which he created not; insomuch that he dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
good out of the euill, yea and compelleth the euill (contrary to
the nature thereof) to serue vnto Good? If a Captayne were of
such skill as to order al things in such wise in his Armie, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing should serue to the atteynement of his victorie; thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
commend him highly, &amp; it were in déede one of the rarest feates
of Warre. But if he could moreouer gayne some part of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Hoste, and make them to take his owne parte; thou couldest
not woonder sufficiently at his pollicie. What wilt thou say then of
him, which could make them to fight on his side vnwitting to them
selues, and that euen his enemies Hargwebusses should helpe to
giue themselues the foyle? Soothly euen after that sort is it that
God can skill to make both sinners and their sinnes to serue him.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> (as appeareth by the Histories) was an ambitious Prince;
and ambition (as ye knowe) cannot be welliked of God. Now, to
satisfie his ambition, <hi>Cyrus</hi> Ieuyes a great Hoste against the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
If a man should haue told him it had bin to deliuer the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
and to buyld vp Gods Temple agayne, as <hi>Esay</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told;
what think you he would haue sayd vnto it? Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the end of his Warres and of his warfare, fell out to be so in
déede. Thus ye see how an ambitious person and his ambition ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
God, without meaning any such thing. The Emperour <hi>Titus</hi>
ment to bring <hi>Iewry</hi> to due obedience: and it had bin foretolde, that
of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> one stone should not be left standing vpon another.
No doubt but that <hi>Titussis</hi> owne passion caried him; but yet see
how God ouerruleth it. The same man which persecuted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
at <hi>Rome,</hi> goeth to reuenge Christes death at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
and (as sayth <hi>Iosephus</hi>) in that fact he tooke not himselfe as Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the World, but as the executer of Gods Iustice against the
<hi>Iewes. Iudas</hi> through Couetousnesse betrayed the blud of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse
to death. But God by the sheading of that blud (if thou be a
Christian) redéemed thée; and yet the holy Scripture saith, that the
Deuill being in <hi>Iudas,</hi> did put that purpose into his heart. Ye see
then that not the Couetousnesse of <hi>Iudas</hi> only, but also the Deuill
himselfe serued GOD. Besides that, the Stories of the Byble be
full of such matter, wee might marke the like examples ordinarily
in the bookes of the Heathen, if wee were as diligent in obseruing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13215:119"/>
them, as we bee in obseruing the arte of Rhetoricke or Logicke in
the author's which we reade. For by reason of the great corruption
which reigned at those daies in <hi>Rome,</hi> all men cryed out that there
was not any Commonweale there, appealing to God for defence
against the vniustice of the Senate, at the same tyme that GOD
executed iust vengeance vpon them for it, by the vniust couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Likewise when <hi>Attila</hi> entered euen into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles
of <hi>Europe,</hi> all the Preachers of <hi>Christendome</hi> did nothing
els but bewayle the wretchednesse of that tyme.<note place="margin">Saluian in his vii booke of Prouidence.</note> Ye must thinke
that when this great Robber cast lots in his Countrie of <hi>Scythia,</hi>
whether he should leade the third part of that Land, he had another
meaning than to reforme the world. Yet notwithstanding, all men
acknowledged him to be a necessarie scurge of GOD, and to haue
come in due season. Yea, and he himselfe considering that he had
conquered much more of the Countrie, than euer he hoped at the
first to haue séene, insomuch that he had ouercome euen those which
were counted the strength of the World: as barbarous as he was,
he fell to thinke of himselfe, that he was the Scurge wherby God
chastised the World. Not that God is not able to chastise vs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
whensoeuer he listeth; (for his Storehouse is neuer vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
of roddes to scurge vs withall, as of Plagues, Diseases, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and such other things,) but that as a Maister of a howshold
holdeth skorne to whippe his Slaues himselfe, causing eyther his
thiefe Seruant or some other of their fellowes to doe it: yea and
when his owne Children offend him grieuously, he voutsafeth not
to beate them with his owne hands, (for so should he doe them too
great an honour) but causeth (peraduenture) the groome of his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe it, to the intent to shewe them the iustnesse of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
Euen so doth God punish the wicked one by another, whom
he could consume all at once in one hower; yea and his Children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the wicked, when not counting of them as of his Children,
but being readie as it were to disherite them, he disoeyneth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them with his owne hands. Thus therefore ye see, how God
serueth his owne turne by the wicked and their wickednesse, to his
owne glorie and to the welfare of those that are his.</p>
               <p>And as touching the offences whereinto he suffereth good<note place="margin">The very Sinnes of good men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to their benefite.</note> folks
now and then to fall: what greater poynt of prouidence can there
bee, than to turne them into instruments and furtherances of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue?
If God should hold vs alway by the hand, it is certeyne that
we could neuer trippe. And it is not to be doubted also, but that we
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13215:120"/>
would think at the length, that it was of our owne steadynesse, and
not of Gods vpholding of vs, not only that we tripped not, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that wee tumbled not downe. For what made vs fall but pride?
and what maner of pride, but that we thought we would be Gods
without God, yea euen of our selues? Now, to make vs to knowe
our infirmitie, wherin it is his pleasure to shew his strength: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
he letteth vs goe alone by our selues for a while, and then
stumble we at the next iob that we meete with. Neuerthelesse, this
tripping and stumbling saueth vs from a greater fall: for it maketh
vs to call for his hand to hold vs vp. After the same maner dealeth
the Nurce with her Nurcechild that maketh haste to goe alone too
soone: She suffereth him to stagger and to réele till he crye; but yet
in letting him goe with the one hand, she holdeth him vp with the
other; and sometymes he thinkes he goes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alone, when as she gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him both with her eye and with her hand. Sometymes also
when wee bee ouerlustie, God suffereth vs to fall into some sinne,
both wittingly and willingly, &amp; afterward maketh vs to féele such
grypes and hartbytings for it, that euen the vyce it selfe serueth vs
for a Schoolemaister, to driue vs to eschewe it. So the father suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his Child to burne his finger in a Candle, onely of purpose to
make him afrayd of fire, that the little findging of his finger, may
kéepe him from the burning of his face. There are examples hereof
in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Dauid</hi> and in others, which receyued good by their
trippes and falles. And I haue no doubt but that a great sorte euen
of the Heathen, haue felt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues how greatly their experience
of vyce in themselues hath profited them to the more earnest loue
of vertue.<note place="margin">Euilles are in the world as things set one ageinst ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after the maner as it is in the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of wordes.</note> So then, let vs not grudge at the prosperitie of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
for vnto them it is a bane: neither let vs complaine of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

the vizor of vertue in the wicked, for it is but an instrument of vice;
neither let vs disdeyne the falles of the vertuous, for they bee but
quicknings vp vnto vertue. But rather let vs glorifie God, which
maketh the euill good whether it will or no, which causeth vyce to
doe seruice vnto vertue, and which guydeth euen the most sinfull
déedes, to his glorie; the most vniust, to the executing of his iustice;
and the most vncerteyne, to the hitting of his marke. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he doe all this, yet can he not be blamed to haue wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
any thing in the World, nor to haue mainteyned euill in any
maner a wise, no more surely than the Soule or abilitie of mouing<note place="margin">The actions and mouings are of God; but the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them and the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are of ourselues.</note>
that is matched with a lame legge, is too blame for that the lame

the legge whether soeuer it will for all the lamenesse of the legge.
What shall I say more? If any doe yet still doubt of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearsed, I will put him but to one proofe; for his answere
whereto vpon leysure, I will beleeue him vpon his oth. If he bée a
despiser of God, let him call to mynd if he can, how much euill he
hath susteyned in the hauing of his goodes, and how much euill he
hath endured to doe euill. Let him remember how greatly he hath
tyred himselfe with his owne wishes, tormented himselfe with his
good successes, set himselfe on fire when he thought but to warme
him, and wandered quite away, when he ment to haue brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the bent of his owne bowe. Or if he be one that seareth
God, let him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how much euill he hath left vndone, in forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to haue so great store of those false goodes: how many things
he hath wished which he would haue eschewed, if he had forekno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
the issewe of them which he sawe afterward: how greatly he
had bene dreaded and misliked of others, though he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
to haue done better: how often his falles and slidings haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to make him to take sure footing against sinne: how oft his wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings
out of the way haue made him to escape the lyings in wayt
and the théeueries of the world: how oft his owne wyles haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to turne him from the right: &amp; how often his owne ouersights
haue serued to bring him to his intended ende: and I doubt not but
the héedfull marking of these things, both in others and in himself,
will make him to perceyue that a certeyne euerlasting prouidence
watcheth ouer our liues and all our doings. At leastwise vnlesse
we will denye, that to leade the forecastes of others to another end
than they purposed; to bring the vnaduised ouersights of others to
better passe than they themselues could wish; and to make the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the wisest to doe seruice, not only to his owne diuine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
(if a man may so terme it) but also oftentymes euen to the
vndiscréetnesse of the meanest, is the worke of Prouidence.</p>

the Prouidence, which thei haue dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to depend vpon the same as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance
thereunto. Insomuch that
euen they which haue flatly denyed the
Creation, haue neuerthelater graunted
the Prouidence, by reason that they found it so cleere and manifest
a matter; howbeit that to denye the Prouidence and to denye the
Creation is all one. <hi>Hermes</hi> espyes it out euerywhere, as well in
the Creation of the whole and of the parts thereof, as in the order
and maintenance of al things. And if it be demaunded of him, what
prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is, to haue brought foorth so many things which seeme
néedlesse and vnprofitable; his answer is readie shapen, That God
created all things to his owne glorie: and that it is a glorie, both to
him to haue created all things, and vnto all things to haue bin crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his hand.<note place="margin">Hermes in his Asclepius, and Cyrillus in his second booke.</note> And if it bee asked againe, whence the euill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that is in things: He answereth, That GOD created them
good, howbeit that (to speake properly) there is nothing purely good
but only God. As for the euill, it is come in vpon the good, like as
all generation is accompanyed with corruption. The yron rusteth;
thou wilt not wyte it vpon the Smith. The Wine sowreth; thou
wilt not wyte it vpon the Uintener. The things that are created
doe corrupt; as little also oughtest thou to wyte it vpon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Why? Because that only he is vnchaungeable, and it is méete
that there should alway bée some difference betwéene the Creator,
and the things created; betwéene all, and nothing. <hi>Plato</hi> in that he
teacheth the Creation, doth also sufficiently teach the Prouidence.
For if Gods power, wisedome, and goodnesse bee equall, or rather
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13215:121"/>
all one thing; looke where his power is, there is his wisedome, and
thither also extendeth his goodnesse. But his power extendeth euen
to the least things, for els they could haue no being at all: therefore
his wisedome also extendeth vnto them to guyde and gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and likewise his goodnesse without the which nothing could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.
And so, Gods prouident goodnesse and gracious wisedome
doe watch ouer all things. Againe, when as <hi>Plato</hi> setteth downe
God to bee the end of man, and man to bee the end of all things in
the world and of the world it selfe: hee sheweth sufficiently that as
man tendeth to God, so doth the world also; but vnto that ende it
should not tend, vnlesse it were directed thether, and who directeth
it thether, but he that first made it? To bee short, the perticular
formes of all things present and to come in respect of vs, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
present with GOD, can haue no abyding without a perfect
knowledge and a steadie direction of all things.</p>
               <p>But if any dowt hereof remaine yet still; let vs heare what the
<hi>Platonistes</hi> say to that matter. Surely <hi>Plotin</hi> hath made two or
thrée bookes thereof, wherein he teacheth prouidence by all things
from the greatest to the smallest, comming downe euen to the little
flowers which wee see vnblowen in the morning and withered at
night, as though he had ment to say the same thing that wee reade
in the Gospell: namely, <hi>Consider me the Lillies of the field;</hi> and
so foorth. Unto the ordinarie complaynt concerning the prosperitie
of the wicked, and the aduersitie of the vertuous; he answereth that
the prosperitie of the wicked is but as a Stageplay, and the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of the godly is as a gaming of exercise, wherein they bee tyed
to a streight dyet, that they may win the prize for which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
Unto the Question concerning euill, he answereth; that it is
nothing els but a fayling of goodnesse,<note place="margin">If the man that suffereth be good; also. Plotin lib. 3. Ennead. 4.</note> which goeth on still dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
it from degrée to degrée eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vttermost; and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth
not from GOD, but from the imperfection of the matter,
which he termeth nothing: and that the euill, (which consisteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
in degrées and in fayling of good,) is so farre of from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing
Gods Prouidence, that it is rather the thing wherein
Gods Prouidence sheweth it selfe the more, as without the which
there were no Prouidence at all to be séene: and yet that therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
God is the author of all abilities, and the disposer or ouerruler
of all willes. Which things (to auoyde long discourse) are more
conueniently to be seene in his owne workes.</p>
               <p>His Disciple <hi>Porphyrius</hi> departed not from the same opinion,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13215:122"/>
                  <hi>howbeit that he was combered with the like perplexities, that they
be which dispute ageinst it.</hi> Seeing that God (sayth he) doth by
his skill ouerrule all things, and order them by incomparable
proprietie of vertue; and that on the contrary part, mannes
Reason being very small, is ignorant of most things how skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and curiouse so euer it seeme to be of the trueth: Surely we
may then call it wyse, when it is not curiouse in serching such
doutfull and hard matters, as are matched with daunger of
blaspheming; but rather graunteth that the things which are
done, are very well as they bee. For what can our small Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
finde fault with or reprooue in the doings of that greate
Reason, to esteeme them eyther lawfull or vnlawfull, seeing
wee vnderstande them not?<note place="margin">Porphyrius to Nemertius.</note> 
                  <hi>And in another place,</hi> If wee suffer
a King <hi>(saieth he)</hi> to dispose of his owne affayres as he listeth;
shall wee deny vnto GOD the ordering and disposing of the
things heere beneath,<note place="margin">Cyrillus in his second and Fifth bookes ageinst Iulian.</note> which hee himselfe created? <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such as founde fault with the gouerment of the world which
they vnderstand not, these are his very words.</hi> Soothly <hi>(sayth he)</hi>
there is not a more vniust speech, than that which presumeth
to teache God Iustice, nor a more holy speech than that which
yeeldeth to the trueth; and to think otherwise is a disease of
mynd &amp; a great cryme. For God not only directeth all things
at all tymes, too the behoofe and full harmony of the whole
vniuersally; but also is the cherisher preseruer and repayrer of
euery seuerall thing in particular. I pray you hathe hee not
shewed too Phisicians, (who haue so much prouidence as hee
hathe giuen them skil,) the things that are too befall too the
whole body of man, how that some members are to be cut of,
some to be seared, and othersome to be eaten away with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasiues,
for the health of the whole body? And yet when the
Nurces or Mothers see the Surgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about to do it, do they not
weepe and cry out ryght strangely, notwithstanding that they
knowe it to be for the welfare of the childes body? But what
doth the Father then who is wiser than they, but comfort the
patient, and hold the playster ready to lay to the wound? God
lykewyse for the curing of the whole, hath ordeyned that men
should dye, <hi>(That is the thing that</hi> Epicurus <hi>findeth fault with)</hi>
&amp; that they should be separated asunder, as a Toe is sumtime
cut of for the sauing of the whole body. And could we enter
into the mynd of God, we should vndoutedly knowe why and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13215:122"/>
to what good end hee hath from the beginning barred some
things from being because he foresaw they should be to hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and vnto other some hath giuen death in recompence of
their godlynes. The summe of all is, that nothing is done but by
the prouidence of God, howbeit that many things seeme repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to his wisdome and goodnes, as the cutting off of a Leg, or the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a member séeme repugnant both to the healing of the whole

contented to part hence, if he found no aduersitie here? And
therefore it is to be thought, that the Rulers of the lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<hi>(he meaneth the Féends)</hi> were the first founders of these
prosperities which the comon sort maketh so great account

that if we fall into any aduersitie whereof wee cannot coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the world he graunteth vnto God the care of al greate things.
And thinke you it beséemeth man too set bounds too the wisdome of
God who hath limited the natures of all things; and to appoynt
what God shall estéeme greate or small, before whom nothing can
be greate or small? Neuerthelesse whereas he sayth that the world
dependeth vpon God as the end thereof; the best of his Desciples
do by infallible consequence gather thereof the prouidence of God.
For seeing that the World dependeth vpon hym and tendeth vnto
him; the beginning of that direction cannot procéede of any other,
than of him to whom it tendeth. Agein, seeing that (as he sayth in
other places) all kynd of things tend too some one perticular ende
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13215:123"/>
euery one peculiar to it selfe, and all méete togither in one vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
end, and yet all of them haue not reason or vnderstanding to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
that ende too themselues, or to hold themselues within that
bound. It followeth then that there is a certeine prouidence which
hath that reason for all and euery of them, and that the same reason
resteth in God vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al of them depend, as <hi>Aristotles</hi> best ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
interpreters are constrained to confesse. To be short, the quick
sentence which is attributed vnto him, which is, That such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a proofe of Gods prouidence are to be answered with the las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
of a Whippe: doth giue vs sufficient credit of his opinion.</p>
               <p>Of the opinion of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> we cannot doubt. For he that
graunteth the creation of a thing, cannot doubt of prouidence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that power and goodnes are alike equall in both of them.
But behold héere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> expresse words of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Aphrodise</hi> in

with his nature; for it is the propertie of an enuious person.
And that he should be vnable, were to vnseemely for him, for
he is able to doe more than he hath yet done. Therefore let vs
not dout of him, either the one or the other, but let vs rather
conclude, that hee both can and will haue care of all things
that are done heere belowe.</hi> And in another place hée gathereth

the Poets (which are full of such sayings euery where) may
answere, as <hi>Orpheus, Homere, Hesiodus, Aratus, Sophocles,
Phocylides</hi> and such others: surely in as much as wée sée that all
Nations haue some Religion, it is a visible president, that Gods
prouidence is beléeued and receiued of all with one accord. For in
vayne doe meu serue God, if he sée it not; in vayne doo men pray to
him if he regard them not, in vayne complaine they to him, if hee
iudge them not; and to be short, in vayne doe wee call vppon him
both on Sea and Land, (where counsell and casualtie seeme most
to take place) for the mainteyning of our welfare, and the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of vs from harme; vnlesse wée bée throughly perswaded that
he heareth vs, and that he ruleth Heauen and Earth and all things
in them from aboue, yea and euen the verye hazard of warre as
<hi>Caesar</hi> termeth it, wherein fortune séemeth to beare greatest sway.
But afore wee giue our determinate Iudgment, wee haue yet two
Aduocates to heare, namely the Aduocate of Fortune, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate
of Destinie. For (sayth the one) if all things passe vnder the
guyding of prouidence, what becommeth of Fortune which we sée
in so manye things? And (sayeth the other) what fréedome then
hath man? must it not néedes be confessed, that a certeine destinie
compelleth euery man to doe whatsoeuer he doth?</p>
               <p>If ye meane fortune as she is peynted by the Poets,<note place="margin">Ageinst For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</note> blynd, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on a bowle, and turning with euery wynd: it is as easie to
wype her away as to paynt her. For who seeth not that there is an
vniforme order, both in the whole world, and in all the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and how then can one that is blynd be the guyder therof? Also
who vnderstandeth not, that to moue things belongeth to stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and not vnto vnstedfastnesse? for how can that thing rule and
wéeld others, which is caryed away it self? Or how can he hold the
sterne who floteth himself vpon the water? Séeing then that there
is so certein order in all things: it followeth that fortune beareth
no sway in any thing, and therefore that there is no fortune at all.
But if by the word fortune they meane as <hi>Proclus</hi> doth,<note place="margin">Proclus vppon Timeus.</note> a certein
diuine power that gathereth causes farre distant one from another,
all to one end: surely in that case we be more fréends to fortune than
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13215:124"/>
they be. For we admit it, not only in things vncerteine wandering
and wauering, but also euen in the things that are moste certein,
yea and in all things whatsoeuer; as the which is but God himself
disguysed vnder another name.</p>
               <p>Nowthen to speake properly, what is Fortune? Is it a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?
Euen by their owne confession, it hath no being but in the
disorder of other things. Shall wee terme it an Accident? How
should an accident worke so diuers accidents?<note place="margin">Iunenall. I here wants no God at all, where wisdum doth aduyse: we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be any thing at all? Surely it is a word that signifieth nothing but
respectiuely, that is to say, as hauing respect of some things or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are spoken of, and it hath no ground or being but of and
in our owne ignorance. That which is fortune to the Childe, is no
fortune to the father: that which is fortune to the Seruant, is none
to the Maister: that which is fortune to the foole, is none to the wise
man: that which is fortune to the wise man, is none vnto God. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of our knowledge or ignorance, so doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
increase or abate.<note place="margin">Error, &amp; Blind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and the not knowing of things and causes, haue brought vp the names of Nature and Fortune.</note> Take away ignorance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, and fortune
is banished from all their dealings. The father letteth a thing fall
in his Garden, to see whether his child wil bring it to him or steale
it away. The childe thinkes it to be falne by chaunce; and his father
who knowes to what ende he did let it fall, smyles at him. And so
the thing that was chaunce or fortune to the childe, was of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the father. A Mayster sendeth foorth diuers Seruants di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
waies, all to one place, to the intent that of many, some one at
the least may escape and come home againe. They méete there all
together. At the first sight the thing which was forecast by good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
seemeth to them to happen by aduenture. A Captayne hauing
deuised to take the Gate of some Citie, causeth a Cart or a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryot
to bee broken vpon the Drawbridge as it were by some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce,
that his ambush may in the meane while breake foorth and
enter the Towne. The Warders fall to beating of the Wagoner
for it, and othersome excuse him as ouertaken by misfortune. And
so the thing which was a pollicie of Warre in the Captayne that
deuised it, is a chaunce or fortune to the Towne that wist not the
ground of it. A wise man to giue a glyke to another wise man, or a
Captayne to beguyle a Captayne, or an enemie to delude his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
cyphereth a letter grossely for the nonce, and sendeth it such a
way as he imagineth that it shalbe surprized. He that lighteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is glad of so good aduenture, and thinking that he readeth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
of his aduersaries hart, buildeth all his affayres in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13215:124"/>
vpon things contriued to deceyue him. And so the thing which
was a rare deuise in the one, is a rare aduenture to the other. Now
if among men, which are all of one kynde, and haue welneere like
portion of reason, there bee such oddes betwéene age and age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
qualitie and qualitie, and betwéene wit and wit; that the
same which in one is prouidence, is fortune in another: shall wee
thinke it straunge, that the thing which seemeth fortune to vs that
are but blindnesse and ignorance, should be singular prouidence as
in respect of God? Or that he which is the only cause of all causes,
should haue the skill to assemble them together to some one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
effect, how farre distant soeuer they be? As for example, if he
make thee to finde a Treasor in digging of a pit, or to scape a fall
from a plancher in going to walke vppon it; wouldest thou steale
that benefite from the goodnesse of GOD, who brought thée to the
one place, or saued thée from the other? I say from God who is thy
maker, to father it vpon blynd Fortune which knoweth thée not?
And why should it be harder for him to match two causes together
that are farre asunder, than to haue made them so farre at oddes
one from another? Or than it is for thy selfe to put wood to fire, and
fire to water, &amp; thy meate into the water, which are causes so farre
distant, and yetnotwithstanding thou ioynest them together to one
certeyne ende, which is the nourishment of thy bodie? And what
things are further distant in thy mynd, than a Charyot, a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
and an Hoste of men; which things notwithstanding thou
couldest skill to bring fitly together for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taking of a Citie? Thus
looke wherein thou doest chiefly place fortune, there doth the rarest
and most wonderfull poynt of Prouidence most euidently shewe it
selfe.</p>
               <p>But now comes me the other Aduocate;<note place="margin">Ageinst Destinie.</note> who to bring vs vnto
Destinie, and to a certeyne necessitie of all things and of al doings,
maketh his hand of all the things which we haue alledged against
Fortune. Therefore let vs see how we may walke betwéene For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and Destinie, so as wee may shunne chaunce without failing
into necessitie, and perceiue whether the same be Prouidence or no.
If all things (say they) be guyded by GOD to some one certeyne
end, yea euen those also which seeme casuall; then can they not bee
turned any other way. I willingly graunt them that. And if they
cannot bee turned; then are not mens doings free, but of necessitie.
Nay, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent is vtterly false; because the things which haue
free will to endeuer themselues contrary to Gods will, haue not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13215:125"/>
free power to restreyne his will from ouerruling them. But let vs
lay foorth this matter more at large, that it may bee the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
We see in the Skye a great number of Starres that are
fixed, and many also (as the Planets) which haue euery of them
their peculiar mouings turnes &amp; courses seuerally to themselues.
Now, the highest Heauen, by his vniuersall mouing carieth all the
Starres about, as well the mouable as the vnmouable, without
any stopping or interrupting of their perticular mouings, whereby
bee made innumerable figures aspects and respects, which I leaue
to the Astrologers to declare. The Sunne maketh the day and the
yéere; the Moone maketh the moneths &amp; the quarters; the Pleyads
and Hyads make the Seasons; the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gstarre maketh the heate
of the Sommer, and so foorth. Let vs put the case that the highest
Heauen stood still, and that the lower Heauens kept on their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
mouings: or let vs put the case that he went on, and that all the
rest stood still; and then should there bee none of the sayd figurings
and aspects to bee seene. But let them all alone as they bee: let the
highest Heauen by his mouing carie all the Starres about, and let
euery of them continue the hauing and executing of his owne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
nature, the mouable as mouable, and the vnmouable as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouable,
and euery of them indeuer accordingly against the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall;
and then shall wee see the woonderfulnesse of the Heauen,
which by an vniforme kynd of mouing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leaueth to euery Starre
his proper and peculiar mouing, yéeldeth euery day diuers formes
in the Skye, which cause alterations in the ayre; which thing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his owne sole mouing could doe if the residue of the Starres
stoode still, neyther could the courses and mouings of the Starres
bring it to passe, if they were not carried about by the mouing of
him. Now let vs see how this example agréeth with our matter.
God by his will and power hath created all powers, and disposed
all willes. That his power ouerruleth all powers, al men confesse.
For who is he that maketh a Clocke and cannot rule it? But that
his will should direct all willes to such ende as he listeth, without
forcing them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their nature which is to be free; there is the dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.
God forbid that he which created nature to doe him seruice, should
be vnable to vse the seruice thereof without marring it. God then
(say I) guydeth all things to the performance of his will, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable
by their mouings, and the vnmouable by their stedfastnesse;
the things indewed with sence, by their appetites, and the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things, by their willes; the naturall things, by their thraldome,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13215:125"/>
and the things that haue will, by their freedome: And the freer that
they be, the greater is his glorie, as in déede it is a more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
thing to cause libertie to yéeld freely to obedience by gentle
handling, than to hale it by for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e and compultion as it were tyed in
a chayne. If the willes of all men were caried by Gods will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hauing their awne peculiar mouings: the power of God could
not shine foorth in them so much as it doth now, when all willes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
themselues seuerally against his will, and yet neuerthelesse
euen in following their owne sway, doe finde themselues led (they
wote not how) whether soeuer it pleaseth him. Neither should wée
see the said diuersities of figures in the Heauen, which bréede so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

God; but wee should see euerywhere one vniforme will
holding all other willes fast fettered, and carrying them whether
soeuer it listed; and the more streightly that they were tyed vp, the
lesse should we estéeme of his power, as who would say he stoode in
feare to let them loose. Agayne, if wee imagine all those willes to
haue free scope, to followe their own lykings without any gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of higher power to ouerrule them, and restreyne their wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they intend to breake out: wee should undoubtedly see diuers ends
in things, where as now they tend all to one: And libertie would
turne into loosenesse, loosenesse into disorder, and disorder into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
whereas the world doth necessarily require ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

requireth all things to bee referred to some one certeyne ende.
God therefore to shew his power in our fréedome and libertie; hath
left our willes to vs; and to restreyne them from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

no lesse by them, than if wee had no will at all. Let vs enforce our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
as much as wee list against his will, and yet euen our diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
shall turne to the fulfilling of his will. Let vs goe East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when his will goes Westward, and yet doth his mouing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

vs still. But alveit that God do leade foorth and guyde the one
will as well as the other; yet notwithstanding right happie as that
will which indeuereth to followe, and vnhappie is that which must
bee haled and dragged. Likewise in a keness of Hounds, euery of

third, yea, and fourth causes, and hath linked them one to an
other, to do what he will haue done: but the thing that deceiueth vs
in this case, is that we consider not that our wills are among these
causes and that according to their fréenesse such as it is, they work
fréely in the doings of this world, lyke as all other causes woork
euery of them according to their peculiar moouings, inclinations,
abilities, natures or kynds. After the same maner the man that is
acquaynted with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his howseholdmatters, will deeme aforehand
which of three parts his eldest sonne will choose, and which his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
will choose, though he be farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, bicause he knoweth
their natures and inclinations; and yet for all that, hee inclyneth
them not to the dooing of the one or of the other. Ageine, another
foreséeth that a Prince will kéepe peace or make warre, bycause he
knoweth him two be eyther of a quiet or of an vnquiet disposition.
Euen so is it with God: sauing that he being néere and innermore
to al things than the things themselues are, doth knowe them most
perfectly, wheras we haue nothing but by coniectures, and those
verye weake. To be short, as in respect of God the things are of
necessitie, which as in respect of themselues are things of casualtie;
the cause wherof is, that the matter which in the things themselues
is to come, is present to his sight euerlastingly; and his foreséeing
of things to come, is not in the causes of them as it is vnto wyse
men, but in himself who is the cause of all causes; and therfore he
séeeth not that thou shalt do this or shalt not do that [as of a thing
to come] but whatsoeuer thou art to doo, he séeth thée doing it from
euerlasting; naturally if it be to be done naturally, and willingly if

Should hee not be compelled to say, that in this sillie body there
dwelleth a greater thing than the body, greater than the earth, yea
greater than the whole world togither? Then let vs say with <hi>Plato,</hi>
that man is dubble; outward, and inward. The outward man is
that which we see with our eyes, which forgoeth not his shape whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is dead, no more than a Lute forgoeth his, shape when the Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaier
ceasseth from making it to sound, howbeit that both life, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
sence, and reason be out of it. The inward man is the Soule,
and that is properly the very man; which vseth the body as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument;
whereunto though it be vnited by the power of God, yet
doth it not remoue when the body ronneth. It seeth when the eyes
be shut, and sometymes seeth not when the eyes be wyde open: It
traueleth while the body resteth, and resteth when the body traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
that is to say, it is able of it self to parforme his owne actions,
without the help of the outward man, wheras on the contrarie part
the outward without the help of the inward that is to wit, the body
without the presence of the Soule, hath neither sence, mouing, life,
no nor continewance of beeing. In the outward man we haue a
Counterfet of the whole world, and if ye rip them both vp by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celmeale,
ye shal find a woonderfull agreement betwixt them. But
my purpose in this booke is not to treate of the things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
peculiarly to the body.</p>
               <p>In the inward man wee haue a summe of whatsoeuer life sence
and mouing is in all creatures, and moreouer an Image or rather
a shadowe (for the Image is defaced by our sinne) of the Godhead
it selfe. And that is the thing which wee haue to examine in this
Chapter. In Plants, we perceyue that besides their bodies which
wee see, there is also an inward vertue which wee see not, whereby
they liue, growe, bud, and beare fruite: which vertue wee call the
quickening Soule, and it maketh them to differ from Stones and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13215:128"/>
Mettalles, which haue it not. In sensitiue liuing things, we finde
the selfesame vertue, which worketh while they sléepe &amp; are after a
sort as the Plants; and therewithall we finde another certeine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or power which seeth, heareth, smelleth, tasteth, and feeleth;
which also in many of them doth hoord vp the things brought in by
the sences; which maner of power the Plants are voyd of. This do
we terme the sensitiue Soule, because the effects thereof are discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and executed by the Sences.<note place="margin">In Man are three Abilitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Soule.</note> In man we haue both the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the Sensitiue, the former vttering it selfe in the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and increasing of him, and the later in the subtilitie of sence and
imagination, wherethrough he is both Plant and Beast together.
But yet moreouer wee see also a Mynd which considereth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth,
which reapeth profite of the things that are brought in by
the Sences, which by his séeing conceiueth that which it seeth not;
which of that which is not, gathereth that which is; &amp; finally which
pulleth a man away both from the earth &amp; from al sensible things,
yea and (after a sorte) from himself too. This doe we call the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Soule, and it is the thing that maketh man to bée man, (and
not a Plant or a brute Beast as the other two doe,) and also to bee
the Image or rather a shadowe of the Godhead, in that (as we shal
say hereafter) it is a Spirit that may haue continuance of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
by it selfe without the bodie. And by the way, whereas I say
that the inward man hath a quickening power as a Plant hath, a
sensitiue power as a Beast hath, and a power of vnderstanding
wherby he is a man: my meaning is not that he hath thrée Soules
but onely one Soule; that is to wit, that like as in the brute Beast
the sensitiue Soule comprehendeth the quickening Soule; so in
man the reasonable Soule comprehendeth both the sensitiue and
the quickening, and executeth the offices of them all thrée, so as it
both liueth, feeleth, and reasoneth euen as well and after the same
maner, as the mynd of a man may intend to his owne household<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters,
to the affayres of the Commonweale, and to heauenly
things all at once. Or to speake more fitly, these three degrees of
Soules are thrée degrées of life, whereof the second excéedeth and
conteyneth the first, and the third excéedeth and conteyneth both
the other two. The one, without the which the bodie cannot liue,
is the Soule or life of the Plant, and is so tyed to the bodie, that it
sheweth not it selfe in any wise out of it. The second, which cannot
liue without the bodie, is the Soule or life of the Beast; which doth
well vtter foorth his power and force abroad, but yet not otherwise
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13215:129"/>
than by the members and instruments of the bodie whereunto it
is tyed. The third, which can of it selfe liue and continue without
the bodie, but not the bodie without it, is the Soule of man, which
giueth life inwardly to all his parts, sheweth foorth his life abroad
in the perceyuing of all things subiect to Sence, and reteyneth still
his force (as shalbe sayd hereafter) yea and increaseth it, euen when
the strength of the bodie and the very liuelinesse of the sences fayle.
And in very déede, ye shall see a man forgoe all his sences one after
another as the instruments of them decay, and yet haue still both
life and reason vnappayred. The cause whereof is, that some of the
instruments of life and sence doe fayle, but the life it selfe which
quickeneth them fayleth not. And therefore the Beast forgoeth not
life in losing sence, but he vtterly forgoeth sence in forgoing life.
And that is because life is the ground of the abilities of sence, and
the sensitiue life is a more excellent life than the quickening life, as
wherein those powers and abilities are as in their roote. To bee
short, he that bereaueth man or beast of the vse of Sences, or man
of the right vse of reason, doth not thereby bereaue him of life; but
he that bereaueth the beast or the outward man of their life, doth
therewithall bereaue them of sence and reason. Therefore it is a
most sure argument, that the Soule which causeth a beast to liue,
and the Soule that causeth it to haue sence, are both one, that is to
wit, one certeyne kynd of life more liuely and more excellent than
the life that is in Plants. And likewise that the Soule which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
man to liue, to haue sence, and to reason, is but one, that is to
wit, one certeyne kynde of life more excellent, more liuely, and of
further reach, than the life of the Beast. But like as sence is as it
were the forme or Selfebeing (if I may so terme it) of the life of a
beast; so is reason or vnderstanding the very forme and Selfebeing
of the Soule of man; and (to speak properly) it is the Soule or life
of the Soule, like as the apple of our eye is the very eye of our eye.
And in very déede, when the mynd is earnestly occupied, the sences
are at a stay; and when the sences are ouerbusied, the nourishment
and digestion is hindered; and contrary wise: which thing could not
come to passe if the Soule were any mo than one substance, which
by reason that it is but one, cannot vtter his force alike in all places
at once, but yéeldeth the lesse care one where so long as it is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
occupyed anotherwhere. In this Soule of man (which yet
notwithstanding is but one) the diuersitie of the powers and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is very apparant. The quickning power doth nourish, increase
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13215:129"/>
and mainteyne vs; and Reason and Sence meddle not therewith,
neyther haue they power to impeach the working thereof. The
trueth whereof appeareth in this, that those things are best done
when our mynd is at rest, and our sences are asléepe; insomuch that
oftentymes we forgo the sence and mouing of some parts by some
Rhewme or some Palsey, and yet the same parts ceasse not to bee
nourished still. Also, the sensitiue life seeth and perceiueth a farre of,
yea oftentimes without setting of the mynd therevpon, or without
considering what the Sence conceyueth. Some men which haue
but weake Sences, haue very quicke vnderstanding; and likewise
on the contrary part. Agayne, some fall into a consumption, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant not the perfect vse of their Sences. Sometyme the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part is so earnestly bent and occupyed about the things that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
liketh of, that by the increasing of it self, it hurteth and diminisheth
the part that quickeneth. Also it standeth in argument against the
Sences, and reproueth them of falshoode, and concludeth contrary
to their information. And it may bee that the man which hath his
digestion perfect and his Sences sound, hath not his wit or reason
sound in like case. Now, were the Soule but onely one abilitie, it
could not be so. But now is the same diuided manifestly into wit or
vnderstanding, and will; the one seruing to deuise, and the other to
execute. For we vnderstand diuers things which we will not, and
wee will diuers things which wee vnderstand not: which contrary
operations cannot be attributed both to one power. Neuerthelesse,
the vniting of all these powers together is with such distinctnesse,
and the distinguishing of them is with such vnion, that ordinarily
they méete all together in one selfesame action, the one of them as
readily (by all likelyhood) as the other, howbeit that euery of them
doth his owne worke seuerally by himselfe, and one afore another
as in respect of their obiects.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we thrée sorts of men, according to the thrée powers
or abilities of the inwarde man. Namely the earthly man, which
like the Plant myndeth nothing but sléeping and féeding, making
al his sences and al his reason to serue to that purpose, as in whom
the eare of this present life onely, hath deuoured and swallowed vp
his sences and vnderstanding. The Sensuall man (as S. Paule
himself termeth him,) who is giuen wholly to these sensible things
imbacing and casting downe his reason so farre, as to make it a
bondslaue to his sences and the pleasures and delights therof: And
the reasonable man, who liueth properly in spirite and mynd, who
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13215:130"/>
entereth into himselfe to knowe himselfe, and goeth out of himselfe
to behold God; making this life to serue to the atteynment of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and vsing his Sences but as instruments and seruants of his
reason. After as any of these thrée powers doe reigne and beare
sway in man, that is to wit, after as a man yéeldeth himselfe more
to one tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another of them; so becommeth he like vnto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
the brute Beastes, or Plants, yea and the very Blockes and
Stones. But it is our disposition euen by leynd, to be caryed away
by our corrupt nature, and by the obiects which hemme vs in on all
sides; but as for against our nature yea or beyond our nature, our
nature is not able to doe any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Now, it is not enough for vs to knowe that wee haue a Soule
whereby wee liue, feele, and vnderstand, and which beeing but one
hath in it selfe alone so many sundrie powers or abilities: for it will
be demaunded of vs by and by what this Soule properly is. And
soothly if I should say, I cannot tell what it is, I should not belye
my selfe a whit; for I should but confesse myne owne ignorance, as
many great learned men haue done afore me. And I should doe no
wrong at all to the Soule it selfe; for sith wee cannot deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof, the lesse that we be able to declare the nature and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therof, the more doth the excellencie therof shine forth. Againe,
it is a playne case, that no thing can comprehend the thing that is
greater than it selfe. Now, our Soule is after a sort lesse than it
selfe, inasmuch as it is wrapped vp in this body, in like wise as the
man that hath gyues and fetters on his féete, is after a sort wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
than himselfe. Neuerthelesse, let vs assay to satiffye such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
as well as wee can. And forasmuch as it is the Image of
God, not only in respect of the gouernment and maintenance of the
whole world, but also euen in the very nature thereof: as wee sayd
heretofore when we spake of the nature of GOD, if we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
or conceyue what it is, let vs at leastwise be certified what it
is not. First of all, that the Soule and the Body be not both one
thing,<note place="margin">The Body and the Soule be not one self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing.</note> but two very farre differing things, and also that the Soule
is no part of the body, it appeareth of it self without further profe.
For if the Soule were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body or a part of the body, it should grow
with the body as the other parts of the body doe, and the greater
that the body were, the greater also should the Soule be. Nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise,
the body increaseth to a certeyne age and then stayeth;
after which age is commonly the tyme tha the Soule doth most
grow, and those that are strongest of mynd are commonly weakest
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13215:130"/>
of body, and the Soule is seene to be full of liuelinesse in a languis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g
body, and to growe the more in force, by the decay of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
The Soule then groweth not with the body, and therefore it
is not the body, nor any part of the body. And whereas I speake
of growing in the Soule, by growing I meane the profiting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in power and vertue, as the body groweth in greatnesse by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inlarging. Againe, if the Soule were the body, it should lose
her strength and soundnesse with the body, so as the maimed in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
should therewith feele also a mayme in his vnderstanding as
well as in his members: whosoeuer were sick of any disease, should
also bee sicke in his reason: he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in Soule also: the blynd mans Soule should bee blynd,
and the lame mans Soule should be lame. But we see co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise,
that the maymed and the sicke, the Cripples and the blynd, haue
their Soule whole and sound, and their vnderstanding perfect and
cléeresighted in it selfe. To be short, many a man dyeth whose body
is sound, and differeth not a whit in any part from that it was whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it was aliue, and yet notwithstanding, both life, mouing, sence, and
vnderstanding are out of it. Let vs say then that in the body there
was a thing which was not of the body, but was a farre other
thing than the body.</p>
               <p>Some wilfull person will obiect here, that the force and strength
of the Soule groweth with the body, as appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h in this that a
man growen wil remoue that which a child cannot, and that a child
of two yéeres old will goe, which thing a babe of two moneths old
cannot doe. But he should consider also, that if the selfesame man or
the selfesame child should haue a mischaunce in his legge or in his
arme, he should thereby forgoe the strength and mouing thereof,
whereas yet notwithstanding his Soule should haue her former
force and power still to moue the other as she did afore. Therefore
it is to be sayd, not that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childs Soule is growen or strengthened
by tyme; but rather that his sine wes are dried and hardened which
the soule vseth as strings and instruments too moue withall and
therefore when age hath loosened and weakened them, a man hath
neede of a staffe to help them with, although he haue as good a wil
to runne as he had when he was yoong. The soule then which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all at one becke, hath the selfsame power in infancie which
it hath in age, and the same in age which it hath in the prime of
Youth: and the fault is only in the instrument, which is vnable to
execute the operations thereof: like as the cunning of a Luteplaier
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13215:131"/>
is not diminished by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moystnesse or slacknesse of his Lute strings,
nor increased by the ouer high streyning and tytght standing of
them; but in deede in the one hee cannot shewe his cunning at all,
and in the other he may shewe it more or lesse. Likewise the spéech
of Children commeth with their teeth, howbeit that the speech doe
manifestly v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter it self first, in that they prattle many things which
they cannot pronounce: and in old men it goeth away agein with
their teeth, and yet their cloquence is not abated thereby. Asfor
<hi>Demosthenes,</hi> although hee surmounted all the Orators of his
tyme, yet were there some letters which he could not pronounce.
Giue vnto old age or vnto infancie the same sinewes and teeth,
and as able and lustye Limmes and members as youth hath; and
the actions which the soule doeth with the body and by the body, I
meane so farre foorth as concerne the abilities of sence and lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
shalbe performed as well in one age as in another. But had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou as greate indifferencie in iudging of the force and power
of thyne owne soule, as of the cunning of a Luteplayer, (I say not
by the nimblenes of his fingars which are perchaunce knotted
with the gout, but by the playne and sweete Harmonie of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatorie
as they terme it, which maketh thée to déeme him to haue
cunning in his head, although hee can no more vtter it with his
hanos,) so as thou wouldest consider how thou hast in thy selfe a
desire to go, though they féete be not able to beare the; a discretion
to iudge of things that are spoken; though thyne eyes cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
it vnto thee; a sound eloquence, though for want of thy teeth
thou cannot well expresse it; and which is aboue all the rest, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
quicke and heauenly reason, euen when thy body is most
earthly and drooping. Thou wouldest soone conclude that the force
and power of quickening, moouing, and perceyuing, is whole and
sound in thy Soule, and that the default is altogether in thy body.
Insomuch that if she had a newe body and new instruments giuen
vnto her, she would bee as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustie and chéerely as euer she was, and
that the more she perceyueth the body to decay, the more she labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to retyre into her self, which is a playne proofe of that she is not
the body nor any part of the body, but the very life and inworker of
the body.</p>
               <p>And sith it is so,<note place="margin">That the Soule is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> there néedeth no long skanning whether the
Soule be a substance or a qualitie. For, seeing that qualities haue
no being but in another thing than themselues; the life which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
another thing to be, cannot be a qualitie. Forasmuch then as
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13215:131"/>
the Soule maketh a man to be a man, who otherwise should be but
a Carkesse or Caryon: doubtlesse (vnlesse we will say that the only
difference which is betwixt a man and a dead Carkesse, is but in
accidents) we must néedes graunt that the Soule is a forming sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and a substantiall forme, yea and a most excellent substance
infinitly passing the outward man; as which by the power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
thereof causeth another thing to haue being, and perfecteth the
bodily substance which séemeth outwardly to haue so many perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But herevpon inseweth another controuersie, whether this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
bee a bodily or an vnbodily substance: which case requireth
somewhat longer examination. Soothly, if we consider the nature
of a body, it hath certeine measurings, and comprehendeth not any
thing which is not proportioned according to the greatnesse and
capacitie thereof. For, like as it selfe must bee fayne to haue a place
in another thing; so must other things occupye some certeyne place
in it; by reason whereof it commeth to passe, that things can haue
no place therein if they be greater than it, without anoying the one
the other. To be short, if the thing bee lesse than the body that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth
it, the whole body shall not conteyne it, but only some part
thereof: And if it be greater, then must some part thereof néedes be
out of it: for there is no measuring of bodies but by qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie. Now
we see how our Soule comprehendeth heauen and earth,<note place="margin">Bodilesse.</note> without
anoying eyther other; and likewise tyme past present and to come,
without troubling one another; and finally innumerable places,
persons, and Townes, without combering of our vnderstanding.
The great things are there in their full greatnesse, and the small
things in their vttermost smalnesse; both of them whole and sound,
in the Soule whole and sound, and not by parcelmeale or only but
in part of it. Moreouer, the fuller it is, the more it is able to receiue;
the moe things that are touched in it, the moe it still coueteth; and
the greater the things bee, the fitter is shee to receyue them euen
when they be at the greatest. It followeth therfore that the Soule
(which after a sort is infinite) cannot be body. And so much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lesse
can it so bee, for that whereas it harboreth so many and so great
things in it, it selfe is lodged in so small a body. Agayne, as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
diuers places are in the Soule or Mynde without occupying
any place; so is the Mynd in a thousand places without chaunging
of place; &amp; that erewhiles not by succession of tyme, nor by turnes,
but oftentymes altogether at one instant. Bid thy Soule or Mynd
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:13215:132"/>
goe to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and foorthwith to turne backe agayne to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and straight way to be at <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Lyons:</hi> Bid it passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
<hi>America,</hi> or to go about <hi>Affricke;</hi> and it dispatcheth all these
iourneys at a trice: looke whether soeuer thou directest it, there it is;
and or euer thou callest it backe, it is at home agayn. Now, is there
a body that can bee in diuers places at once, or that can passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remouing, or that can moue otherwise than in tyme, yea and in
such tyme as (within a little vnder or ouer) is proportioned both to
his pace, and to the length of the way which it hath to goe? Then
is it certeine that our Soule is not a bodily substance; which thing
appeareth so much the more plainly, in that being lodged in this
body which is so mouable, it remoueth not with the body. Also it
is a sure ground, that two bodies cannot mutually enter eyther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other, nor conteyne eyther other: but the greater must alway
néedes conteyne, and the lesser must néedes bee conteyned. But by
our Soules, we enter, not only eyther into others bodies, but also
eyther into others mynds, so as wee comprehend eyther other by
mutual vnderstanding, and imbrace either other by mutual louing.
It followeth then that this substance which is able to receiue a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse
thing, can bee no body; and that so much the rather, for that
the body which seemeth to hold it, conteyneth it not. Nay verely,
this Soule of ours is so farre of from being a bodily substance, and
is so manifestly a Spirit; that to lodge all things in it selfe, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them all after a sort spirituall, and bereueth them of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and if there were any bodylinesse in it, it were vnable to enter
into the knowledge of a bodie. So in a Glasse a thousand shapes
are seene: but if the cléere of the Glasse had any peculiar shape of it
owne, the Glasse could yéeld none of those shapes at all. Also all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
things are imprinted in the eye; but if the sight of the eye had
any peculiar colour of it owne, it would be a blemish to the sight, so
as it should eyther not see at all, or els all things should seeme like
to that blemish. Likewise, whereas the Tongue is the discerner of
all tastes; if it be not cléere but combered with humours, all things
are of tast like to the humour, so as if it be bitter, they also be bitter;
and if it be watrish, they be watrish too; yea and if it bee bitter, it can
not iudge of bitternesse it self. That a thing may receyue al shapes,
all colours, and all tastes; it behoueth the same to be cléere from all
shapes, from all colour, and from all sauour of it owne. And that a
thing may in vnderstanding knowe and conceiue all bodies, as our
Soule doth, it behoueth the same to bée altogether bodylesse it self;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13215:132"/>
for had it any bodylinesse at all, it could not receiue any body into
it. If wée looke yet more néerely into the nature of a body, wée shall
finde that no body receiueth into it the substantial forme of another
body, without losing or altering his owne, ne passeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one forme
into another, without the marring of the first; as is to bee seene in
wood when it receyueth fire, in seedes when they spring foorth into
bud, and so in other things. What is to be said then of mans soule,
which receiueth and conceyueth the formes and shapes of al things
without corrupting his owne, and moreouer becommeth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter
by the more receyuing? For the more it receyueth, the more
it vnderstandeth; and the more it vnderstandeth, the more perfect
is it.</p>
               <p>If it bee a bodily substance, from whence is it and of what mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
If it be of the fower Elements, how can thei giue life, hauing
no life of themselues? Or how can thei giue vnderstanding, hauing
no sence? If it bee of the mixture of them, how may it bee sayd that
of diuers things which haue no beeing of themselues, should bee
made a thing that hath being? Or that of diuers outsides should
bee made one body? or of diuers bodies, one Soule? or of diuers
deaths, one life? or of diuers darknesses, one light? Nay rather,
why say wee not that he which beyond nature hath made the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these bodies, hath for the perfecting of our body, breathed a
Soule also into the body? To be short, the propertie of a body is to
suffer, and the propertie of our Soule is to doe. And if the body bée
not put foorth by some other thing than it selfe, it is a very blocke;
wheras the mynd that is in our Soule ceasseth not to stirre vp and
downe in it selfe, though it haue nothing to moue it from without.
Therefore it is to bee concluded by these reasons and by the like,
that our Soule is a bodylesse substance, notwithstanding that it is
vnited to our body.</p>
               <p>And herevpon it followeth also,<note place="margin">Vnmateriall.</note> that our Soule is not any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
thing, forasmuch as matter receyueth not any forme or shape
but according to his owne quantitie, and but onely one forme at
once, whereas our Soule receyueth all formes without quantitie,
come there neuer so many at once or so great. Agayne, no matter
admitteth two contrary formes at once; but our Soule contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
comprehendeth and receyueth them together, as fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
heate and cold, white and blacke; and not only together, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the better by the matching and laying of them together. To bée
short, seeing that the more wee depart from matter, the more wée
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13215:133"/>
vnderstand; surely nothing is more contrary to the substance of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Soule, than is the nature of matter. Furthermore, if this reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Soule of ours is neither a bodily nor a materiall thing, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
vpon matter in the best actions therof: then must it néedes
be of it self, and not procéede eyther from body or from matter. For
what doth a body bring foorth but a body; and matter but matter;
and materiall but materialles? And therefore it is an vnmateriall
substance, which hath being of it selfe.</p>
               <p>But let vs see whether the same bee corruptible and mortall or

thereof. For he teacheth, that the doctrine of Gods prouidence, and
the immortalitie of our Soules are so linked together, that the one
is as an appendant to the other. And in very déed, to what purpose
were the World created, if there were no body to behold it? Or to
what ende behold wee the Creator in the world, but to serue him?
And why should wee serue him vppon no hope? And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
hath he indewed vs with these rare giftes of his, which for the
most part doe but put vs to payne and trouble in this life: if we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
like the brute Beast or the Hearbes, which knowe him not?
Howbeit, for the better satisfying of the sillie Soules which go on
still like witlesse Beastes, without taking so much leysure in all
their life, as once to enter into themselues; let vs indeuer héere by
liuely reasons to paynt out vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe their true shape, which
they labour to deface with so much filthinesse. The Soule of man
(as I haue sayd afore) is not a body, neyther doth it increase or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
with the body: but contrarywise the more the body decaieth,
the more doth the vnderstanding increase; and the néerer that the
body draweth vnto death, the more fréely doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynd vnderstand;
and the more that the body abateth in flesh, the more woorkfull is
the mynd. And why then should we think, that the thing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the stronger by the weakenesse of the body, and which is
aduaunced by the decay of the body, should returne to dust with the
body? A mans Sences fayle because his eyes fayle, and his eyes
fayle because the Spirits of them fayle: but the blynd mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
increaseth, because his eyes are not busied: and the olde
mans reason becommeth the more perfect by the losse of his sight.
Therfore why say we not that the body fayleth the Soule, and not
the Soule the body; and that the Glasses are out of the Spectacles
but the eysight is still good? Why should we déeme the Soule to
be forgone with the Sences? If the eye be the thing that séeth, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:13215:133"/>
the eare the thing that heareth; why doe wee not see things dubble,
and heare sounds dubble, seeing we haue two eyes and two eares?
It is the Soule then that seeth and heareth; and these which wee
take to be our sences, are but the instruments of our sences. And if
when our eyes bee shut or pickt out, wee then beholde a thousand
things in our mynd; yea and that our vnderstanding is then most
quicksighted, when the quickest of our eysight is as good as quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
or starke dead: how is it possible that the reasonable Soule
should bee tyed and bound to the sences? What a reason is it to say
that the Soule dyeth with the sences, séeing that the true sences do
then growe and increase, when the instruments of sence doe dye?
And what a thing were it, to say that a Beast is dead, because he
hath lost his eyes, when we our selues see that it liueth after it hath
forgone the eyes? Also I haue prooued that the Soule is neither
the body, nor an appertnance of the body. Sith it is so, why mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
we that thing by the body, which measureth al bodies; or make
that to dye with the body, whereby the bodies that dyed yea many
hundred yéeres agoe, doe after a certeine maner liue still? Or what
can hurt that thing, whom nothing hurteth or hindereth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
Though a man lose an arme, yet doth his Soule abide whole
still. Let him forgoe the one halfe of his body, yet is his Soule as
sound as afore: for it is whole in it selfe and whole in euery part of
it selfe, vnited in it felfe and in the owne substance, and by the force
and power thereof it sheadeth it selfe into all parts of the body.
Though the body rot away by péecemeale, yet abideth the Soule
all one and vndiminished. Let the blud dreyne out, the mouing wex
weake, the sences fayle, and the strength perish; and yet abideth the
mynd neuerthelesse sound and liuely euen to the ende. Her house
must bee pearced through on all sides, ere she bee discouraged; her
walles must be battered doune ere she fall to fléeting; and she neuer
forsaketh her lodging, till no roome be left her to lodge in. True it
is that the brute Beastes forgo both life and action with their blud.
But as for our Soule (if wee consider the matter well) it is then
gathered home into it self; and when our sences are quenched, then
doth it most of all labour to surmount it selfe: woorking as goodly
actions at the tyme that the body is at a poynt to fayle it, yea and
oftentymes farre goodlyer also, than euer it did during the whole
lifetyme thereof. As for example, it taketh order for it selfe, for our
houshold, for the Commonweale, and for a whole Kingdome; and
that with more vprightnesse, godlynesse, wisedome, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13215:134"/>
than euer it did afore, yea and perchance in a body so forspe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,
so bare, so consumed, so withered without and so putrified within,
that whosoeuer lookes vpon him sees nothing but earth, and yet to
heare him speake would rauish a man vp to heauen, yea and aboue
heauen. Now, when a man sees so liuely a Soule in so weake and
wretched a body, may he not say as is said of the hatching of Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
that the shell is broken, but there commeth forth a Chicken?</p>
               <p>Also let vs sée what is the ordinary cause that things perish. Fire
doth eyether goe out for want of nourishment, or is quenched by his
contrary which is water. Water is resolued into aire by fire, which
is his contrary. The cause why the Plant dyeth, is extremitie of
colde or drought, or vnseasonable cutting, or vyolent plucking vp.
Also the liuing wight dyeth through contrarietie of humours, or
for want of foode, or by feeding vpon some thing that is against the
nature of it, or by outward vyolence. Of all these causes, which can
we choose to haue any power against our Soule? I say against the
Soule of man, which (notwithstanding that it be vnited to matter
and to a bodie) is it selfe a substance vnbodily, vnmateriall, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceiuable in vnderstanding? The contrarietie of things? Nay,
what can be contrarie to that which lodgeth the contraries alike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
in himselfe? which vnderstandeth the one of them by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
which coucheth them all vnder one skill? and (to bee short) in
whom the contrarieties themselues abandon their contrarietie, so
as they doe not any more pursewe but insewe one another? Fire is
hote, and water cold. Our bodies mislike these contraries, and are
gréeued by them; but our mynd linketh them together without ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
burning or cooling it selfe; and it setteth the one of them against
the other to knowe them the better. The things which destroy one
another through the whole world, do mainteine one another in our
mynds. Againe, nothing is more contrary to peace then warre is;
and yet mans mynd can skill to make or mainteyne peace in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for warre, and to lay earnestly for warre in seeking or inioying
of peace. Euen death it selfe (which dispatcheth our life) cannot bée
contrary to the life of our Soule: for it seeketh life by death, and
death by life. And what can that thing méete withall in the whole
world, that may bee able to ouerthrowe it, which can inioyne obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to things most contrary? What then? Want of foode? How
can that want foode in the world, which can skill to feede on the
whole world? Or how should that forsake foode, which the fuller it
is, so much the hungryer it is; and the more it hath digested, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13215:134"/>
able it is to digest? The bodily wight feedeth vppon some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
things, but our mynd feedeth vpon all things. Take from it
the sensible things, and the things of vnderstanding abyde with it
still: bereaue it of earthly things, and the heauenly remayne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.
To be short, abridge it of all worldly things, yea and of the
world it selfe, and euen then doth it feede at greatest ease, &amp; maketh
best chéere agréeable to his owne nature. Also the bodily wight fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it selfe to a certeyne measure, and delighteth in some certeyne
things. But what can fill our mynd? Fill it as full as ye can with
the knowledge of things, and it is still eager and sharpe set to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
more. The more it taketh in, the more it still craueth: and yet
for al that, it neuer feeleth any rawnesse or lack of digestion. What
shall I say more? discharge our vnderstanding from the mynding
of it self, and then doth it liue in him and of him in whom all things
doe liue. Againe, fill it with the knowledge of it selfe, and then doth
it feele it self most emptie, and sharpest set vpon desire of the other.
Now then, can that dye or decay for want of foode, which cannot be
glutted with any thing, which is nourished and mainteyned with
all things, and which liueth in very déede vppon him by whom all
the things which we wonder at here beneath are vphild?</p>
               <p>And what els is vyolence, but a iustling of two bodies together?
and how can there be any such betwéene a bodie and a spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?
yea or of two spirits one against another, seeing that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
when they would destroye one another, they vphold one an
other? And if the Soule cannot be pushed at, neither inwardly nor
outwardly: is there any thing in nature that can naturally hurt it?
No: but it may perchaunce bee weakened by the very force of his
encounter, as wee see it doth befall to our sences. For the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and the more sensible the thing is in his kynd which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sence
receiueth, so much the more also is the sence it self offended or grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
therwith. As for example, the féeling, by fire; the taste, by harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
the smelling, by sauours; the hearing, by the hideousnesse of
noyse, whether it be of Thunderclappe or of the falling of a Riuer;
and the sight, by looking vpon the Sunne, vpon Fyre, and vpon all
things that haue a glistering brightnesse. I omit, that in the most
of these things, it is not properly the sence it selfe, but the outward
instrument of sence only that is offended or hurt. But let vs see if
there be the like in our reasonable Soule. Nay, contrarywise the
more of vnderstanding and excellencie that the thing is, the more
doth it refresh and comfort our mynd. If it bee darke so as wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13215:135"/>
it but by halues, it hurteth vs not; but yet doth it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
vs. Nay, as we increase in vnderstanding it, so doth it like vs
the better; and the higher it is, the more doth it stirre vp the power
of our vnderstanding, and (as ye would say) reache vs the hande
to drawe vs to the atteynement thereof. As for them that are dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted,
wee forbid them to behold the things that are ouerbright.
But as for them that are of rawest capacitie, wee offer them the
things that are most vnderstandable. When the sence beginneth to
perceyue most sharply, then is it fayne to giue ouer, as if it felt the
very death of it selfe. Contrarywise, when the mynd beginneth to
vnderstand, then is it most desirous to hold on still. And whereof
commeth that, but that our sences work by bodily instruments, but
our mynd worketh by a bodilesse substance which néedeth not the
helpe of the body. And seeing that the nature, the nourishment, and
the actions of our Soule are so farre differing, both from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nourishment, and actions of the body, and from al that euer is
done or wrought by the bodie: can there be any thing more childish
than to déeme our Soule to be mortal by the abating and decaying
of our sences, or by the mortalitie of our bodies? Nay contrariwise
it may be most soundly and substantially concluded therevpon, that
mans Soule is of it owne nature immortall, seeing that all death
as well vyolent as naturall commeth of the bodie and by the bodie.</p>
               <p>Let vs see further what death or corruption is.<note place="margin">What is death</note> It is (say they)
a separating of the matter from his forme. And forasmuch as in
man the Soule is considered to be the forme, and the bodie to be as
the matter: the separation of the Soule from the bodie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
called Death. Now then, what death can there bee of the Soule,
sith it is vnmaterial as I haue sayd afore, and a forme that abideth
of it selfe? For (as one sayth) a man may take away the roundnesse
or squarenesse from a table of Copper, because they haue no aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter: but had thei such a round or square forme, as
might haue an abyding without matter or stuffe wherein to be, out
of doubt such forme or shape should continue for euer. Nay (which
more is) how can that be the corrupter of a thing, which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thereof? The lesse corsinesse a man hath, the more hath he
of reason and vnderstanding. The lesse our mynds be tyed to these
bodily things, the more liuely and chéerefull be they. At a word, the
full and perfect life thereof, is the full and vtter withdrawing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
from the bodie and whatsoeuer the bodie is made of. All these
things are so cléere as they néede no proofe. Now, we knowe that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:13215:135"/>
euery thing worketh according to the proper being therof, and that
the same which perfecteth the operations of a thing, perfecteth the
being thereof also. It followeth therefore, that sith the separation
of the body from the Soule, and of the forme from the matter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
the operation or working of the Soule (as I haue sayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
it doth also make perfect and strengthen the very being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and therefore cannot in any wise corrupt it. And what els is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but to be corrupted? And what els is corrupting, but suffering?
And what els is suffering, but receyuing? And how can that which
receyueth all things without suffering, receyue corruption by any
thing? Fyre corrupteth or marreth our bodies, and we suffer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
it. So doth also extreme colde: but if wee suffered nothing
by it, it could not fréese vs. Our sences likewise are marred by the
excessiue force of the things which they light vpon. And that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they receyue and perceyue the thing that gréeueth them, and
for that the maner of their behauing of themselues towards their
obiects, is subiect to suffering. But as for the reasonable Soule,
which receiueth al things after one maner, that is to wit, by way of
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, wherethrough it alway worketh &amp; is neuer wrought
into; how is it possible for it to corrupt or marre it selfe?</p>
               <p>For what is the thing whereat our Soule suffereth aught in the
substance thereof, I meane whereby the substance of our Soule is
any whit impayred or hurt by mynding or conceyuing the same in
vnderstanding? As little doth the fire hurt it as the ayre, and the
ayre as the fire. As little hurt receiueth it by the frozen yce of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wey,</hi>
as by the scorching sands of <hi>Affricke.</hi> As little also doth vyce
anoye it as vertue. For vyce and vertue are so farre of from incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
the substance of the Soule, that our mynd doth neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
or vnderstand them better, than by setting them together one
against another. That thing therfore which doth no whit appayre
it selfe, but taketh the ground of perfecting it self by all things, can
not be marred or hurt by any thing.</p>
               <p>Agein, what is death? The vttermost poynt of mouing, and the
vttermost bound of this life. For euen in liuing we dye, and in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we liue, and there is not that step which we set downe in this
life, which dooth not continewally step foreward vnto death, after
the maner of a Dyall or a Clocke, which mounting vp by certeine
degrées forgoeth his mouing in mouing from Minute to Minute.
Take away mouing from a body, and it doth no more liue. Now
let vs sée if the soule also be caryed with the same mouing. If it be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13215:136"/>
caryed with the same mouing, then doth it vndoutedly moue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall.
Nay, contrariwise, whether the mynd rest, or whether it be
buzyed about the proper operations thereof, it is not perceiued
eyther by any panting of hart, or by any beating of pulses, or by any
breathing of Lungs. It is then as a Shippe that carieth vs away
with it, whether we walke or sit still; the stickingfast whereof or
the tying thereof to a poste, hindereth not our going vp and downe
in it still. Ageine, if the Soule be subiect to the finall corruption of
the body, then is it subiect to the alterations thereof also; and if it
be subiect to the alterations, it is subiect to tyme also. For altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or chaunges, are spices, or rather consequents of mouing, and
moouings are not made but in tyme. Now man in respect of the
body hath certeine full poynts or stoppes, at the which he receiueth
manifest chaunges, and thereafter groweth or decayeth. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
where the decay of the body beginneth, there beginneth the
cheef strength of the mynd! Houbeit that in some men, not only
their chinnes are couered with downe, but also their beards become
gray, whose minds for want of exercise, shewe no signe at all either
of rypenesse or growing. Moreouer, time (as in respect of the body)
cannot be called ageyne, but in respect of the mynd it is alwayes
present. Yea and tyme perfecteth, accomplisheth, and increaseth our
mynd, and after a sort reneweth and refressheth it from day to day,
whereas contrarywise it forweareth, wassheth away and quight
consumeth, both it self, and the body with the life thereof. It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
then that the reasonable Soule is not subiect to time, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to any of the chaunges and corruptions that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
tyme. Nay we may say thus much more; That nothing in the
whole World is nurrished with things better than itself; neither
dooth any of them conteyne greater things than itself; But the
things that are corruptible do liue of corruptible things, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
liue without corrupting them: as for example, beasts liue by
herbes, men by beasts, and sofoorth. And therefore things which
liue by vncorruptible things, and can so receiue and digest them, as
to turne them into the nurrishment of their nature, and yet not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
them; are vncorruptible them selues to. Now the Soule of
man, I meane the reasonable soule or mynd, conceiueth reason and
trueth, and is fed and strengthened with them. And reason &amp; trueth
are things vnchaungeable, not subiect to tyme, place or alteration,
but stedye, vnchaungeable, and euerlasting. For that twice two be
fower, and that there is the same reason in the proportion of eight
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13215:136"/>
vnto six that is of fower vnto three, or that in a Tryangle, the three
inner angles are equall with the too ryght angles; and such like;
are truethes which neither yeeres nor thousands of yeeres can
change; as true at this day, as they were when <hi>Euclyde</hi> first spake
them. And so foorth of other things. It followeth then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Soule
comprehending reason and trueth, which are things free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
cannot in any wyse be subiect to corruption.</p>
               <p>Agein, who is he of all men that desireth not to be immortall?
And how could any man desire it, if he vnderstoode not what it is?
Or how could he be able to vnderstand it, vnlesse it were possible
for him to atteyne vnto it? Surely none of vs coueteth to be begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglesse,
for none of vs is so; neither can any of vs be so. And as we
cannot so be, so also can we not comprehend what it is. For who is
he that is not at his witts end, but only to think vppon eternitie
without beginning? On the contrarie part there is not so bace a
mynd which coueteth not to liue for euer; insomuch that wheras
we looke not for it by nature, we seeke to obteyne it by skill and
pollicie, some by bookes, some by Images, and some by other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices;
and euen the grossest sort can well imagine in themselues
what immortalitie is, and are able both to conceyue it and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it. Whence comes this, but that our soules beeing created
cannot conceiue an euerlastingnesse without beginning, and yet
neuerthelesse, that forasmuch as they be created immortal, they doe
wel conceiue an immortalitie or euerlastingnes without end? And
whereto serues this vniuersall desire, if it be not naturall? or how
is it naturall if it be in vaine? and not onely in vayne, but also too
bring vs to Hell and to Torment? Let vs wade yet déeper. Who
can dispute or once so much as doubt whether the Soule bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
or no, but he that is capable of immortalitie? And who can
vnderstand what difference is betwixt mortall and immortall, but
hee that is immortall? Man is able to discerne the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
that which is reason, and that which is not, and therevpon
wee terme him reasonable. Whosoeuer would hold opinion that a
man is not reafonable, should neede none other disproofe than his
owne disputing thereof; for he would go about to proue it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Man can skill to discerne the mortall natures from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
And therefore we may well say he is immortall. For hee
that should dispute to the contrarie, shalbe driuen to bring such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as shall of themselues make him to prooue himselfe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
Thou sayest the Soule can not be immortall: and why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

(sayest thou (that to be so, it would behoue it to woorke seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

consider what thy body dooth at the same tyme. Nay yet further,
who hath taught thee so much of the immortall nature, if thou thy

inwoorking of a reasonable wight is, but the wight which in it selfe
hath the vse of reason?</p>
               <p>Yet sayest thou still, if the Soule be immortall, it is frée from
such and such passions. How enterest thou so farre into the Nature
that is so farre aboue thée, if thou thy selfe beest mortall? All the
reasons which thou alledgest against the immortalitie of the soule,
doe feight directly to the proofe of it. For if thy reason mounted no
higher than to the things that are mortall, thou shouldest knowe
neither mortall nor immortall. Now it is not some one couetous
man aboue all other, that desireth immortalitie, nor some one man
excelling all others in wisdome, that comprehendeth it, but al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
without exception. It is not then some one seuerall skill or
some one naturall propertie, that maketh such difference betwéene
man and man as we sée to be betwéene many, but rather one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same

too ouerliue themselues, ne know how to liue, &amp; therefore their
Lyues doe vanish away with their bloud, and is extinguished with
their bodies. If euer thou hast looked to dye, consider what discourse
thou madest then in thy mynd: thou couldest neuer perswade thy
conscience nor make thy reason to conceiue, that thy Soule should
dye with the Body; but euen in the selfesame tyme when it dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ageinst it selfe, it shifteth it self I wote not how from all thy
conclusions, and falleth too consider in what state it shall bee, and
where it shal become when it is out of the body. The Epicure that
hath disputed of it all his lyfe long, when he commeth to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatheth
a yerely pension for the keeping of a yéerely feast on the
day of his birth. I pray you to what purpose serue feastings for the
birth of a Swyne, séeing he estéemeth himselfe to be no better than
so? Nay what els is this, than a crying out of his Nature against
him, which with one word confuteth all his vaine arguments? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

opinion of immortalitie; and bicause he hath liued wickedly in this

that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward man there are (as ye would say) thrée men;
the liuing, the sensitiue, and the reasonable. Let vs say therefore
that in the same person there are thrée liues continued from one to
another: namely, the life of the Plant, the life of the Beast, and the
life of the Man or of the Soule. So long as a man is in his moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wombe, he doth but only liue and growe; his Spirit seemeth
to sléepe, and his sences seeme to bee in a slumber, so as he seemeth
to bee no thing els than a Plant. Neuerthelesse, if ye consider his
eyes, his eares, his tongue, his sences, and his mouings, you will
easely iudge that he is not made to be for euer in that prison where
he neither seeth nor heareth, nor hath any roome to walke in, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he is made to come forth into an opener place, where he
may haue what to see and behold, and wherewith to occupye al the
powers which wee see to bee in him. As soone as he is come out, he
beginneth to see, to féele, and to moue, and by little and little falleth
to the perfect vsing of his limbes, and findeth in this world a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
obiect for euery of them, as visible things for the eye, sounds
for his hearing, bodily things for his feeling, and so forth. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, we finde there a mynd; which by the eyes as by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13215:138"/>
beholdeth the world, and yet in al the world finding not any
one thing woorthy to rest wholly vppon, mounteth vp to him that
made it; which mynd like an Empresse lodgeth in the whole world,
and not alonly in this body; which by the sences (and oftentymes
also without the sences) mounteth aboue the sences, and streyneth
it self to goe out of it selfe, as a child doth to get out of his mothers
wombe. And therefore wee ought surely to say, that this Mynd or
Reason ought not to bee euer in prison. That one day it shall see
cléerely, and not by these dimme and clowdie spectacles: That it
shall come in place where it shall haue the true obiect of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
and that he shall haue his life free from these fetters and from
all the affections of the body. To be short, that as man is prepared
in his moothers wombe to be brought foorth into the world; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o is he
also after a sort prepared in this body and in this world, to liue in
another world. We then vnderstand it, when by nature it behoueth
vs to depart out of the world. And what child is there which (if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did not by her cunning driue him out,) would of himself come
out of his Couert, or that commeth not out as good as forlorne and
halfe dead; or that if he had at that tyme knowledge &amp; spéech, would
not call that death, which we call birth; and that a departure out of
life, which we call the enterance into it? As long as we be there, we
see nothing though our eyes be open. Many also doe not so much
as stirre, except it bee at some sodaine scaring or some other like
chaunce; and as for those that stirre, they knowe not that they haue
eyther sence or mouing. Why then should wee thinke it straunge,
that in this life our vnderstanding seeth so little, that many men do
neuer mynd the immortall nature, vntill they be at the last cast, yea
and some thinke not themselues to haue any such thing, howbeit
that euen by so thinking they shew themselues to haue part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
And imagine wee that the vnborne babe hath not as much adoe
by nature to leaue the poore skinne that he is wrapt in, as we haue
hinderance in our sences and in our imprisoned reason, when we be
at the poynt to leaue the goods and pleasures of this world, and the
very flesh it selfe which holdeth vs as in a graue? Or had the babe
some little knowledge; would he not say that no life were compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the life where he then is, as we say there is no life to the life
of this world wherein we be? Or would he not account the stage of
our sences for a fable, as a great sort of vs account the stage that is
prepared for our Soules? Yes surely: and therfore let vs conclude
where wee began, namely that man is both inward and outward.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13215:138"/>
In the outward man, which is the bodie, he resembleth the béeing
and the proportion of all the parts of the world. And in the inner
man he resembleth whatsoeuer ky<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd of life is in all things or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that beareth life in the world. In his moothers wombe he
liueth the life of a Plant, howbeit with this further, that he hath a
certeyne commencement of sence and moouing which excéede the
Plant, and doe put him in a readynesse to be indewed with Sences
as a Beast is. In this life he hath sence and mouing in their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> propertie of a sensitiue wight; but yet besides these,
he hath also a beginning to reason and vnderstand, which are a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of another life such as the sensitiue wight hath not, &amp; this
life is to be perfected in another place. In the life to come he hath
his actions free and full perfected, a large ground to worke vppon
able to suffise him to the full, and a light to his vnderstanding in
stead of a light to the eye. And like as in comming into this world,
he came as it were out of another world; so in going yet into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world he must also goe out of this world. He commeth out of
the first world into the second, as it were fayling in nourishment,
but growing in strength vnto mouing and sence: and he goeth out
of the second into the third, fayling in sences and mouing, but gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
in reason and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. Now, seeing we call the passage
out of the first world into the second a birth, what reason is it that
we should call the passage out of the second into the third, a death?
To be short, he that considereth how all the actions of mans mynd
tend to the tyme to come, without possibilitie of staying vppon the
present time, how pleasant and delightful soeuer it be: we may well
discerne by them all, that his being (which in euery thing (as sayth
<hi>Aristotle</hi>) followeth the working thereof) is also wholly bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the tyme to come; as who would say this present life were
vnto it but as a narrowe grindle, on the further side whereof (as it
were on the banke of some streame or running water,) he were to
finde his true dwelling place and very home in déede.</p>
               <p>But now is it tyme to sée what is sayd to the contrarie:<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we haue to consider eftsoones that which we spake of afore; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that if all that euer is in vs were transitorie and mortall, wee
should not be so witty to examine the Immortalitie as we be: for
of Contraries the skill is all one. If a man were not mortall, that
is to say, if he had no lyfe, he could not dispute of the mortall lyfe;
neither could he speake of the Immortal, if he himself also were not
Immortall. Therefore let vs goe backe retryue. Some man will
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13215:139"/>
say, that the Soule dyeth with the body, bycause the Soule and
the body are but one thing, and he beléeueth that they be both but
one, bycause he seeth no more but the body. This argument is all
one with theirs, which denyed that there is any God, bycause they
sawe him not. But yet by his dooings thou mayst perceyue that
there is a God: discerne lykewise by the dooings of thy soule, that
thou haste a Soule. For in a dead body thou seest the same partes
remayne, but thou séest not the same dooings that were in it afore.
When a man is dead, his eye seeth nothing at all, and yet is there
nothing chaunged of his eye: but whyle hee is aliue it séeth infinite
things that are dyuers. The power then which séeth is not of the
body. Yet notwithstanding how lyuely and quickesighted so euer
the eye be; it séeth not it self. Woonder not therefore though thou
haue a soule, and that the same soule sée not it self. For if thyne ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
sawe itself; it were not a power or abilitie of séeing, but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
thing: lykewise if thy Soule sawe itself, it were no more a
Soule that is to say the woorker and quickener of the body, but a
verie body, vnable to do any thing of it self, and a massie substance
subiect to suffering. For we sée nothing but the body and bodily
substances. But in this thou perceiuest somewhat els than a body,
(as I haue sayd afore) that if thyne eye had any peculiar colour of
it owne, it could not discerne any other colour than that. Seeing
then that thou conceyuest so many dyuers bodies at once in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
néeds must thou haue a power in thee which is not a body.
Be it (say they) that we haue a power of sence; yet haue we not a
power of reason; for that which we call the power of reason or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
is nothing but an excellencie or rather a consequence
of sence, insomuch that when sence dyeth, the residew dyeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
also. Soothely in this which thou haste sayd, thou haste sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
sence; which thing thou haddest not done, if thou haddest
nothing in thee beyond sence. For whereas thou sayest, if the sence
dye, the rest dyeth also; it is a reason that proceedeth from one
terme to another, and it is a gathering of reasons which conclude
one thing by another. Now the sences do in deede perceyue their
obiects, but yet how lyuely so euer they be, they reason not. We sée
a Smoake; so farre extendeth the sence. But if we inferre, therefore
there must needes be fire, and thereupon seeke who was the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
thereof: that surmounteth the abilitie of sence. We here a péece
of Musicke; that may any beast do as well as we. But his hearing
of it is but as of a bare sound; whereas our hearing therof is as of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13215:139"/>
an harmony, and we discerne the cause of the concords and discords,
which either delight or offend our sence. The thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heareth the
sound is the sence; but the thing that iudgeth of that which the sence
conceyueth, is another thing than the sence. The lyke is to be sayd
of smelling, tasting, and feeling. Our smelling of sents, our tasting
of sauours, and our feeling of substances, is in déede the woorke of
our Sences. But as for our iudging of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing
by the outward sent thereof, or of the wholsomnes or vnwholsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of foode by the taste thereof, or of the whotnesse or vehemencie
of a feuer by feeling the pulse; yea and our procéeding euen into the
very bowels of a man, whether the eye beeing the quickest of all
sences is not able to atteyne; surely it is the woorke of a more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
power than the sence is. And in verie déede there are beasts
which do here, see, smell, taste, and feele much better and quicklyer
than man doth. Yet notwithstanding none of them conferreth the
contraries of colors, sounds, sents and sauours; none sorteth them
out to the seruing one of another, or to the seruing of themselues.
Whereby it appeareth, that man excelleth the Beasts by another
power than the Sences; and that whereas a man is a Peynter, a
Musician, or a Phisition; he hath it from elswhere than from his
sences. Nay, I say further, that oftentymes we conclude cleane
contrarie to the report of our sences. Our eye perchauce telleth vs
that a Tower which we see afarre of is round, whereas our reason
deemeth it to be square: or that a thing is small, which our reason
telleth vs is greate: or that the ends of lyues in a long walke do
meete in a poynt, whereas our reason certifieth vs that they runne
ryghtfoorth with equall distance one from another. For want of
this discretion, certeine Elephants (sayth <hi>Vitellio</hi>) which were
passing ouer a long bridge, turned backe beeing deceyued; and yet
they wanted not sight no more than we do. But they that led them
were not deceyued. Their Leaders then besides their eysight, had
in them another vertue or power which corrected their sight, and
therefore ought to be of hygher estimation. In lyke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase is it with
the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other sences. For our hearing telleth vs that the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclappe
is after the lyghtening; but skill assureth vs that they be
both togither. For there is a certeine power in vs, which can skil
to discerne what proportion is betweene hearing and seeing. Also
the tong of him that hath an Agew, beareth him on hand that euen
sugre is bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

To be short, those which haue their sences most quicke and ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ely,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13215:140"/>
be not of the greatest wisdum and vnderstanding. A man therefore
differeth from a beast, and excelleth men by some other power than
sence. For whereas it is comonly sayd, that such as haue séene most
are comonly of greatest skill: we see that many haue traueled farre
both by sea and land, which haue come home as wise as they went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth.
A horse hath as good eyes as he that rydes vpon him, and
yet for all his traueling, neither he nor paraduenture his Ryder
whom he beareth become any whit the wyser by that which they
haue seene: whereby it appereth that it is not enough to see things
vnlesse a man do also mynd them to his benefite.</p>
               <p>Now there is great difference betweene the lyuelynes of the
Sence, and the power that gouerneth the Sence; lyke as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a Spye is one thing, and the Spye himself is another, and
the wisdum of the Capteine that receyueth the report of the Spye
is a third. Nay, who can deny, that Sence and Reason are dyuers
things; or rather who wilnot graunt, that in many things they be
cleane contrarie? Sence biddeth vs shun and eschew greef; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Reason willeth vs to profer our leg sometyme to the Surgion
to be cut of. Sence plucketh our hand out of the fire, and yet we our
selues put fire to our bare skin. He that should sée a <hi>Sceuola</hi> burne
of his owne hand, without so much as once gnashing his téeth at it,
would thinke he were vtterly senslesse: so mightily dooth Reason
ouerrule sence. To be short, Sence hath his peculiar inclination,
which is appetite; and Reason lykewyse hath his, which is will.
And lyke as reason doth oftentymes ouerrule sence and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to it; so will correcteth the sensuall appetyte or lust that is in vs,
and warreth ageinst it. For in an Agew we couet to drink, and in
an Apoplexie we couet to sleepe, and in hungre we couet to eate:
and yet from all those things doth our will restreyne vs. The more
a man followeth his lust, the lesse is he led by will: and the more he
standeth vpon the pleasing of his Sences, the lesse reason vseth he
ordinarily.</p>
               <p>Againe, let vs consider the brute Beastes which haue this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue
part as well as we. If we haue no more than that, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it to passe that a little child driueth whole flockes and heards
of them whether he listeth, and sometymes whether they would
not? Whereof commeth it that euery of them in their kynd, doe all
liue, nestle, and sing after one sorte; whereas men haue their lawes.
Commonweales, maners of buylding, and formes of reasoning,
not only diuers, but also commonly contrary? Now, what can har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13215:140"/>
these contrarieties together, but onely that which hath not any
thing contrary vnto it, and wherein all contrary things doe lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their contrarietie? Surely it is not the Sence that can doe it,
whose proper or peculiar obiect is most contrary to the sence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this (as I haue sayd afore) whereas we conceyue wisedome,
skill, vertue, and such other things which are all bodilesse, our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
haue none other thing to worke vpon, than the qualities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
substances: And whereas we make vniuersall rules of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
things; the Sences atteyne no further than to the particular
things themselues: And wheras we conclude of the causes by their
effects; our Sences perceyue no more but the bare effects: And
whereas concerning the things that belong to vnderstanding, the
more vnderstandable they bee, the more they refresh vs; Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the stronger that the sensible things are, the more do they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Sence: To be short, the selfesame thing which wee speake
in behalfe of the Sences, procéedeth from elswhere than from the
Sences. And we will easely discerne, that he which denyeth that
besides the common Sence there is in man a reason or vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
distinct and seuered from the Sence, is voyd both of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and of Sence.</p>
               <p>But see here a grosse reason of theirs. This reason or power of
vnderstanding (say they) which is in man, is corruptible as well as
the power of perceyuing by the Sences. I thinke I haue prooued
the contrary alreadie; neuerthelesse, let vs examine their reasons
yet further. The forme or shape of euery thing (say they) doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
with the matter. Now, the Soule is as ye would say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme
or shape of the body: therfore it corrupteth with the body. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
were rightly concluded, if it were ment of the materiall
forme. But I haue proued that the Soule is vnmateriall, and hath
a continuance of it selfe. And in déede the more it is discharged of
matter, the more it reteyneth his owne peculiar forme. Therefore
the corrupting of the matter toucheth not the Soule at all. Again,
if mens Soules liue (say they) after their bodies, then are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
for the world is without beginning and without ending, and
(as wee knowe) nature can away with no infinite thing: therefore
they liue not after their bodies. Yes say I; for I haue proued that
the world had a beginning, and that with so substantiall reasons,
as thou art not able to disproue. Therefore it followeth that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
which thou alledgest can haue no place. Another saith,
If dead mens Soules liue still, why come they not to tell vs so?
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13215:141"/>
And he thinketh he hath stumbled vpon a woonderful suttle deuise.
But how doth this followe in reason? There hath not come any
man vnto vs from the Indies of a long tyme: ergo there be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
May not the same argument serue as well to proue that wee
our selues are not, because wee neuer went thether? Againe, what
intercourse is there betwéene things that haue bodies, and things
that haue no bodies; or betwene heauen and earth, considering that
there is so small intercourse euen betwéene men, which liue all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one selfsame Sunne? He that is made a Magistrate in his own
Countrey, doth not willingly returne to the place of his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Likewise the Soule that is lodged in the lappe of his God,
and come home into his natiue soyle, forgoeth the desire of these lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
things, which to his sight beholding them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, are lesse
than the point of a Néedle. On the other side, he that is put in close
prison, (how desirous soeuer he bee) cannot goe out; so the Soule
which is in the Iayle of his souereine Lord God, hath no respit or
sportingtyme to come tell vs what is done there. Unto the one,
the beholding of the Euerlasting God is as a Paradize wherein he
is wiling to remayne; and vnto the other, his owne condemnation
is an imprisonment of his will. But we would haue God to sende
both the one and the other vnto vs to make vs to beléeue. As who
would say, it stoode him greatly on hand to haue vs to beléeue, and
not rather vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should beléeue. And in effect what els is al this,
but a desiring y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some man might returne into his mothers wombe
againe, to incourage young babes against the pinches and paines
which they abide in the birth, whereof they would be as shye as we
bee of death, if they had the like knowledge of them? But let vs
let such vanities passe, and come to the ground.</p>
               <p>Yee beare vs on hand (say they) that the Soule of man is but
one, though it haue dyuers powers. Whereof we see the sensitiue
and the growing powers to be corrupted and to perish: therefore
it should seeme that the vnderstanding or reasonable power also
should do the lyke. At a woord, this is al one as if a man should say,
you tell mee that this man is both a good man, a good Swoord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player,
aud a good Luteplayer altogither; &amp; that bycause his swoord
falls out of his hand, or his hand itself becommeth Lame, therefor
he cannot be a good or honest man still as you reported him to bee.
Nay though he lose those instruments, yet ceasseth he not therefor
to bee an honest man, yea and both a Swoordplayer and a Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player
to, as in respect of skill. Lykewyse when our Soules haue
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13215:141"/>
forgone these exercises, yet ceasse they not to be the same they were
afore. To inlyghten this poynt yet more; of the powers of our
Soule, some are exercysed by the instruments of the bodie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome
without any help or furtherance of the bodie atall. Those
which are exercysed by the bodie, are the sences and the powers of
the Sences and the powers of the growing, which may carye the
same likenesse that is betweene a Luter and a Lute. Breake the
Luters Lute, and his cunning remayneth still, but his putting of
it in practise faileth. Giue him another Lute, and he falles to play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
newe againe. Put out a mans eyes, and yet the abilitie of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abydeth still with him, though the very act of seeing bée disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted.
But giue vnto the oldest Hag that is the same eyes that
he had when he was young, and he shall see as well as euer he did.
After the same maner is it with the growing or thriuing power.
Restore vnto it a good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> stomacke, a sound Liuer, and a perfect heate;
and it shall execute his functions as well as euer it did afore. The
power that worketh of it selfe and without the body, is the power
of reason or vnderstanding, which if we wil we may call the mynd.
And if thou yet still doubt thereof, consider when thou myndest a
thing earnestly what thy body furthereth thy mynd therein; &amp; thou
shalt perceyue that the more fixedly thou thinkest vpon it, the lesse
thou seest the things before thée; and the more thy mynd wandreth,
the more thy body resteth: as who would say that the workings of
the body, are the greatest hinderance and impediment that can bée
to the peculiar doings of the mynd. And this abilitie of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
may bee lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ned to a man, which though he haue lost both his
hand and his Lute, ceasseth not therefore to bee a man still, and to
doe the true déedes of a man, that is to wit, to discourse of things,
to mynd them, to vse reason and such like; yea and to be both a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a man as he was afore, notwithstanding that he cannot put
his Luteplaying in exercise for want of instruments. Nay, (which
more is) this vnderstanding part groweth so much the stronger
and greater, as it is lesse occupyed and busied about these bace and
corruptible things, &amp; is altogether drawen home wholly to it selfe;
as is to be seene in those which want their eyes, whose mynds are
commonly most apt to vnderstand, and most firme to remember.
Doe we debate of a thing in our selues? Neither our body nor our
Sences are busied about it. Doe wee will the same? As little doe
they stirre for that too. To vnderstand and to will (which are the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of the mynd,) the Soule hath no néede of the bodie; and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13215:142"/>
as for working and being, they accompany one another sayth <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.</hi>
Therefore to continue still in being, the Soule hath not to
doe with the body, nor any néede of the body: but rather, to woorke
well and to be well, the Soule ought eyther to be without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
or at leastwise to be vtterly vnsubiect to the bodie.</p>
               <p>Yea (say they) but yet we see men forgoe their reason, as fooles
and mealancholike persons: and seeing it is forgone, it may also bée
corrupted; and if corrupted, it may also dye: for what is death but
an vtter and full corruptnesse? Nay, thou shouldest say rather, I
haue seene diuers which hauing seemed to haue lost their right
wittes, haue recouered them againe by good dyet and medicinable
drinkes. But had they bene vtterly lost and forgone, no Phisicke
could haue restored them agayne: and had they bene vtterly peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
the parties themselues should haue had neither sence nor life
remayning. Therefore of necessitie the sould of them was as sound
as afore. But our Soules wee see not otherwise than by the bodie
and by the instruments of the bodie as it were by Spectacles; and
our mynd which beholdeth and seeth through his imaginations as
it were through a Clowde, is after a sort trubbled by the dimining
of the Spectacles and by the smoakinesse of the imaginations. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that maner the Sunne seemeth to be dimmed and eclipsed; and
that is but by the comming of the Moone or of some Clowdes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
him and vs; for in his light there is no abatement at all.
Likewise our eysight conceyueth things according to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
wherethrough it looketh, or according to the colour that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwarteth
the things which it looketh vpon. Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> away the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
and our eyes shall see cléere: purge away the humours,
and our imagination shall bee pure: and so our vnderstanding shall
see as bright as it did afore, euen as the Sunne shineth after the
putting away of the Clowdes. And it fareth not with our Soules
as it doth with our bodies, which after a long sicknesse reteyne still
eyther a hardnesse of the Splene, or a shortnesse of breath, or a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Rhewme vppon the Lungs, or a skarre of some great
wound that cannot bee worne out because of the breake that was
made in the whole. For neither in their vnderstanding, neither in
their willes do our Soules feele any abatement, sauing that there
abydeth some mayme or blemish in the instruments; to wit (as I
will declare hereafter) so farre foorth as it pleaseth GOD for a iust
punishment, to put the Soule in subiection to the bodie whose so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereyne
it was created to haue bene, because it hath neglected the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13215:142"/>
will of the Creator, to followe the lustes and lykings of the bodie.
This appeareth in Lunaticke folkes and such others, which haue
their wittes troubled at tymes and by fittes. For they be not vexed
but at the stirring of their humours, beeing at other tymes sober
and well enough stayed in their wittes. The like is seene in them
that haue the falling sicknesse. For their vnderstanding seemeth to
be eclipsed, and as it were striken with a Thunderclap, during the
tyme of their fittes; but afterward they bée as discréete as though
they ayled nothing. To bee short, the body is subiect to a thousand
diseases, wherewith wée see the vnderstanding to bee no whit alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
because they touch not the instruments of the Sences and of
the Imaginations, which moue the vnderstanding. Troubled it is
in déede by those fewe things only, which infect the Sence and the
Imagination, which by that meanes report the things vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whereon the mynd debateth. Therfore ye shall neuer see any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
out of his wittes or out of his right mynd, in whom the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may not manifestly perceyue, eyther some default of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
as a mishapen and misproportioned head; or els an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerabounding
of some melancholike humour, that troubled and
marred his bodie afore it troubled or impayred his mynd. And like
as the wisest men being deceyued by false Spyes, do make worng
deliberations, howbeit yet grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good reason, which thing
they could not doe vnlesse they were wise in déede: So the reason
that is in our mynd maketh false discourses, and gathereth wrong
conclusions, vppon the false reports of the imaginations; which it
could not doe, if it were eyther diminished or impayred, or done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Whereunto accordeth this auncient saying, <hi>That there bee
certeyne follyes which none but wise men can commit, and
certeyne Errors which none but learned men can fall into:
because that in some cases, discretion and wisedome are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
in the partie that is to be deceyued, euen to the intent he
may bee deceyued; and learning is required in a man that he
may conceyue and hold a wrong opinion.</hi> As for example, to
be beguyled by a dubbledealing Spy or by the surprising of a cose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
letter, belongeth to none but to a wise man. For a grosheaded
foole neuer breaketh his brayne about such matters as might bring
him to the making of false conclusions by mistaking likelyhoods in
stead of truth. Likewise to fall into Heresie by misconceyuing some
high and déepe poynt, befalleth not to an ignorant person; for he is
not of capacitie, neyther doth his vnderstanding mount so high.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13215:143"/>
To be short, whosoeuer sayth that mans Soule perisheth with the
bodie, because it is troubled by the distemperature or mispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionatenesse
of the bodie; may as well vphold that the Child in the
moothers wombe dyeth with his moother, because he moueth with
her, and is partaker with her of her harmes and throwes, by reason
of the streyt coniunction that is betwéene them; howbeit that many
children haue liued safe and sound, notwithstanding that their moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue dyed; yea and some haue come into the world euen by
the death of their moothers.</p>
               <p>And whereas some say, that because our mynd conceyueth not
any thing here, but by helpe of Imagination; therfore when the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
is gone with the instruments whereunto it is tyed, the
Soule cannot worke alone by it self, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently be alone by it
selfe: surely it is al one as if they should say, that because the Child
being in his moothers wombe taketh nourishment of her blud by
his nauill; therfore he cannot liue whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is come out of her womb,
if his nauillstrings be cut off. Nay contrarywise, then is the tyme
that the mouth, the tongue, and the other parts of the Childe doe
their duetie, which serued erst to no purpose, sauing that they were
prepared for the tyme to come. After the same maner also doe wee
cherish our mynd by Imagination in this second life; which in the
third life being (as ye would say) scaped out of prison, shall begin
to vtter his operations by himselfe, and that so much the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynly,
for that it shall not be subiect to false reports, nor to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
eyther inward or outward, but to the very things themselues
which it shall haue seene and learned. To bee short, it shall liue, but
not in prison; it shall see, but not through Spectacles; it shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
but not by reports; it shall list, but not by way of lusting: the
infirmitie which the bodie casteth vpon it as now, shall then bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
the force which it bringeth now to the body, shal then be more
fresh and liuely than afore. Now then, notwithstanding these vayn
reasons of theirs, let vs conclude, That our soule is an vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or reasonable power, ouer the which neither death nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
haue naturally any power, although it be fitted to the body
to gouerne it. And if any man doubt hereof, let him but examine
himselfe; for euen his owne doubts will proue it vnto him. Or if he
will stand in contention stil, let him fall to reasoning with himselfe:
for by concluding his arguments to proue his Soule mortall, he
shall giue iudgement himselfe that it is immortall. And if I haue
left any thing vnalledged which might make to this purpose, (for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13215:143"/>
why may I not, séeing that euen the selfsame things which I haue
bin able to alledge on the behalf of myne aduersaries, do driue them
thereunto?) let vs thinke also that he which feeleth himself conuic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in himselfe, and for whose behoofe and benefite it were greatly,
both to beléeue it and to confesse it, néedeth no more diligent proofe
than hath bene made alreadie. But if any man will yet of spyght
stand wilfully still against himselfe, let him trye how he can make
answer to my foresayd arguments: and in the meane while let vs
see what the sayd opinion of the wisest men, yea and of the whole
world hath bene vpon this mater.</p>

in nature, had not taken some leysure to search
it selfe and the nature therof, and by searching
atteyned to some poynt in that behalfe. And
therefore as there haue at al tymes bene men,
so shall we see also that men haue at all tymes
beléeued &amp; admitted the immortalitie of the Soule; I say not some
one man or some one Nation, but the whole world with generall
consent, because all men vniuersally and perticularly haue learned
it in one Schoole, and at the mouth of one Teacher, namely euen
their owne knowledge in themselues. The holy Scripture which
teacheth vs our saluation, vseth no schoole arguments to make vs
beléeue that there is a God: and that is because we cannot step out
of our selues neuer so little, but wee must néedes finde him present
to all our Sences. And it seemeth to speake vnto vs the lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of the immortalitie of our soules, specially in the first bookes
therof, because we cannot enter into our selues be it neuer so little,
but we must néedes perceiue it. But inasmuch as from the one end
thereof to the other, it declareth vnto vs the will of God: in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13215:144"/>
it doth vs to vnderstand, that it is a thing wherof it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for vs to doubt.<note place="margin">The opinion of the Men of old tyme.</note> And whereas it setteth foorth so precisely from
age to age, the great and manifold troubles and paines which good
and godly men haue susteyned in indeuering to followe that will; it
sheweth infallibly that their so doing was in another respect than
for this present wretched life. For who is he that would depart
with any péece of his owne lyking in this life, but in hope of better
things? and what were it for him to lose his life, if there were not
another life after this? This serueth to answer in one word to such
as demaund expresse texts of Scripture, and are loth to finde that
thing in the Byble, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned there, not only in euery leafe
but almost in euery sine. For whereas God created man after the
world was fully finished and perfected: it was as much as if he had
brought him into a Theatre prepared for him, howbeit after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort than all the other liuing things which were to do him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
As for Beastes, Birds, Plants, and such other things, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
brought them foorth: but Man receyued his Soule by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
from God. Also the brute Beasts are put in subiection to
man, but man is in subiection onely vnto God. And the conueying
of that good man <hi>Henocke</hi> out of this life for his godlinesse, was
to none other end, but to set him in another life voyd of all euill and
full of all good.<note place="margin">The beleefe of the Patriarkes. &amp;c.</note> But when we reade the persecutions of <hi>Noe,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwartings
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the banishment and wayfarings of
<hi>Iacob,</hi> and the distresses of <hi>Ioseph, Moyses,</hi> and all the residewe of
the Fathers; they be all of them demonstrations that they did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynly
trust and beléeue that the Soule is immortall, that there is
another life after this, and that there is a iudgement to come. For
had they bene of opinion that there is none other life after this; the
flesh would haue perswaded them to haue hild themselues in quiet
here, and they would haue liked nothing better than to haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
swéetly the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon trade of the world, <hi>Noe</hi> among his frends,
<hi>Abraham</hi> among the <hi>Chaldees, Moyses</hi> in <hi>Pharaos</hi> Court, and
so foorth. So then, although the Scripture seeme to conceale it; yet
doth it speake very loude thereof in déede, considering that all the
cryes of the good and godly, and all the despayres of the wicked
which it describeth vnto vs, doe sound none other thing vnto vs, if
we haue eares to heare it. And it may bee, that in the same respect,
this article of the Immortalitie of the Soule was not put into the

of vs Christians, because wee beléeue beyond reason, and this is

within the bounds of reason; and whosoeuer treateth of Religion
must néedes presuppose God eternall and man immortall, without
the which two, all Religion were in vayne. Also, when we see that
Godlinesse, Iustice, and vertue were commended among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of all ages: it is all one as if wee should heare them preach in
expresse words the Immortalitie of the Soule. For their so doing
is buylded euery whit vppon that, as vppon a foundation without
the which those things could not stand. I will spend my goodes or
my life for the maintenance of Iustice. What is this Iustice but a

hath sent them from aboue a Soule indewed with much vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
and another that exhorteth them to seeke Paradise as the
peculiar dwelling place of the Soule. A third sayth that the Soule
of man hath God as it were shut vp in it, and that it hath not any
mortalitie therein. For (sayth he) the Soule is as it were dronken
with God, and sheweth foorth his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>uders in the harmonie of this
mortall body. And agayne another sayth, It is a cléere fire procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the power of the heauenly father, an vncorruptible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and the mainteyner of life, conteyning almost all the whole
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13215:145"/>
world with the full plentie thereof in his bosome. But one of them
procéedeth yet further, affirming that he which setteth his mynde
vppon Godlinesse, shall saue his body, frayle though it bee. And by
those words he acknowledgeth the very glorifying of the bodie.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">The Greekes.</note> all these sayings are reported by the <hi>Platonists,</hi> &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

auncient and holy Oracles are to be beléeued, which affirme mens
Soules to bee immortall, and that in another life they must come
before a Iudge that will require an account of al their doings. The
effect whereof commeth to this, That the Soule of man procéedeth
immediatly from God, that is to say, that the father of the bodie is
one, and the father of the Soule is another: That the Soule is not
a bodily substance, but a Spirit and a light: That at the departure
thereof from hence, it is to goe into a Paradise, and therfore ought
to make haste vnto death: And that it is so farre from mortalitie,
that it maketh euen the body immortall. What can wee say more

into this body as into a Prison for sinning. And whereas the flée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of soules out of one body into another, is fathered vpon him;
although the opinion be not directly against the immortalitie of the
Soule, yet doe many men thinke that hee hath wrong doone vnto
him. And his Disciple <hi>Timoeus</hi> of <hi>Locres</hi> reporteth otherwyse of

his Soule put into a beast, that he might become the more volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

this poynt; yea and so is <hi>Zeno</hi> too, howbeit that he thought
the Soule to bee begotten of Man, wherein hee was contrarie too
himselfe. To bée short, scarsly were there any to be found among

perswaded many men to it with liuely reasons, yea and by his own
death much more then by all his lyfe. And so ye see we be come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with consent of all the wyse men of olde

whom the vngraciousest of our dayes would esteeme but as

bring in God giuing commaundement to the vndergoddes
whom he created, that they should make man both of mortall and
of immortall substances. Wherein it may be that he alluded to this
saying in Genesis, <hi>Let vs make man after our owne Image and
lykenesse.</hi> In which case the Iewes say that GOD directed his
spéeche to his Angels; but our Diuines say hee spake to himselfe.
But anon after, both in the same booke and in many other places,
<hi>Plato</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato in his Timaeus, and in his third booke of a Comonweale.</note> (as it were comming to him himselfe ageine,) teacheth that
GOD created Man by himselfe, yea and euen his Lyuer and his
Brayne and all his Sences; that is to say, the Soule of him, not
onely indewed with reason and vnderstanding, but also with sence
and abilitie of growing and increasing; and also the instruments
whereby the same doe woorke. Moreouer hee maketh such a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
difference betwéene the Soule and the body; as that hee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
them not toogither as matter and forme, as <hi>Aristottle</hi> doth:
but as a Pilot and a Ship, a Commonweale and a Magistrate, an
Image and him that beareth it vpon him. What greater thing can

                  <hi>The Soule of Man is very like the Godhead; Immortall, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,

which are conditions</hi> (saith he) in his matters of State) <hi>that can
not agree but to things most diuine.</hi> And therefore at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
out of the world, he willed his Soule to returne home too
her kinred and to her first originall, that is to wit, (as hée himselfe
sayth there) to the wyse and immortall Godhead the Fountaine of
all goodnes, as called home from banishment into her owne natiue
countrie.<note place="margin">Plato in his fifth booke of Lawes.</note> He termeth it ordinarily <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is to say, <hi>of

                  </gap>,

Heauen and not in Earth, begotten from aboue and not héere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
and finally such as cannot dye heere, forasmuch as it liueth
still in another place. To be short, séeing (sayeth he) that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
the things that are Diuine and immortall, that is to wit,
the Godhead, and the things that are vnchaungeable and vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
as trueth is: it cannot be accounted to be of any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than they. The same opinion doth <hi>Plutarche</hi> also attribute
vnto him, which appeareth almost in euery leafe of his writings.
As touching the auncienter sort of <hi>Platonists,</hi> they agree all with
one accord in the immortalitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule, sauing that some of them
deriue it from God, and some from the Soule of the World, some
make but the Reason or mynd onely to be immortall, and some the
whole Soule: which disagreement may well be salued, if we say
that the Soule all whole together is immortall in power or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
though the execution and performance of the actions which are
to be doone by the body, be forgone with the instruments or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body.</p>
               <p>The disagréement concerning this poynt among such as a man
may voutsafe to call by the name of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> séemeth to haue
begonne at <hi>Aristotle,</hi> howbeit that his Disciples count it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to him, that he hath giuen occasion to doubt of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in that behalfe. For it is certeine that his newfound doctrine
of the Eternitie or euerlastingnesse of the World, hath distroubled
his brayne in many other things, as commonly it falleth out, that
one error bréedeth many other.<note place="margin">Aristotle in his second booke of liui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g things.</note> 
                  <hi>Because nature</hi> (sayth he) <hi>could
not make euery man particularly to continue for euer by
himself, therefore she continueth him in the kind by matching
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13215:147"/>
Male and Female together.</hi> This is spoken either grossely or
doubtfully. But whereas he sayth that if the Mynd haue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working
of it owne without any helpe of the Sences or of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it may also continue of it selfe, concluding thereuppon that then
it may also be separated from the body, as an immortal thing from
a thing that is transitorie and mortall: It followeth consequently
also, that the Soule may haue continuance of it selfe,<note place="margin">Aristotle in the third book of the Soule.</note> as whereof
he vttereth these words, namely, That the Soule commeth from
without, and not of the seede of Man as the body doth, and that the
Soule is the onely part in vs that is Diuine. Now, to be Diuine
and to be Humane, to be of séede and to be from without, that is to
say, from GOD; are things flat contratrie, whereof the one sort is
subiect to corruption, and the other not.<note place="margin">Aristotle in his tenth booke of moralles.</note> In the tenth booke of his
Moralls he acknowledgeth two sorts of lyfe in man; the one as in
respect that he is composed of Body and Soule, the other as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Mynd onely; the one occupied in the powres which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
humane and bodily, which is also accompanyed with a felicitie
in this lyfe; and the other occupied iu the vertues of the mynd,
which is accompanied also with a felictie in another lyfe. This
which consisteth in contemplation, is better than the other; and the
felicitie thereto belonging, is peculiarly described by him in his
bookes of Heauen aboue Tyme, as which consisteth in the franke
and frée working of the Mynd, &amp; in beholding the souereine God.
And in good sooth,<note place="margin">Michael of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus vpon Aristotles Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles.</note> full well doeth <hi>Michael</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> vppon this

                     </gap>.</note> In his bookes
of the Soule, hee not onely separateth the Body from the Soule,
but also putteth a difference betwixt the Soule it selfe &amp; the Mind,
terming the Soule the inworking of the body and of the bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
and the mynd that reasonable substance which is in vs,
whereof the doings haue no fellowship with the doings of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and whereof the Soule is (as <hi>Plato</hi> saieth) but the Garment.
<hi>This Mynd</hi> (sayth he) <hi>may be seuered from the body, it is not
in any wyse mingled with it, it is of such substaunce as cannot
be hurt or wrought vpon, it hath being and continuance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
and of it selfe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his second booke of the Soule.</note> 
                  <hi>and euen when it is separated from the
body, then is it immortall and euerlasting. To be short, it hath
not any thing like vnto the body. For it is not any of al those
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:13215:148"/>
things which haue being afore it vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which of all bodily things can it be?</hi> And in another place
he sayeth thus: <hi>As concerning the Mynd, and the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
powre, it is not yet sufficiently apparant what it is. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
it seemeth to bee another kind of Soule, and it is
that onely which can bee separated from the corruptible, as
the which is Ayeuerlasting.</hi> To be short, when as he putteth this
question, whether a Naturall Philosopher is to dispute of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Soules, or but onely of that Soule which is immateriall: it
followeth that he graunteth that there is such a one. And againe,
when as he maketh this Argument; <hi>Looke what God is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly,
that are wee in possibilitie according to our measure:
but hee is euerlastingly separated from bodily things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time will come that wee shall bee so too.</hi> He taketh it
that there is an Image of God in vs, yea euen of the Diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which hath continuance of itselfe. Uery well and rightly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth <hi>Simplicius</hi> gather therof, the immortalitie of the Soule.
For it dependeth vpon this separation,<note place="margin">In the last booke of the parts of beasts. In the tenth of his Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles.</note> &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continuance of being

of our Soules and Myndes cannot bee found in this lowe
earth: for there is not any mixture in them, or any compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that may seeme to bee bred or made of the earth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any moysture, any wyndinesse, or any firy matter
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13215:148"/>
in them. For no such thing could haue in it the powre of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
Vnderstanding, and conceit, to beate in mynd things
past, to foresee things to come, and to consider things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
which are matters altogither Diuine. And his conclusion
is, that therefore they bee deriued from the Mynd of GOD, that
is to say, not bred or begotten of Man, but created of God: not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
but vnbodily; wherevpon it followeth that the Soule cannot
be corrupted by these transitorie things. The same <hi>Cicero</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cicero in his second booke of the Nature of the Gods: and in his fust booke of Lawes.</note> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place sayeth that betwéene God and Man there is a kinred of
reason, as there is betwéene man &amp; man a kinred of blud. That the
fellowship betwéene man and man commeth of the mortall body,
but the fellowship betwéene God and man commeth of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
who created the Soule in vs. <hi>By reason whereof</hi> (sayth hée)
<hi>we may say we haue Alyance with the heauenly sort, as folke
that are descended of the same race and roote; whereof that
we may euermore be myndfull, we must looke vp to heauen
as to the place of our birth, whether we must one day returne.</hi>
And therfore yet once againe he concludeth thus of himself. <hi>Think
not</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that thou thy selfe art mortall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Scipioes dreame.</note> 
                  <hi>it is but thy body
that is so. For thou art not that which this outward shape
pretendeth to be, the Mynd of Man is the man in deede, and
not this lumpe which may bee poynted at with ones Fingar.
Assure thy selfe therefore that thou art a GOD; For needes
must that be a God, which liueth, perceyueth, remembereth,
foreseeth, and finally reigneth in thy body as the Great God
the maker of all things doth in the vniuersall world. For as
the eternall God ruleth and moueth this transitory world, so
doth the immortall Spirit of our soule moue &amp; rule our fraile
body.</hi> Hereuntoo consent all the writers of his tyme, as <hi>Ouid,

I will content my selfe with a fewe sayings of his.</hi> Our Soules
<hi>(sayth he)</hi> are a part of Gods Spirit, and sparkes of holy things
shining vpon the earth. They come from another place than
this lowe one. Whereas they seeme to bee conuersant in the
bodie, yet is the better part of them in Heauen, alway neere
vnto him which sent them hither. And how is it possible that
they should be from beneath, or from anywhere els tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from
aboue, seeing thei ouerpasse al these lower things as nothing,
and hold skorne of all that euer we can hope or feare? <hi>Thus
ye sée how he teacheth that our Soules come into our bodies from
aboue. But whether go they agayne, when they depart hence? Let
vs here him what he sayes of the Lady</hi> Martiaes <hi>Sonne that was
dead.</hi> He is now euerlasting <hi>(sayth he)</hi> and in the best state,<note place="margin">Seneca concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lady Martiaze So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this life In his Que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stions, and in his hooke of Comfort.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of this earthly baggage which was none of his, &amp; set free
to himselfe. For these bones, these sinewes, this coate of skin,
this face, and these seruiceable hands, are but fetters and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Soule. By them the Soule is ouerwhelmed, beaten
downe, and chased away. It hath not a greater batterll, than
with that masse of flesh. For feare of being torne in peeces, it
laboureth to returne from whence it came, where it hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
for it an happie and euerlasting rest. <hi>And agayn:</hi> This Soule
cannot be made an Outlaw: for it is a kin to the Gods, equall
to the whole world, and to all tyme; and the thought or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt
thereof goeth about the whole Heauen, extending it self
from the beginning of al tyme to the vttermost poynt of that
which is to come. The wretched coarse being the Iayle &amp; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Soule, is tossed to and fro. Vpon that are torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
murthers, and diseases executed. As for the Soule, it is holy
and euerlasting, and cannot bee layd hand on. When it is out
of this body, it is at libertie and set free from all bondage, and
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant in that beautifull place (wheresoeuer it be) which
receyueth mens Soules into the blessed rest thereof as soone
as they bee deliuered from hence. <hi>To bee short, he seemeth to
pricke very nere to the rysing againe of the dead. For in a certeyne
Epistle to</hi> Lucilius, <hi>his words are these.</hi> Death, wherof we be so
much afrayd, doth not bereue vs of life, but only discontinew
it for a tyme; and a day will come that shall bring vs to light
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13215:149"/>
agayne. <hi>This may suffise to giue vs knowledge of the opinion of
that great personage, in whom wee see that the more he grewe in
age, the nerer he came still to the true birth. For in his latest bookes
he treateth alwaies both more assuredly and more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly therof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Also the saying of</hi> Phauorinus <hi>is notable.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fauorinus.</note> There is nothing
great on earth, <hi>(sayth he)</hi> but Man; and nothing great in Man,
but his Soule. If thou mount vp thether, thou mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>test aboue
Heauen. And if thou stoope downe agayne to the bodie, and
compare it with the Heauen; it is lesse than a Flye, or rather a
thing of nothing. At one word, this is as much to say, as that in
this clod of clay, there dwelleth a diuine and vncoruptible nature:
for how could it els be greater than the whole world?</p>
               <p>As touching the Nations of old tyme,<note place="margin">The common opinion of all nations.</note> we reade of them all, that
they had certeyne Religions and diuine Seruices, so as they belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that there is a Hell, and certeyne fieldes which they call the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysian
fields,</hi> as we see in the Poets <hi>Pindarus, Diphilus, Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Euripides</hi> &amp; others.<note place="margin">Porphyrius in his 4. booke of Abstinence.</note> The more supersticious that they were,
the more sufficiently doe they witnesse vnto vs what was in their
Conscience. For true Religion and Superstition haue both one
ground, namely the Soule of man; and there could be no Religion
at all,<note place="margin">Which with their owne hands made the fire to burne their bodies in: and sawe aliue the kindled flame that should consume their Skinne.</note> if the Soule liued not when it is gone hence. Wee reade of
the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they burned themselues afore they came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
oldage, terming it the letting of men loose, and the fréeing of
the Soule from the bodie: and the sooner that a man did it, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
was he estéemed. Which custome is obserued still at this day
among the people that dwell by the Riuer <hi>Niger</hi> otherwise called
the people of <hi>Senega</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> who offer themselues willingly
to be buryed quicke with their Maisters. All the demonstrations of
Logicke and Mathematicke (sayth <hi>Zeno</hi>) haue not so much force
to proue the immortalitie of the soule, as this only doing of theirs
hath. Also great <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing taken prisoners ten of their
Philosophers, (whom they call <hi>Gimnosophists</hi>) asked of one of
them to trye their wisedome, whether there were mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>men aliue or
dead. The Philosopher answered, that there were moe aliue: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
(sayd he) <hi>there are none dead.</hi> Ye may wel think they gaue
a drye mocke to all the arguments of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Callisthenes,</hi>
which with all their Philosophie had taught their scholer <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
so euill. Of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> we reade that they sorrowed at the
birth of men and reioyced at the death of them, yea euen of their
owne chidren. And that was because they thought that which wee
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:13215:150"/>
call death, not to be a death in déede, but rather a very happie birth.
And these be the people whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth to haue bene
called the <hi>Neuerdying Getes,</hi> and whom the <hi>Greekes</hi> called the
<hi>Neuerdying Getes or Thracians.</hi> Who were of opinion that at

                  <note place="margin">Gebeleizie, that is to say, Register or Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of caze &amp; rest.</note>
that is to say (after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretation of the <hi>Getish</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
tongue) to him that gaue them health, saluation or welfare,
and gathered them together. The like is sayd of the <hi>Galles,</hi> chiefly
of the inhabiters about <hi>Marsilles</hi> and of their <hi>Druydes;</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truscians</hi>
and their Bishops; and of the <hi>Scythians</hi> and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
of whom all the learning and wisedome was grounded vpon
this poynt. For looke how men did spread abroad, so also did this
doctrine, which is so déeply printed in man, that he cannot but carie
it continually with him. Which thing is to bee seene yet more in
that which wee reade concerning the hearers of <hi>Hegesias</hi> the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renian,</hi>
who dyed willingly after they had heard him discourse of
the state of mens Soules after this life; and likewise concerning
<hi>Cleombrotus</hi> the <hi>Ambraciote,</hi> who slewe himselfe when he had
read a certeyne treatise of the immortalitie of the Soule. For had
it not bene a doctrine most euident to mans wit, they would neuer
haue bin caried so farre by it, as to the hurting of their bodies. And
if among so many people, there be perchaunce some fewe wretched
caytifes, that haue borne themselues on hand the contrarie; which
thing neuerthelesse they could neuer yet fully perswade themselues
to be out of all doubt or question: surely wee may beléeue that they
had very much adoe and were vtterly besotted like Drunkards, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could come to that poynt: so as wee may well say of them
as <hi>Hierocle</hi>

they might not be punished for their faults: But yet that they
preuent the sentence of their Iudge, by condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto death afore hand.</hi> But if they wil neither heare God,
nor the whole world, nor themselues: let them at leastwise hearken
to the Deuill as well as they doe in other things; who (as sayth

               <l>It were a great wickednesse for thee to say</l>
               <l>The Soule to be mortall or for to decay.</l>
               <p>And vnto <hi>Polytes</hi> he answered thus.</p>
               <l>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:13215:150"/>As long as the Soule to the body is tyde,</l>
               <l>Though loth, yet all sorowes it needes must abyde.</l>
               <l>But when fro the body Death doth it remoue,</l>

they be somewhat vnproper) (for what wordes can a man finde to

expressely concerning the nature of the Soule, besides the
things which he hath written dispersedly heere and there in other
places. His chiefe conlusions are these. That mens Soules pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
not of their bodies, nor of the seede of the Parents, but come
from aboue, and are as ye would say graffed into our bodies by the
hand of God: That the Soule is partly tyed to the body and to the
instruments thereof; and partly franke, frée, workfull, &amp; continuing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:13215:151"/>
of it selfe; and yet notwithstanding that it is neither a body nor the
harmonie of the body, but (if wee consider the life and operation
which it giueth to the body) it is after a sort the perfection [or rather
the perfector] of the body; and if wee haue an eye to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereby it guydeth the mouings and doings of the body; it is
as a Gouernour of the body: That the further it is withdrawne
from the Sences, the better it discourseth of things; insomuch that
when it is vtterly separated from them, it vnderstandeth things
without discoursing, reasoning or debating, yea euen in a moment;
because this debating is but a certeyne lightening or brightnesse of
the mynde, which now taketh aduisement in matters whereof it
doubteth, and it doubteth wheresoeuer the body yéeldeth any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
vnto it; but it shall neither doubt nor séeke aduisement any
more when it is once out of the body, but shall conceyue the trueth
without wauering: That the Soule in the body is not properly
there as in a place, or as in a ground, because it is not conteyned or
comprehended therein, and may also bee separated from it; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if a man had eyes to see it withall, he should see that the bodie
is in the Soule, as an accessary is in a principall, or as a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
in a conteyner, or a sheading or liquid thing in a thing that
is not liquid, because the Soule imbraceth the body, and quickneth
it, and moueth it equally and alike in all parts. That euery abilitie
thereof is in euery part of the bodie, as much in one part as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as a whole Soule in euery parte; notwithstanding that euery
seuerall abilitie thereof seeme to bee seuerally in some particuler
member or part, because the instruments thereof are there; as the
sensitiue abilitie seemeth to rest in the head, the yrefull in the heart,
and the quickning in the Liuer, because the Sinewes, Hartstrings
and Uaynes come from those parts: Whereas the reasonable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is not in any part, sauing so farre foorth as it worketh and hath
his operation there, neither hath it any néede of place or instrument
for the executing of it selfe. And to be short, that the Soule is a life
by it selfe, a life all in one, vnpartable; which causeth to growe, and
groweth not it selfe; which goeth throughout the bodie, and yet is
not conteyned of the bodie; which vniteth the Sences, and is not
deuided by the Sences; and therfore that it is a bodilesse substance,
which cannot bee touched neither from within nor from without,
hauing no néede of the bodie eyther outwardly or inwardly, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
is immortall, diuine, yea and almost a very God: Which
things he proueth by many reasons, which were too long to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13215:151"/>
here.<note place="margin">Plotinus in his booke of the Sences, &amp; of Memorie. En. 4. lib. 3. and in his booke of doubts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Soule chap. 26. 27.</note> Yea he procéedeth so farre as to say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which are
passed into another world, haue their memorie still, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that to some mens seeming it goe away with the Sences as
the treasury of the Sences. Howbeit he affirmeth it to be the more
excellent kynd of memorie; not that which calleth things agayne to
mynd as alreadie past, but that which holdeth and beholdeth them
still as alwaies present. Of which two sorts, this latter he calleth
Myndfulnes, and the other he calleth Rememberance. I will add
but onely one sentence more of his for a full president of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
<hi>The Soule</hi> (sayth he) <hi>hath had companie with the Gods,
and is immortal; and so would we say of it (as Plato affirmeth)
if we sawe it fayre and cleere. But forasmuch as we see it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
troubled, we thinke it not to bee eyther diuine or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
howbeit that he which will discerne the nature of a
thing perfectly, must consider it in the very owne substance or
being, vtterly vnmingled with any other thing. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
els is added vnto it, doth hinder the perfect discerning of
the same. Therfore let euery man behold himself naked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing saue himselfe, so as he looke vppon nothing els
than his bare Soule: and surely when he hath vewed himselfe
in his owne nature merely as in respect of his Mynd, he shall
beleeue himselfe to bee immortall. For he shall see that his
Mynd, ameth not properly at the sensible and mortall things,
but that by a certeine euerlasting power, it taketh hold of the
things that are euerlasting, and of whatsoeuer is possible to
be conceiued in vnderstanding: insomuch that euen it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
after a sort a very World of vnderstanding &amp; light.</hi>
This is against those which pretend a weakenesse of the Soule,
by reason of the inconueniences which it indureth very often in the
bodie.</p>
               <p>Of the same opinion are <hi>Numenius, Iamblichus, Porphirius,</hi>
and <hi>Proclus,</hi> notwithstanding that now and then they passe their
bounds, suffering their wits to runne royet. For in their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
they had none other rule, than only the drift of their owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
It was commonly thought that <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Aphrodise</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued
not the immortalitie of the Soule,<note place="margin">Alexander of Aphrodise in his bookes of the Soule.</note> because he defined it to
be the forme of the body proceeding of the mixture &amp; temperature
of the Elements. Surely these words of his doe vs to vnderstand,
either that he ment to define but the sensitiue lyfe onely (as many
others doe) and not the reasonable soule; or els that he varieth from
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13215:152"/>
himselfe in other places. And in very déede hee sayeth immediatly
afterward, that he speaketh of the things which are subiect to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and corruption. But speaking of the Soule he sayeth it is

we may thinke as some doe, that by this Soule he meane
but onely God, and not also the Soule that is in vs; for the which
thing he is sharply rebuked by <hi>Themistius,</hi> who notwithstanding
speaketh neuer a whit better thereof himselfe. Howsoeuer he deale
elsewhere, these words of his following are without any doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
at all. <hi>The Soule</hi> (sayth he) <hi>which is in vs, commeth from
without and is vncorruptible.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his second booke of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes.</note> 
                  <hi>I say vncorruptible because the
nature thereof is such, and it is the very same that Aristotle
affirmeth to come from without.</hi> And in his second booke of
Problemes, searching the cause why the abilities of the Soule are
oftentimes impeached: <hi>If a mans brayne be hurt</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the
reasonable soule dooth not well execute the actions that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
thereon. But yet for all that, it abydeth still in itselfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable
of nature, abilitie and power, through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
thereof. And if it recouer a sound instrument, it
putteth her abilities in execution as well as it did afore.</hi> But
I wil reason more at large hereafter against the opinion that is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
vpon him.</p>
               <p>What shall we say of <hi>Galene,</hi> (who fathereth the causes of all
things as much as he can, vpon the Elements and the mixture and
agréeble concord of them) if after his disputing against his owne
Soule,<note place="margin">Galen in his booke of the Manners of the Soule.</note> he be constreyned to yéeld that it is immortall? Surely in
his booke concerning the manners of the Soule he doeth the worst
that he can against <hi>Plato:</hi> and in another place hee doubteth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be immortall, and whether it haue continuance of it selfe or
no. Yet notwithstanding, in his booke of the doctrine of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and <hi>Plato,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his booke of the doctrine of Hippocrates and Plato.</note> 
                  <hi>It must needes be graunted</hi> (sayeth hee) <hi>that the
Soule is either a sheere body and of the nature of the Skye, (as
the Stoiks &amp; Aristotle himself are inforced to confesse) or els
a bodilesse substance, whereof the body is as it were the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
and whereby it hath fellowship with other bodyes.</hi> And
it appeareth that hee inclyneth to this latter part: For hee maketh
the vitall spirit to be the excellentest of all bodily things,<note place="margin">In his booke of Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and yet he
grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the Soule to bee a farre more excellent thing than that.
What shall we then doe? Let vs wey his words set downe in his
booke of the conception of a Child in the Moothers Wombe. <hi>The
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13215:152"/>
Soule of Man</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>is an influence of the vniuersall Soule
that descendeth from the heauenly Region, a substance that
is capable of knowledge, which aspyreth alwayes to one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
lyke vnto it selfe, which leaueth all these lower things
to seeke the things that are aboue, which is partaker of the
heauenly Godhead, and which by mounting vp to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of things that are aboue the heauens, putteth it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the presence of him that ruleth all things.</hi> Were it reason
then that such a substance comming from elsewhere than of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and mounting so farre aboue the body, should in the ende dye
with the body, because it vseth the seruice of the body?</p>
               <p>Now hereuntoo I could adde infinite other sayings of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">The vniuersall consent.</note>
authors both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Philosophers, Poets, and
Orators from age to age, wherein they treate of the iudgement to
come, of the reward of good men, of the punishment of euill men, of
Paradise and of Hell, which are appendants to the immortalitie of
the Soule: but as now I will but put the reader in mynd of them
by the way, reseruing them to their peculiar places. To bée short,
let vs runne at this day from East to West, and from North to
South, I say not among the <hi>Turkes, Arabians,</hi> or <hi>Persians,</hi> (for
their <hi>Alcoran</hi> teacheth them that mans Soule was breathed into
him of God,<note place="margin">In the Alcora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Azo: 25. and 42.</note> and consequently that it is vncorruptible) but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

I meane the very <hi>Caribies</hi> and <hi>Cannibals;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It appeareth by the storyes or the East and West Indyes.</note> and we shall find this
beléefe receiued and imbraced of them all. Which giueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that it is not a doctrine inuented by speculations of some
Philosophers, conueyed from Countrie to Countrie by their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
perswaded by likelyhods of reasons, or (too be short) entered
into mans wit by his eares: but a natiue knowledge, which euery
man findeth and readeth in himself, which he carieth euerywhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with himselfe, and which is as easie to bée perswaded vnto all
such as viewe themselues in themselues, as it is easie to perswade
a man that neuer sawe his owne face, to beléeue that he hath a face,
by causing him to behold himselfe in a glasse.</p>
               <p>There remayne yet two opinions, to be confuted. The one is
the opinion of <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ageinst Auerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoes.</note> and the other is the opinion of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Aphrodise,</hi> who affirme themselues to hold both of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi>
namely in that they vpholde that there is but one vniuersall
reasonable Soule or mynd, which worketh al our discourses in vs,
howbeit diuersly in euery seuerall person. And this thing (if wee
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:13215:153"/>
beléeue <hi>Auerrhoes</hi>) is done according to the diuersitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies
or Imaginations wherewith the mynd is serued as with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.
But if we beléeue <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Let the Reader beare these termes &amp; their significations in Mynd, for al the discourse here ensewing.</note> it is done according too
the diuersities of the capable mind as they terme it, that is to say,
of the abilitie or capabilitie that is in men to vnderstand things, by
receyuing the impression of the vniuersall mynd that worketh into
euery of them which in respect thereof is called of them the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Soothly these opinions are such as may bee disprooued in one
worde. For this onely one Mynd, whether in possibilitie or in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
could not haue receiued or imprimted in euery man one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
common beléef and conceit of the immortalitie of the Soule,
in so great diuersitie of imaginations, and in so many Nations, as
we sée doe beléeue it, considering that the very same conceit is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
repugnant against it. Nay, it may well bée sayde that <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> had very diuers conceits and imaginations
one from another, and very contrary to all other mens, seeing they
had so diuers and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie opinions imprinted either in their mind
or in their imagination. Howbeit forasmuch as there may be some,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will make a doubt of it; Let vs examine them seuerally yet more
aduisedly.<note place="margin">Auerhoes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Aristotles third booke of the Soule.</note> First <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> will néedes beare <hi>Aristotle</hi> on hand,
that <hi>Aristotle</hi> is of that opinion. Let vs see how this surmize of
his can agrée with the propositions which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath left vs.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> telleth vs that the Soule is knit to the body as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme
or shape too the matter; that the Soule hath thrée chiefe powers,
namely of lyfe, of sence, and of vnderstanding; and that the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
part conteineth in his power both the other two powers,
as a Fiuesquare conteineth both a Fowersquare and a Triangle.<note place="margin">Aristotle in his second booke of the Soule.</note>
Whereupon it followeth that if any one of the three powers of the
Soule be ioyned to the body as a forme to the matter; all the thrée
be ioyned so to, as which are all in one soule as in their roote. Now
<hi>Auerrhoes</hi> neither can nor will deny that the powers of growing
and of perceiuing by the sences are ioyned after that maner too the
body; and therfore it followeth that the vnderstanding power is to
ioyned also, and consequently that according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as euery
body hath his forme, so euery body hath his Soule.<note place="margin">Aristotle in his first booke of the Soule.</note> The same <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
findeth fault with the former Philosophers for holding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that a Soule might passe out of one man into another: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(sayeth he) that euery certeyne Soule must needes be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and appoynted to some one certeine body. Now looke by
what Soule a man liueth, by the same Soule doth he vnderstand:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13215:153"/>
for it is but one Soule indued with three diuers abilities, as hee
himselfe teacheth opently. One vnderstauding or Mynd therefore,
must (according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>) worke but in one seuerall body, and
not in many bodyes. Also according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> a Man &amp; a Beast
agree in this, that both of them haue one sensitiue power and one
selfsame imagination of things perceiued by the Seuces, &amp; that
they differ in this, that man hath yet further a mynd and reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the beast, which thing the beast hath not. Now if this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
or Mynd be without the man, as the Sonne is without
the Chamber that it shineth into and inlighteneth; then cannot he
be called reasonable or indewed with vnderstanding, neither doth
he consequently differ from a beast. For the difference must bee in
nature, and not in accident. And so should it insue that <hi>Aristotles</hi>
foresaid definition of a man is false, as if he should define a Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
by the shyning of the Sunne into it: Or say that a Dog differeth
not from a man in kind; yea and that Beasts are eapable of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
forasmuch as they haue Imagination ready aforehand to
receiue the influence thereof as well as wee. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
one in his defining both of beast &amp; of man; and <hi>Auerrhoes</hi>
also holdeth himself to it, without doubting thereof at all. This
conclusion therfore cannot in anywise be vpheld by such grounds.</p>
               <p>Againe, if there bee not in euery seuerall man a seuerall mynd,
but onely one vniuersall mynd common to all men, which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
diuers by the onely diuersitie of our imaginations: Then in
respect that we haue sundrie imaginations, wee shall bee sundrie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wights; and in respect that we haue al but one mynd, we shall
bee all but one man. For man is not man in respect of the sensitiue
power, but in respect of the reasonable part which is the mind. But
<hi>Aristotle</hi> graunteth that we be not only diuers liuing wights, but
also diuers men. And therefore he must néedes meane also, that we
haue not only diuers imaginations, but also diuers mynds. Now
besides many other Reasons that might be alledged, ye might add
this also, That otherwise <hi>Aristotles</hi> Moralles and his discourses
concerning Iustice, Fréewill, the Immortalitie of the Soule, the
happie blisse, the reward of the good, and the paynes of the wicked,
were vtterly frutelesse and to no purpose: For as our fancies or y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
did come and goe, so would al those things come and
go likewise; and so should they haue no continuance of themselues,
but only be as a shadowe and vayne fantasie. But let <hi>Aristotle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
(for he hath wrong) and let vs come to the matter it self. The
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13215:154"/>
Philosophers doe ordinarily make a dubble mynd; the one which
they call possible or in possibilitie, which is capable and of abilitie
to vnderstand things; and this they liken to a smooth table; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they call working or workfull, which bringeth the abilitie into
act, whereas notwithstanding they be not two mynds, but two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
abilities of only one mynd. Now, as for this abilitie or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie
of vnderstanding, we affirme it to be in the Soule of euery
man. Contrarywise, <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> affirmed onely one vniuersall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
mynd to be shed abroad euery where throughout all men; and
that the same is diuersly perfected and brought into act in euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
man, according to the diuersitie of the imaginations which
the man tonceyueth, euen by the helpe or influence of the sayd vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
workfull mynd, which he sayth is also a substaunce seuered
from man, and (in respect of the vnderstanding in possibilitie) is as
the Sunne is to the sight of our eyes; and the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie
is to the imaginations, as the sight is vnto colours. Now,
I demaund first of all, whether these vniuersall Mynds of his, bee
substances created or vncreated. If they bee created, where becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
then his conclusion, That the world is without beginning,
and without ending, seeing that he will haue them to be continued
euerlastingly in all men that haue bene, are, or shall be? If they bee
vncreated, how can so excellent substances bee made subiect to our
fond imaginations, to yéeld influence into them at their pleasures?
Or rather how happeneth it that they correct them not? How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
it that thei leaue them in such errors, yea euen in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of themselues, seeing that by the erring of the imaginations,
the very vnderstanding and reason themselues must also néedes be
so often beguyled? Againe, as concerning these substances, which
extend into so many places; are they Bodies or Spirits? How can
they be Bodies, seeing they be in infinite places at one instant, and
do infinite things, yea and flat contraries? And if they be Spirits,
doth it notfollow thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they be wholly in al men, &amp; wholly
in euery man; that is to say, that euery man hath them whole to
himselfe? And therefore that if they bee deceyued by the fantasie of
any one man, they be consequently deceyued in all men? And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
comes it then, that one man ouercommeth his imaginations,
and another man not? Or that one man resisteth them, and another
suffereth himselfe to be caryed away by them? Moreouer, who can
denye that a man willeth things, whereof he hath vnderstanding;
and likewise that he willeth some things which he vnderstandeth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13215:154"/>
not; and that he vnderstandeth some things which he willeth not?
And also that he willeth things euen contrary to his appetites, and
concludeth oftentymes contrary to his imaginations, as commeth
to passe in Dreames and in Lookingglasses; which thing the brute
Beastes doe not? When a man willeth contrary to his appetites,
willeth he not contrary to his sences, yea and contrary to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
too? for what els is fantasie or imagination, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
backe of the sences? And if this workfull vnderstanding
be the only worker in his possible vnderstanding by meane of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
how commeth it to passe that a man willeth contrary to
his imagination? Againe, when either in dreaming or in debating,
reason concludeth cleane contrary to that which fancie or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
offereth; wherof commeth it that a man is contrary to himself,
or that the déede is contrary both to that which imprinted it, and to
that wherein it is imprinted? Also what els is imagination (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the opinion of <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi>) than a certeyne operation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the bodie, steaming vp from the Hart to the Brayne? And
on the contrary part who can say nay, but that the Will and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
are able to performe their operations without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of the body, seeing that a man doth both will and debate
things that are most repugnant to the body?<note place="margin">Aristotle in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. booke of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturalls.</note> Yea and that (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
sayth) those bee not actions which passe into the outward
man, but those which abyde within and make perfect the inner ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
And who can make Will and Understanding to be things depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon imagination, seeing that both waking and sléeping and
all maner of waies els, they dayly vtter infinite iudgements and
determinations against it? Now, if we haue nothing in vs aboue
Imagination: then considering that wee doe both will and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
it must needes bee that this power or abilitie to will and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
is shed into vs from without. And if it be but only one v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersally
in all men; then seeing that the actions thereof are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without the imagination, without the sences, and without the
instruments of the bodie, yea and against them: it followeth that it
willeth and vnderstandeth in vs whatsoeuer it liketh and listeth,
euen in despite of all impediments and lets of the bodie; and that as
it is but one, so it shall will but one selfsame thing, and likewise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vnderstand but one selfesame thing in all men. For if (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
confesseth) our imaginations make not our will and reason
subiect vnto them; much lesse doe they make the foresayd vniuersall
mynd subiect to them as <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> pretendeth. But now contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13215:155"/>
wee see there bee as many Willes as men, yea euen in one
matter; and that the vnderstandings of men are not onely diuers,
but also contrarie. It followeth then that euery particular person
hath in that behalfe a particular substaunce, which willeth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth,
franke and free from all imaginations whensoeuer it
listeth to retyre into it selfe; and not that there is but one vniuersall
mynd which willeth and vnderstandeth all things in all men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, by the iudgement of <hi>Aristotle</hi> as I sayd afore, this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
mynd could not worke will and vnderstanding in vs: for to
will and vnderstand (sayth he) are operations that passe not into
the matter nor into the outward thing, but abide stil in the worker,
that is to say in the mynd, as actions and perfections thereof.</p>
               <p>Let vs yet agayne take of that which hath bin sayd afore. If the
sayd vniuersall only one working mynd, haue wrought from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
in the sayd vniuersall only one capable mynd, by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of men: then hath the knowledge of all things bin euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
imprinted in the sayd capable mynd; for it shal euermore haue
brought the abilitie into act: And therwithal, the working and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the thing that is euerlasting, shall haue depended vpon a
thing that is temporall; which is vnpossible. And although <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes</hi>
supposed not the World to be euerlasting: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the sayd capable mynd which hath bene set a worke so many
hundred yéeres, by so many imaginations of men, and in so many
sundry Nations, could not now méete with any newe thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it had not the knowledge afore. For this capable mynd (saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrhoes</hi>)
is a certeine spirituall substance, which spreadeth it self
foorth into all men and into all ages, and the nature of such sort of
substaunces is to be all in the whole, and all in euery part thereof.
For they bee not tyed to any one place, but are wheresoeuer they
worke, and their working is in respect of the whole and not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any one part, forasmuch as they be vndiuidable. Therefore
it should followe by his opinion (as I haue sayd afore) that the one
vniuersall capable mind is &amp; worketh whole and vnparted in euery
man. And if it be so; then is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> being of it there, not in way of méere
abilitie or possibilitie onely, but in way of operation and perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working,
as a wicked spirit is in a Witch, in a Pythonesse or in a
possessed person: which spirit, (were he possessed of the man as he
himselfe posseseth the man, (after which maner <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vs to possesse the vnderstanding in possibilitie, by our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natious;)
would make the man capable of all that euer the Spirit
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:13215:155"/>
himselfe knoweth or is. Whereupon it will followe, that this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in possibilitie shall euerlastingly in all men from their
very birth, actually vnderstand and knowe all things that all men
vnderstand, as well in the old as the yoong, and in the ignorant as
the skilfull; so as wee shall haue no more neede of sences, nor of
imagination to vnderstand withall. Too be short, although <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoes</hi>
admitteth not the World to bee without beginning: yet at
leastwise he will not deny, but that [by his reckening] they which
come into the world at this day, should come farre more skilfull
than all their predecessors, and the children of them more skilfull
than their fathers, and the ofspring of those children more skilfull
than those children themselues, and so forthon, because they should
succeede in the knowledge continued throughout all ages. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it will also insue, that all Sciences shalbe equally in all men
that make profession of them. As for example, we will speake heere
but of some one speciall Science, as Grammer and Arithmetike.
Now if there bee any diuersitie in the skill thereof, that diuersitie
cannot come but of the diuersitie of the subiect or ground wherein
the skill is. Now the ground of the skill is the capacitie of the
mynd or vnderstanding, (which <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> supposeth to be but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one, common to all men) and not the Imagination, which is but a
reflexion or rebounding backe of the Sence. And so forasmuch as
there is (by his saying) but one ground in al men; it followeth that
the knowledge or skill of this or that Science must needes bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
&amp; alike in all men: or els that if it be not equall, but doe vary,
as wee see it dooth in diuers degrees; then the same varying or
diuersitie happeneth through the diuersitie of the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the skill is, and consequently that there is one particular vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
or one peculiar mynd in euery man, and not one vniuersal
mynd comon to all men. Also it is a generall rule, that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of a thing hath not the thing afore he receiue it. For (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aristotle in his third booke of of the Soule.</note>
saith (that which is to receiue a thing, must needes be first vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
voyde of the thing which it receiueth. Now afore that our
Sence and Imagination had any beeing at all, this vniuersall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mynd had receiued &amp; possessed all things aforehand; and not
only receiued them, but also kept them together. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
himself saith, that maner of mynd is the place of all vnderkinds &amp;
sortes of things, and thereto hath no lesse power than the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
to reteine whatsoeuer the Sences receiue. In vaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should that vniuersall mynd vnderstand by our Imaginations,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:13215:156"/>
considering that it vnderstandeth by it selfe: in vaine likewise
should the Imaginations imprint those things in it, which were
imprinted in it so long afore: and in vaine is <hi>Aristotles</hi> setting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe
of a workfull vnderstanding, which should bring our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in abilitie, from possibilitie into action; if the sayd onely
one vniuersall mynd or vnderstanding be perfect of it selfe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting,
as it followeth to be vppon the opinion of <hi>Auerrhoes.</hi>
Neither is it to be sayd, that although the conceyuable vnderkinds
of things haue bene imprinted euerlastingly in the sayd vniuersall
mynd; yet notwithstanding there needed an Imagination for the
vnderstanding of them, as there needeth now whensoeuer we will
vse the things that we haue seene or learned afore. For by that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening,
to learne all maner of Sciences, wee needed no more but
to bethinke vs by imagination, of the things that were already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
in the said only vniuersal one mynd, as we doe the things
that haue bene printed sometime in our memories, and are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
slipped out of our remembrance; and so might we our selues
learne all sciences without a teacher, because that in the sayd vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
mynde of ours, wee should haue all the skill that euer any
man had atteyned to, in like maner as the persone that hath once
had the skill of Arithmetik or Cosmographie throughly settled in
his mynd, needeth no teacher to teache it him ageine, but onely to
ouerturne his owne imagination, and to search his memorie for the
finding againe of that which he had layd vp there. Now we knowe
that whosoeuer learneth nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knoweth nothing, and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
he which most studyeth, most learneth: and that all the tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and turmoyling of a mans owne imagination that can bee all
his life long, will neuer make him to attaine of himself to so much
as the very principles of the least science that is. By reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it followeth, That we haue not the skill of any science in vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
wee either be taught it or find it out by beating our wits about
it: and that our imagination serueth not to reuiue the Sciences
in vs, but to bring them into vs, and to plant them in vs. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as all the Sciences should bee in all men from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if there were but one vniuersall mynd in all men, [which is
not so] it followeth that there is in euery particular persone a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and peculiar mynd, and not any one vniuersall mynd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all men. Moreouer, our mynd atteyneth after a sort to the
vnderstanding of itself: which thing it could not doe in very deede,
if there were but one vniuersall mynd common to all men. For too
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13215:156"/>
vnderstand it selfe, it must needes worke vpon it selfe. But if wee
beleeue <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi> our mynd shall but onely be wrought vppon
and receiue into it from the Imagination, as a Windowe recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
light from the Sunne. Ageine, the capacitie of the vniuersall
vnderstanding in possibilitie, could not doe that. For it behoued it
to haue some other thing besides itself, to bring it selfe into action.
And surely Imagination could not helpe it, for it doth but offer vp
the sensible things vnto it, &amp; atteineth not so farre as to the things
that are to be discerned by drift of reason. Yet notwithstanding we
vnderstand that wee vnderstand, and we reason and iudge both of
our Imagination, and also of our reasoning and vnderstanding it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
The thing then which doth so enter and pearce into itselfe, is
another maner of power than an Imagination, or than an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
vnderstanding in possibilitie. What is to be said to this, that of
one selfesame Imagination, one selfsame persone concludeth now
after one sort, and byandby after in another sort; and thereoutof
draweth both contrarie argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and contrarie determinations:
or that diuers persons by diuers imaginations doe close togither in
one will and one mynd? Is it possible that this should proceed of
an euerlasting substance in one selfesame persone, seeing that ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingnesse
is not subiect to any change of tyme or place? Or that
it should proceede of any one selfesame substance in many men, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the imaginations of them be so diuers one from another?
at leastwise if the said substance worke not but by such instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts?</p>
               <p>As touching the opinion of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Aphrodise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Against Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodise.</note> who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
a certeine vniuer sal working mind that imprinteth things
in the vnderstanding in possibilitie, that is to say in euery mans se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
capacitie, and bringeth it foorth into action: the most part
of the Reasons alledged afore against <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi> will also serue
against him. Howbeit forasmuch as by this workfull mynd, hee
seemeth to meane God himself, there is thus much more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnto it; That God who is altogither good and altogither wise
would not imprint in our mynde the fond and wicked conceites,
which we find there, nor leaue so great ignoraunce and darkenesse
as wee feele there, but would in all men ouercomme the infection
which the body bringeth: and although hee inspired not all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
with his gracious giftes, according to the diuersitie of their
capacities after the mauer of a planed Table; yet would he not at
leastwise peint the Worlde with so many false Portraytures and
Traynes, as euery one of vs may perceiue to bee in our selues.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:13215:157"/>
Agayne, were there any such inspiration or influence, it should bee
eyther continuall or but by tymes. If continuall or euerlasting, we
should without labour and without cunning vnderstand all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our imagination offereth vnto vs. And if it bee but at tymes,
then should it not lye in vs to list or to vnderstand any thing at all,
though we would neuer so fayne. For contrarywise, we haue much
a doe to vnderstand some things, so as we must bee fayne to winne
them from our ignorance by péecemeale: and there bee some other
things, which we vnderstand by and by as soone as they be put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, and when we list our selues. There is then in vs a power of
Understanding, though very feeble; but yet neuerthelater obedient
to our will: which thing cannot be fathered vpon God. Also if there
be but onely one Mynd working in all men, there shall bee but one
selfesame vnderstanding in all men, I meane naturally, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that it differ in degrees. For into what place soeuer the
Sunne doe shed his beames, he doth both inlighten it and heate it,
howbeit diuersly according to the nature and condition of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and things that receyue him, some more and some lesse, some
brightlyer and some dimlyer. But howsoeuer the case stande, his
light yéeldeth no darknesse, nor his heate any cold. So then, if the
diuersities of mens imaginations doe cause diuersities of effects in
the inspiration or influence that floweth into the capacitie of our
vnderstanding; surely it must néedes bee after this maner, namely
that one man shall vnderstand one selfesame thing more, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man lesse; but not in that any man shall take vntruth for truth,
vnright for right, or one thing for another. Now, we see vnto how
many errors wee bee subiect, I meane not in such things as this,
namely, that one man seeth better a farre of, and another better at
hand; but that one man seeth white and another seeth blacke (which
are things contrary) in one selfesame ground and at one selfesame
tyme. It followeth therefore that diuers and sundries mynds doe
worke in diuers persons, and not one selfsame mynd in al persons.
By force of which reasons and of such others, I say that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shall finde in himselfe and of himselfe, That euery man hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Soule by himself, that is to say a spirituall substance vnited
to his body, which in respect of giuing life to the body is as the
forme therof, and in respect of giuing reason, is as the guyde of our
actions: That in euery man there is a certeyne Sunbeame of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whereby they conceyue things and debate vpon them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through
it commeth to passe, that oftentymes they agrée both in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:13215:157"/>
the Reason it selfe which is one, and in the manifest grounds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and in whatsoeuer dependeth euidently vpon the same: That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man hath also a peculiar body by himselfe, and likewise pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
complexion, humours, imaginations, education, custome and
trade of life: whereof it commeth that euery man takes a diuers
way, yea and that one selfsame person swarueth diuersly from the
vnitie of Reason wherof the path is but one, and the waies to stray
from it are infinite: That this Sunbeame of reason which shineth
and sheadeth it self from our mynd, is properly that vnderstanding
which is termed <hi>The vnderstanding in abilitie or possibilitie,</hi>
which is increased and augmented by all the things which it seeth,
heareth, or lighteth vppon, like fire, which gathereth increase of
strength by the abundance of the fewell that is put vnto it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
after a sort infinite by spreading it selfe abroad: Also it is
the same which otherwise we call <hi>the Memorie of vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
or myndfull Memorie:</hi> and it is nothing els but an abundance of
Reason, and as it were a hoorder vp of the continuall influences of
the Mynd: That the Mynd from whence this floweth as from his
spring, is properly that which they the sayd <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
doe terme the <hi>working or workfull Mynd,</hi> which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
power or force that can skill to extend reason from one thing
to another, and to procéede from things sensible to things vnsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
from things mouable to things vnmouable, from bodily to
spirituall, from effects to causes, and from beginnings to ends by
the meane causes. This Mynd is in respect of Reason, as cunning
is in respect of an Instrument or toole; and Reason, as in respect of
imagination and of the things that are sensible, is as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or toole in respect of the matter or stuffe that it workes vpon:
Or to speake more fitly, this Mynd is vnto Reason, as the mouer
of a thing is to the thing that is mouable, and Reason is to her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
as the mouable thing is to the thing whereunto it is moued.
For to reason or debate, is nothing els but to procéed from a thing
that is vnderstoode, to a thing that is not vnderstoode, of purpose to
vnderstand it: and the vnderstanding thereof is a resting that inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
vppon it, as a staying or resting after mouing: That both of
them as well the one as the other, are but onely one selfesame sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
and like as a man both when he moueth and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he resteth,
is all one and the same man, or as the power that moueth the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
is one selfesame still, both when it stirreth them, and when
it holdeth them still; so the reasonable or vnderstanding Soule that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:13215:158"/>
is in euery man, is but onely one selfesame substance bodylesse and
immateriall, executing his powers partly of it selfe and partly by
our bodies. And seeing that <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> make so
great estimation and account of the effects which are wrought in
vs, that they bée inforced to attribute them to some vncorruptible
and euerlasting Mynd; let vs take of them, that in very trueth the
thing which worketh so great woonders in the body, can be neither
sence, nor body, nor imagination; but a diuine, vncorruptible and
immortall mynd, as they themselues say.</p>
               <p>But let vs learne the thing of mo than them, which al wise men
teach vs, and which euery of vs can learne of himself; namely, that
this Understanding or Mynde is not one vniuersall thing as the
Sunne is that shineth into all the windowes of a Citie, but rather
a particular substance in euery seuerall man, as a light to leade him
in the darknesse of this life; for surely it was no more difficultie to
the euerlasting GOD, to create many sundrie Soules, that euery
man might haue one seuerally alone by himselfe, than to haue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but onely one Soule for all men together. But it was farre
more for his glorie, to bee knowne, praysed, and exalted of many
Soules, yea and more for our welfare to prayse, exalt and knowe
him, yea and to liue of our selues both in this life and in the life to
come: than if any other vniuersall Spirit, Soule or Mynd what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
should haue liued and vnderstoode eyther in vs or after vs.
Now then, for this matter let vs conclude, both by reason, and by
antiquitie, and by the knowledge that euery of vs hath of himselfe;
That the Soule and the Body be things diuers: That the Soule
is a Spirit and not a Body: That this Spirit hath in man three
abilities or powers, whereof two bee exercised by the body, and the
third worketh of it selfe without the body: That these three abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are in the one onely Soule as in their roote: whereof two doe
ceasse whensoeuer the body fayleth them, and yet notwithstanding
the Soule abideth whole without abateme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any of her powers,
as a Craftsman continueth a Craftsman though he want tooles to
worke withal: And finally, that this Soule is a substance that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
of it selfe, and is vnmateriall and spirituall, ouer the which
neither death nor corruption can naturally haue any power.</p>
               <p>And for a conclusion of all that euer I haue treated of hetherto
in this booke, let vs mainteyne, That there is but only one God,
who by his owne goodnesse and wisedome is the Creator and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner
of the world and of all that is therein: That in the world he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13215:158"/>
created Man, after his owne Image as in respect of mynd, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Image of his other creatures as in respect of life, sence, and
mouing; mortall so farre foorth as he holdeth the likenesse of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and immortall so farre foorth as he beareth the Image of the
Creator: that is to wit, in his Soule: That he which goeth out of
himself to see the world, doth forthwith see that there is a God, for
his workes declare him euerywhere: That he which will yet still
doubt thereof, néedeth but to enter into himselfe, and he shall meete
him there; for he shall finde there a power which he seeth not: That
he which beléeueth there is one God, beléeueth himselfe to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
for such consideration could not light into a mortal nature:
and that he which beléeueth himselfe to be immortal, beléeueth that
there is a God: for without the vnutterable power of the one God,
the mortall and immortall could neuer ioyne together: That he
which seeth the order of the world, the proportion of man, and the
harmonie that is in eyther of them compounded of so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
cannot doubt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is a Prouidence; for the nature which
hath furnished them therewith, cannot bee vnfurnished thereof it
selfe; but as it once had a care of them, so can it not shake of the same
care from them. Thus haue we thrée Articles which followe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeably
one another. Insomuch that he which proueth any
one of them, doth proue them all thrée, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that I haue
treated of euery of them seuerally by it selfe. Now, let vs pray the
euerlasting God, that wee may glorifie him in his workes in this
world, and he voutsafe of his mercie to glorifie vs one day in the
world to come.</p>

therof. The Peacocke is sayd to be proud of his gay fethers, when

vpon his féete, he casts mée downe his tayle and is ashamed. Euen
so, as long as we thinke vpon the liuelinesse of our Spirit, and the
excellencie of our Soule as in respect of the nature thereof; surely
wee haue whereof to glorifie God that gaue it vnto vs, and of his
gracious goodnesse hath voutsafed to honor vs aboue al other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
On the other side, if wee consider how this nature of ours is
straungely defiled and corrupted, and how farre it is digressed from
the first originall thereof: surely there is no remedie but we must be
ashamed of our selues, and woonder to see from how great a heigth
we be now falne and sunke downe. Euen so the best Wine becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

was the better; so much shall the corruption that lighteth

               <p>Greatly in good sooth is man bound vnto God,<note place="margin">Mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeereth in his respect to Godward.</note> if he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it; and very blynd is hée if he haue not the skill to perceiue it.
Of the great multitude of Creatures which God had created, hee
hath giuen to some but onely bare béeing; to some, both béeing and
lyfe; and to other some both béeing, lyfe, and sence; But vnto man
he hath giuen all these, and moreouer a reasonable mynd, whereby
he (and onely he héere beneath) knoweth in all things what they
haue and what they bee, which thing they themselues knowe not.
Which is an euident proof, that whatsoeuer they haue or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they be, they haue it and are it for man, &amp; not for themselues.
For to what purpose are all their vertues and excellent properties,
if they themselues knowe them not? The Sonne excellent among
the celestiall bodyes, and the Rose among flowers. The beast is a
degree aboue the Trees, and among the Beastes, one hath some
one poynt which another hath not. But what skilles it what thou
art or what thou hast, if thou knowe it not? What booteth thee the
light, if thou see it not? what art thou the better for swéete sents, if
thou smell them not? Or what auayleth it thee to excell in any
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13215:159"/>
thing if thou discerne it not? Of a trueth, only man of al the things
in this inferior World, can skill of these things and how to inioy
them; and therfore it must néedes be that they were made for none
but him; that is to wit, that to speake properly, GOD hath giuen
vnto him whatsoeuer all other creatures either haue or be; and he
hath not dealt with him simply as with a Creature, but rather as
with a Child of his, for whom he hath expresly created this worlde
and giuen it him to possesse. Now if the thing that is possessed bee
infinitely lesse than the possessor thereof; and the world is giuen to
man to possesse: how farre then doth man excell the world? And
how greatly is man bound vnto God, who created him of nothing
that is to say, not only hath giuen the world vnto man, but also gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
euen man to man himselfe? Wherefore if he acknowledge not
him to whom he is beholden, not only for this inheritance but also
euen for his owne being: what shall we say but that he is an vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and bastardly Childe, euen such a one as hath lost not onely
his right mynd, but also euen his sences? But of so many men, of
whom all and singuler persons stand bound, both ioyntly and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in the whole and for the whole of that great bond for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the Condition thereof, how fewe be there which doe once
thinke of it, and how much fewer be there which thinke well of it?
Nay, how fewe bee there which knowe that there is such a bond,
and how much fewer doe dispose themselues to acknowledge it?
And if perchaunce some one or two among many doe dispose them
selues thereunto, yet notwithstanding who is he that euer was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to atteyne vnto it, considering that it importeth a yéelding vnto
God of that which is his due: that is to wit, the imploying of our
selues and of all that he hath giuen vnto vs, euen our whole being
and life, our Sences, our Reason, our doings, and finally all that
euer we haue both within and without vs, in his seruice? and that
wee contrarywise turne all things to our selues as to their proper
ende, yea and euen our selues to our selues which are nothing? If
we kept a reckoning of our life, how small a part thereof do we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
vpon God? How fewe of our steppes doe wee walke in his
seruice? How fewe of our thoughts are directed vnto him? And if
wée looke vppon our very prayers, what are they but continuall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
seeing that euen in the middest of our greatest vehemencie,
we vanish away by and by into vayne imaginations, and are caried
as farre away from our prayers into wandering conceyts, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is distant from earth, and further? What Sonne will not fall
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13215:160"/>
out with him that speakes euill of his Father? or els all that stand
by will count him a coward if he passe it ouer with silence? Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise,
which of vs is moued when he heareth Gods name blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed?
or if he be moued, that setteth himselfe in defence of him:
or if he set himselfe in defence, doth not by and by forget it? What
then doth this argewe, but that in very trueth, our Soule liueth
not, but our Body; and that our Soule hath not her mouings and
actions free and liuely, seeing it is not moued at the iniuries that
are done to the Soule and to the father that made the Soule, but
at the wrongs that are done to the body and to the father of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
If a man breake the Scutchions of our Armes, wee take it to
bee a great disgrace to vs, and a touching of our credite; and if hée
breake our Images or Pictures, we fall out with him and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be reconciled: And if it be done to a Prince, he makes it a poynt
of high Treason; and that we doe not the like, it is not for want of
pride, but for want of power to reuenge it. On the contrary parte,
which of vs is greeued at the wrong that is done to his neyghbor,
or rather which wrongeth not his neyghbor euery day? Or which
is much moued when he seeth a man slayne before his face, vnlesse
he be his brother or néere friend? Nay, which of vs our selues doth
not daylie kill his brother, eyther in very déede, or in heart, eyther
with the Sword I meane, or by hatred, euen for the least offence
that can be pretended, and so teareth or breaketh not the Image of
God which he hath paynted and ingraued in man, euen euery ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
without any regard? Now what els is this, but that we know
not this Image of God to bee in our selues? For otherwise how
durst wee bee so presumptuous, as to offer any hurt or harme vnto
it, but because the secret consent of all mankinde in such outrage,
confesseth it to be quite and cleane forgone, or at leastwise to bee so
disfigured and defaced, and so straungely berayed, that it can scarsly
bee discerned any more? And because the kindred that is betwéene
all men, deriued from the father of their Soules, moueth vs very
little, but the vyle kindred of the flesh moueth vs very much, which
is as farre inferiour to the other, as there is oddes betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule
and a lump of earth, or betwéene the fathers of eyther of them; that
is to wit, betwéene GOD and Man: Yet notwithstanding, seeing
that the wickeddest man in the world, and such a one as seemeth to
bee touched with nothing, hauing once slayne him whom he hated
most of all men, doth by and by after the deede done, feele a hart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

byting in his mynd, and a torment in his Conscience; which thing
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:13215:160"/>
he feeleth not for the killing of a thousand beastes euery day; what
can we say to be the cause thereof, but only the remaynder of Gods
Image common to all men, which putteth him in mynd of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
that he hath done, and is highly offended at his owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and which (according to this saying <hi>The good blud lyeth
not</hi>) maketh our indytement of it self, and would fayne euen it self
be reuenged of vs within vs? Therfore let vs say (which thing we
cannot denye vnlesse wee denye our selues) that God created man
to be to him as a Child, and that man is growne out of kynd, yea
straungely growne out of kynd, not regarding (as wee see in most
men) to bee knowne eyther of his father or of his brethren, (which
thing notwithstanding the bastards of this world do seeke to their
vttermost to doe) but by his will going about to abolish his pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
and al his titles of kindred, that he might be called the Sonne
of the earth,<note place="margin">The sonne of the earth.</note> (which was the name of Bastards in old tyme) rather
than the some of him that begate him, and created so many things
for him to inioye. For proofe whereof to be true, what ame we at in
all our studies and indeuers, but the earth and earthly things? Had
we continued still in our originall creation, wee should according to
the spirituall substaunce of our Soules, haue naturally pursewed
spirituall things, yea and haue mounted vp aboue the very heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. But where seeke wee now our inheritance, our welfare,
and our felicitie, but in these transitorie things? And whereof are al
our suites and quarrels in this world, but of Cattell, of Corne and
of Land? Wherefore we must néedes confesse, that it is a witnesse
of the dishereting of Mankynd from the heritage of his father, and
that he is in his fathers displeasure and dissauour, and that he doth
but runne after Peasecoddes as the prodigall Childe did, when he
had wasted his inheritance licentiously.</p>
               <p>But now to come to those which make most profession of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse;
whence (thinke we) commeth the distrust that all of vs haue
naturally of Gods goodnesse and assistance; but of the feeling of our
iust disherison, which our conscience is greeued at within vs? The
sonne of a good and rich father behighteth himselfe as much reléefe
as his father is able to yéeld, and as he himselfe hath néede of. If
not; but that the Child doubt thereof: we presume so farre of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
goodnesse, that we conclude that his sonne hath offended him,
and made himself vnworthy of his goodnesse by some great cryme.
Now then, seeing that God is the very goodnesse and riches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
wherof commeth it that no man can assure himself of them?
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13215:161"/>
that no man can rest himself boldly enough vpon him? that no man
can trust vnto him so assuredly as his goodnesse requireth? and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
that our requestes are so full of distrust, and our hearts so full
of vnbeléefe? Surely, séeing the fault cannot be in Gods goodnesse,
which is a fountayne that cannot be dreyned drye: it must néedes be
that the fault remayneth alonly in the naughtinesse and frayltie of
our selues, which dare not hope for good at the hand of him which
is most excellently good, because our whole nature telleth vs that
we bee vnworthie of his grace, by reason we haue offended him too
gréeuously.</p>
               <p>If we consider the gouernment and order of the World,<note place="margin">In respect of the World.</note> wee
may euen there also find apparantly, that man holdeth not himself
in his state, but is falne from the seate of honour wherein God had
placed him. God had set him aloft, aboue the Stones, aboue the
Plantes, aboue the Brute beastes, yea and aboue the world it selfe.
If he abyde still in his degree, whence commeth it that so many
men make themselues bondflaues to Gold and other mettals? and
that so many men doe leade the life of Plants and brute beastes in
the bodyes of men? some giuing themselues to nought els than to
eating, drinking and sléeping, and neuer lifting themselues vp any
higher; and othersome consuming and wasting themselues in most
beastly delights &amp; pleasures? For what beast is there that would
be a Plant, or Plant that shooteth not vp to get out of the ground?
To be short, what thing is there in the whole world sauing onely
man, which doth not very precisely kéepe the owne state and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree?
I pray you if a man should see one with a princely Crowne
al myry on his head, tilling the ground and following the Plough;
what would he thinke but that he were deposed from his Throne,
and that some mischief were befalne him? And what then is to be
sayd of that man, which toyleth in Doonghils and skulketh into
corners to wallowe himselfe in a thousand sorts of filthines, and
imployeth all his wit vpon such things: but that he is falne from
the toppe of his mynde, and that by the greeuonsnes of that fall, he
hath so lamed and maymed all his abilities, that it lyeth not in him
to returne againe from whence he is falne? For who can deny but
he is borne to greater things than hee doeth? Or who can thinke
that GOD hath giuen him an immortall Soule, to the intent he
should imploy himselfe altogether about things which are not so
much as worthy to be mortall? Or a countenance which he calleth
continually to the mynding of Heauen, to looke groueling on the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13215:161"/>
myre? Or a Scepter, to play the dizard with it in a Playe? Or a
triple Mace to rake Dounghilles withall, or too digge the ground
withall?</p>
               <p>Againe, how is the Lawe and order of gouernement which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
forth in the whole world and in all the partes thereof, turned
vpside downe in man who is the Litle World, by the disobedience
of the Body to the Soule? In Plantes, in Trees, and in brute
beastes, the soule distributeth nurrishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by proportion. Their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
obeye the direction of their Soules without geynsaying, and
euery abilitie performeth his duetie accordingly. The nurrishing
abilitie followeth his appetites, and goeth not beyond them. The
sensitiue followeth his naturall delights, but it violateth them not.
But as for man, what shall wee say of him? Surely that his body
commaundeth his Soule, as if the Plough should drawe the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as they say; that his will suffereth it selfe to be ruled by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites;
that his reason is an vnderling to his sences, and that his
very whole nature is most commonly quite out of order. So must
we needes confesse an ouerthrowe of nature, in him for whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
nature it selfe was made, and that man was swarued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
from his right way, seeing that all other partes of the World
doe followe their Nature, and that Nature itselfe teacheth vs it.
What is to be sayd then, but that man is not onely falne from the
state wherein he was, to be set in lower degree than he was afore;
but also that he is falne in himselfe and from himselfe, in and from
his owne peculiar nature? Moreouer it is manifest that the world
was created for mans vse; for the world knoweth not it selfe, nor
the creatures that are therein. And ageine, as for the Angels, they
needed it not; and as for the brute beastes, they haue no skill to vse
it. Onely man hath vnderstanding to vse the seruice thereof, and a
body that hath neede of their seruice. Sith it is so, who can doubt
that God created man with a knowledge of his creatures, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
gaue him power ouer them? Whereof commeth it then that the
beastes doe naturally knowe their seasons, the remedies of their
diseases, and the Herbes that haue a proprietie of nature to heale
them; and that only man among all other liuing things, knoweth
them not, insomuch as he is fayne to goe to Schoole to the brute
beastes to learne them? Also whereof commeth it that these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(which surely GOD made not to be snares to man, for that
had bene repugnant to the goodnes of the Creator, but for mans
benefite and seruice) doe now kicke and spurne ageinst man, yea
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13215:162"/>
euen those which haue no power or stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth at all to withstand him?
Let vs omit Woolues, Leopards, and Lyons, which seeme to haue
some force to ouermatch the weakenes of man. What meaneth it
that wormes make vs warre within our Bowels, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vermin deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
our Corne, and that the earth yeeldeth vs not any kind of fruit
which hath not a peculiar enemie in it, to marre it ere it come to
our hand: but to driue vs to confesse, that man must needes haue
offended his maker right greeuously, and that whereas Gods put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his creatures in subiection to man, was to the end that man
should haue continued in obedience vnto GOD, now because man
hath rebelled against Gods Maiestie, God also suffereth those to
rebell against man, whom he had put in subiection to man, yea euen
to the very off kourings of the earth? For what els is this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of the earth to him that tilleth it, of the Sea to him that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it, and of the aire to the successe of all our labours and trauels,
but a protestation of whole nature, that it disdeineth to serue a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that was so presumptuous as to disobey his Creator; a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I say, which by doing seruice to the creatures, hath forgone
the authoritie which he had receiued of this Maker?</p>
               <p>Now consequently let vs consider man towards man.<note place="margin">In respect of Man.</note> What is
there more disordered or more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to nature, than is the nature
of man himselfe? If beastes of one kind doe kill or eate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
wee take it for an ougly thing. What an ouglynesse then
ought it to be vnto vs, when wee see how men (who alonly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with reason,) doe euery howre kill one another, and roote out
one another? Nay rather is it not a great wonder to see good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
and frendship, not among Nations, not betwéene Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
not among Companies; but euen in households, yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Chamberfellowes? Wolues are cruell: but yet in what
race of Wolues shall wee find <hi>Caribies</hi> and <hi>Cannibals?</hi> Lyons
also are cruell: but yet where were they euer seene in Battell one
against another? Now what is warre, but a gathering and pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp together of all the sorts of beastlines that are in the world?
And yet what is more common among men than that? A Beast
(say some) will barke or grunt ere he byte; a house will cracke ere
it fall downe; and the Wind whistleth ere it breake things. But
contrariwise what is man towards man? who euen in laughing,
threatneth, in saluting sleaeth, &amp; vnder faire countenance of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
interteynement, cloketh a thousand Serpents, a thousand
Lyons, a thousand Quickesands, and a thousand Rockes at once?
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:13215:162"/>
Well: let vs leaue the wicked which discouer themselues too
much. What doe wee in all our bargayning, buying and selling,
but beguyle one another? or what doe we in our dalying, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
one another? And what els is the whole societte of man which
we so highly commend, but a selfgaine, and a very incroching one
vppon another, the greater sort as tyrants vppon the meaner, the
meaner vpon the inferiour sort, and the inferiour sort one vppon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
too take him in some trippe? To bee short, if wee doe any
good, it is but to the end to bee seene; asfor in secret, wee will doe
none at all. Ageine, if wee forbeare to doe euill, it is but for feare
least the World should knowe it; and were that feare away, wee
would stick at nothing. Wherto then serueth vs our reason which
should further vs vnto all goodnes, but to couer our naughtinesse,
that is to say, to make vs woorse and more vnreasonable? yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
how vnreasonable so euer wee bee in all our doings,
we cannot but knowe that there is a reason; and were it not in vs,
we could not conceiue it; and were it not corrupted, we should not
swarue from it; and yet if we examine oure selues, we shalnot bee
able to deny, but that we digresse very farre from it. Therefore we
may well deeme of our reason, as of an eysight that is either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred
or inchaunted. It hath the ground of sight still; but yet it
standeth the partie in no stead, but onely to beguyle him by false
images and illusions.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to man in himselfe,<note place="margin">Man in respect of himself.</note> and see whether at leastwise he
loue himselfe better than other men: and the more wee stirre him,
the more shall we feele the stinche of his corruption. When a disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
man feeles peine, wee say there is corruption in his body; and
furthermore that there is a default in Nature, or that the partie
hath taken some great surfet, which hath brought him to that case.
Nowthen what shal we say of the great nomber of diseases wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
mankind is peyned, and wherewith he is so wholy ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that there is not any age of his life, any part of his body, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
small string in any part of his flesh, which hath not some peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
disease? Nay I say further, that man alone is subiect too mo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
than all other liuing things in this World togither. The
Philosophers sawe it, and haue made bookes expresly thereof, and
are vtterly amased and graueled in seeking out the cause thereof;
and they could neuer yet yéelde any Reason thereof which might
satisfie others or themselues. Neuerthelesse the most parte of
them come to this point, that man is the most vnhappiest of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:13215:163"/>
wights; and they find fault with God and nature for it, whom
notwithstanding they confesse to haue doone nothing but iustly in
that behalfe. One sayes, that onely Man fleaeth himselfe through
impatience of greef. Another sayes, That the lyfe of man is such,
as that death is rather to bee desired of him than lyfe. And of such
speeches doe all their Schooles ring. There is another which with
great woonderment, reckeneth vp certeine hundreds of diseases
whereunto the eye alone is subiect. Now which of all the beastes
hath so much as the thirtith part of them in his body? Is it likely
that God, which hath giuen to Man so great preheminence aboue
all his creatures, created him of purpose to torment him aboue all
other creatures? Or rather is it not to be sayd, that man in his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
was created farre after another sort than he now is, whether
it be in respect of the Creator himselfe, or of the ende for which hee
created him? Surely then, let vs say as we haue sayde afore, that
the very cause why Man alone hath mo diseases in his body, than
all other Creatures toogither; is for that hee hauing abused Gods
gracious gifts, hath doone more euill than all they could skill too
doe: and that the very euill and vntowardnes that is in them, is
but to punish man withall: as for example, the Hayle and Snowe
serue not to hurt the earth or the fruites of the earth, but to punish
him that should take the benefite of them.</p>
               <p>Againe, when we come to consider the Soule and the body knit
together; what a number of affections doe we méete withall there,
(which as saith <hi>Plutark)</hi> are so much more sorowfull and gréeuous
than the bodily diseases, as the Soule is more sinfull and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
than the bodie? To bring these passions to some reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
order, the Philosophers haue made bookes expresly of Morall
vertue, and giuen precepts (say they) to bring them to obedience:
wherein they confesse the rebelliousnesse that is naturally in vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
reason. But who feeleth not in himselfe, that their remedies
serue not so much to take away the mischief, as to cloke it? Which
is a playne declaration, that it is not a spot which may bee washed
away, but a déepe impression bronded in nature as it were with a
fearing yron, which in very déede is not to bee wyped out agayne,
but couered; nor to be subdewed and ouercome, but with much a do
to be restreyned and hild short. Furthermore, seeing that reason is
so much more excellent than passion or affection, as the forme shape
or fashion (say they) is more excellent than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter or stuffe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is: whence commeth this infection in vs, that maketh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:13215:163"/>
to ouermayster the forme, and causeth the forme (as ye would
say) to receyue shape and fashion of the matter; that is to say, which
putteth reason in subiection to affection, &amp; to the impressions which
affection yéeldeth, contrary to the order which is obserued in all the
whole world beside? For what els is this Intemperance of ours,
but reason (such as it now remayneth) imprinted with lust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence?
And what els is anger, but reason atteynted with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and so foorth of the rest? And if a man will say, that these things
are naturall in vs; whereof commeth it that of these affections, wee
conceyue inwardly remorse, and outwardly shame; yea and that so
naturally, as wee must of necessitie néedes feele them whether wee
will or no, and can no more let them than we can restreyne the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our Pulses or the panting of our Hearts: but because that
shame and remorse for sinne are naturall in vs, but the sinne it selfe
is against nature? As for example, there be things the doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is in vs vyce; and in brute Beasts, nature: for they be angry, they
aduenge themselues, and they company together indifferently and
in open sight: and of so doing they bee not ashamed, because it is
their nature. Now, were these affections and fleshly pleasures as
naturall in vs as in the Beastes; as little should we bee ashamed of
them, as they. But contrarywise, if an honest man come in while
wee bee angrie, by and by our rage is repressed, as who would say
our vyce did hyde it selfe from him: and if a man come vpon vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
in taking our pleasure (yea though it bee well lawfull) wee
blush, as if our blud were desirous to hide and to couer our doings.
Yea and how secretly soeuer we be alone by our selues in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of our vyces; wee incounter continually with a companyon in our
selues, which not only beareth witnesse of them, but also condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and punisheth them in vs. Soothly then, the motions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and lust against reason in man, are not naturall nor originall,
that is to say,<note place="margin">Diodorus lib. 4.</note> they procéede not of his first creation; but are come in
afterward by corruption.<note place="margin">Herodotus in his Clio.</note> And therefore the remorse which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnto vs in those passions, is nothing but a secrete (howbeit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
liuely) warning of nature, which is ashamed to play the brute
beast; which thing she would not be, if those things were originally
of mans nature. And in very déede, the vniuersall consent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
in being ashamed to goe naked,<note place="margin">Austin in his woork of the Citie of God, lib. 14. Chap. 17. and 18.</note> insomuch that they had leuer
to see the skinne of a Beast, or the excrement of a Woorme vppon
themselues, than to sée their owne flesh: and the thing which Saint
<hi>Austin</hi> noteth in all men; namely, that they will rather doe open
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13215:164"/>
wrong in all mens sight, than haue to doe with their lawful wines
openly; doe euidently shewe that the beastlinesse (that is to say the
concupiscence or lust) that is in carnall copulation, is not an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
nature, but a mere corruption thereof. Which thing our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
age (but surely nothing to her prayse) may better proue vnto
vs, than al the reasons in the world. For certeynly, considering the
excessiue ouerflowing of vices which is to be seene, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> customable
vse of them, yea euen of such as are against nature, turned almost
into nature; if euer voluptuousnesse could haue transformed it selfe
into nature, and preuayled against nature, it must néedes haue bene
in this our age; wherein notwithstanding, as strongly armed, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised,
and reigning as vyce seemeth to be, yet is she inforced to
hyde herselfe euen in the middest of her tryumphs, vndoubtedly as
acknowledging that she reigneth not ouer her owne, but ouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans.</p>
               <p>Agayne, if ye haue an eye to friendship, to charitie, to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp of Children, to societie in Mariage; who will not say that
for all our trayning vp to leade vs thereto, and for all our reading
to instruct vs therein, yet we had néede to resort to the brute beastes
to learne of them, and to take example of them, which is a token
(as I sayd afore) that their nature is lesse corrupt than ours? If the
case concerne the turning away from the vyces of Intemperance;
Lecherie, Drunkennesse, Incest, &amp; such others: who would thinke
that our nature being so excellent, and (besides the discourse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(hauing so many Lawes, Statutes, Penalties, &amp; Magistrates
to helpe it; and being brydled with so many daungers, sorowes and
paynes insewing the same; should yet notwithstanding not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned:
whereas on the contrary part, the brute beastes doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
forbeare both foode and pleasure, sauing onely so farre foorth
as nature requireth, that is to wit, for the maintenance and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of them selues and of their kind? And séeing their nature
doth so vphold it selfe, and that our nature beeing stayed so many
wayes, and closed in with so many barres, cannot bee vpheld nor
kept within compasse: who can say that our nature (in case as it is
nowe,) is not in worse plyght than theirs is? And yet who wil say
that the Nature of the excellentest of all other Creatures, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bene such from the first originall beginning thereof? All the
sayd things are comon both to Man and Beast: but yet moreouer,
Man glorieth of an excellencie of mynd inriched by God with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
goodly gifts. What is to be said then, if in the thing whereby
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13215:164"/>
he surmounteth them, he be found inferiour to them? Or if in that
which of it self is vncorruptible, corruption be most open and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?
Of so many men indewed with Reason, I pray you how
many be there that vse it? That is to say, Of so many men, how
many be not brute beastes? Or what rarer thing is there among
men, than a very man in deede? And of such as vse Reason, how
many be there that vse it well; that is to say, how many bee there
which be not Diuels? Now take mee out of mankind the beastes
and the diuels, and who will thinke it straunge that a Philosopher
tooke a Torch at high nooneday, to seeke for a Man in the middes
of a multitude? One sort all their life long doe set their mynd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
nothing but this lyfe; they spare not so much tyme as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what that power is which woorketh that thought in them.
What booteth it these more to haue a mynd, than it booteth a man
to haue eyes that doth nothing but sléepe? Others imploy it about
the defyling of some mans wife, or the deflowring of some maiden,
or the glosing of some wrong, or the eluding of some right, or the
sowing of discord in some household, or the setting of fyre on the
fower corners of some Realme. To what purpose ageine is it for
these men to haue a mynd, which is bent and intended to nothing
but mischief? Or what els is such a mynd, than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye of the<note n="*" place="margin">The Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleb and also the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryce.</note> beast
of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> which killeth those whom it looketh vpon, and it self also
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rebounding back of his owne sight? Some in deede doo lift vp
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye of their mynd aloft; but how farre or what see they? Surely
(as saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> euen as much as an Owle in the bright sunne.
The Edge of vnderstanding rebateth at the outside of the least
things that are: and how then shall it be able to enter into them?
Our mynd is dazeled with vapors; and what will it be then at the
vnaprochable light for which it was created? GOD created the
World for man; therefore his intent was that man should haue
the seruice thereof: and that he might haue the seruice of things, it
behoued him to knowe them. Contrariwise, what thing doe wee
knowe-sufficiently? What knowe wee in comparison of that wee
knowe not? And how can wée vse the seruice of them, seeing euen
the least things commannd vs; not the Beastes, the Herbes, and
the Stones only, but also euen the Earth and the very drosse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
God hath created man for his owne glory; and as man is the
end of the World, so is GOD the end of Man. And it is not to be
doubted, but that as God gaue man knowledge of the worlde, that
hee might vse it too his behoofe; so hee gaue him knowledge of his
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13215:165"/>
Godhead, that he might serue him. But how many be there which
ame at this marke? and how shall wee hit it if wee ame not at it?
and how shall we ame at it, if we see it not? and how shall wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ee
it, if we thinke not on it nor passe not for it? Againe, let vs bend
our wittes to it as stoutly as we can; who is he that féeleth not him
selfe to quayle, when he is to think vpon God? Who is he that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
not, if hee streyne himselfe to farre? And whereof commeth
this, but that the string of this Bowe hath falne into the Watter,
and is made so wet that it wil serue to no purpose any more? This
mynd bringeth foorth deedes; and because they be somewhat slow,
they be done with the more aduisement. But what are the best of
those deedes but sinne? If wée commit any cryme, all our whole
mynd goeth with it, and our doing of the euill is for the euils sake.
But if we doe any good; which of vs doth it not as a bywoorke for
some other things sake, rather than for the loue of the good itselfe;
as one for honour, another for gaine, and a third for feare? And
what elles is this, but a seruing of vanitie, and not an obeying of
vertue? And whereas euill is nought els than a bereuing or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of good: who is hée on the contrarie part, which thinketh not
himself a man goodynough, if he doe no euill? As who would say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
good also were nothing els but the bereuing or absence of euil. And
in very deede whome doe we call good and honest men, but such as
absteyne from dooing men wrong, from stealing, from extorting,

in onely refreyning or ceassing, but in woorking and performing.
And in effect, what els is it to define an honest man to be such a one
as doth nothing atal; than to define a good Archer to be such a one
as neuer shooteth at all? This mind of ours doth also yéeldfoorth
words: and they passe out more swiftly than déedes, yea euen from
the wisest. If a man would keepe a reckening of his words but for
one day; what should hee find at night but a heape of vanities, as
backebytings, slaunders, leasings, raylings, besides a thousand
sortes of slipperdeuices and idle words, which euen by their onely

whereas speech was giuen vs to procure and mainteyne societie,
we see it is commonly applyed to the breaking thereof, by sowing
of discord and debate: who can deny but that there is a notable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13215:165"/>
in the mynd, which vttereth forth that speeche? Ageine,
séeing it is an vniuersal vyce, ageinst which the better sort do striue
with all their force and cannot ouercome it: who can say it is a vice
that is incident but to some peculiar persones, and not to the whole
kynd of man? What is to be sayd then of our thoughts and witts,
whereof whole thousands passe through our mynd in an hower,
which our mynds can neither represse nor expresse? O how many
doe we esteeme to be good men, whome we should sée to be wicked
men if their thoughts lay open, or if we had eyes to see into them?
O what a sort of wilde beastes should wee see harbered in a mans
heart as in a Forest? And what is then our skil, but ignorance; our
wizdome, but vanitie; and our holines, but hipocrisie? Wherein
consisteth our vertue, but in concealing our vyces, whenas in truth
(as sayth <hi>Aristotle)</hi> it were both more for our behoof and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
to rightuousnes, if we layd them open? Moreouer, what
is all our inforcing of our selues to vanquish our vices, but a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to outronne our owne shadowe, which (doe we what we can)
will alwayes accompany vs whether wee will or no? And surely
we ought to be ashamed, not so much for that wee bee such, as for
that either we knowe not our selues to be such, or be not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ashamed that we be such. Neither is there a stronger proof of our
corruption, than that: in like maner as we déeme them to be filthie
and stinking, which are raking in Priuies and féele not the stinche
of them: and those to be more sick which féele not themselues sick,
than those which are most peyned with their disease: and those too
be more frantick which find not them selues to be braynsicke, than
those whiche seeke to the Phisition for the curing of their frenzie.
For had we the wit to consider our chaunges, to féele the vnéeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our Pulses, and to obserue the steamingvp of our humors
with the impressions which they make in our brayne: wée should
by such discerning of our diseases, become halfe sikfolke and halfe

to Stone, and Penny to Penny, no more minding the life of our
Soule, than if wee had no Soule at all. If any man doe yet still
doubt hereof, I offer him a condition, which if he will put in tryall,
I dare assure him hee will doubt thereof no more. Let hym but set
downe in writing, all the thoughts and imaginations that come in
his head by the space of one day, and at night let hym reuiew them
and take the account of them; And I dare vndertake he shall fynd
in them so many vanities, so many crymes, so many Hobgoblins,
and so many Monsters; so straunge, so fond, so foule, and so oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that he shalbe afraid of himselfe like the beast that starkleth at
the sodeine sight of himself in a lookingglasse; and that he shal not
stand gasing, enamored at his owne beautie as <hi>Narcissus</hi> did; but
ronne away ashamed of his foule deformitie, to séeke where to wash
away the myre that he hath wallowed in. What a thing then were
it, if he considered it thus all the weeke long without putting it in
writing. And how much more were it, if hee should doe it a whole
yere; and finally all his whole life? To be short, to set man in fewe
words before our eyes, we reade comonly that there are fower po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wres
or abilities in mans Soule, namely, Wit, Will, the abilitie
of béeing angrie, and the abilitie of lusting, and in these fower wée
lodge fower vertues, that is to say, in Wit, Wizdome; in Will,
Rightfulnesse; in the abilitie of being angrie, Hardinesse; and in
the abilitie of Lusting, Stayednesse. Now, Wit is maymed with
ignorance; Will, with wrongfulnes; Hardinesse, with Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
and Stayednesse, with Licentiousnes; so as in this worlde
they can neither be cured without skarre, nor be brought to a skar.
Also we perceiue there are in man the outward sences, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Appetite, which thrée the brute beasts haue as well as he,
ouer and besides the which, hee hath also wit and will as peculiar
giftes giuen him of God. And if we be men, we estéeme our selues
better than beastes, and looke to haue them to be our vnderlings.
Contrariwise, whereas Imagination ought to rule the Sences,
and Reason to rule Imagination, and will to rule Appetite: now
the outward sence carieth away Imagination, Imagination Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Appetite will, insomuch that the onely sence being bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
or beguyled, carieth a man headlong into all euill after the
maner of <hi>Phaeton</hi> whom the Poets speakeof. It is a playne case
therefore, that man hath made himselfe an vnderling to the beast,
and consequently that mankind is turned strangely vpsidedowne,
and doubtlesse farre more monstruously, than if we sawe him goe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13215:167"/>
vpon his head with his heeles vpward. Nowthen, seeing that man
is so ouerturned, whereof can he brag, but of offending God vnces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
in this life, and of infinite punishment in another lyfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the infinitenesse of him whom he hath offended? And to
what purpose therefore shall his immortalitie serue him, but to dye
euerlastingly and neuer to be dead?</p>
               <p>But let vs leaue this matter to another place.<note place="margin">Whence mans corruption co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</note> And forasmuch
as by considering man what he is to Godward, to the worldward,
to Manward, and to himselfe, I haue euidently proued his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; frowardnesse; namely, that he is vtterly contrary to the ende
to which he was created of God, to the order of the whole World,
to the welfare of all Mankinde, and to his owne benefite: Let vs
henceforth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider from whence and from what tyme this mischief
may haue befalne him, and what may haue bene the cause thereof.
Certesse, if we say it came of God and that he had it of his creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
we blaspheme God too too grossely. For God is good, and the very
goodnesse it selfe: and therfore he cannot haue made any thing euill.
Also it appeareth throughout the whole gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the world,
that he is the mayster and mainteyner of order. And therefore how
is it possible that he should make the little world (namely man) to
be a mould of confusion and disorder? Agayne, no other thing than
his owne glorie and the welfare of man, moued him to create man;
and yet man beeing in case as hee is, forbeareth not to blaspheme
Gods name, and to purchase his owne destruction. Néedes then
must it be that Man was made a farre other creature at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
than he is now: as in very déede the Husbandman createth
not the wiuell in the Corne, nor the Uintener the sowernesse in the
Wine, nor the Smith the rust in the yron; but they come in from
elswhere. Neuerthelesse, the man that neuer dranke other drinke
than Uineger, would think it to be the naturall sap and taste of the
Grape. And wee likewise who neuer felt other in ourselues than
corruption, and are bred and brought vp in darknesse like the <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merians,</hi>
would beare ourselues on hand, that GOD is the cause
and author thereof. Now, let vs which haue tasted both the Wine
and the Uineger, iudge what maner of creatures we may haue bin
in our first creation: in doing whereof there is yet notwithstanding
this great difference, that the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of our soule,
is vnable to do eyther of them both the one, because corruption can
not iudge of cleannesse; and the other, because it cannot iudge well
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13215:168"/>
of it selfe. In Wine and Uineger we discerne a liquid nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them both: but as concerning their qualities, the Wine is
swéete, warme, and friendly to nature; whereas the Uineger is
sharpe, cold, and corrosiue: yea and the very colours of them are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
one another. Lo here two things vtterly contrary; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the Uineger is nothing els but Wine altered from
his nature. And because we haue seene the one as wel as the other;
we will neuer bee made to beléeue, that the Uineger was Uineger
from the very Grape. Let vs iudge of our Soules with like discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We finde there a spirituall nature, immateriall and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall;
and that is the onely remaynder of her first originall. But yet
this Spirit of ours is foreward to nothing but euill, nor inclyned
to any other thau bace and transitorie things. It clingeth to the
earth, and is a bondslaue to the body. To be short, in stead of stying
vp, it crauleth I wote not how, contrary to the nature of a Spirit,
which mounteth vp on high, and cannot bee shut vp in these vyle
and drossie things. Therefore it must néedes bee sayd, that this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ours was not so of nature; it departed not such as it now is
from the hand of the workmayster: but contrarywise, good, frée,
pure, and indewed with farre other qualities than it hath now: for
now it is steyned with naughtinesse, bondage of sinne, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Nay will some man say, seeing it was created cléere from all
corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who was able to corrupt it as we see it to be now? Sure
wee be that it is a spirituall nature: and therefore neyther the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
nor any other bodie, could naturally do any hurt vnto it; and
as little also could tyme doe any thing thereto: for tyme is nothing
but the mouing of bodies. Moreouer it was free of it selfe, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the bodie, and therefore could not receyue her first corruption
from the bodie. And yet notwithstanding wee see, that as now it is
subiect to be corrupted, both of her owne flesh and of the vanities of
the world, which by nature had no power ouer it. Néeds then must
the maker of nature himselfe, haue giuen a power to these things
aboue their nature, whereby they might preuayle agaynst the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Soule; the doing whereof surely could not but haue bin
rightfull in him, considering that he is the very rightuousnesse it
selfe. For Iustice layeth not any punishment, but where some fault
or offence hath gone afore. Therefore it must néedes bee sayd, that
man had committed some hey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s crime against his maker, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
such penaltie and bondage were appoynted iustly vnto him.
And therefore let vs say, that the Soule of man being the first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13215:168"/>
of it self, did of it owne accord vanish away as Wine turneth
in it selfe and of it self into Uineger: whereas if the Soule had hild
her selfe in awe and vnder couerture, and had rested on her Lées as
is sayd of Wine; that is to say, if she had abidden stedfast in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her maker, without seeking her welfare in her selfe: she might
haue continued vtterly vncorrupted still. And agayne, that by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so away from GOD to her selfe, she offended her maker, and
forwent the gracious giftes which she had receyued of him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
followed the curse of the Creator, and the sentence of his iust
wrath vppon his creature; wherethrough it came to passe, that the
same was not onely bereft of all the grace wherewith it was reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by beholding it selfe in him, but also was made an vnderling
to the selfesame things which were made to haue done it seruice.
Now what this sinne was, wee cannot better vnderstand, than by
the punishment thereof. For punishment and sinne haue a mutuall
respect one to another, as a sore and a salue, and may after a sort be
knowne the one by the other. Order would that our wit should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
GOD, and that all our sences and appetites should obey our
reason: but wee see that as now our sences and appetites hold rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
vnder foote. This punishment ought to set our fault before our
eyes, when as wee see our selues falne downe and thrust vnder our
selues; namely, that man intended to haue mounted vp aboue God.
The same order would also that all the whole world and worldly
things should haue serued man, and man haue serued GOD; that
God might haue bene the marke of man, as man should haue bene
the marke for all other things to haue amed at. But wee see that at
this day man is an vnderling to the least things that are: insomuch
that euen those which haue neither sence nor life doe resist him, and
he pitcheth the ende of all his desires in earthly things, as if they
were of more valewe than himselfe, accordingly as all of vs know,
that the end is alwaies better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the things that tend to the same.
Séeing then that nature is reuolted from man, it is certeyne that
man is reuolted from God: for it is the ordinary punishment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Subiects, that their owne seruaunts and vnderlings also
do kicke and spurne agaynst them. And moreouer, seeing that man
not only findeth all maner of mischiefe and misfortune in himselfe,
but is also so blynd as to seeke his felicitie in the myre, and in the
durtie dunghils of this world; it is a token that he sought his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
in himself, and elswhere than in God? To bee short, wée bée
striken in our Soules with ignorance of the things that are most
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:13215:169"/>
néedfull for vs; and in our bodies with continuall infirmities, and
finally with death: and that is because we haue bene curious in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
trifeling things, as not contented with the lesson that GOD
had giuen vs; and would néedes haue made our selues immortall,
howbeit not by the euerlasting power of Gods quickening spirit,
but by the forbidden vse of transitorie things, yea euen which had
no life in them. Thus see we now whereof the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
is come, namely euen of our owne transgression, and of the
punishment that followed vpon the same.</p>
               <p>But it is demaunded of vs yet further,<note place="margin">How long ago corruption came into ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> how long it is ago since
this befell. If wee had espyed this corruption in vs but from some
certeyne hundred yéeres hence; it were not for vs to seeke any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for it. But let vs hold on our course vp the streame of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
euen to the Riuers head, and wee shall finde it still alwaies
foule and muddy; and we shal from age to age heare these outcryes
euen among the best, <hi>I loue well the good, but I cannot doe it;</hi>
and (to bee short) <hi>that man is inclyned to doe euill, and subiect
to receyue euill;</hi> which are in one word both the fault and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Agayne, were it but in some households, or but in some
Nations only, men would not sticke to father the fault vppon the
Clymate and the Soyle, or vppon the misteaching or misexample
of the Parents. But when we see that in that respect all men are in
one selfesame taking, aswell the men of old tyme as the men of our
daies, sauing that sinne increaseth continually, as well vnder the
Equinoctiall lyne as betwéene both the Tropicks, and as well on
the further side as on the hether side of them, sauing that some take
more payne to keepe it from sight tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, and that those which
haue most wit are woorst; forasmuch as I haue alreadie sufficiently
proued the creation of the world and of the first man: wee be driuen
to mount vp agayne to the same man, and to say that as he is the
roote of our ofspring, so is he also the welspring of this corruption
which reigneth in vs, as in whom our whole race was both attein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with sinne, and attached with punishment. In this behalfe it is
not for vs to pleade against GOD, but to submit our shoulders to
his Iustice, and to lift vp our eyes to his mercie. For necessarily
from poynt to poynt doth this consequence ensewe: The Soule is
corrupted in all mankynd: Who is so corrupted that he feeleth it
not? This corruption cannot procéed from the Creator. For when
did euer purenesse yéeld forth corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The other creatures could
not haue defiled it. For what maketh a thing vncleane, but the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:13215:169"/>
of vncleannesse vnto it? and what causeth the taking of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse
vnto it, but the touching thereof? and what touching one
of another can there be betwéene a Spirit and a Bodie? It remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
therefore that our Soule corrupted it self by forsaking her due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
eyther of her owne accord, or by the admitting vnto it of some
wicked Spirit, that is to say by perswasion of that Spirit, which
perswasion is vnto Spirits, as touching is vnto bodies. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
this coruption is from all tyme: then comes it not of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And in all Nations: then comes it not of Constellation. And
in all ages, both old young and middle sort: then comes it not of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
or exampletaking. Therefore it must néedes procéed both
from one only man, and from the firstcreated man, who turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God through pride, whervpon God also did iustly turne
away from him, as wee reade of our first father <hi>Adam</hi> in the holy
Scripture. Now then, what remayneth more for vs, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that thing by nature, which wee beléeue through Scripture?
namely, That God created man good: That he told him his will:
That man chose to liue after his owne lyking, and would néedes
become equall with God: That therevpon he was banished from
Gods presence and fauour: That the Earth became rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
man, and man against himselfe: and to bee short, that man
was wrapped in the wretchednesse of this world, intangled with
sinne in himself, driuen to liue euer dying in this life, and (were not
Gods wrath appeased towards him) sure to dye euerlastingly in
the life to come.</p>

both euening and morning, that we haue offended God, and
ought to bee sacrifized and slayne for our offences according to our

a fault, and conscience misgiueth the insewing of punishment

                  <note place="margin">Aristotle.</note>
in his Moralles, sheweth that the affections must be ruled
by reason, and our mynd bee brought from the extremes into the
meanes, and from iarring into right tune. Which is a token that
our mynd is out of tune euen of it owne accord, seeing that it née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
so many precepts to set it in tune agayne. And yet is not <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
so presumptuous as to say, that euer he brought it to passe in
his owne mynd.<note place="margin">Theophrast.</note> 
                  <hi>Theophrast</hi> his Disciple was woont to say, that
the Soule payd wel for her dwelling in the bodie, considering how
much it suffered at the bodies hand. And what els was this, but an
acknowledgement of the debate betwéene the bodie and the mynd?
But (as sayth <hi>Plutarke</hi>) he should rather haue sayd, that the bodie
hath good cause to complayne, of the turmoyles, which so irksome
and troublesome a guest procureth vnto him.<note place="margin">Plato in his Phedrus.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> who went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, sawe more cléerly than both of them. He condemneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerywhere
the companie and fellowship of the body with the soule,
and yet he condemneth not the workmanship of God. But he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs that the Soule is now in this bodie as in a prison, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as in a Caue or a graue. And that is because he perceiued eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that contrarie to the order of nature, the Soule is subiect to
the bodie, notwithstanding that naturally it should and can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
it. The same <hi>Plato</hi> sayth further, that the Soule créepeth
bacely vpon these lower things, and that it is tyed to the matter of
the bodie: the cause whereof he affirmeth to be, that she hath broken
her wings which she had afore. His meaning then is, that the soule
of her owne nature is winged and flyeth vpward, that is to say, is
of a heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; diuine nature, which wings she hath lost by meanes
of some fall. But to get out of these bonds, and to recouer her
wings, the remedie that <hi>Plato</hi> giueth her, is to aduaunce her selfe
towards God, and to the things that concerne the mynd. By the
remedie we may coniecture what he tooke the disease to be namely,
that our Soule hauing bin aduaunced by God to a notable digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13215:171"/>
the which it might haue kept still by sticking vnto God; fell to
gazing at her gay feathers, till she fell headlong into these transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things, among the which she créepeth now like a sillie woorme,
reteyning nothing as now of her birdlike nature, saue onely a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of her feathers and a vayne flapping of her wings. Now he
sayth that he learned all this of a secret Oracle, the which he had in
great reuerence. And of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

So then, there is both a fault and the punishment: and the fault
must néedes procéede from one first man, euen in the iudgement of
those men of olde tyme, which acknowledged the Creation of the

staying vppon the beholding of his father, would needes bee
medling and doing somewhat of himselfe, and so fel from the

of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which shall answer both for the <hi>Pythagorists</hi> and
for the <hi>Stoiks. Man</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>is of his owne motion inclyned
to follow the euill and to leaue the good. There is a certein
stryfe bred in his affections, which stepping vp ageinst the will
of Nature, hath made it to tumble from Heauen to Hell, by
vndertaking to fight ageinst God. He hath a free will which
he abuseth, bending himself wholy to incounter the Lawes of
God: and this freedum itself is nothing else but a willingnesse
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13215:172"/>
to admit that which is not good, rather than otherwise.</hi> What
els is this, but as the holy scripture saieth, that al the imaginations
of manes hart are altogither continewally bent to euill? and which
wee dayly dispute of, namely that our freedome is fresh and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vnto euill, but lame and lasie vnto dooing well? If yee aske
him the cause thereof, <hi>Let vs not blaspheme for all that,</hi> (sayeth
he) <hi>nor say that God is the author of our sinnes: but rather
that man is of his owne accord become vntoward; and that
whensoeuer we fall into sinne, we do that which is in vs, but
not which was in vs from God.</hi> How then shall we make these
propositions of his to agree; namely that God created man; that
man is froward and corrupted; and yet that God created not man
such a one: vnlesse we say that God created man good, and that
afterward man degenerated from his nature? But it is the very
thing whereunto he commeth of himself. <hi>Ambition</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is
our bane; and this mischeefe haue wee of ourselues, bycause
we be gone away from God, and do giue ourselues to earthly
things, which make vs to forget God.</hi> And that this mischeef is
comon to all mankynd, he confesseth sufficiently in that he giueth
vs an vniuersall remedie that is to wit Religion: <hi>the which alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is able</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>to rid vs from earthly ignorance, without
the riddance whereof, we can neuer come agein to our former
shape, and to the lykenes of our kynd, which was to be lyke
vnto God.</hi> Now if all the whole kynd be defiled as he sayeth it is;
surely we must resort backe to one first father, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom it is spred
out into the rest by naturall generation.<note place="margin">Plutarke in his booke of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue, and in his booke of the mutuall loue betweene Parents and their Children and That Beastes haue Reason.</note> 
                  <hi>Plutarke</hi> wryting of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertue, findeth it a very hard matter to make our affection sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to reason, and the body obedient to the spirit. And he is driuen
to maruell greatly, That our féete should be so ready to goe or too
stand still whensoeuer Reason loozeneth or pulleth backe the Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
and that on the contrarie part, our affections should carry vs
away so headlong for all the restreint that wee can make. Also hee
thinketh it strange, that in our discourses of the greatest matters,
as of Loue, of the bringing vp of our Children, and of such like, we
be driuen to take the brute beastes for our Iudges, as who woulde
say that nature had stamped no Print of them in our selues; And
he findeth himself so sore graueled in his consideration, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
the brute beastes before vs in all things, sauing in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
which wee haue to knowe God; vndoubtedly as perceiuing a
continuall following of their kind in all of them, wheras in vs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:13215:172"/>
there is contrariwise such an vnkindly and Bastardly Nature,
that not euen the best of vs haue any whit of our former nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning
in vs, sauing onely shame that we haue it no more. And
this very gift of knowing God which remayneth to man, graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Plutarke</hi> more than all the rest. <hi>Man</hi> (saieth he) <hi>is a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creature; God hath set him in the world to be serued &amp;
honored of him, and he hath made him to be borne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ciuill Societie. Whereof commeth it then that in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he is more vnreasonable, more contrarie to Gods will,
and more against the Lawe of Nature, then the very brute
beastes?</hi> In this perplexitie, one whyle he saith that man had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
fayre and sound Seede, but that he corrupted it afterward:
Anotherwhile hee sayth that he delt with reason as perfumers doe
with Oyles, which neuer ceasse medling and mingling of them,
till there remayne no sent of Oyle at all: And in one place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
(by all likelihod) this corruption to be so vniuersal: he saith
further, that at the very beginning and from their first comming
into the Worlde, men intangled and confounded themselues with
sinne. Whereby we may perceiue, that had the thing bin declared
vnto him in such sort as wée beléeue it; surely hee would willingly
haue imbraced and receiued it, as the only solution of so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
wherein he was intangled.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the <hi>Platonists.</hi> All of them agrée in these points;
That the Soule of Man is a spirit; and that a spirit cannot natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
receiue any affection from a body, neither which may cause it
to perish, nor which may doe so much as once trouble it. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
on which side so euer they turne themselues, they
cannot deny but that our mynds are trubbled with infinite affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and passions in this body, and that they be subiect one while to
starting besides themselues through pryde, anger or enuie; an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while to be cast downe with Riottousnes, Gluttonie, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenes;
yea and to receiue diuers impressions not only from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but also from the aire, the water, and from Mistes, and finally
from euery little thing in the world. Now how can this contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be reconciled, except their meaning be as ours is, that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Soules are not subiect to any of these things, but that they
bee put in subiection to them beyond the course of nature? If it bee
beyond the course of nature; by whome is it doone, but by him that
commaundeth nature, to whome it is as easie to put a spirit in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as to lodge a man in a house? If it be done by him who is the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:13215:173"/>
rightuousnes it selfe; doth it not followe that it was for some fault
committed by the Soule? If for some fault; then seeing that the
punishment thereof is in all men, in whome should that first fault
be, but in that man which was the originall of all men, as in whom
all of vs (say I) were materially? Now againe, this fault cannot
bee imputed to the body, for it is in the will, and the body of it selfe
hath no will: neither can it be imputed to any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>fection receiued
first from the body; for the Soule could not be wrought into by the
body. In the Soule therefore must the fault of mankind néedes be,
and for the soules offence doth the Soule itself suffer punishment,
and make the body also to suffer with her.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, that we may the better iudge of their opinions, let vs
heare them in the chief of them one after another. <hi>Plotine</hi> hauing
considered that the Soule is of nature diuine, heauenly, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall;
concludeth that of itselfe it is not wrought into by the body.
But afterward perceiuing how it is defiled, ouermaistred by sinne,<note place="margin">Plotin: Enn. 3. lib. 2.</note>
and by force of necessitie linked vnto lust; he commeth backe to this
solution, That hir béeing here beneath is but a banishment too her,<note place="margin">Also Enn. 1. lib. 6 Cap. 5. Also Enn. 1. lib. 8. Cap. 14. &amp; Enn. 6. lib. 9 Cap. 9.</note>
which he termeth expresly a fall, and otherwise (as <hi>Pato</hi> doth) a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of hir wings: That the vertue which she hath, is but a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of hir former nature; That the vyce which she hath, is taken
by dealing by these bace and transitorie things: and too bee short,
that al the vertue which is learned, is but a purging of the Soule,
which must be fayne to be as it were newfurbished, to scoure of the
greate Rust that hath ouergrowen it. In these Contradictions
therefore hee maketh this question to himselfe:<note place="margin">Plotin. lib. 1. Enn. 5. Cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>What should bee
the cause</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>that our Soules being of a diuine nature,
should so forget both God their father, and their kinred, and
themselues? Surely</hi> (answereth he) <hi>the beginning of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef,
was a certeine rashnes &amp; ouerboldnesse, wherethrough
they would needes plucke their neckes out of the collar, and
be at their owne commaundement; by which abuse turning
their libertie into licentiousnes, they went cleane backe, and
are so farre gone away from GOD, that (like Children which
being newly weaned, are byanby conueyed away from their
Fathers and Moothers, they knowe neither whose, nor what
they be, nor from whence they came.</hi> Now in these words he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with our Diuines, not only in this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> corruption came in by
sin,<note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 1. lib. 8. Cap. 4.</note> but also in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kind of sinne, namely Pryde, wherby we be turned
away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Maker. In another place, <hi>The Soule</hi> (saith he) <hi>which
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:13215:173"/>
was bred for heauenly things, hath plundged itselfe in these
materiall things, and matter of itselfe is so euill, that not onely
all that is of matter or matched with matter, but also euen
that which hath respect vnto matter, is filled with euill, as the
eye that beholdeth darknes is filled with darknes.</hi> Here ye sée,
not onely from whence we be turned away, but also too what: that
is too wit, from God, to vanitie, from the Creator to the creature,
from good to euill. But of this inclyning to the materiall things,
he sometymes maketh the body to be the author,<note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 3, lib. 5. Cap. 5.</note> as though the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
had caried the Soule away by force of his imaginations; and he
acquitteth the mynde thereof as much as he can, insomuch as hee
sticketh not to affirme, that notwithstanding all this marrednesse,
yet the Soule liueth and abideth pure and cleane in God,<note place="margin">Enn. 3. lib. 3. Cap 4.</note> yea euen
whyle the Soule (whereof the Mynd is as yee would say the very
eisight or apple of the eye) dwelleth in this body. Howbeit, besides
that he is reproued for it by <hi>Porphyrius, Proclus</hi> and others; his
owne reasons whereby he proueth that the Soule is not naturally
subiect to the body, be so strong; that it were vnpossible for him too
shift himself from them. In this the great Philosopher is ouershot,
that he will needes seeke out the cause of sinne in Man as Man is
now. Where finding Reason caried away by Imagination, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
deceiued by the Sences; he thought the fault to haue
procéeded of that; wheras in deede he should haue sought the cause
in Man as he was first created, when he had his Sences and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
absolutely at commaundement, whose wilfull offending
hath brought vppon vs the necessitie of punishment which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.
And in good sooth, this saying of his in another place cannot
be interpreted otherwise; namely that the cause why the Soule
indureth so many trubbles and passions in this body, is to be taken
of the life which is led afore out of the body: that is to say, that the
subiection of the Soule to the Body is not the originall cause of
the sinne therof, but rather a condemnation thereof to punishment.<note place="margin">Plotin. Eun. 1. lib. 8. Cap. 14. &amp; lid. 3. Cap. 4</note>
Neither also can he scape fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these conclusions of his owne, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Soule beeing separated from the body, hath her wings
sound and perfect: and that the Body being ioyned to the Soule,
hath no power to breake her wings, and yet that she findeth herself
there to be weake and without wings: except he hold with vs, that
the Soule hath by her fall forgone her strength, and that the body
by the feeblenes of the Soule and the sentence of the Creator, is
strengthened in his weakenesse: that is to wit, in so much as the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:13215:174"/>
body (as I haue sayde afore) is of a House become a Prison to the
Soule. To be short, graunting Gods Iustice, as he doth; hee can
neuer wind himselfe out of this question which he himself maketh;
namely why the sinnes are imputed to the Soule, seeing it doth
them not but by infection of the body; vnlesse he make this infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be a punishment of the fault which the Soule had committed
afore in the body.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> who perceyued these inconueniences, hath
spoken more distinctly of the matter than his Mayster did, agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him neuerthelesse in the corruption of man,<note place="margin">S. Austin in the Citie of God, lib. 10. Cap. 23. and 32.</note> and in the
cleansing of the Soule; <hi>Which cleansing of the Soule</hi> (sayth he)
<hi>is so needfull a thing, as that it cannot possibly bee but that
God hath prouided some vniuersal meane of cleansing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd.
How is it possible then</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that the fall of the
Soule, should come of Imagination which knitteth the Soule
to the bodie, seeing that the higher things are not drawne
downe by the lower, but contrarywise the lower are drawne
vp by the higher? Nay rather</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the higher substances
come downe in themselues from vnderstanding into imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
from spirituall things to bodily things, from high
things to lowe things, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfect things to vnperfect things.
And wheras by sticking fast vnto God they might haue abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
firme, not so much by their owne strength as by his, and
might haue liued and wrought as vnder his forme; they bee
come to a fall of themselues by stooping to matter. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Porphyrius in his booke which she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth how to do the things that are to be conceyued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only by reason and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note>
(sayth he) <hi>in the substaunces which are inclinable to such
things, there is befalne (as men say) a sinne, and a certeyne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef
which is condemned, because they fell in loue with the
Creatures, and turned away to them from the Creator.</hi> To be
short, he commeth to this poynt, that the fall of mens Soules, is
like the fall of the Féendes that is taught by the Iewes, and that
through the fault of the wit and the will, which he termeth vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
or vnfaithfulnesse, man is falne into the folly of concupiscence,
that is to say,<note place="margin">Also in his third booke of Abstinence.</note> from the fault into the punishment thereof, from the
rebellion of the Soule, into the bondage thereof to the bodie. And
ye must not thinke wee speake contraries when wee say, one while
that man sinned by aduauncing himself too high, and by presuming
to become as it were equall with God; and another while that he
sinned by stooping downe to these bace and lowe things. For in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
déede, the lifting vp of a mans selfe to Godward, is the true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:13215:174"/>
and humbling of himselfe: for who is hée that can rightly
looke vp to God, and make account of himselfe, or rather not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baced
in himselfe? And to inclyne to a mans selfe, is in very trueth
a presuming to make himselfe equall to God. For it is a seeking of
that thing in our selues, which is not to bee found but in GOD,
namely of welfare and felicitie; and what els is pride, but a selfesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
or an ouerwéening of a mans selfe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proclus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proclus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Soule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Feend. cap. 4.</note> doth ordinarily call the inclyning of our nature vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
a descending or comming downe; and the corruption thereof, a
fall, because the highest that our Soule can atteyne vnto, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of God; and the descending, stooping, or comming downe
thereof, is to fall into estimation of our selues; and the fall is to bee
thrust downe [in subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>] vnder our selues, like a body that falleth
from some high place. But as touching the cause of the corruption,
he fathereth it vppon our Mynd, that is to wit, the highest part of
our Soule; saying that if the same had continued sound, and sticked
fast vnto God, (as sayth <hi>Plotin</hi>) it had also hild reason sound still,
which is the Sunbeame thereof, and consequently all our actions
should haue bene found, so as wee should not haue bene subiect to
sinne. Séeing then that the punishment is come euen to the highest
part of vs, which we sée combered with so many passions, dimmed
with so much darknesse, and defiled with so many vyces: surely the
fault procéeded onely from thence. Herevnto we might ad many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sayings; but wee will content our selues as now with onely
<hi>Simplicius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simplicius vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Epictus.</note> the famous interpreter of <hi>Aristotle. As long as mans
Soule</hi> (sayth he) <hi>cleaueth fast vnto God the author thereof, it
abydeth sound, and holdeth her perfection wherwith she was
created of God: but fall she once to shrinking away from him,
by and by she withereth as hauing lost her roote, and comes
to nothing; neyther can she recouer her former liuelynesse,
except she be reunited agayne to her former cause.</hi> Now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
we euerychone of vs, that our nature is withered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs say that we be slipped from our roote. And the roote lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not the braunches, but contrarywise the braunches leaue the
roote. Let vs say then that we haue bereft ourselues of the gracious
goodnesse of God, who would haue mainteyned vs still: for to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and quicken, is the propertie and nature of the roote. In one
only thing doe the Philosophers differ from vs in this behalfe:
namely, that they vphold all mens Soules to haue sinned euery
one in himselfe; and wee say, That the onely first man sinned, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13215:175"/>
thereby hath bound all his whole ofspring to the punishment. But
yet doe both come backe agayne to one poynt, seeing that euen by
their owne reasons I proued the creation of the world, which of
necessitie leadeth vs to one man the father of vs all, whereas the
Philosophers hang wauering still vnresolued in that poynt.</p>

what shall we say to that which we haue learned in these our daies
among the barbarous Nations of the West Indies? <hi>There came

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:13215:175"/>
chaunged the good soyle which he had giuen them,

left them nothing but a few riuers to helpe themselues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
by their great labour and trauell.</hi> Who espyeth not here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
the sinne of man, Gods curse vppon the earth, and namely
these words, <hi>In the sweate of thy browes shalt thou eate thy

God, when as euen those knowe him, whom wee estéeme to bee

               <p>But here the wicked perceyuing themselues to want matter to
replye,<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> do fail to rayling against God. Séeing that man (say they)
sinned through the fréewill which GOD gaue vnto him; how can
God be called good, hauing giuen man wherewith to sinne? By the
same reason I say at once for all, if God be good; why hath he made
Man, or any thing for Man? If he should take from thée all that
thou abusest, I pray thee what should bee left thée? Thy Reason?
What is there in thée that maketh thée more vnreasonable? Thy
Sences? To what other seruice doest thou put them, than to the
marring of thy Sences? Thy Tongue? How much more eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is it in speaking euill, than in speaking good? To bee short, where
shal the good things become which he hath giuen thée for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of thy health and life? Nay, on the contrary part, which of
them is it that thou turnest not to thy death and to thy bane? Now
is the founder of them to blame, if thou kill thy self with the things
without the which thou couldest not liue? Or if thou become euill
by the things without the which thou couldest not be good? GOD
hath giuen thée a will; and without will thou couldest not bee good.
Unto will hee hath added a good wit to guyde it: and without wit
thou couldest not be wise. If thou be loth to be eyther good or wise,
it is but because thou art loth to bee a man. Thy will was giuen
thée to loue God withall. Now, loue delighteth to bee fréeharted;
neither would God bee loued of vs as inchaunted to it, but freely
and vtterly vnconstreined. Therfore it behoued this will to be frée.
Likewise thy wit was giuen thée to behold God withall. And had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou but onely thy Sences, what haddest thou more than the
brute Beastes? And if thou haddest no more than they; why were
they and all the whole world made for thee? Now then, which of
these two canst thou finde fault with, seeing that without them
both, thou couldest be neither good, nor wise, no nor a man? Thou
wouldest haue bin created vnchaungeable; howbeit, not as a Rock
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:13215:176"/>
or a Mountayne, but as a Man. Surely the vnchaungeablenesse of
Spirits, was created to depend vppon their linking in with their
maker. Thou wouldest peraduenture haue bin an Angel: but there
are euen of the Angels that are falne; and as thei were farre higher
than thou, so was their fall more daungerous than thyne. O man,
acknowledge the goodnes of the Creator in creating thée good; and
acknowledge the vanitie of the creature, which cannot stand in his
owne goodnesse, but in the goodnesse of the Creator. But especially
aboue all things commend thou his goodnesse and mercie, in that
he hath not onely reléeued thée in thy fall, but also as it were vphild
thée that thou mightest fall the softer.</p>
               <p>Another taketh exception to Gods Iustice. What Iustice is it
(sayth he) to punish a man so rigorously for so small a fault? Nay,
what is more iust than nature? What is more naturall than to
runne into darknesse, when a man turneth away from the Sunne?
Or (as <hi>Plotin</hi> sayth) to impayre and wex naught, when a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
from the souereyne good? But O thou man which thinkest
thy self iuster than God, what punishment wouldest thou appoynt
to thy Sonne, not being a babe or a yoong childe, but being come to
yéeres of discretion, and a mangrowen; not pinched and pyned, but
flowing in all wealth: if vpon a brauerie and lustinesse of courage,
he would disobey thée for a thing of nothing? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> set thou <hi>Adam</hi>
also before thyne eyes newly come into the world by the goodnesse
of the Creator, not starke naked, but furnished with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world
to serue him; not witlesse, but with a pure sound and skilfull mynd;
not subiect to his lustes, but able to holde them in awe to his will,
and hauing his will obedient to reason. Now, whether thou consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his sinne, his rebellion, his vnfaithfulnes, and his pride; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou haue an eye to the easines of absteyning from sinne: what
punishment wilt thou not déeme him worthie to haue?</p>
               <p>Yea (sayest thou) but why vseth he this rigour against his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
Nay rather, say, why is he so mercifull, why is he so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as to kéepe them low in their fathers fall, least they should fall
[more gréeuously] through the same rashnesse? Thou buildest a
Citie, and the custome is to beautifie it with Priuiledges. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
this Citie rebelleth; thou take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> away their priuiledges, their
Belles, their Armour, and their weapons; and this punishment of
their Insurrection extendeth to all their posteritie, albeit they were
but fewe at the beginning, and grewe to bee mightily multiplyed
afterward. The graunting of the Priuiledges to the first, was a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:13215:176"/>
poynt of goodnesse; for otherwise they might haue had occasion to
complayne of thée. Likewise it is Iustice to take them so from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and mercie to withhold them from their posteritie who haue the
same rebellious mynd in them, and had els runne headlong into
extreme punishments. God gaue thée the priuiledge of freedome,
and inriched thée with singular gifts both of body and mynd: praise
thou his goodnesse. Now, because thou hast abused them, he eyther
taketh them cleane away, or els diminisheth them: acknowledge
thou his Iustice. And because thy children might doe as thou hast
done, and would not be amended by thine example, he taketh them
from them also and diminisheth them in thée: commend thou still
his mercie in his Iustice, but specially honor thou his Iustice in his
mercie, in that of this rebellious race hée causeth the partie to bee
borne, which can appease his Iustice.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this, they giue not ouer. If by the sinne of the first
man (say they) nature be corrupted in all men: why be not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
more corrupted than their Fathers, by meanes of so many
sinnes committed by their Fathers? In this behalfe they mislyke
of Gods clemencie, and yet could not Gods Iustice haue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. Now the Lords intent in punishing the rebellious Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
was to make them submit themselues againe vnder his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
and not to destroy them vtterly. And it was Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to humble mankind by making hym to feele the smart of his
fall; and not to breake him in peeces in his wrath, but to reclayme
him by his mercie. We bee falne into a Pit, we be falne from our
highnes: now what would a second fall be? We haue broken our
Wings already against the Earth; whether would wee fall at the
next fall, being vnable to make a second flight? Wée be falne (say
I) from the goodnes of our nature into naughtines, from Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
into his wrath: how can wee fall any lower? Nay rather by
creeping halfebroken vpon the Earth, we knowe that we be falne;
and féeling the losse which we haue susteyned, wee crye vnto God
for relief, and like little Nurcechildren we beséech him to stay and
vphold vs with his mightie hand.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let vs conclude for these twoo last Chapters,
That mans nature is corrupted; and that it was not so created of
God; but that man abusing Gods grace, did cast himselfe downe
from goodnesse into naughtines, and from Gods freefauour intoo
his iust displeasure; and that the man in whome the sayd Nature
was first corrupted, was the first man: from whom we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:13215:177"/>
our corruption, as well as our nature. But let vs not so much
muse to take an account how we be falne into this pit of infection,
as earnestly bethinke vs by what meanes we may get out againe,
which is the thing that we haue to treate of next.</p>

For Nature (say the Philosophers) doth nothing otherwise than
well and to a good ende. If they spake so of the Handmayd, what

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:13215:177"/>
and this desire being in vs by kynd, cannot be in vayne. Therefore
it must néedes be that the true welfare of man consisteth in his true

both: for they be both but one selfesame thing; which in respect that

                     </gap> whereby to knowe the amingpoynt and welfare of Man.</note> had we continued in our originall nature, we should haue
had no payne at all to séeke them: for our wit was inlightened with
the sight of our marke, and our will was drawen by our welfare,
that is to say, by GOD by whom and for whom we were created;
whereas now through our pride our eyes are gazing at all things,
sauing our right way and our chief welfare. Yet notwithstanding,
wee may trace it out by certeyne markes, specially if wee beare in
mynd that we be falne: for then wee will not stand groping for it in
the filth of the things that are here beneath, as folke amazed at our
fall; but wee will seeke for it in the grace and in the face of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
from whence we be falne. For like as when we seeke to knowe
the vse and goodnesse of a toole (as for example, of a Sawe,) wee
consider it not by the rustinesse thereof that hath eaten away the
téeth, or by the breakes that it hath taken by some falles; but by the
téeth thereof which are sound, sharpe, and smooth, such as they were
when they came newe out of the Sythemakers shop: euen so must
we doe with man; we must not iudge of his end by the blyndnesse,
ignorance, naughtinesse, and corruptnesse that is come vpon him,
but by the excellencie, goodnesse, and light that was in him at the
first when GOD created him. Also wee iudge not of the vse of the
Sawe by the mettall thereof in that it is Stéele, or in that it hath a
handle, or in that it hath an edge to cut withall: for a knife hath all
things, which yet notwithstanding is neuer the more a Sawe for
all that: but we déeme thereof by some peculiar shape, and by some
propertie of the téeth therof, which make it to differ, not only from
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:13215:178"/>
a Knife, the which hath no téeth, but also from a Fyle which hath
téeth, howbeit of another sort. Then let vs doe the like still in man.
If wee déeme of the vse whereto God hath appoynted him, by that
he liueth, or by that he hath sences; what néedeth man to be made,
seeing that the Plants are indewed with life, and the brute Beasts
both with life and sence? But now hath he made Man, and he hath
not made him in vayne. The vse of him therefore is to be taken, of
that part which GOD hath giuen him specially and peculiarly to
make him a man; of that (I say) which maketh him to differ from
the things which haue but onely being, life, and sence: I meane the
very highest part of his Soule. Againe, the fayd perticular shape
which giueth a perticular vse to the Sawe, is common to all tooles
which beare the name of a Sawe: and therefore the special proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Man which giueth him a peculiar vse which no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath, must néedes bee after such a sort peculiar vnto him, as it
may neuerthelesse bee common to all of the same kynd: that is to
say, as al men are created with that propertie, so all men must tend
to that end. And forasmuch as that end is the souereyne welfare of
Man; it hath consequently certeyne markes or tokens whereby it
is to bee knowne. Man feareth nothing more than his end, neither
desireth he any thing so much as to continue for euer: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the souereine welfare is the end of Man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must néedes bee an end without end; and end which doth not
consume or waste, so as the thing which tendeth to it should therby
be fordone: but which perfecteth &amp; fulfilleth it, so as beyond it there
is not aught that can bee desired or be. If there were any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, it were neither an end, nor souereine or chief. But for such
a one doe we seeke. And if it could eyther waste or perish, we might
be afrayd to lose it: and the greater that the pleasure were, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
also should the greefe thereof bee. But the propertie of felicitie
or happinesse is, to content the desire &amp; to exclude feare. Now then,
as touching the thing which we seeke; in respect that we seeke it as
our end, it behoueth it to bee agreeable to the very nature of Man,
peculiar to the whole kynd, and common to all that be of the kynd:
and in respect that it is our souereine welfare, it behoueth it to bee
vniuersall, perfect, and continuall. And now let vs see what that
may be.</p>
               <p>Surely if we consider man and the world;<note place="margin">The world is not the end to which man was made.</note> in man the Sences,
and in the World the sensible things: man as the beholder, and the
world as a Theatre: man as the guest, in the world the Feast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:13215:178"/>
of all things conuenient for him: we will say by and by, not
only that they be made the one for the other, but also that in very
deede the World was made for man, and not man for the World or
for any thing therein. And ageine, if we consider how that in the
World there is wherewith to content the eye the eare and all the
sences; but nothing that can sufficiently content the mynd, the
which (as earthly as it is) passeth from the things visible to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible,
from the bodily to the gostly, and from the creatures to the
maker: shall we not easily conclude (which thing I will treate of
more at large hereafter) that as the worlde cannot be mans ende, so
can it not also be his contentation? And yet notwithstanding man
is not created for nought; neither is the desire of his owne welfare
planted in him to no purpose. For as say the Philosophers, nature
hath made nothing in vayn, neither is she maymed in things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Therefore it must needs be, and otherwyse it cannot be, but
that the creator is the end and contentment of man, whose mynd
cannot be satisfyed nor his will contented to the full, if any part of
him do rest vppon these vyle and transitorie things. By the way
whereas we comonly affirme that God is both the end and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of all things for that then he guyded and led whither soeuer be
listeth by his prouidence, and also be made partakers of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
we must vnderstand that this is verified of man after a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

haue but sence and appetite, and other some but only a bare inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

God, as the arrowe is leueled at some marke by the Archer,
who shooteth the Arrow streyght though it haue no eye to see with.
But man by a peculiar pruiledge hath an vnderstanding wit which
was giuen vnto him cleere sighted and cleane, that he might see the
marke whereat he is leueled, and will, which he receyued frank and
free, that he myght repose all his delyght therein: the one to knowe
and discerne it, the other to loue aud imbrace it; the one to see, and
behold it, the other to obteyne and enioy it. Nowthen, as the hither
end of all Creatures here beneathe is man, and the furthest end of
them is God: so the neerest and immediate end of man is to knowe
God, and his only welfare is to sticke wholy vnto him.</p>

people are? Surely then was not man set in the world, to the intent
that that should be his mark to ame at; and much lesse could he seeke
his contentment there. Yet notwithstanding he had receyued more
wit than we haue, and not to no end. And therefore we must needes
say it was to direct him to some further thing than vanitie, which at
that tyme could haue no place at all. Some will say, his fouereine

who sees not that many brute beastes doe passe man in lyuely force
both of life and sence? But in this alone he (as <hi>Plutark</hi> saith) doth
passe them all. Secondly, it must neuerthelesse bee comon to all
men. Now (as vtterly blinded and corrupted as we be) what is
more common among vs all, than the knowledge of God? If Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Honor bee the marke we shoote at; how feawe of so many
men which leuell at it with Heart, Eye, Hand, and Sinewes, doe
hit it? If our welfare consist in hauing our health, in béeing vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
in dealing vprightly, or in calmenesse of mynd; how feawe doo
inioy it? On the contrarie part, who is so blynd, that he feeth not
God, as soone as hee doth but looke out with his Eyes? or which
findeth him not within him selfe? or which atteyneth not to him, if
he looke aboue himselfe? And who seeth not this marke, so cleere
that the world is but a shadowe to it? so great that the whole world
is nothing to it; and so néere, as that we be not néerer to our selues?
Or who can be afrayd to bee shut out from it, whose greatnes hath
roome inough for all, and whose sufficiencie is such, as the former
shotte can be no impediment to the latter to haue a lighting place?
Surely therefore we may wel say, that if we had continued sound,
we could haue had none other marke or end but him; for all things
els had bin nothing. And now also for all that we be corrupted; we
ought not to tend or intend to any other than him; for he alone can
be all to all, and this poynt can be nowhere but in him. To be short,
like as the Soule is the shape of man, so is the knowledge of God
the true shape of al vnderstanding of man. Neuerthelesse, although
the shape of man was disfigured in the first man, yet there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a certeine comon conceiuing of God, howbeit so defaced and
beslubbered, that either wee discerne him no more to bee our ende,
though hee put vs in mynd thereof on all sides; or els imagining
our selues to leuell at that marke, we swarue aside one while to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlynes,
and another whyle to superstition; or at leastwise we had
leuer for the most part, to roue at euery thing that our sences méete
withall, and too wallowe in these bace things like Beastes which
haue no more but their sences.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in our souereine welfare, I required that it should bee
vniuersall. Now where shall it be found to be so but in God, who is
in deede the very good of all goodnes, and the very welfare of all
welfare that is in the world? Also that it should be perfect and full.
And what desire wee but the things that are? And what can hee
want, which possesseth him in whome all things are? Againe, I
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:13215:180"/>
added that the same must be euerlasting and vnchaungeable. Now
who can bee so, but the maker of order and chaunge it selfe? and
what thing see we heer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wee desire to content our sences, hee hath made sensible things for

                  </gap>once; and if we desire to content our mynd, he himselfe is the
things that are to be mynded. Where then is the thing to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
which we couet, but onely in him? Now as touching this
vniuersall souereine good, true it is that all of vs are able too desire
it, but for the most part of vs, vnable to discerne it, and none of vs
able to atteine vnto it. There remaineth nothing to vs at all, I
meane euen to the best of vs since our fall, but a gréef that we haue
it not any more, and that we be not able of ourselues to recouer it
ageine héere belowe. Then let vs say, that as it had bin a happy case
for vs, to haue continued still in our first state: so is it now for vs to
returne thither againe; that is to say, to be set againe in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
that we may oneday see his face yet againe. And because this

we must dispose our lyfe in this world, not to liue still in
the world, but to dye in respect of these dead things, and to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God; at leastwise if wee intend to liue the true lyfe, and to liue
euerlastingly in him.</p>
               <p>Now then wee see that wee haue found our true restingpoynt
and our true welfare,<note place="margin">The false ends and the false Welfares.</note> that is to wit the turning ageine vnto God,
from whose fauour and fellowship we be departed. For proof ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we neede but to examine from point to point the other ends and
welfares which worldly men doe set downe to themselues, by the

as we shall find a common desirousenes in all men to seeke the

which like to the lustings of them that haue the gréene Sicknesse,
(who be greedy of Dust, Coales, Ashes and such other baggage)
cannot but bewray vnto vs a straunge distemperature and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our whole nature. Most men haue in all ages spent their
whole life, either in raking togither of riches, or in Ambition, or in
purchasing of Lands, or in puffing vp themselues with the wind of
Pryde. And what can bee more contrarie to the lyking of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
than those things? The end whereto things tend, is
better than the things themselues. What is it then for a man too

worse then Earth and Doong? And who would not beléeue that
the Soule of man were infinitely lesse made for such things, than
cloth of Gold to wrap vp myre and dirt in?</p>
               <p>Also wee seeke the vttermost end of man.<note place="margin">Riches.</note> Now who is he that
desireth not Riches for some other end, than for the Riches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues?
namely that hée might spend them either wantonly or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably,
or necessarily? Nay who would passe for them at all, if he
might haue the other things without them? Were it not so; what
were more wretched than man in whose end consisteth his welfare;
seeing that either the Wind, or Fyre, or robbing may bereue vs of
that felicitie; that is to wit, ouerwhelme vs with miseries in one
moment? Againe, how can Riches be the common marke for all
men to shoote at, seeing that the inriching of one man is the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerishing
of another? Yea and that the very béeing of them consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
but in the opinion of men, some counting Gold, some stones,
some Shelles, and some Nuttes to be Riches; and all resembling
yoong children, which set al their felicite in Checkstones &amp; pinnes?
And what is it for men to set their felicitie in things which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man nor of Man, as if they should set the goodnes of a Knyfe
in the Sheath, or of a Horse in his Footecloth or Saddle? To bée
short, how can that bee the souerein Good, which is no good at all?
which is common as wel to the bad as to the good, and doth rather
impaire men than amend them? Or howe can that bee our chéefe
marke to shoote at, which of all things turneth vs most fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true
marke, that is to wit, from God; as in trueth there is not a readier
way to driue vs quite and cleane from God, than to drawe vs née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and néerer to worldly riches?</p>
               <p>And what is Ambition?<note place="margin">Honor.</note> We might discourse of that tyme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

are the happiest? Soothly they that are excluded are disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
of their pretensed felicitie. That is al the harme they haue
by it. They that atteyne to honor, are in continual torment, spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or spighted, doing mischiefe or receyuing mischiefe, ouermated
or ouermating. What is this but many euilles for one, and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
of miseries without number, for the obteynement of one
sillie shadowe of felicitie? We will leaue the residue to declamers:
what are the fruites of these hellish torments, what are they? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
Honour, Reputation, and Power or Authoritie. What is all
this but wynd, which cannot fill vs, nor scarsly puffe vs vp? I shall

be saluted as I goe abroade, I shall sit highest at méetings. In ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
these things, what haue I, which a wicked man may not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue than I: And if it be a good thing, how is it giuen to euill
men? I shall haue reputation. If it bee among euill men, O how
shal I be blamed among good men! Perhaps I shal haue it among
good men. If for vertue: who seeth not that reputation is but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
made to followe vertue? And who will runne after the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
to forgoe the body? If freely for nothing, (as men say) vpon
Credite: who knoweth not that thing to be nothing worth, which
is giuen for nought, and by such as are noughtworth? And who
will beléeue that we be borne to such an end as that? Nay rather,
how many be the slaunders wherewith good men be charged: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that diuers tymes they bee fayne to forgoe their reputation,
for the preseruation of their Conscience?</p>
               <p>Finally,<note place="margin">Powre Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and Soucreintie.</note> I shall haue obteyned power and authoritie. If that
be the end of Man; how happeneth it that for one mans hauing of
it, so many millions are fayne to goe without it? And if it be his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereine
good; whereof commeth it, that not only it is turned to euil,
but also commonly turneth the possessors thereof to euill? But let
vs put the case that all this is good. To whom? For euery one that
is honored as a Prince, ten thousand are fayne to knéele: For one
that tryumpheth, a hundred thousand are led in captiuitie: For one
that reigneth, ten hundred thousand serue as Slaues. By this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
some only one man should be the end of many men: and the
felicitie of thrée or fower should bee the infelicitie of a whole world.
Now our séeking is for the end and felicitie, not of some one or two
men, but of all the whole kynd. What willye say then if euen those
fewe haue it not? I take to witnesse the happiest Courtiers that
are, whether one wrye looke of their Prince do not sting them more
at the heart, than a thousand flatterers and as many crouchers and
cappers can delight their eares and eyes? Nay, I report me euen
to the greatest Princes themselues, whether one Rebellion of their
Subiects against them, doe not vex them more than all their hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
tryumphs doe reioyce them? And were it not a shame to say,
that mans souereine good should stand in awe or depend vppon a
grim looke? What els then are all these things, but resemblances
of the Apples that grow about Sodome, which being pleasant to
the eye, and prouoking to the appetite, doe vanish into smoake or
into soote as soone as a man puts his téeth to them?</p>
               <p>Besides this, the felicitie of man ought to abyde in the thing it
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:13215:181"/>
selfe. But the contentment of the ambicious person, dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
another. Also it ought to be euerlasting: But ambition endeth
with the body, and is buryed with it in the same graue. Againe, the
things that ambition craueth, are fought sometymes for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things sake: but wee demaund an end wherevpon to rest, and
not a meane to an ende. To bee short, so farre of is ambition from
being a way to bring vs to souereine good or felicitie; that in very

decayeth vs more than sensualitie? Agein, we seeke an end; but
yet an endlesse end, not which maketh an end of our pleasures, but
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:13215:182"/>
which doth still feede our desires. Contrarywise, what is there
which is sooner at an end in it selfe, which sooner maketh an end of
vs, or which sooner wearieth vs and lesse contenteth vs, than the
bodily pleasures; considering that (as the Poet sayth) the pleasure
and payne goe both together? Moreouer, how may that be the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereine
good, which is not so much as a meane good? For who can
denye, but that abstinence is taken for a vertue, euen among the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
sort? And what maner of good is that, which may become e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
by increasing, if it were not euill of it selfe afore? Finally, al bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
pleasures consist in the Sences, and are executed by the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
parts. Now, the Sences are oftentymes forstalled in vs, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by diseases or by old age: and the sensitiue parts are dispatched
at the least by death.</p>
               <p>Now albeit that a man haue a dubble life, the one in this world,
the other in another, the one dying, the other immortall; the first
which is here tending to the second as the woorse to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better; yet is
not our seeking for such an end or such a felicitie as dyeth with vs,

which is occupied one whyle in itself, another while in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Soothly it is not to bee doubted, but that our end will bee found to

with the managing of his affayres in this world. The foulest vyce
in the world shall finde a mate: but if Uertue runne through the
whole world, she shal scarce find a husband. Now then, if we séeke
our felicitie in this life; what is Uertue but very miserie? And if
we séeke it in the other lyfe; what shal become of this vertue where
we shall haue no affections to encounter with? Surely then is not

but the Soule liueth still, and yet giueth ouer the dealings
of the world. Therefore néedes must some other thing then Policy
be our souerein good, seeing that this Policy is limited within the
bounds of this world.</p>
               <p>Now then,<note place="margin">Wisdome or Religiousnes.</note> let vs examine Wisdome. It is the beholding of
God and of things belonging to GOD. This requireth a man to
lift vp himselfe aboue the world, and aboue himselfe; I meane that
a man should retyre from all outward things into his owne soule,
the Soule vnto her Mynd, and the Mynd vnto God. Surely there
is great lykelyhod that our dooings ought to bee referred to this
wisdome, and that our end and welfare should consist therein. For
the perfecting of such a contemplation, wee say there are required
Wealth, Health, Uertue, and Policie. For want and pouertie, bée
as Fetters of Yron to a weldisposed mynd: a sickely and diseased
body, is as a torture to it; vnruly affections dazle it and make it sée
one thing for another; Policie is the stablisher of Comonweales, &amp;
whosoeuer giueth himself to contemplation, it behoueth him to be
settled in a quiet place, that he may hold the Plommet of his mind
steddy without shaking or stirring. Thus doe all things séeme to
serue to that vse. But when they come all to the forenamed poynt,
to helpe vs; yet I pray you how farre doe they further vs? It is
naturally bred in man to beléeue that there is a GOD: and his
woorkes doe put vs in mynd of it euery howre. But shall we enter
into our woorkemayster, séeing that the very outside of the least of
all his workes doth stoppe vs? Again, who knoweth not, that if
there be not a God, there can bee no happines atall? And sith wee
knowe it, euen (as ye would say) from our birth; why take we so
much peine in seeking that which wee haue alreadie? Reason tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs further, that God is good and iust; that is to say, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
that which is good, &amp; hateth that which is euill. And our owne
conscience telleth vs, that we doe little good or none, but much euil.
And if the little good which we doo be doone amisse, what happines
is there, or rather what vnhappines is there not in that knowledge
which maketh vs to feele a continuall torment in our selues? But
the partie that is giuen too contemplation, mounteth vp yet
higher, and considereth that God is immortall, vnchangeable, and
not to be wrought into; which is as much to say, as that he is not
as we men are, who doe dye, moue, and chaunge: and when hee
comes to that poynt, he is at the highest that his wit can reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And what is all this stying vp, but a creeping still vppon the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:13215:184"/>
earth? For, to say that of a thing which it is not, or to say it is not
this or it is not that; what els is it but a protesting that we knowe
not what it is? as if a man should boast that hee knowes an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
vndr pretence that hee knowes it is not a Snayle? What
then is our highest contemplation but déepe ignorance? And who
would make ignorance his highest felicitie &amp; furthest end or shoote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anker?
Yet notwithstanding how feawe be there which atteine so
farre? And if any through rashnes aduenture any further: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
what error and blyndnesse doe they fall, no lesse than they which

               <p>It remaineth then in the end,<note place="margin">Faith or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef.</note> that wee must atteine to that by
Fayth, which wee cannot atteyne vnto by Reason; that wée must

the <hi>Arabian</hi> procéeded so farre, as to say that the roote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherby the
felicitie to come is atteind vnto, is faith. And what is this fayth in
God, but a beléeuing that our welfare lyeth in him? What is the
beléeuing, but the hoping for it? What is hope, but the desiring of
it? What is the desire of it, but the not hauing of it? And to bee
short, what is the continuall beléef of it héere, but a bewraying that
héere we can neither haue it nor see it? If we haue not faith; what
haue we but ignorance? And if we haue faith; what haue wee but
onely a desire and longing; considering that the greater our fayth
is, the more wee despise these bace things; and the greater our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is, the more we hate our selues, and the more earnestly doe we
loue God. To be short, What is fayth? Welfare behighted. But
we would sée it. Again, what is faith? The way vnto felicitie. But
we would possesse and inioy it. Looke then what proportion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
that which is present, and that which is to come; such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is there betwixt the hope which we haue heere (yea euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the world and aboue our selues,) and the perfect and full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the good which we seeke to atteine vnto. But let vs in feaw
words gather togither what wee haue said heretofore. Whereas
wee seeke for an ende or restingpoint, the world is made for man,
man for the Soule, the Soule for the mynd, the mynd for a much
higher thing than it self, and what els can that be but God? As for
that which we vnderstand here as concerning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God by our naturall
wisdome; it is but ignorance; and that which we conceiue by our
supernaturall power, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> but beléefe; and beleefe maketh not things
perfect, but only moueth the vnderstanding. It followeth then that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:13215:184"/>
our doings can haue no end to rest vpon here, but only in the life to
come, which is the beholding and knowing of God. Againe, if wee
seeke the souereine good; our appetites owe obedience to our will,
our will to our reason, and the perfection of our reason is the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of God. And so the contentment of our will is our possessing
of God. Now we possesse not God, but so farre foorth as wee loue
him: we loue him not, but so farre foorth as we knowe him: and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can ignorance ingender earnest loue, nor beleefe ingender full
and perfect fruition, but onely a certeyne hope, which hope is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with impatience euen in the best of vs. It followeth therefore
that we cannot inioye our souereine welfare, vntill we bee come to
our vtmost end; nor haue our full contentation, vntill wee haue full
knowledge: that is to wit, wee cannot haue it in this world, nor in
man, which two cannot content the mynd or satisfie the will of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
forsomuch as eyther of them both is a world of wretchednesse: but
though wee haue a dubble life, yet can we haue our vtmost resting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
and our onely souereine welfare, nowwhere els but onely in
God and in the euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>Here I should declare what that felicitie of man shalbe, when
he is come to his vtmost restingpoynt. But who wilbee so rash as
to open his mouth in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> behalf, after him that hath told vs that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eye hath seene it nor hart can conceyue it? And how should we
knowe it here, being vnable eyther to see it or to haue it here? Now
therefore at one word, let vs be contented with this, that all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
shalbe satisfied at that day, seeing they extend not but too the
things that are; and that in God we shall at that day see, haue, and
knowe all things. But yet for a more larger confirmation of this
former poynt, it is now tyme to here what the Philosophers say
thereof.</p>

that <hi>Cicero</hi> saieth that the whole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

skill of the right way one as another: and at the last the most part
of them perceiue in the end of their trauell, that the more haste they
made, the further they wandered from their way. But what woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is it if blynd folkes, or such as are guyded by blynd folkes, or
such as haue no guyde at all, doe goe astray? Nay rather, were it
not to bée estéemed for a myracle, if any of them all, howbeit being
guided from aboue, should happen to hit vpon the right way? Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
desire causeth men to seeke their welfare. And all Philosophie
lyeth in that poynt of seeking out the welfare of man. Sinne hath
put vs from it, and maketh vs to lose it. And therefore the wiser
sort haue laboured to recouer it by eschewing sinne. But most men
knowing not that this sinne is come vppon vs by a high fall, and
therefore imagining themselues to bee nestled still in their former

there were twohundred fowerscore and eight opinions, concerning

so fewe could hit vppon the trueth. Yet notwithstanding they try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
one ouer another, and were curious in confuting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as in déede it is alwaies more easie to reproue a fault, than to
amend it; and to conuince a lye, than to finde out the trueth. But
yet at leastwise we haue wonne thus much at the hands of them al,
That there is one chiefe ende and one souereine good, whereat all
men ought to ame: and wee finde euen by the contrarietie of their
own reasons one against another, that it is none of all those things
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13215:185"/>
wherein they haue sought it: wherevpon wee may easely conclude,
that it cannot bee anywhere els, than where wee seeke it. Had they
well considered, that Man is falne from his former dignitie, and
compared the glorie of his former state with the wretchednesse of
his present state; they would haue sought none other happinesse or
felicitie than to returne thether, that is to say, than to bee linked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
vnto GOD: and they would neuer haue followed so many
fond fancies, more worthie to be pityed than to be laughed at. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
there are some fewe to be found in all ages, which haue

were their pleasures? Forsooth (say they) to bethinke a mans selfe
how oft he hath made good chere, or how oft he hath séene his trull.
O straunge beastlinesse. As who would say (sayth <hi>Plutarke</hi>) that
the pleasures of this world were to be kept in Conserues, or to bee
layd vp as Restoratiues in the closet of mans memorie: or rather
(say I) as though the rememberance of troubles past, yea or of

                  <note place="margin">Porphyr. in his first booke of the Soule to Byrithius and Anebon.</note> vpholdeth) is but
mere coniecture, easie to bee ouerthrowne with euery little push.
Now then, how may this bee a happinesse, vnlesse we will graunt
that the Owle is happie in comming neere the Sunne; or a blynd
man happie in beholding colours?</p>
               <p>His Disciples <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi> perceiuing that all
our contemplation is but vexation of mynd, most commonly to no
purpose; haue found vs out another deuyce. Which is, that all our
happinesse consisteth in ioyning the capacitie of our mynde, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our imagination, vnto certeyne separated substances, to be
informed by them in all maner of knowledge: for the which deuyce
they bee reproued of most Philosophers, and as I beléeue, in the
end they laughed themselues to skorne for it. But as I haue sayd
alreadie, what are these separated substances of theirs? Or rather
why did they not set our felicitie in being knit vnto GOD, whom
they confesse to be better than all these things? Againe, who is he,
were he neuer so fantasticall, euen though it were <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

beare vs on hande) the knowledged of the nature of all sensible

shall we atteyne to the full heyghth thereof, if wee stop at the very
beginning?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Academikes</hi> therfore, who take vpon them to weare <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi>
liuery, mounted vp one step higeher, and considered very well
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:13215:186"/>
that all our contemplation is but a continuall wrestling, one whyle
against the darknesse of the things,<note place="margin">Laertius in the life of Plato-Plato in his Phoedon.</note> and another whyle against the
darknesse of our owne mynd. And as they acknowledged our hurt
to proceede of a fall, whereby we brake our wings, which (as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
interpreteth them) were Morall vertue and contemplation: so
conceiued they therevpon, that it were a great good turne for vs to
recouer them againe. But whether to bee caried by them? Let vs
heare that of <hi>Plato. All the things in this world</hi> (sayth he) <hi>which
we cal goods, as Beautie, Riches, Strength, Nobilitie, and such
other; are so farre of from being goods in deede, that they be
rather corrupters and hinderers of good.</hi> Then are they very
farre of from beeing the <hi>Souerein good of man,</hi> or consequently
the <hi>End</hi> whereat he out to stay. Againe, <hi>It is vnpossible</hi> (sayeth
<hi>Plato) that men should be happy in this lyfe, doe what they
can: that is to be had in another lyfe, where the vertuous shal
receiue felicitie for a reward.</hi> In vayne then doe wee seeke that
here beneath, by our deedes and contemplations, which is not here
to be found: and in vayne doe we set our vtmost end heere, where
is not the furthest end of our lyfe. But in the end, what is this feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie?
It is (sayth <hi>Plato) to be ioyned vnto GOD, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
lyke vnto him, who is himselfe the highest top, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
end, and the vtmost bound of all felicitie.</hi> Thus yee see
that (by <hi>Platoes</hi> iudgement) the two things which we seeke, doe
meete both togither alonly in God. The end of our life is to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto God. And our Blessednes or felicitie which ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
vs, which consisteth in the full fruition of all good things, is
the possessing of God, who is the very felicitie itselfe. Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
<hi>Aristotle</hi> seemeth to haue come at length to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same point,
in that he sayth,<note place="margin">Aristotle in his booke of the World: And in his Morals; and in his first booke of the Heauens.</note> That God is the beginning, the middle, and the
end of all things: and againe, that mans felicitie consisteth in the
same thing wherein the felicitie of the Gods consisteth, that is to
wit, in perfect contemplation of that which is aboue all mooueable
things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pythagoras</hi> sayde that the ende of this lyfe is Contemplation;<note place="margin">The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of old tyme.</note>
that the end of all Contemplation, is God; and that the felicitie of
man is to be lifted vp vnto God. Also he taught vs that we be but
as Pilgrims in this world,<note place="margin">Pythagoras. Mercurius Trif megistus, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise called Hermes.</note> and as folke banished from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
and what doth the banished man desire more, than to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
home into his owne Country? And <hi>Mercurie</hi> sayeth, that
our end is to liue in Soule, which in this world is as good as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:13215:187"/>
That in this world there is not any thing that is woorthy to
be sayd to bee well or good. It is in another place therefore that
man must liue and inioy his welfare, namely (as he sayth) in being
become one againe with God. And <hi>Zoroastres</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zoroastres.</note> saith, that we must
trauel with al our power towards the brightnes of the father, who
is the giuer of our Soule. Also he hath told vs that we be falne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from this brightnesse of light into thicke darknesse, and haue
lost Gods fauour by going about to set our selues free from his
seruice. But as the world hath taught vs more and more that there
is no good in the world: so the later Philosophers haue discoursed
yet more largely thereof, than those that went afore. Here therefore
wee might rehearse a good part of <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> and others,
whose opinion forasmuch as I haue alledged already in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <hi>and it is sayd that he
was so called, because he spake so Diuinely of this matter. Thus
therfore doth he say:</hi> Shal we say that to be healthy, to be faire,
to be riche, to be honored, to be of a good wit, and such lyke
are mans happines? No surely. The strength of man is but a
iest, and his honour a mockery. Yea, Man himself and all that
he maketh account of, are but a fleeting shadowe. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
vnto good men, they be good possessions; but vnto wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, they be euill and daungerous. What then? shoulde
not the possessing of them for euer, and not as in a Dreame
that vanisheth away, be the true happines? No: the possessing
of them for euer, if it were without vertue, were a very greate
mischiefe, and the sooner they were taken from vs, the lesse
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:13215:187"/>
harme it should be. Nay, the very true meane to atteine to the
heauenly felicitie, is praying and calling vpon the Goddes, &amp;
cheely vpon the great God which reigneth ouer them all. <hi>And
therefore he sayth in another place,</hi> Whatsoeuer a man doeth or
leaueth vndone, ought to be referred to the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all
this lyfe is ordeyned for nothing els but to followe God; the
knowledge of whom is perfect vertue, Wisdome and Blesful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which maketh vs lyke the Goddes, <hi>that is to say (after his
maner of speaking,</hi> like the Angels. <hi>Let vs heare yet more of him.</hi>
The time hath bene <hi>(saith he)</hi> that man was fast tyed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

him to be well aduised, by what meane he may be rid of
it. Now, other knowledge there is none that can deliuer him,
but onely the knowledge of God. For the paterne of felicitie,
is to knowe the good, and the knowing of good, is the holy
gate whereby to come to the maker of all things. Now <hi>(sayth

maketh vs to forget God, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be separated from this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
lyfe wherein we be: for this body will neuer suffer vs to
play the right Philosophers in deed. <hi>It followeth then that this
knowledge of God vnder the which he comprehendeth all vertue,
all wisedome, and all studie of Philosophie, cannot be atteind vnto
nor become perfect in this lyfe, but onely in the life to come.</hi>

               <p>The finall end of Man (<hi>sayth</hi> Plotin) is the pure Good,<note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 1. lib. 4. cap. 15. 16.</note> that

good,<note place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 6. lib. 9. Cap. 10.</note> can haue no good taken from him, nor any good put
vnto him. For it is not only an vniting vnto God, but almost a
being of God himselfe. <hi>Now who is he that can take such posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it in this lyfe? And therefore he addeth.</hi> There our mynd
beholdeth the fountayne of life, of vnderstanding, of being,
the cause of good, and the roote of the Soule. There lyeth our
welfare after such a sort, that to be farre from it, is as good as
not to be atall. There is the beginning and end of lyfe. The
beginning; for from thence doth it proceede; and the end;
for there is the welfare whereon it resteth. The welfare, say I;
for in atteyning thether, it becommeth agein that which it
had bin afore. For as for the being which it hath here, what is
it but a downfall, whereby it hath lost hir wings? Here reigneth
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:13215:188"/>
a bace and vile Venus; but there reigneth a heauenly one.
Here a loue of the World; there the loue of God. And what a
greefe ought it to be vnto vs, to be wedded to the earth? And
on the contrary part, how desirous ought we to bee to feele
God in all parts aboue? Yea and to be so ioyned vnto him, as
one centre is within another, so as both of them may be but

(<hi>sayth he</hi>) and the end of happy lyfe, and the perfection of our

by acknowledging that he gouerneth all things with Iustice,
as by consenting to all that he doth, as proceeding from a

as in the roote, it abydeth in the perfection wherein GOD
created it. But if it fall to starting out of him, it becometh wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

in <hi>Plotine, Porphyrius, Proclus, Hierocles</hi> &amp; such others, whome
it would be ouerlong to heare, only <hi>Iamblichus</hi> shall suffice, whose
words are these: <hi>The good Soule shall dwell with GOD, and
walke vp and downe in Heauen, where it shall haue a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

shalbe sent vnder the Earth, to the iudgements which are
there executed vpon Soules.</hi> Now what can we demaund more
of the Philosophers, than that which they confesse? Namely that
the happines and the ende of man, are not in this lyfe but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that the marke which man should shoote at, is to imploy
this in the knowing of GOD, that in the other lyfe he may euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
enioy all good things in him.</p>
               <p>So then, let vs conclude both by mans reason and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of all Philosophie. That as the body of man relyeth vpon his
Soule; so his mortall lyfe relyeth vpon the immortall lyfe that is
to come: That the end wheretoo man was created in this world,
is to know and serue God, and to possesse him wholy aboue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
for asmuch as by our fall wee bee falne from knowledge into
ignorance, and therfore although we haue some little glimmering
sight of our end which wee ame at, yet wee wote not how to shape
our selues to it; And again, by the same fall we be falne from our
souereine welfare into a bottomlesse pit of misery, where we créepe
so lame as it is not possible for vs to returne ageine to our former
state: Let vs see whether God of his mercie, haue not left vs some
remnants whereby to get vp ageine, and to bee directed into our
right way; and whether hee himselfe also doe not reache vs out his
fatherly hand, through the cloudes of darknes wherewith we bee
ouerwhelmed, to pull vs backe and to call vs home ageine to him,
as very Bastards, Rebelles, and vnworthy Caytifes as we he.</p>

and therefore he must applye himself withall his heart to
immortall things. That by sinne he is falne from God and from
himselfe: and therefore he must craue forgiuenesse of him, that his
wrath may bee appeased: That this offence was a certeyne pride
and ouerwéening of himselfe; and therefore he must acknowledge
his frayltie and wretchednesse, and humble himself before GOD.

that is to say, one ordinarie duetie &amp; seruice of man towards God?
For what els are all the exercises of Religion, but appertenances
of the Articles which we haue proued; that is to wit, of the creation
of the world, and of Gods Prouidence; of the Immortalitie of the

This is in token that wee ought to humble our selues beneath the
very earth. Againe, there be Sacrifices both generall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and what are those but protestations that all of vs and euery of
vs haue deserued death? In the end of all this, there commeth a
promise and a pretence of euerlasting life, to such as discharge their
duetie towards God: which is as much to say, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and obseruations are not the things that wee must rest vpon,
but are meanes to leade vs to our right end, which is to lift vs vp
on high. But betwéene these two last Articles, namely betwéene
the death which wee protest our selues to haue deserued, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
life that is behighted vs to inherit, there is a maruelous
waste distance to bee filled vp: and yet notwithstanding eyther it
must néedes bee that man is set in the world in vayne, or els that
there is a way or a bridge ordeyned for the passing thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Religion, which hath brought vs to the pits brim, must also
shewe vs this bridge; that she may vnyte and linke vs againe vnto
God, from whom we be gone so farre and so strangely by our fall;
and that she may reconcyle vs as bastardly children to our father,
and as rebellious Subiects to our Prince: without which reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
or (according to the Latin deriuation) Religion, God ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to be our father, and wee to bee his children; and all Religion,
how gay and glorious show soeuer it haue, is vtterly vnprofitable
and vayne. Now, the end that man should ame at in this life, is to
returne vnto God, and it cannot be in vayne: but in vayne it should
be, if there be no way to leade man vnto GOD, or rather to bring
God vnto man. To the intent therefore that neither GOD be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
of his glorie, nor man of his end and felicitie, there must
according to my former profes) néedes bee a way, that is to say a
meane to reconcyle man vnto God, and to vnite him againe vnto
him, that he may bee saued; which way wee will (according to the
common spéech) call Religion.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">There is but one true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> all the auncient men agree fully, that there ought to be a
Religion among all men; as in déede there is not a thing that doth

maner <hi>as</hi> Aristotle <hi>termeth it; that is to say, a naturall propertie
which agreeth fitly to the whole kind of man, and only to man, and
without the which he cannot bee a man. Now I am not ignorant
that they speake sometimes of the seruing of the Gods in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
number, as though there were mo Gods then one; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that some of the Philosophers turned aside to arte magike,
and all of them yeelded to the I dolatries &amp; Superstitions of their
tymes. For in deede, to knowe that God ought to bee serued, and
to knowe after what sort he wilbe serued, and to serue him thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
are things farre differing. But it is inough for this tyme that
we win thus much at their hands, that of necessitie there is a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which thing euen the Nauigations of our tyme doe shewe to
be imprinted in all the Clymates of the world, and in all kinds of
men; as which haue discouered Nations that wander in Woods,

               </p>
               <p>Héerby then we know that there is a Religion,<note place="margin">Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> there is but one true Religion.</note> that is to say, a
way to Saluation, or a way whereby to come home againe vnto
God. But are there many wayes, or but onely one? It is a high
question, but yet easie to be decyded, if we consider what Religion
requireth of vs, and what it is to get for vs. Religion (as the men
of olde time themselues haue taught vs) requireth of vs in effect,
that we should yéeld full obedience vnto God: ful obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce say I, so
as we should dedicate our selues to his glorie, both our thoughts,
words and deedes, in such sort that our selues and all that euer is
in vs should bee referred to his honour. If Religion require this,
how can it be any other then one? Or what diuersitie can it admit?
And if any require lesse of vs, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented peraduenture with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, (which is all one as if they would rob God of one halfe
of a Man;) what is their dooing but Hipocrisie or high treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God? But now ageine, séeing that Religion byndeth vs in
so great a bond, euen by nature, that there is not any man which is
not inforced to confesse the dette so witnessed by the whole worlde:
surely there is no man that féeleth himselfe able to pay it, or which
doth not willingly pleade giltie, yea and which is not inforced to
say, that the most part of his thoughts, words and déedes, are not
only farre of from God, but also tending directly to offend GOD.
Now then, if Religion offer vs not as well a meane whereby to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:13215:193"/>
discharge and cancell the bond, as it offereth vs the bond it selfe: It
is so farre of from being the way to welfare which it ought to bee,
that it is rather a definitiue sentence of death, and an expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of vs. Therfore let vs see whether there be many wayes
of satisfaction, or but onely one.</p>
               <p>What shall the deuoutest man in the world offer vnto God for
his owne discharge? Shall hee offer his first fruites? God gaue
him both the séede and the whole crop. Sacrifices? The Wood, the
Fyre, and the Cattell, are all of Gods gift. The whole world, if a
man had it? Hee hath lost the inheritance and the right thereof in
séeking to infranchise himself from the seruice of God. Nay (which
more is) God not onely gaue the world vnto man, but also man to
man himself. The world then and all that euer is therein, cannot
discharge man against God. What may man himself doe? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an acceptable Sacrifice should man be to GOD (as <hi>Hierocles</hi>
saith) if he were such a one as he ought to be. But what should the
best of all men offer vp in sacrifising himself? Soothly nothing but
enuy, hatred, rayling, backebyting, vaine thoughts, vntrue words,
wrongfull dealing, and (to go yet further) faynt thanks, with cold
and counterfet praiers. Now these are so farre of from amounting
to a discharge, that they turne to a huge heape of worse and more
vndischargeable bonds, according to the infinitenesse of the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
of the Creator that is offended by them. Now then, if neither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
world nor man can dischardge man against God; what remayneth
to doe it, but God himselfe, whom Religion must offer to man for
his discharge; euen God mercifull, to God iust; God a paymay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to God the creator: Uerily, that hauing shewed vs how déep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wée be indetted to GOD; it may also teach vs the woonderfull
meane ordeyned by God and in God, wherby he and his souereine
Iustice may be satisfied, and our extreme iniquitie be therewith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued?
Now the dette of vs all is all of one sort and nature; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we owe our selues all wholy vnto God; and our vnabilitie
to discharge it is also all alyke; namely that all that euer commeth
of our selues can deserue nothing but death vpon death. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
bond (say I) entred into of vs all by Gods benefites towards
the first man, is by his disobedience become forfeted, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of himselfe and of all mankind. Besides this, the creditor and
the payer are both one, and cannot be but both one. For it is onely
God that both doth and can satisfie himself. It followeth then, that
the true Religion can be but one; namely euen that only one which
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:13215:193"/>
sheweth vs the onely one meane of saluation: and that all other
Religions, if they abate any whit of mans debt vnto God, are trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
to his maiestie; and if they set not downe a sufficient meane
of discharge, they be but vayne and vnauaylable ceremonies: and
so as well the one sort as the other, vtterly vnworthy of the name
of Religion. Furthermore, if there be diuers true Religions, I
meane diuers, as in respect of the substance of them, whereof ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that diuersitie? Of the thing which they poynt at? Nay, in
God (whom Religion looketh at) there is such vnitie, that all other
maner of vnitie is diuersitie in respect of that. And then if it bee so
that one Religion relye vpon one God, and another vpon another,
we be sure that there is but one God, and that all other Gods are
either Creatures or Uanities, insomuch that (as <hi>Proclus</hi> himselfe
saith) mo Gods and no God differ nothing atall. And so what shal
those other Religions be, but either Idolatrie or Atheisme, that is
to say, vtter Godlesnes? Whereof then? Of their ground? Nay,
Man which is the ground whereon Religion worketh, is but one
kind of thing. Also as the disease being in all men commeth of one
roote, so is it of one selfsame nature. Likewise the remedie thereof
(as I haue sayd already) is but only one. Now where the ground
is all one, the disease all one, and the remedie all one too: who will
euer say that there should bee diuersitie of Artes in the handling or
ministring of them? If a man bee too humble himselfe, I would
fayne haue them to tell me, what other way there is than to know
himselfe: what other way to knowe himselfe, than to behold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
what other way to behold himselfe, then to looke into a faire
cleare glasse? And what clearer glasse is there, than the Lawe of
God, and the perfect obedience which GOD requireth at mans
hand? And seeing that this lawe, and the perfect obedience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the same, can be but one, How may Religion be diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mo than one? Ageine, if man be to be lifted vp vnto God, what
other way is there than to make him knowe God as his Creator,
that he may honor him; as his gouernour, that he may call vppon
him; as his father, that he may obey him; and altogither iust, that
hee may seeke to appease his wrath? Which thing sith hee cannot
doe of himselfe, what shift hath he but to haue recourse to the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
And séeing that the remedie can bée but onely one; doth it not
follow that saluation lyeth in that onely Religion which sheweth it
vnto vs, and that to haue any mo Religions, is but confusion and
vanitie? And to speake properly, what is Religion? An arte or
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:13215:194"/>
skil (if I may so terme it) how to saue men. And wherein consisteth
this arte? First in shewing men their disease; secondly in shewing
them that it is deadly; and finally in teaching the fit and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
remedie. In déede the very Law of Nature leadeth vs well too
the first poynt. For who is hee which euen of Nature accuseth not
himselfe, and whose conscience nippeth him not when hee hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
Reason also leadeth vs to the second poynt. For who is hee
that concludeth not with himselfe, that the Creature which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his creator deserueth to be rooted out, that is to say, that sinne
ingendreth death? And thus farre may all Religions come, and
all Ceremonies ordeyned by man, as Praiers, Sacrifices, Was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shins,
Cleansings, &amp; such others. Bnt what is all this but a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of vs to Hellgate, or rather a shewing of Paradise vnto vs a
farre of, howbeit with such a horrible and infinite gulfe betwixt vs
and it, as man and all the whole world can neither fill vp nor passe
ouer? Yet must there néedes be a passage; For the end of Man is
to be vnited vnto God, and this end is not in vaine; the meane to
be vnited aboue, is to be reconcyled here beneath; and the meane
to be reconcyled here beneath, is (as I haue sayd alreadie) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one, which is, that God himselfe acquit vs without our dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the debt which wee owe vnto him. Onely that Religion
then (and none other) which leadeth vs streight to the said passage,
and by the following whereof we find it, is the true Religion, as
that which allonly atteineth to the ende of Religion, which is the
sauing of man. May not men (wil some say) worship God diuersly,
some lifting vp their eyes to heauen, and othersome casting their
faces downe to the ground? Yes, for the worshipping is but one,
and the humbling of mens selues is but one still, though there bee
difference in the signes. But our disputing here is not of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
but of the substance of them. Also may not men offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
diuersly? Yes. But if thy Sacrifices haue no further ende
then the sheading of the blud of a beast; then (as sayth <hi>Hierocles</hi>)
they be to the Fyre but a feeding thereof with fewell and vapors;
and to the Préestes, a superfluous maintenance of butcherie. It is
requisite therefore that sacrifices should bee referred to somewhat;
namely that by them thou shouldest protest, that whereas the sillie
innocent beastes doo suffer death, it is thou thy selfe that hast deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it both in body and Soule. Againe, if thou haue nothing els in
thy Religion, but Sacrifices and prayers; how goodly a showe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they make, thou hast nothing but a confession of thy fault, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:13215:194"/>
a sentence of death against thee for the same. For if those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
aime not at a certein marke, they be trifling toyes; and if that
be the end whereat they aime; then come they short, as which doe
but leade thee vnto death, and there leaue thee.</p>
               <p>There are some that would beare vs on hand,<note place="margin">An obiection.</note> that Religion is
but an obseruation of certeyne Ceremonies in euery Countrie; by
which reason, that which is holy here, should be vnholy in another
place; and that which is godly in one Land, should be vngodly in
another. To be short, they make it lyke the Lawes that depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Custome, which passe no further than the bounds of the place
where they be vsed. If Religion be nothing else but so; what sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
art, or trade is more vayne than that? Or rather what is to be
sayd of it, but that in deede it is no Religion at all? Leachecraft is
vncerteine in many respects, as of aire, of water, of age, and of cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate:
but yet, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is Leachecraft in one Countrie, is not man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelling
in another. Lawecraft hath almost as many sundry Lawes
as caces, and the caces that are in the world are infinite. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
who séeth not that all these diuersities of caces are
brought vnder one vpryghtnes and reason? and that they which
yéeld not thereunto, are not reputed for men, but rather, for enemies
of mankynd and wyld beasts? Also vertue hath the affections to
woorke vpon, a ground more mouable than the Sea and the wind.
And yet who wil say, that that which is hardines betweene the too
Tropiks is Cowardlines in all other Countryes; or that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
is stayednesse in one half of the world, is vnstayednesse in the other
half? To be short, what thing is more subiect to rising and falling,
or to be cryed downe or inhaunced, than coyne of siluer and gold, as
which séemeth to followe the willes of princes? And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
for all their ordinances and proclamations, both gold and
siluer do alwayes kéepe a certeine rate and valew. What shall we
say then to Religion, which hath a firmer and substantialler ground
than all these; I meane not mennes bodies, goods, affections, or
fantasies; but the very soule and mynd of man, who also hath such
a rest to stay vppon, as is settled, vnmouable, and the Lord of all
Chaunges, that is to wit, God? How much more wysely doth our
<hi>Pythagorist Hierocles</hi> teache vs, that Religion is the gouernesse
of all vertewes, and that all vertewes tend to her as to their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
end, as who would say, they be no vertewes if they swarue
from her; insomuch that hardynesse being referred to any other
than godlynesse, becommeth rashnesse; wisedome becommeth wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:13215:195"/>
lynes; and Iustice becommeth Iuggling; and at a woord, all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is but masking and hipocrisie? If Religion be the end of all
vertewes, must it not needs be fixed and vnmouable? Or if it be
mouable, what is there then that is iust, good, or vertuous? And if
the case stand so; what thing in the world is more vnauaylable than
man, or to speake more ryghtly, what thing is to lesse purpose in
man, than his mynd? But there is vertue, and the wickeddest man
that is, will auow it. Therefore there is also a certeine Religion,
which maketh it to be vertue, and whereunto vertue referreth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and the vngodlyest man that is cannot scape from it.</p>
               <p>Let vs looke yet further into the absurdities of this opinion.
Who can denie but that among the diuersities of Religions, there
were many sorts of wickednes and vngodlynes openly executed;
some woorshipping the creatures in Heauen yea and on earth, as
the <hi>Egiptians</hi> did in old time, and as the <hi>Tartarians</hi> do at this day;
some offering vp men in Sacrifice, as the <hi>Carthaginenses</hi> did in
old tyme and as the Westerne Iles do yet at this day: and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
permitting things not only contrarie to all Lawes, but also
euen horrible and lothsome to nature? If all this be good; I pray
you what good is there, or rather what euill is there in the world?
But if it be euill in itself; who can deny but that there were wicked
and vngodly Religions in the world, (I vse the woord Religion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the comon maner) and that a man had neede of a Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to discerne the good Religion from the bad? And in verie deede
it is so rooted in nature to beléeue that there is but one Religion to
be had, as well as to beleeue that there is but one God; that (as we
may daily see) a man will rather indure the change of a temperate
aire into an extreme whot or into an extreme cold; of freedom into
bondage; and of Iustice into Tyrannye, than any alteration atall
(though neuer so little) in the case of Religion: verily as who
would say, it were not so naturall for a man too loue his natiue
Countrie, to be frée, and to be at his easie; as to haue some one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
Religion to gwyde him to saluation.</p>
               <p>Now my meaning hath bin to lay foorth this trueth after the mo
sorts, of purpose to take away the doubts, and to auoyde the krinks
inuented anew by certeine Libertines. But forasmuch as there are
many Ceremonies which disguise them selues in the attire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to deceyue vs:<note place="margin">The first mark of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> it is more needfull for vs to haue sure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
marks, whereby to discerne the true Religion. First of all
therefore let vs lay this foundation which I haue layd and settled
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:13215:195"/>
alreadie heretofore, namely that Religion is the ryght Rule of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God, and of reconcyling and reuniting man agein vnto God,
that he may be saued. Now mans Saluation is nothing els but
his felicitie, happynes, souereyne good, or welfare: and his welfare
(as I haue declared afore) is to be knit vnto God. For neither the
world, nor any creature in the World can make man happye, but
only he that made man. And it is a cleare case that wee ought to
serue him heere beneath, who is to make vs happie aboue, and nòne
other but him. All Religion therefore, (how goodly a showe so euer
it haue to the eye,) which turneth away from seruing God to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the Creature, is but Idolatrie and vngodlynes vnto vs. Also
all Religion which causeth vs to séeke our welfare anywhere els,
than only in him that is the maker of all welfare; wilbe vnto vs not
only vanitie and a thrusting of vs out of the way; but also a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of ourselues, and a casting of vs headlong into all wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednes.
They may well haue in them an offering of first fruits, of
thanksgiuings, and of other seruices: but all these are but iniuries
and blasphemies ageinst God, if wee think ourselues beholden too
any creature for the things which we neither haue nor can haue of
any but the Creator. Also they may well haue prayers, and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but those prayers shalbe both vayne and vngodly, being made
to him that cannot here them, and which impute the gouernment of
the world vnto Creatures, or to such as sée them not, or can scarsly
sée the things that are afore them. And asfor their Sacrifices, they
shalbe but smokie sauours, yea ful of trayterous trecherie to God,
in that they confesse their lyues before dead things and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to Creatures for the offences which they haue committed
ageinst the Creator. Now therefore let the first marke of the true
Religion which we séeke, be this; that it direct vs &amp; all our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruices
vnto the true God the maker of Heauen and earth, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
searcher of mens hearts, which are the things wherewith he wil
cheefely be serued; that it may distinguish it from all Idolatries,
which seeke vnto wood, to stone, to the Sunne, to the Moone, to
Men, to Angells, and to all the Creatures that are in Heauen and
in earth. And it is not needfull to heape vp here greate nombers of
proofs, or to repeate agein the things that haue bin discoursed in
the second and third chapters of this woorke. For sith there is but
one God, and but one Religion; there is not also any thing more
agréeable to nature, than to referre the same wholly to the creator.
And in verie deede <hi>Plotin, Porphyrius, Proclus, Iamblichus</hi> and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:13215:196"/>
such others; which worshipped the Angels or good spirits as they
thought; sayd that their so doing (wherein neuerthelesse they were
more vnexcusable) was to atteyne by degrees to the highest God.</p>
               <p>But will this sayd marke alone fuffice vs?<note place="margin">The second marke of true Religion.</note> No: wee must not
only serue GOD, but we must also serue him aright. Now then,
what is the Rule of this seruice, or who is he that can set it downe
in writing? That we may serue him aright, it behoueth vs to know
him aright: and which of vs can vaunt of that? How many bee
there which after long studie, can but so much as tell vs what it is
not? And what followeth then, but that lyke as the wizdome of
the world, cannot without the ouerthrowe of it selfe, atteyne any
further concerning God, than to say what hee is not: so the same
wizdome may well atteine so farre as to discerne what seruing of
God is false; but it can no more set downe and poynt out the true
seruice, than it can atteyne to the knowledge of the Godhead. The
Country cloyne shalbe skorned for his labour, if he take vpon him
to appoynt how his Prince is to be serued; and yet is he a man as
well as the Prince, differing from the Prince in state and calling,
but not atall in nature and kind. What is to be sayd then of Man,
who is but a woorme, yea and lesse than a woorme in respect of the
euerlasting God; if hée will needes shape him &amp; serue him after his
owne fancie? The Philosopher will say that GOD ought to bee
serued. And if he be a Diuine, he will passe somewhat further, and
say, that he is not serued with vapors and smoakes, nor with the
sheading of blud. But which of them hath euer sayd, God is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and serued in spirit? And if any of them haue come any thing
neere it; how wyde hath he wandered away ageine when he came
to the particular poynting out of that seruice? Of a trueth, what
are all the worshippings of God which man hath ordeyned of his
owne head, but childish imaginations, not onely vnbeseeming the
Maiestie of God, but also inferiour to the discretion of a man? as
Gamings, Showes, Stageplayes, Ronnings of Horses, Iusts,
a thousand sorts of Combats, Swordplayings, Wrestlings, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings
and such other? And what doth all this betoken, but that
man mounteth not aboue man; and that when he thinketh himself
to flye his lightest pitch, he scarce heaueth himselfe vpright vppon
his feete, but neuer riseth aboue the earth? For what man is hee
which calling his witts about him, and looking aduisedly vnto him
selfe, could find in his heart to bee honored and serued after that
maner? Surely then let vs say, that looke how farre God voutsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:13215:196"/>
to stoope vnto vs, so farre be we able to mount vp vnto him: for
his comming downe, is our mounting vp. For if we cannot see the
Sonne but by helpe of the Sonne, how welsighted so euer we be:
much lesse can God be séene or knowen of vs, without the help and
light of God himself. To be short, we cannot serue God except we
knowe him nor knowe him except he voutsafe to discouer himselfe
to vs, and therefore wee can not knowe how to serue and worship
him, furtherfoorth then he listeth to shewe it vnto vs by his word.
And yet for the discouering of himself vnto vs, he néedeth neither
to drawe vs vp to his brightnes, nor to come downe to vs in his
maiestie. For our mynds could no more abyde it than our eyes can
away with the beholding of the Sonne: but hee must be fayne too
stoope to our small abilitie, by telling vs what seruice he requireth
at our hands, not according to his spirituall nature which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly comprehend, but as it were through a glasse or a scarf,
according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleshly nature which we beare about with vs. Thus
haue we found our second marke of Religion; namely that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God which Religion is to teach vs, must be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his word, and reuealed vnto vs by his ownselfe.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare what the heathen say in this case, who knewe very
well that all the Ladders of their Philosophie were too short to
reache thereunto, and that it behoued men to be inlightened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
from aboue. <hi>Diuinitie</hi> (saith <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epistle: and in his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides.</note>) <hi>cannot be laydforth
after the maner of other kinds of seruing, but hath neede of
continuall mynding. And then our wit is foorthwith kindled
as with a fyre, which afterward gathereth light more &amp; more,
and maynteineth it selfe. Finally</hi> (sayth he) <hi>we know nothing
of Gods matters by our owne skill.</hi> If he which of all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Philosophers saw most cléere, confesse here that his sight fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
very much if it be not ayded from aboue: what may we déeme
of others? And in good sooth, in matters of Religion he sendeth vs
euermore to the auncient Oracles, that is to say (according to his
meaning) to Gods word.<note place="margin">Aristotle in his Supernaturals.</note> 
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Supernaturals rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and commendeth a certeyne answere of <hi>Simonides</hi> too <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
Kyng of <hi>Sicilie;</hi> which is, that it belongeth to none but onely
God, to haue skill of the things that are aboue nature; and howe
much lesse then to be skilfull in Diuinitie, and to dispose of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that is to say to shewe the meane how to ouercome and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
nature? And whereas <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Lawes sayeth,<note place="margin">Cicero in his first booke of Lawes.</note> that
there is not any lawe among men wherto men are bound to obey,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:13215:197"/>
vnlesse it be ordeined by GOD, and deliuered as it were with his
owne mouth: if he had bene well examined, he would haue sayde
no lesse concerning Religion. <hi>It is certaine</hi> (saith <hi>Iamblicus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iamblichus.</note>) <hi>that
we be bound to do the things that please God.</hi> But which are
those? <hi>Surely</hi> (sayth he) <hi>they be not possible to be knowen of
any man, but of him that hath heard God himselfe speake, or
which haue learned them by some heauenly instruction.</hi> And
<hi>Alpharabius</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> agreeth thereunto in these words.<note place="margin">Alpharabius in his booke of Sciences.</note> 
                  <hi>The
things that concerne GOD, and are to be beleeued through
holy fayth, are of a higher degree than all other things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they proceede from diuine inspiration, and mans wit is
too weake, and his reason too short too attayne to them.</hi> And
therefore we reade that as they which haue ordeined and stablished
any Religion in any Nation, haue giuen it foorth as proceeding
from God; verily because nature taught them, that it belongeth to
none but to God alone, to appoynt how hee shalbe serued; neither
would the ordinance therof otherwise be obserued, because the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that were to obey it, would make as great account of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
as of the partie that should inioyne it. Thus by the definitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Philosophers, our second marke standeth firme,
which will serue vs to discerne the true Religion from the inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, so as we may well refuse for vntrueth, whatsoeuer is
not grounded vpon Gods word. But in following our former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
let vs consider yet further whether this will suffice or no.<note place="margin">The third marke of true Religion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We haue néede of a Lawe that procéedeth from Gods mouth:
and what may that I pray you be, but the same which proceedeth
from holynesse it self, namely that we should be holy as he is holy?
And if we cannot of our selues know God, nor how he ought to be
serued; alas how shall we performe it when he hath declared it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs? The ende of Religion (sayeth <hi>Plato</hi>) is to knit man vnto
God. The way to bring this to passe, is to become rightuous and
holy, or (as saith <hi>Iamblichus</hi>) to offer vnto GOD a cleane mynd
voyd of all naughtines and cléere from all spot. What man (as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
they themselues confesse) could euer vaunt therof? And what
els then is Religion to all of vs, but a booke wherein we reade the
sentence of our death, that is to wit our very death in deede, vnlesse
that in the ende wee find some grace or forgiuenesse of our sinnes?
Yet notwithstanding Religion is the Pathway to life, yea euen to
eternall life; a Pathway that hath a certeyne ende, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyleth
vs not. Therefore it must by some meanes or other fill vs
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:13215:197"/>
vp the great gulfe that is betwéene endlesse death, and endlesse life,
and betwéene the dwellingplace of blessednes, and the horriblenes
of Hell. And therefore let our third marke be, That Religion must
put into our hands, a meane to satisfie Gods Iustice, without the
which, not onely all other Religions, but also euen that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
the true seruing of the true GOD were vtterly vayne and
vnprofitable. Now, mans reason hath well perceiued that some
such meane was néedefull in Religion: but to knowe what that
meane is, was to high a thing for mans reason to atteyne vntoo.
In respect whereof the <hi>Platonists</hi> busied themselues very much in
finding out some meane to cleanse men from their sinnes, and too
knit them vnto God beeing reconciled to his fauour, and they set
downe certeine degrées wherby to atteine therunto. But yet in the
end they confesse all their washings and clensings to be vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient.
There are which say it is to bee done by abstinence, by
vertuous behauiour, by skill, or by <hi>Iupiters</hi> mysteries; and some
say it is to be done by al of them successiuely one after another. But
yet when they haue bestirred themselues on all sides, <hi>Porphyrius</hi>
conclusion is, That they be Ceremonies without effect, and yet
notwithstanding that there must of necessitie néedes be a meane to
purge and iustifie men, and that the same must bee vniuersall, and
that it is not possible (admitting Gods prouidence as we ought to
doe) that God should leaue mankind destitute of that meane. And
that this remedie ought to be conteyne din Religion, hee sheweth
sufficiently in that hee seeketh it in taking the Orders, and in the
Consecrations, hallowings and other misteries of his owne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which in the end he letteth go againe. But yet more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
doth <hi>Hierocles</hi> shewe it,<note place="margin">Hierocles in his 14. and 24. Chapters, and in his preface.</note> who sayth that Religion is a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Wisedome that consisteth in clensing and perfecting the life,
that men may be at one with God, and become like vnto him: and
that to atteyne to that cleanesse, the meane is to enter into a mans
owne conscience, and to consider of his sinne, and to confesse it vnto
God. Thus farre he is very well. Neuerthelesse, here they stoppe
ouershort euerychone of them: for vppon confession inseweth but
death, vnlesse God (who is the very Iustice it selfe, and more infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
contrary to euill than we can imagine,) be appeased and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for our offences, whereas in Religion we séeke for very life.
To bee short, of the great nomber of Religions which are in the
Worlde, some haue no certeine restingpoint atall; as we reade of

first in the morning; and that is but a vaine Ceremonie: Some
haue a restingpoynt, howbeit an euill one; as for example, all they
that direct vs to the creatures; and those are nothing els but Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries.
Some doe set vnto themselues a good end, in that they aime
at the Creator; but they will néedes worship him after their owne
fancie; and that is a swaruing aside to superstition, or rather (which
worse is) a seruing of their owne fancie, and not of GOD. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the residue, there is one which hath an eye to the Creator
and honoureth his Lawe, and that is the Religion of the Iewes.
This againe is a way that leaueth vs in the middes of our way,
leading vs into the wood, but not leading vs out againe. But the
true Religion in déede and which deserueth the name of Religion,
is only that which hath God for hir shooteanker, his woord for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of hir worshipping, and a meane appoynted by him to pacifie
hym withal; and in that onely and in none other resteth any Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>Some tell vs that Religion is nothing els but charitie;<note place="margin">An obiection.</note> that is
to say, the performing of a mannes duetie towards his neighbour:
and those men would tell vs if they durst, that Religion is but an
instrument of ciuil gouernment. But when they haue inlarged the
commendations of charitie as farre as they can, what can they (at
a woord) say more than we say thereof; namely, that Charitie is of
such force and weight, that Religion can by no meanes stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it? Neuerthelesse, to speake properly thereof, Charitie is not
the marke whereby to discrene the true Religion, but rather to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
who is ryghtly Religious. Too the intent a man may bée
happye, he must returne vnto God; therefore he must needs serue
him. That is the badge of Religion. But the godly or Religious
man vttereth his Religion, (that is to say, that God hath touched
him truely in his hart,) in that he performeth all the dewties of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyned
freendship and godly affection towards his neybor who is
the Image of God. Charitie therefore is nothing els but a reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of godlynes or of the loue of God, backe vnto our neybour, or
a reflexion or sigh vpon this Image. Also that a man may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye,
he must be linked vnto God; and that he may be linked vnto
God, he must be reconciled into his fauor. Now this charitie which
they speake of, is but a linking of Man vnto Man. It is not that
which maketh a man happie, neither doth the fault which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
vs all, consist in want of charitie, (I meane that Charitie
which they pretend); but in rebelling ageinst God. Therefore it
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:13215:199"/>
booteth vs not to be at one with our neybour, except we be at one
with God. Neuerthelesse it is a good signe that our hart is seruent
in the loue of God, as the child is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of his father, when being
vnable as yet to vnite our selues vnto him, we link our selues in one
body and one mind to al those which beare his Image. To be short,
the true marke of fire is not heate; for there are other things which
are whot as well as fire: but it is a vertew that is so linked vnto it,
that as soone as ye heare of fire, it followeth immediatly that there
is heate also, but not contrarywise. Lykewise Charitie is not the
true religion itself, but a vertue which accompanieth it so of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
that a man can no sooner say there is Religion in this man or
that man; but that it must needs followe incontinently, that there
is charitie in him also. And what maner of charitie? Soothly not
such as they take it to be which refreyne from misdealing for feare
of mannes Lawe; for that is but hipocrisie: nor a desire of credit
that we may haue the better spéede in our affayres; for that is but
a chaffaring. Nor a desire of honor whereby wee be spurred to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;
for that is but a self loue. But it is a certeine feare and loue of
God, which maketh vs to cherish and loue all those for Gods sake,
which are of him and hold of him. Now what man is he that dareth
vaunt of this perfect charitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he loueth his neyghbor as he ought,
and in such respect as he ought, that is to say as himself, and for the
loue of God? For how can we haue this charitie, if Religion go
not afore? And if our loue towards God be so short and feeble (as
I sayd afore); what rebounding backe thereof will there be vppon
our neyghbour.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let vs conclude, That as man hath but one end,
namely of returning vnto God; so there is but one ryght path to
leade him thether, and that is Religion. And that as there is but one
God; so there can be but one true Religion, that is to say, one way
that leadeth to saluation; which Religion hath these thrée vnfallible
marks whereby to discerne it; namely that it woorship the true
GOD; that it worship him according to his word; and that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concyle
to God the man that followeth it. And now let vs conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
sée which of al the Religions in the world it is, that alonly
is to be discrned by these marks.</p>

created heauen &amp; earth and all things in them;
which gouerneth them by his wisedom; which
mainteineth them by his goodnes; which wéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

the true Religion which beareth our first marke, from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religions how peinted and disguysed so euer it is possible for
them to be. This God which hath doone those things can bee but
one. For séeing he created all things, all the things which wee sée
heere beneath are but creatures. Now then, whatsoeuer Religion
pointeth vs to any mo Gods then one, we ought to abhorre it euen
at the very first approche. Again, the same God is also infinite and
incomprehensible. For the woorke cannot conceyue the woorkmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
but contrariwise the woorkemayster conceyueth the woorke.
Whatsoeuer woorke therefore is made to counterfet him or too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble

and Superstition, inuented by the Diuell or by man.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come néerer to the rabble of Religions; and wee
shall sée there throngs of hundred thousand Gods distinguished by
straunge fantasticall deuyces of men, of women, of beastes and of
monsters. Yet shall wee not sée there any whit of that which wee
séeke for. But there is one Religion to be séene among all the rest,
which for all the rest, beareth this marke graued in her forehead,
<hi>In the beginning GOD created the Heauen and Earth:</hi> and
soundeth out this spéech alowd euerywhere, <hi>The Lord our God is
but one God;</hi> and in the middes of all the rout that barketh and
byteth at her on all sides, cryeth out coragiously, <hi>All your Godds
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:13215:200"/>
are but error and vanitie.</hi> Therefore without staying vppon the
others, which are not worthie so much as to be looked on, wee will
procéede to that onely one Religion which alonly in trueth profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the true way, and the knowledge of the place whereunto wee
would come. Now, to shewe the way, the end whereto it leadeth
must be knowen: and the end which all of vs tend vnto, is a happy
lyfe. And to leade a happy lyfe, is to liue in God who is the very
happinesse it self. And the same God (as I haue made the heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themselues to confesse) is but one. The Religions therefore
which were not the liuery of that, but of many, cannot bring vs too
the happynes which we séeke: for it is but one, and to be had at the
hand of that one. Which then is the one Religion that shall leade
vs to the one God? Shall we séeke for it among the <hi>Assyrians?</hi>
They worshipped as many Gods as they had Townes. Among
the <hi>Persians?</hi> They had as many Gods, as there be Starres in
the Skye and Fyres on Earth. Among the <hi>Greekes?</hi> They had
as many Gods as they had fancies: Among the <hi>AEgiptians?</hi> They
had as many Goddes as they sowed or planted Fruites, or as the
Earth brought foorth fruites of it selfe. To be short, the <hi>Romanes</hi>
in conquering the worlde, got to themselues all the vanities in the
Worlde, and they wanted no wit to deuyse others of their owne
brayne. What shall it auayle vs to aske the way of these blynd
Soules, which go groping by the Walles sydes, and haue not so
much as a Child or a Dog to leade them as some blynd folk haue,
but catch hold vnaduisedly of euery thing that comes in their way?
But yet among these great Nations, we spye a little Nation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> which worshippeth the maker of al things,
acknowledging him for their Father, calling vpon him alone in all
their néedes, as (for al the small account that others made of them)
abhorring all the glistering gloriousnes of the greate kingdomes
that were out of the way. It is in the Religion of this people and
not elsewhere, that that we shall find our sayd former marke. And
therefore we must séeke it onely there, and leaue the damnable foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes
of the rest, as being assured that wee may more safely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
one man that is cléeresighted, than a thousand that are blind.
For what greater blindnes of mynd can be, than to take the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the Creator, a thing of nothing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that is infinite?</p>
               <p>Now, that the people of Israell worshipped the true GOD in
such sort as I haue described him; the continuance of their whole
Historie sheweth well ynough. All men knowe in what reuerence
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:13215:201"/>
the Byble hath bin had in all times among the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And if
any man doubt whether it be Gods word or no; that is a question
to be decyded otherwise. But yet for all that, it is out of all doubt,
that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> themselues tooke it to be so, and that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
better iudge of their Beléef and Religion, than by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for the which they haue willingly suffered death. And what
els doe those Scriptures preach from the first word of them to the
last, than the onely one God the maker of Heauen and of Earth?
As soone as you doe but open the Byble, byandby ye sée there, <hi>In
the beginning God created the Heauen and the Earth.</hi> At the
very first step in at the gate of that booke, it excludeth al the Godds
made or deuised by man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that people, to the intent to kéepe them

excellent, who for his disobedience is become subiect to corruption.
Who could punish and imprison such a substance, but he that made
it? He founded the world and peopled it, which afterward was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed
by the flud, and who could let the waters loose, but he
that held them at commaundement? The people of <hi>Israell</hi> found
drye passage through the Red Sea; and who prepared them that

Sunne stoode still and went backe at the speaking of a woorde; and
of whose word? but of his whose woord is a deede? I dispute not
heere as yet, whether these things bee true or no; but I say onely
that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> beléeued them, yea and that they beléeued them
in all ages; and that they worshipped him whom they beléeued to
be the doer of those things; who certesse cannot be any other, than
the same of whom the first lyne of the booke sayeth, That he made

The Lyons whelpes rore vnto him for foode, and all things that
liue in the aire, on the Land, and in the water, do wayt vppon him
for the supplying of their needs. And what is all this in effect, but
that the God whom <hi>Israell</hi> woorshipeth, is the Creator and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:13215:202"/>
of all things? The verie true God which maynteyneth all
things by his goodnes, as well as he made them by his power. As
carefull for all things yea euen to the least, as he is myghtfull and
of abilitie to maynteyne them. Al the whole scripture from the one
end to the other, that is to say the people of <hi>Israell</hi> from age to age,
sing nothing else but that. Now if we reade ouer the old ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the <hi>Egiptians, Persians,</hi> and <hi>Thuscanes</hi> leafe by leaf; where
shall we find in them one woord of the true God, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowncing,
and blaspheming him? And what are all their Godes
but caryers of Receyts, like these dogleaches which professe but
the curing of some one disease only, or lyke these comon craftsmen,
which professe but the skill of some one craft or misterie? But this
true God (as I haue said) is the onely one God. What other people
haue bin forbidden to call vppon many Godds? Nay rather, what
other people haue not bin comaunded to haue infinite Gods, as a
token of Religion? He is a quickening Spirit which cannot bee
counterfetted nor conceyued. What other God hath sayd, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
will ye lyken me, which do hold the Earth betweene my
Fingers? What house will yee build for me which make the
Earth my footstoole and the Heauen my feate?</hi> And to what

                  <hi>Thou shalt not make any grauen

tymes, than to breake that commaundement? Insomuch that
they would not admitte eyther peynter or karuer into any of their
Cities. Contrarywyse, which of all the Gods of the Heathen haue
not requyred Images? Yea and (as we reade in <hi>Porphirius</hi>)
taught how they should bee peynted? Much more vayne in good
sooth than the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that woorshipped them. To be short, the true God
which gouerneth the whole world, must also (as I haue said afore)
gouerne both men and their witts to his glorie. And to gouerne
them so, it behoueth him to knowe them; and to knowe them, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
him to see them; and to see into their harts, it behoueth him
to haue made them. For the father which thinketh himself to be the
begetter of a Chyld, seeth not into the hart thereof; nother doth the
schoolemayster see into his scholers wit, whereof he thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the framer. And much lesse can an Imaginatiue God do
any of those things, hauing not made the one nor the other. What
other God shall ye reade to haue sayd, <hi>Thou shalt not couet:</hi> or to
haue required the sacrifice of the hart, or the fasting of the spirit, or a
hartbroken and lowly mynd? Who els can forbid Couetousenes
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:13215:202"/>
and hypocrisie, but he which is able to punish it? And who can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it, but he that sees it? And who can see it in man, but he that
made man? On the contrarie part, who séeth not that the Lawes
which are reported to haue bin inspired by the Godds at <hi>Rome,</hi> in
<hi>Athens,</hi> and in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> extend no further than to the outward
man?<note place="margin">Cato in his oration for the Rhodians.</note> Insomuch that none of them (as sayeth <hi>Cato</hi>) is found to
haue sayd <hi>He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is mynded to steale, but only He that stealeth,
shalbe giltie.</hi> Which is as much to say, as that they be but Lawes
of men, who see not into folks harts; Lawes of Creatures which
pearce no further then the Cote or the Skinue. The people of
<hi>Israel</hi> therefore are the people that serued the onely true God that
made man, and all other people serued Gods made by men.</p>
               <p>Now this silly people (as we reade in Histories) was strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
despysed and trampled vnder foote,<note place="margin">The Heathen acknowledged the true God to be in Israell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> as though all the diuels had
conspired and banded themselues against that people, which alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worshipped the true God. But what are the Heathen compelled
in the end to confesse? <hi>Varro</hi> the best learned of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who
made a beadroll of all the Gods, for feare (as hee sayth) least they
should stray away: concludeth in the end, that those doe worship
the true God, which worship the onely one, without Images, and
which beléeue him to be the gouernor of the whole world. Yea and
(which more is) he saith that the <hi>Iewes</hi> (by what other name soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they call him) doo worship the same God truely:<note place="margin">Austin, in the Citi of God. lib. 8. chap. 31. Denis of Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnassus. lib. 1.</note> and that if after
their example all Images had bin forbidden, (as they were a long
time in <hi>Rome</hi>) men had not fallen into so many superstitions &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
It is not to be doubted but that he which spake so of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole

more of them, if he had not feared men more than his Gods. And

Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, the chiefe Monarckeies of the world armed
themselues in all ages against this small people: but yet the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
that they were, the greater appeared the mightines of their
GOD. <hi>Sennacharib</hi> King of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had subdewed all his
neighbours, and intended to fill vp the Dyches of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as he
had doone by the ouerthrowe of other Citties. For performance
whereof he sent <hi>Rabsaces</hi> the Generall of his Hoste to subdue <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
King of <hi>Iuda.</hi> In the opinion of men <hi>Senacharibs</hi> argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
was good and well concluded. If I should send thee two thousand
Horses (saith hee) ready furnished to Battell,<note place="margin">2. Kings. 18. 19.</note> thou couldest hardly
furnish as many men to ryde them. And canst thou thinke then that
thou art able to resist my whole armie? I haue conquered <hi>Aram,</hi>
and <hi>Arphad,</hi> and <hi>Ana,</hi> and <hi>Aua,</hi> and <hi>Sepharnam,</hi> and what shall
then become of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> if it stand wilfully against mee? But
when as he said, <hi>Consider what became of the Goddes of those
Nations,</hi> supposing the GOD of <hi>Israel</hi> to haue bene of the same
stampe: therein his argument fayled, not for that (as the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
say) he concluded from the particular to the generall, or from
that which is true simply to that which is true but in some certeine
respect, but for argewing from that which is nothing at all to that
which is all, namely from the vanitie of Idols, to the almightines
of the Creator. But what became of this victorious Monarke, and
of his men, and of their Idols? Although the holy Scripture had
sayd nothing thereof, <hi>Herodotus</hi> can tell vs it sufficiently. The
Host of <hi>Sennacharib</hi> (saith he) was miserably discomfited, his state
came to decay, his owne sonnes murthered him in the Temple of
his Idols, the <hi>Babilonians</hi> gathered vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scatterings of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
(which more is) in a certeine Temple of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> an Image

and triumph to the true God, against the Goddes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
in the persone of that Prince which had destroyed so many of
them? From henfoorth the Monarchie of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> did neuer
prosper, but the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> came to be Lords of it, who
at the first seemed to take warning by the example thereof. For
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:13215:203"/>
they restored the <hi>Iewes</hi> home agein into their Countrie, according
to the Prophesies, and gaue them leaue to buyld vp their Temple
ageine, furthering them by all meanes therein, and giuing them
certeine allowances for the maintenance of their Sacrifices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
in their Letters to their Lieuetenants, that the God
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was the true God, and none other.</p>
               <p>But what shall we say of the Gods of <hi>Greece,</hi> who in conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Persians,</hi> came to take a foyle in <hi>Iewrie?</hi> For <hi>Alexander</hi>
hauing subdewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Persians,</hi> made men to worship him as a God;
and hearing that in the Mountaines of <hi>Palestine,</hi> there was a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom neither the <hi>Assyrians</hi> nor the <hi>Persians</hi> could subdue to
their Gods, for all the rigour and crueltie they could shewe; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that at his owne being in <hi>Babylon,</hi> certeyne <hi>Iewes</hi> that had
bin conueyed thether, did flatly disobey him, when he ment to haue
buylded there a Temple to <hi>Iupiter Bele,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hecataeus the Abderita.</note> as <hi>Hecateus</hi> reporteth,
who accompanyed <hi>Alexander</hi> in that voyage: he turned head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with a venemous rancour to that poore people.
But when <hi>Iaddus</hi> the Highpriest of the <hi>Iewes</hi> came before him in
his Priestly attyre, accompanyed with his Leuites about him; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
cast downe himselfe at his féete &amp; worshipped him. This
<note n="*" place="margin">Moenina, Alexander who vaunted himselfe as a God.</note> God I say whom y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greatest personages worshipped thensforth,
did there worship a man that came to make supplication vnto him.
<hi>Parmenio</hi> thinking this to be a very strange sight, asked <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the cause why he did so. It is not the man (quoth <hi>Alexander</hi>)
whom I worship, but the God whose Priest he is: for <hi>I sawe him</hi>
(sayd he) <hi>in the same attyre, when I was yet in Macedony;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosephus in his Antiquities, lib. 11 cha. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and
when I doubted whether I might meddle with Asia or no, he
gaue me courage to proceed, assuring me that by his guyding
I should ouercome the Persians.</hi> Herevpon he went vp into the
Temple, and offered Sacrifize vnto GOD, in such maner as the
Highpriest instructed him; who shewed him the booke of <hi>Daniell,</hi>
wherein it was prophesied certeyne hundred yéeres afore, that a
certeyne <hi>Greeke</hi> should come &amp; conquer the <hi>Persians,</hi> which now
fell out to bee he. Wherevpon he suffered the <hi>Iewes</hi> to liue after
their owne lawes, and from seuen yéeres to seuen yéeres released
them of all tributes, which thing he denyed to the <hi>Samaritanes.</hi>
Now, of all the great number of Nations, of whom he conquered
many moe than he saw, where reade we that euer he did the like to
any of them? And whervnto shal we attribute this déede of his, but
to his bethinking him of the thing which hehad learned in secret of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:13215:204"/>
the great Priest of the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> called <hi>Leon,</hi> namely, that all the
Gods whom the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worshipped, were Kings of old tyme,
of whom the memoriall had bin consecrated by their posteritie: and
therefore he is a greater King than any of them all, thought also
that he might well be the greatest God of them all. But in the God
of <hi>Israell</hi> he acknowledged another maner of thing: namely, that
he was God of Gods and King of Kings, the chaunger of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyres
at his pleasure, which vpholdeth Kings with his hand, not
to performe their vayne attempts, but to bring to passe his owne
euerlasting decrées. By the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Monarchie of
the <hi>Greekes</hi> came to be dispersed, so as the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> gate the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereintie
in <hi>AEgipt.</hi> And what greater proofe would wee haue of
their acknowledging the only one God, than to see <hi>Ptolomie Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph</hi>
cause the Byble of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> to be so solemnely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
at his owne charges? For what do Conquerours desire, but
to giue lawes to those whom they haue vanquished: and therefore
what els was this, than a receiuing of lawes at the hands of the
<hi>Iewes?</hi> And seeing that the men of <hi>Israell</hi> were weaker than the
men of <hi>AEgipt:</hi> what can wee say, but that the God of <hi>Israell</hi> had
subdewed the Gods of <hi>AEgipt?</hi> And soothly, afterward when <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomie</hi>
surnamed <hi>the bountifull</hi> had gotten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souereintie of <hi>Syria,</hi>
he offered not Sacrifize for his victories vnto the Gods of <hi>AEgipt</hi>
(which notwithstanding were very many in number, and seemed
to haue giuen law to the Nations round about them): but he went
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there acknowledging himselfe to haue receyued
his prosperitie of the God of <hi>Israell,</hi> did consecrate the Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of his victories vnto him. And yet was this in the tyme of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
aduersitie of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> euen when their Countrey was forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed,
and their Temple vnhallowed by their enemies and by their
owne Priestes themselues; that is to say, at such a tyme as all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things should haue disswaded him from woorshipping of the
God of that people, had not the most manifest trueth driuen him to
the contrarie.</p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>Romaines,</hi> what tyme they extended their
warres into <hi>Iewrie,</hi> we reade that they reuerenced the Temple of
<hi>Ierusalem:</hi> insomuch that <hi>Augustus</hi> ordeined certeyne Sacrifizes
to be offered there both yéerely and dayly, and that diuers Heathen
princes, being prouoked by his sending of offerings thither so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
followed his example in doing the like. But seeing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>
brought all the Gods of all the Nations whom they had
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:13215:204"/>
conquered into <hi>Rome:</hi> how happeneth it that only this God could
finde no place there?<note place="margin">Cicero in his oration for Flaccus.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> answereth, that it beseemed not the
Maiestie of the Empire. But if I should appose him vpon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
did <hi>Bacchus, Anubis, Pryapus,</hi> and their shamefull night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes
and misteries celebrated in the darke, yéeld renowme to the
state of the Empyre? Nay, if he will say the trueth, they knew that
the God of <hi>Israell</hi> (and none other) was the true God, and that for
the harbouring of him, it behoued them to driue away all the rest:
but they had so long tyme foaded folke with Idolatrie, that they
were afrayd (as many Princes are at this day) least they might be
deposed by their Subiects in receyuing their rightfull Lord.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding (will some saye) this sillie people of the
<hi>Iewes</hi> were caryed away from their own Countrey into the fower
quarters of the world, scattered among other people, and parted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
all Nations of the earth, at the pleasure of their enemies that
had gotten the vpper hand of them. Surely Gods wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
is to be noted in this case, farre more without comparison,
than if that people had conquered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world by force of armes.
For by the things which the Poets haue written of them, wee see
in what contempt they were had of all men. But yet let vs heare
the wonderment that was made thereat, not by a common person,
but by the great Philosopher <hi>Seneca.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca in his Booke of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet notwithstanding</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the custome of that Nation hath so preuailed, that it is the
rather receyued of the whole world, and they beeing vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
haue (I wote not by what meanes) giuen lawes to their
Conquerours.</hi> Who seeth not here a great motion of mynd in
this Philosopher? And what man hauing common reason, is not
rauished thereat as well as he? Is it possible for Kings to haue
subdewed a people whom they could neuer inforce to chaunge their
owne lawes? The example thereof is <hi>Iewrie,</hi> which hath bin trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vnder foote by the <hi>Assyrians, Persians, Greekes</hi> &amp; <hi>Romaines;</hi>
and yet for all their chaunging of their Maysters, they could neuer
bee brought to alter their lawe. There may perchaunce some like
constancie bee found among other Nations, as in respect of their
lawes: but that a people being conquered, caryed away, brought
into bondage, vnaccounted of, led in triumph by diuers Empyres,
as the <hi>Iewes</hi> were, should not only subdue the harts of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
to their GOD, so as the Conquerours could not fasten
their lawes vppon the vanquished sort, but contrarywise the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
sort haue fastened their lawes vpon their vanquishers, the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:13215:205"/>
Subiects vppon their Prince, the Captiues vpon their Mayster,
and the condemned vpon their Iudge: who (I pray you) would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue

any other can possibly doe it but God? But if <hi>Seneca</hi> will voutsafe
to heare <hi>Seneca</hi> quietly, it may be that he himselfe shall finde a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to his owne wonderment. Namely, that the Gods (as he
sayth) which were called inuiolable &amp; immortall, whom the <hi>Iewes</hi>
left to other Nations, <hi>were dumbe and sencelesse Images, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guysed
in the shapes of Men, Beastes, and Fishes; and some in
vgly and ilfauoured monsters; and that the Feends which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
those Images, required woorse things of men for their
seruice, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the horriblest Tyrants that euer were; as that men
should gash themselues, mayme and lame themselues, geld
themselues, and offer men women and children in Sacrifize
to them.</hi> But when folke heard speaking of the true God the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of Heauen and Earth, and that he wilbe serued with the hearts
and mynds of men: that word issewing out of the mouth of a poore
prisoner, caught men prisoners and ouercame their Gods. And in
very déede (as wee shall see hereafter) if we reade the good authors
of that tyme; eyther they speak but of the one God, or if they speak
of mo Gods, it is but for customes sake and in way of condemning
them. What els then were the manifold fléetings of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but
as many conueyings abroad of companies of Preachers, to shewe
forth the true God; and as many Armies to destroy the Idols and
to roote them out?<note place="margin">Origen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Celsus. lib. 3.</note> Wee reade that the Coniurers which were in

the God of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the God that drowned the <hi>AEgip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
in coniuring such as were possessed of Deuilles, and that the
Deuilles trembled at that name. This serueth not to proue that
they worshipped not other Gods, but that they knewe those Gods
to be of no force.<note place="margin">Iulian ageinst the Galileans.</note> 
                  <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata</hi> did vnderset his shoulder, to
shore vp the seruice of the false Gods as much as he could. But yet
durst he not deny, but that the God of <hi>Abraham Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>
is a great and mightie God; and he sware by all his Gods that he
was one of them that were conuerted to his seruice, and that hee
knewe him to be very gracious to such as serue him as <hi>Abraham</hi>
had done. Who now could euer make an <hi>Israelite</hi> confesse that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other God was good, than the same whom he worshipped? And
if he be the very God, how can it be (euen by <hi>Iulians</hi> owne saying)
that all the residue should not bee euill, seeing that this good God
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:13215:205"/>
condemneth them, and declareth them to bee all wicked Spirites
and enemies of mankynde? But if <hi>Iulian</hi> himselfe would tell vs
what befell him at <hi>Antioche,</hi> when he asked counsell of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles
who made all his Philosophers to quake, and all his great

what stuffe they be:<note place="margin">Zosimus. lib. 4. Socrates. lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> insomuch that euen his owne Historiographer
<hi>Zosimus,</hi> is ashamed to make report of it.</p>
               <p>Now, I would fayne that the Heathen or their Aduocats should
but shewe me one of these two things; eyther where any Author of
the <hi>Iewes</hi> yéeldeth record to any God of the Heathen: or where any
graue Heathen author hath condemned the God that is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Forasmuch then as in a Chapter appropried to
the same purpose, I haue alreadie proued by all the auncient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and by consent of all people, that there is but only one God;
and by <hi>Varro</hi> euen now, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> do worship the same God:
what followeth therof, but that al of them be <hi>Iewes</hi> in that poynt,
and that as many as are not so, are al ydolaters and deceiued? And
for that cause when <hi>Orpheus</hi> had praysed God in these and such
like verses alledged in the third Chapter.
<q>
                     <l>There is but one perfect God the maker of all things,</l>

                  <hi>Pythagoras to Iupiter. Heere lyeth the great

did sweare by an Oke, by a Gote, and by a Dogge; and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

to be in those Gods, than in the least creatures. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:13215:207"/>
he was the onely man whom <hi>Apollo</hi> auowed to bee the
wysest man of all <hi>Greece:</hi> wherein he had shewed himself to haue
had lesse wit than those beastes, if he had deemed such a one to bee
wisest as had condemned the Godhead. But it is the propertie of
the Deuill, both to abuse men and also to mocke them for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
They cryed out against <hi>Socrates</hi> that he was a blasphemer,
and made him to drinke his owne death. But within a while after,
the <hi>Athenians</hi> did set vp an Image of him in one of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and in a rage did put his accusers to death: [which deede of
theirs made notably against themselues:] for surely they could not
better haue condemned their Gods, than by their iustifying and
honoring of the partie that condemned them. As for his Disciple
<hi>Plato,</hi> this saying of his shall suffice. <hi>When I write vnto you in

the same too: and hee concealeth not that <hi>Numa</hi> vsed Waterspel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

worse than the worst men, Philosophical, whom they taught
to haue bin men, howbeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was not good for the people to know
it; and Ciuill, made by Princes to hold their people in awe with;
for the which purpose also <hi>Varro</hi> addeth, that it is good for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynes
and Gouerners to be perswaded that they bee descended of

Also he deuideth his Gods into certeynes and vncerteynes. The
certeyne (sayth he in his second booke) are as much or more subiect
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:13215:208"/>
to vncerteyntie than the vncerteyne. What certeyntie will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Gods, if they themselues be vncerteyn? But behold the
godlinesse of the man. Hée sayth he will make a Register and an
Inuentorie of them: and wherefore? for feare (sayth he) least they
should be lost, not so much by some sacking of the Citie, as by the
negligence of the Citizens, which began sore at that time to make
no account of them. Soothly the <hi>Romanes</hi> had bene the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
if they had deified this <hi>Varro</hi> that had such a care to saue
and preserue their Gods. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise Senate thought themselues
to haue prouided well for the matter, by making this ordinance,
That no GOD should be admitted into <hi>Rome</hi> without their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
As who would say, that to bee a God it was méete that a bill
of petition should first bee exhibited vnto them, and men were to be
sewed vnto for the obteynement of their voyces. By which one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of theirs they declared themselues to bee more diuine than
their Gods. And therevpon it came to passe, that they receyued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Citie all the Deuilles, all the Tyrants, and all the filthie
Rakehelles of the world for Gods. As for the onely one true God
the Creator of men, the founder of Cities, &amp; the remouer of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyres;
he had no name at al among them.<note place="margin">Cicero concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goddes, the first of his Tusculane questions.</note> Concerning the nature of

are made to ouerthrowe all the Gods of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> For
he reckoneth vp their ages, their garments, their deckings, their
ofsprings, their auncetors, and their alliances. He sayth that their
Temples are their Tombes; their Sacrifizes and Ceremonies,
representations of their liues; and that from the least of them to the
greatest, they were all men, and all their Religious Superstitions
and olde wiues tales. As touching the true God, he speaketh farre
otherwise. For he sayth that he made al things, that he made man,
that he made the very Gods themselues, and to bee short, that it is
much easier for him to woonder at God, than to vtter what he is;
and to declare what he is not, than what he is. And whereas some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
after the maner of the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> he goeth about to drawe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things out of the fables of the Gods; he doth it but onely to
kéepe the people in ignorance, and according to his owne saying in
the selfesame bookes, where hauing condemned his owne Gods, he
sayth that yet for all that, those things are not to bee vttered to the
people; and his allegories are so cold, that it is to bee thought that
euen he himselfe laughed at them. As touching the Birdgazers he
himselfe being a Birdgazer doth flatly skorne them, that is to say
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:13215:208"/>
euen his owne profession, yea and all such as sought counsell at

Likewise wee reade that <hi>Caesar</hi> held still the Prouince of <hi>Affricke</hi>

               <p>But if wee come to the particulars, the matter will bee yet

matter that is treated of expressely by others. Among the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

because he might seeme to haue wrong, if he should not be counted
a God as well as his sonne: and the other, because it might come
to passe, that (being a firie fellowe) he would els make some fray,
seeing that <hi>Ceres</hi> is a Goddesse. To dispatch the chiefe of them
quite and cleane of that doubt, <hi>Euhemere</hi> of <hi>Messene</hi> will alone
suffice; who gathering the historie of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the rest, setteth
downe their tytles, Epitaphs &amp; Inscriptions which were in their
Temples, &amp; namely in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Triphillian,</hi> where
was a piller set vp by <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself, whereon the notablest of his
doings were ingrauen. And this historie being called holy, was
translated by <hi>Ennius,</hi> the words whereof are these.<note place="margin">Euhemere as he is cited by Lactantius.</note> 
                  <hi>Saturne</hi> (sayth
he) <hi>tooke Ops to his wife, and Tytan being his elder brother
claymed the kingdome; but Vesta their mother, &amp; Ceres and
Ops their Sisters, counseled Saturne to keepe his possession.
Which thing when Tytan perceyued; finding himselfe to bee
the weaker, he compounded with Saturne, vpon conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
if Saturne had any Sonnes, he should not suffer them to liue,
that the kingdom might reuert again vnto his Children. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which composition, the first child that was borne
to Saturne was killed. Afterward were borne Iupiter &amp; Iuno
twinnes both at one birth: of whome they shewed but Iuno,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:13215:209"/>
and deliuered Iupiter to Vesta to be brought vp in secret. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them came Neptune, who was serued likewise. And last of
all came Pluto and Glauca; of whom only Glauca (who dyed
within a while) was shewed, and Pluto was nurced secretly as
Iupiter was. Now this came to Tytans hearing, who assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
his Sonnes to him, took Saturne and Ops and put them
in prison. But assoone as Iupiter came to age, he gaue battell
to the Tytans; and getting the vpper hand of them, deliuered
his father &amp; mother out of prison. At length perceyuing that
his father, whom he had set vp againe, was iealous ouer him
and sought his life; he deposed him from his estate and droue
him into Italy.</hi> In this only one historie we sée what <hi>Saturne, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
Iuno, Vesta, Ops, Neptune</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> were, that is to wit,
men and women; yea surely euen men, and among men, but onely
mere men. And yet were they the fathers and mothers of the rest
of the Gods, and reigned in the Iles of the chiefe Midland Sea;
and in <hi>Candy,</hi> a litle afore the warres of <hi>Thebes</hi> and of <hi>Troy.</hi> And
by that meanes wee see also, from whence the Poets haue fetched
their fables; which are not (as some thinke) mere fancies or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
without ground, but disguising of the trueth, and of the
Historie: True in that they report déedes rightly beseeming men;
vntrue in that they attribute them as to Gods, and not as to men.
<hi>Saturne</hi> is taken for the father of them al. And looke what is found
of the father, is to bee verified of his ofspring. The Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
therefore haue sayd, that his wife did hide his children from
him: and the Poets haue sayd that hee did eate them vp, because a
Soothsayer had told him that one of them should depose him. To
auoyde the absurditie of the word <hi>Krouos</hi> which is <hi>Saturne,</hi> the
<hi>Stoikes</hi> haue turned it to <hi>Chronos,</hi> (that is to say tyme,) which
deuoureth all things. But how will they applye all the rest of the
Allegorie vnto the Historie? Who shall bee the daies lost, and who
the daies saued? What shall <hi>Ops</hi> be, and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Pluto?</hi> who
shall be this sonne of tyme, that perisheth not with the tyme nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and reigned afore him. Now, because <hi>Vranus</hi> in Greeke

reporteth to haue ordeyned Sacrifices vnto <hi>Vranus.</hi> And
<hi>Ennius</hi> his translator reporteth, that he ordeyned them vnto his

insomuch that euen <hi>Orpheus</hi> himselfe who canonized him for a
God, speaketh of him after the same maner. What reade we of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter?
Iupiter</hi> (sayth the Historie) deposed his owne father, held
his assemblies in <hi>Mount Olympus,</hi> stole away <hi>Europa</hi> in a ship

should be a man of greater might than his father) was to be borne
of her. Finally, after he had made certeyne Lawes, and parted the
offices of his estate among his friends, he dyed and was buryed in
the Towne of <hi>Gnosus.</hi> What a life is this, but the life of a man?
yea and of a most wicked man, vnworthie, not to reigne in heauen,
but euen to goe vpon the earth? Neuerthelesse, because his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
inforced men to worship him as well as his Graundfather,
yea and he himselfe in his life tyme had caused his Subiects, Uas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salles
and Confederates to dedicate Temples vnto him; by reason
whereof wee see he was called by the names of <hi>Labradie, Atabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
Tryphill,</hi> and diuers other: all things were fayne to be applied
and referred vnto him: insomuch that of a man, the Poets made
him a God; of the Mountayne <hi>Olympus,</hi> they made Heauen; of a
Shippe, and Eagle; and of <hi>Thetis,</hi> a Goddesse. Yet for all this, his
buryall place putteth al out of doubt, and so doth the Epitaph that
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> wrate thereon. For, to haue a Temple in one place,

one, and to be eaten with wormes in the other, are things farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.

such shamefulnes; but yet much more, that such as beare the name
of Christians, are not ashamed too make songs thereof in their

               <p>Let vs procéede to the rest. <hi>Neptune</hi> (as their holy Historie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth)
had the Seacoast for his share, or (as othersome affirme)
he was <hi>Iupiters Admiral,</hi> in respect wher of the Poets of our time
call <hi>Admiralls, Neptunes. Pluto</hi> had the gouernement of lowe
Countries, which they disguysing turned into Hell. <hi>Mars</hi> had the
Leading of Souldiers in the warres, and should haue bin hanged
at <hi>Athens</hi> for a murther. What maner of Godds (I pray you) be
these, which stand at mens courtesie for their grace? And what is
the Lawe of that Heauen, which receyueth those for Godds, whom
men would haue hanged on the galowes vpon earth? Also <hi>Apollo</hi>
became a Shepeherd for loue, and of a Shepeherd, hee became
<hi>Laomedons Mason.</hi> He playd a feawe Iuggling tricks to deceiue
folk withall; but in the end (as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> telleth vs) hee was
killed by <hi>Python,</hi> mourned for by the daughters of <hi>Triopus,</hi> and
buryed at <hi>Delphos.</hi> Who euer sawe a thing more ageinst reason,
than the transforming of him into the Sonne, which is as much as
to shet vp the Sonne into the earth? But yet such are the Godds
of the Greeks and Romanes; that is to wit deadfolks, euen kings
and Quéenes whom loue or feare hath made to be taken for Gods.
And in good sooth, they did not any thing to their Godds, which
men do not at this day to their dead &amp; to such as are of reputation.
They make them Temples, Chappells, and altars; they apparell
them after their age; they set them vp Pensils and Penons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their degree or trade of liuing; they make them a funerall
feast; they celebrate Anniuersaries or Yeermynds all of one sort.
Insomuch that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saieth) the <hi>Obitfeast differeth not

nor the Cearer of deadfolks from the Birdgasers; for the

Or that the gentle Ladies <hi>Larentia</hi> and <hi>Flora</hi> were Canonized

Or that <hi>Caligula</hi> tooke vpon him to haue Altars erected and

not the Chyld of Heauen as <hi>Iulian</hi> reporteth, but (as men sayd in

a Roman wryteth, that he was a Chyld found in <hi>Messine,</hi>
and learned the vertues of some herbes at the hand of <hi>Chyron</hi> the

afterward being striken to death (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) with Thunder,
he was buried at <hi>Cyuosures.</hi> To be short, what miracle reade wee
to haue bin done by him, more than that he shewed men the herbs
called Scordion and Asclepiodotes? By which reason we may as
well Deifie the bird <hi>Ibis</hi> for the Clisters, or the Stag for the herb
Ditanie. But to conclude, what a beastlynes were it to leaue the

               <p>Among other Nations of the world, the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> haue vpon

wherevpon it came to passe, that in diuers Nations there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<hi>Saturnes, Iupiters,</hi> and <hi>Herculeses.</hi> Afterward the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

as <hi>Alexander</hi> did <hi>Ephestion,</hi> and as <hi>Arian</hi> did <hi>Antinous,</hi>
and some their Children, and some their wiues. <hi>Cicero</hi> béeing but
a Citizen of <hi>Arpie;</hi> was so prwd that he would néedes Deifie his

make her to be worshipped as another <hi>Iuno</hi> or <hi>Minerua,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that she was not inferiour to them in any thing. But he came
in too rough a time to make Gods. What more? Euen in one man
were a thousand Gods to be found. For they made Gods of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
of constancie, of wisedome, and of all the other vertues; and
likewise of Loue, of Pleasure, of the instruments of pleasure, and
of all other vices; Also of feare, palenesse, gastfulnes, and all passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Lykewise of Agewes, of the Hemerodes, of the Falling sik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and of maladies and diseases; Also of Dounghils, of Snow,
of Blastings, and of the very Winds, insomuch that the greate
Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> did sacrifice to the winde <hi>Circius,</hi> which tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him in Gall. The cause of these absurdities is in two things,
the one is Gods iust striking of men with blindnes for their tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away from him vnto man, insomuch that whereas they will
néedes become equall with God, they fall by degrees from poynt
to poynt, euen to the casting of themselues downe vnto Beastes
and Wormes, that is to say, they become inferiour to beastes. The
other is, that Princes vnlightened by GOD are so desirous of
vainglorie, and their Seruants are such flatterers, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
perceiuing themselues to haue men at their commaundement,
thinke themselues to be more than men, and their seruants, to bée
made Idols themselues, doe willingly make Idols of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Hereof wee reade in the very Lawes of the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
that their answers are called Oracles, their persons God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads;
and their countenances diuine brightnesse. Who reading
this can doubt, but that if such Lawiers had come in the first ages,
they would haue made vs good store of Gods? Nay, would God
we sawe not still among vs, greate nombers of lyuely and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaking

thereof doe reproue vs for it, and after a sort twich vs euery howre
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:13215:212"/>
by the Cote, to pull vs from it. Now therefore, let the premisses be
a president vnto vs, both of the vanitie of the Godds, and of the
blockishnes of men, which haue both worshipped them and made
them.<note place="margin">Cicero concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Godds, in his booke of Lawes, and in his Tusculane Questions.</note> And so let vs commit the knitting vp of this matter to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
himself, who saith thus. <hi>The conuersation and custome of

heauen, both in reputation &amp; in good will, by whom they
had receiued any greate benefite. Of that sort are Hercules,
Castor, Pollux, Esculapius Liber, and such other; so as Heauen
is peopled with mankind. And if I listed to search &amp; ransacke
the Antiquities and Registers of the Greekes, I should find
that the same Gods whom we take for the greatest, haue had
their originall from among vs. And for the verifying thereof,
Inquire whose the Tumbes are that are shewed in Greece, and
consider with thy selfe what their mysteries and Ceremonies
are, and thou hauing accesse thither, shalt vnderstand without

blacke; to some vppon Altars, and to othersome vppon bankes of
earth: to some the foreparts of Beastes, and to othersome the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derparts,
and such other like stuffe. And because they would néedes
play the Apes with God in al things: they required this seruice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the example of the old Testament. For (as sayth <hi>Porphyrius</hi>)
nothing delighteth them more,<note place="margin">Porphyrius in his booke of answers &amp;c. Euseb. lib. 4. Cap. 4.</note> than to be estéemed as Gods: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the greatest of them all (whom they call <hi>Serapis</hi> and we

what resemblance is there betwixt them and the true God? God
requireth of vs the firstlings of our fruites and of our Cattell. And
forasmuch as he hath created them for vs; is it not reason that wee

the acknowledgement of those things to bee done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

Beastes, is to witnesse the death that we deserue by our sinne: but
they beare vs on hand, that by the death of a Beast wee be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

séeing that the seruing of God is so commendable a thing; if these
were Gods, why was it an infamie and reproach to serue them?

doubteth that if those men were aliue againe, they would be both
ashamed and astonished at those things before the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders by? And
who then can doubt that those Gods were of the worst sort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
which not onely take pleasure in ill dooing themselues, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
doe bedaube themselues with the euill which they did not? As
for example, who would thinke that the goodly Gossip whom they
call the Moother of the Gods, but whom the veriest kaytife in the
world would bee loth to haue to be his Moother, could haue heard
the vilanous spéeches wherewith hir feast was solemnised, and not
haue hidden her selfe away for shame? And if Dame <hi>Flora</hi> could
haue read the Floralles of <hi>Auleius,</hi> who doubteth that she would
not haue done the lyke, and much more bene abashed to sée so great

but Schooles of Lecherie, Sodomie, and Incest? And if the
end of Religion be (as <hi>Plotin</hi> sayth) to become like the partie that
is worshipped, what els could bee the marke that those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
amed at, than to make men rype in all sortes of wickednes?
and what readyer way could there bee to become Diuils in deede,
than to resemble them? For whereas they say that after their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
out of al those filthy things openly, they giue some precepts
of vprightnes and modestie to their Schollers in secret: thereby
their naughtinesse appéereth the more plainly to bee altogither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish,
in that they first corrupt the maners of a whole people, both
by their Religious Seruices and by their example, and afterward
preach of modestie and temperance to two or thrée, making as it
were publick Sermons of all naughtines, to lay the Brydle in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans necke, and then (too kéepe credit with a fewe that are of
more conscience then the rest) rowning them secretly in the Eare
with some little talke of vertue. For who hath euer read that any
of them did euer giue one good precept, or one good example to the
people, whither it were for the withdrawing of them from vice, or
for the drawing of them to true vertue? And yet notwithstanding
to what end desire wee to haue God or his blessed Angels conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
with vs frayle and weake men, but that they of singular good
will, should induce, leade, and guyde vs into the way of saluation?</p>
               <p>But their defenders reply, saying: Yet notwithstanding,<note place="margin">The Oracles of the Gods were false, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeine, vayne and wicked.</note> they
prophesied and wrought great and straunge miracles. Let vs omit
that is more naturall to beléeue the partie which preacheth good
things, without diuinations and miracles, than to beléeue the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that kéepeth a Schoole of euils, though he prophesie and worke
miracles. But in the ende what were the Oracles and Miracles
which they so highly commend? The Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> was one
of the greatest in reputation. The beginning therof may be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for the rest. A heard of Goates (sayth <hi>Diodorus</hi>) was
the first meane to bring it in credit. And afterward a yoong wench
was set there, to vtter foorth the Oracles which she receyued, (as
they say) by her priuie partes. And for the slaunders that grewe
thereof, it was ordeyned that the Wench should be a Mayd of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeres old. By these circumstances a man may gather what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a God that could be. To <hi>Cresus</hi> therefore beeing desirous to
knowe what should bee the issewe of his warres against the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the Oracle answered.
<q>

                  </q>
                  <hi>Cresus</hi> gathered hereof that he should ouerthrowe the Empire of
the <hi>Persians,</hi> but in déede he ouerthrew his owne; which thing the
Oracle had prouided for aforehand, by making the answer so dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that it might be taken both wayes yet was there greate reason
that <hi>Apollo</hi> should haue preserued <hi>Cresus:</hi> for of singular deuotion
he had greatly inryched his Temple at <hi>Delphos.</hi> And vnto <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
(as <hi>Ennius</hi> sayth) he answered thus.
<q>
                     <l>I say the sonne of AEacus</l>
                     <l>The Romanes sure shall ouercome.</l>
                  </q>
Presuming hereuppon that he should ouercome the Romanes, hée
himself was ouercome of them. Also he counseled the <hi>Athenians</hi>
to flée before <hi>Xerxes:</hi> and he foretold the <hi>Salaminians</hi> that they
should be ouercome by the <hi>Persians</hi> either in Winter or in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Who perceyueth not by these doutfull spéeches, that <hi>Apollo</hi>
knew nothing certeinly, and therefore that he euer left himself a
backedoore to scapeout, at all assayes? And as for the comming of
these foresayings to passe; who douteth that <hi>Themistocles</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so puissant an armie to approche, déemed not as much thereof
himself, specially seeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> afore he had heard the answer of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
he counseled his Countrymen to wayt for their enemyes vppon the
sea? And what a number of wise Senatours and good Capteynes
were there (think wee) in those frée Cities and kindomes, which
would haue giuen their aduice more to the purpose in that cace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zosimus</hi> reporteth that when the <hi>Palmirenes</hi> asked couns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll,
whither they should obteyne the Empyre of the East or us; an
Oracle answered them in this wyse:
<q>
                     <l>Go get ye hence lyke guylfull folke and Couseners as yee be;</l>
                     <l>The things yee now do take in hand displease the Goddes I see.</l>
                  </q>
And some such other dooth <hi>Zosimus</hi> report, whereof he maketh
greate reckening. But what els are such wandering and generall
answers, but deceytfull douts, and (as ye would say) shooes that
will fitte both féete, as agréeable to folk that are furthest of, as to
the parties that aske the Counsell? Therefore <hi>Oenomaus</hi> a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
and Orator of Greece, hauing oftentymes (as he himself
confesseth) bin beguyled by the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> gathered a

                  </gap>inst it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytled
the falsehood of Oracles. And <hi>Porphyrius</hi> who lykewyse
made a collection of them, euen without adding diminishing or
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:13215:216"/>
chaunging so much as one woord; sayeth that vppon examining of
them, he found them ordinarily false: and he addeth the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be,<note place="margin">Porphyrius in his bookes of the Answere of Oracles.</note> 
                  <hi>That their foretelling, of things is not by foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but by coniectures taken of naturall causes, and of the
mouings and meetings of the Starres, as hath appered in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Oracles. For Apollo being asked by one whither he should
haue a Sonne or a Daughter, answered, a Daughter; bycause
(ꝙ Apollo himself) that at the tyme of the conception, Venus
ouershadowed Arares. And being asked another time whither
that yeere should bee vnhealthfull or no; hee anwered yea,
bycause the constellation thereof was daungerous for the
Loongs: and so of other things.</hi> How many wyse women and
lerned Phisicions would haue answered that matter better, and
yet for so dooing men would not haue offered sacrifice vnto them?
Nay, which more is, <hi>Porphyrius</hi> sayeth that vpon a tyme, <hi>Apollo</hi>
of <hi>Delphos</hi> being vnable to coniecture by the Starres, desired folk
to let him alone, telling them flatly that if they were importunate
vppon him, he would answer them with lyes. And that at another
tyme he answered flatly, that at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> instant the course of the Starres
could shewe him nothing. Now I pray you what maner of Gods
are these, which learne their wisdome of the Starres? Nay, which
worse is, how can they be sayd to bee good Spirits, which threaten
to lye, if they be vrged too farre? And in good sooth such are the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
which the coniured Deuilles doe yéeld yet still at this day by
these Sorcerers and Witches; for the doing whereof, these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of theirs are by all lawes condemned to be burnt, as he was
that deceiued <hi>Manfred</hi> when he was to fight with Charles Duke
of <hi>Aniow</hi> in the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> by this doubtfull construction
of Grammer, <hi>Non, non Gallus superabit Appulum:</hi> which may bee
Englished as doubtfully thus; <hi>No, the French man the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
shall not ouercome.</hi> For <hi>Manfred</hi> considered not that in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
two Negatiues may counteruayle an Affirmatiue. Many such
other like trickes there are, which we may with lesse trouble reade
in Histories. And if they knowe not the certeyntie of the things
that are demaunded of them; why doe wee eyther woorship them or
woonder at them? And if they speake that which they know not, are
they not deceyuers? And if they speake against their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
are they not lyers? And if it belong vnto Gods to deceyue
and to lye; wherefore doe wee blame our neighbours and beate our
children for so doing? Nay (which more is) to lye and to deceyue in
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:13215:216"/>
matters of such importance, where the case concerneth the blud of
so many sillie Soules, and the sacking of so many poore houses;
who can denye it to be the propertie of the Deuill, who euen from
his first beginning hath bene found to bee doth a Murtherer and a
lyer? As for Birdgazers, I haue touched them in a word or twaine
afore. The <hi>AEgiptians</hi> obserued them after one sort, and the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes</hi>
after another; the <hi>Greekes</hi> on the right side, the <hi>Romanes</hi>
on the left: and <hi>Aristotle</hi> skorned them because they determined
not the tyme; and <hi>Plinie</hi> mocked them, because that euen by their
owne doctrine, they touched not them at all which had no regarde
of them. Yea and euen the greatest Birdgazers themselues, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> made a mocke of it. And if at any tyme they
happened to hit right vppon a thing; it was but after the maner of
our Almanackes, the flat contrary whereof who so followeth, shall
commonly come néerest the trueth. Neuerthelesse, if their Gods
foresawe any Plague by naturall Coniectures, as Philosophers,
Phisitions, Hunters, and Shepheards also doe; they feyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be angrie at some State or Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weale. And for what
cause? Forsooth for omitting of common Playes and Enterludes;
that is to say, for shutting vp the Schooles of Lecherie and Ribau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie:
Or for that they had not made their wonted showes of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
and Swordplayers; that is to say, of men that slewe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
openly to please them withall, and to make a whole state giltie
of manslaughter and murder. And if they iudged by the season of
the yere that the Plague should ceasse; Then it was the goodly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
that had appeased them, and that made men the carefuller
to continue them. Insomuch that when the <hi>Romanes</hi> had lost the
bluddie battell at <hi>Cannas;</hi> it was sayd to be, because their Consul
<hi>Varro</hi> had put a fayre yoong boye to the Galley. And when things
went amisse in the Citie, it was eyther because some Dauncer or
Gambolder had displeased them at the Gamings and Showes in
the Kirke, or because some Malefactor had bin conueyed that way
to the Gallowes. What a Godhead is that I beseech you, which
is prouoked to anger by Modestie, and appeased by mischiefe? In
the fauour whereof a man cannot stand, but by dealing wickedly;
but is so straungely offended by the doing of Iustice?</p>
               <p>But let vs see further whether they be any better Diuines than
Prophetes. The Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> sayth thus:
<q>
                     <l>A God in sooth is Cleomede, and not a mortall wight;</l>
                     <l>The last begot of heauenly race; an Altar to him dight.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:13215:217"/>This <hi>Cleomede</hi> was one of those that pleasured these Gods,
by beating one another with strokes of hand and foote; of whom we
reade that he slewe his aduersarie at one blowe. But of such a one
as <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> he would neuer haue sayd so
much.</p>
               <p>Againe he sayth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archilochus is a very Saint and seruant of the Gods:</hi> Yea verely
of such Gods in déede; for he chose the wickeddest and leaudest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of whom to make his verse. But of <hi>Theognis,</hi> or of a <hi>Phocyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
which had exhorted folk to good life, he would neuer haue sayd
so much.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Cypselus</hi> he sayd thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A happie man is Cypselus and loued of the Gods.</hi> If it bee so: then
what are <hi>Busyris, Phalaris,</hi> and al other Tyrants? for there neuer
was a greater Tyrant than he. But the sayd Oracle sayd also, that
<hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> had prolonged the life of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> for his wel
handling of <hi>Cariton</hi> and <hi>Menalippus.</hi> Now, what fitter meane
can there be to make Tyrants, (that is to say, enemies of mankind
in the world) than to beare men on hande that such are beloued of
the Goddes? <hi>Zosimus</hi> their great Patron, rehearseth an Oracle
which answered, That for the appeasing of an Earthquake at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
it behoued them to honor <hi>Achilles</hi> as a God. This was a
playne turning away of man from God to the creature. The same
answered likewise to the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Methymnus,</hi> that it behoued them
to worship a woodden head of <hi>Bacchus</hi> that was found by fishing
in the Sea. And this was a making of them more blynd than the
stocke it self. And when they were demaunded concerning the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of woorshipping and seruing these Gods; they answered:

off the liues of many folkes. Which doubtfulnesse of spéech the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll
coueted, not of any intent to spare them, but to haue matter of
excuse against such as made conscience to doe it. For being asked
by the <hi>Athenians</hi> how they might make amends for their killing

seuen bodies of eyther sex chosen from among them all, to appease

in the tyme of <hi>Socrates.</hi> Now then, what els is all their

by those Oracles goeth about to proue it: and by <hi>Zosimus</hi> himself,
who maketh so great moane to see their mouthes stopped and their
Temples shut vp. And surely it is not to be marueled, though the
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tryall, did vtter great griefes against
those Oracles: and that the <hi>Platonists</hi> (which went to worke more

               <p>Let vs come to their Myracles.<note place="margin">False Miracles.</note> In the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> there
was a Lamp that neuer went out; and the Image of <hi>Serapis</hi> hung
vnfastened in the ayre. Diuers deceyts may be wrought in the like
case; and it is well knowne that the like wonders are seene euen in
naturall things, as a Fountaine to light a Torch, and a Stone to
hang by yron in the ayre. And they which haue the skill to vse such
things, and to gather together the vertues of many into one, may
wonderfully bleare the eyes, euen of the wisest. As for example, it
hath bene seene that some haue found out a deuise how to burne vp
one water with another; and to breake open a strong Locke, almost
without touching it. And that the Féends (which know more than
wee) doe better serue their owne turnes with the wonders of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than we doe, it is not to be doubted: Insomuch that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which knoweth the vertues of Hearbes, maketh things of
them which the Gardyner that sowed them and cherished them vp
would wonder at and cannot doe. But loe here a strange case. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius
Nauius</hi> the greate Birdgazer of <hi>Rome,</hi> did cut asunder a
Whetstone with a Razor in the presence of King <hi>Tarquine.</hi>
What a number of Witches are dayly burned which doe much
more by their familiaritie with the Deuill? For they stop a Tunne
that is pearced full of holes; they hold fast a Waterspout from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and they bynd the naturall abilities: and yet notwithstanding
they confesse that their so doing is by the wicked Spirites, and the
wicked Spirites discouer not themselues otherwise than so vnto
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:13215:218"/>
them. And in very trueth, the Angelles and the Féends differ not
properly in strength and power, but in will and practise: like as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, the good men differ not from the wicked men eyther in
strength of bodie or in stoutnesse of courage, but in the applying of
their bodies and mynds. Also it may bee that the Image of <hi>Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
Fortune</hi> hath spoken, and likewise the Image of <hi>Iuno Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi>
and such others: And that <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> haue wyped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the sweat from the Horses of the <hi>Romanes</hi> as they traueled:
And that the Ladie <hi>Claudia</hi> drewe the Shippe wherein the Idoll
of the Goddesse <hi>Bona</hi> was, which so many yoong men could not
once stirre. Let vs admit all these things to bee true, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> say that hee becommeth olde in reckoning
them vp. Wee stand not to dispute whither Spirites can speake
by Images or no: for wee doubt not thereof. But I say that the
Spirites which speake in them be wicked Spirites, and turne vs
away to the Creature, to make vs offend the Creator. Neither do
I hold opinion that Spirites cannot take bodies vpon them; nor
that they bee vnable to doe feates farre passing the power of men:
for thereof examples are to bee seene, yea moe than were requisite.
But the thing that I vphold is this, that the Spirites which seeke
to haue the praise of a victorie obteyned, or of the asswaging of a
Plague, which is due but to the only one God; or which will haue
them ascribed to Fortune, which is but an imagination; or to a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
which is but a Blocke; or to a good Goddesse the mother of the
Gods, a mother whom the veryest wretches in the worlde (as I
sayd afore) would disclayme to be their mother, are very Deuilles.
And in good sooth, whereas the Deuill which tooke vppon him the
name of that Goddesse, suffered himself to be drawne by <hi>Claudia,</hi>
who had so ill reporte among all men: It agréed very well to the
life which the Goddesse her selfe had led, and to the miracles of the
Féends, &amp; to the marke that they shot at: namely, to giue the more
boldnesse to <hi>Claudia</hi> to continue her leaud life, and occasion vnto
others to followe her.</p>
               <p>Also one was counted a God because he draue away Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
another because he killed Frogges, Crickets, and Flyes.
And hereof it came that the <hi>Chananites</hi> called their <hi>Belzebub,</hi>

(sayth <hi>Zosimus</hi>) sent Birds to deuoure the Grashoppers. Admit
that all these effects haue not their particuler causes: yet what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
are they to make Gods withal? For by that reckoning, why
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:13215:218"/>
should not those also which by certeyne receyts doe kill Serpents,
Rats, and Féeldmyce, or which doe moreouer driue away vermin
out of mens bodies, bee counted Gods? Nay, if wee will see mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
let vs looke vppon the doings of the onely one God, which are
vtterly vnpossible, wonderfull, and vncommunicalle to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He made the world, and he destroyed it. He made the Sea,
and he dryeth it vp. He made the Sunne, and he causeth it to stand
still. Yea and (which is yet much more) he made all these things by
his word, and with a blast of his mouth he chaungeth them as he
listeth. These are the miracles of the God of Israell, which haue
not their like among the other Gods. And if they will deale vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
in disputing, they must as well beléeue our bookes for these
miracles, as we beléeue their bookes for theirs.</p>
               <p>Also if wee looke vpon the miracles of the good Spirites, and of
the seruants of that one God; they be not castes of Legierdemame
to dazle mens eyes withall; nor nimble tricks &amp; sleyghts, nor won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to no end, to no reason, to no instruction: but when they strike,
it is to chastize men; and when they heale, it is to glorifie God. If
they speake, it is to teach; and if they appeare to vs, it is to leade vs
to welfare. If they foretell, they doe it as messengers from God;
and if they worke miracles, they doe it as executers of his power.
And they bee so farre of from being angrie at a Song mistuned, or
at a Gambauld misbegun in the honor of them after the maner of
the Heathen Gods; that (as wee reade in our Scriptures) they bée
offended with nothing more,<note place="margin">Markes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to knowe Diuels.</note> than when men thank them or honor
them for the things which they ought to thank and to worship the
Creator.</p>
               <p>By the tokens which the <hi>Platonists</hi> giue vs thereof, wee shall
percieue yet better whether those Gods were good Spirits or bad,<note place="margin">Porphirius in his seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d book of Abstinence.

Angels or Diuelles; notwithstanding that that Sect was tootoo
much ouertaken in the seruing of them. <hi>The Diuelles or wicked
Spirits</hi> (saith <hi>Porphirius) delight in bludshed, in filthy and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bawdly
speeche, in giuing Poyson, in furnishing folke with
charmes of loue, and in prouoking them to lechery, and to all
vyces. Yea, and they beare men on hand, that all the Gods and
the very Souereyne GOD himselfe, taketh pleasure in such
things; either feyning themselues to bee the Sowles of some
deadfolkes, or taking vppon them to be Gods.</hi> Which of all
these tokens haue I not noted already in their Gods? Agein (saith
<hi>Porphirius) They turkining themselues as much as they can
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:13215:219"/>
into Gods, that is to say, into Angels of light, to beguile our
sence and imagination with straunge vanities: Insomuch that
he that is the cheefe of them, will needes bee estemed to bee
the souerein God. And yet notwithstanding, their foretelling
of things is but by gesse, and all of them generally bee subiect
to lying and deceyuing. They be angry at euery small tryfle; &amp;
are pacified againe with fond and vaine things. Neuerthelesse
they haue beguyled some vayne Poets and Philosophers, and
consequently by them haue drawen the silly people to the
worshipping of them as Gods.</hi> What is all this but a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the very same Gods whom hee himselfe worshipped? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Iamblichus</hi> who maketh an Anatomie of them,<note place="margin">Iamblichus in his booke of Mysteries.</note> saith thus.
<hi>They transforme themselues</hi> (saith he) <hi>into good Spirits; but
in deed it is but a brag, wherby they pretend more than they
be in deede. They make a galant showe, and daunt men with
their words. They play the Gods, and yet are troubled with
light passions.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apulcius.</note> But the greate Witch <hi>Apuleius</hi> sayth yet more.
<hi>They be pacified with gifts</hi> (saith he) <hi>and wroth with wrongs.
They be pleased with Ceremonies, and angred with the want
of them be it neuer so little. They take vpon them the ruling
of Birdgazers and Bowelgazers, and of the Oracles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of Witches and Wizards. To be short, they be vnkindly
wights, passionate of Spirit, reasonable of vnderstanding, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of body, and endlesse of time.</hi> To whom can these things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
but to his owne Gods? And what remayneth then, but that
they were Diuels; so much the more miserable, as they bee more
vehement in their passions, and immortall in their nature.</p>
               <p>Now is there nothing behind but their owne Confession, and
thereof we shall not yet fayle. <hi>Apollo</hi> therefore as one vppon the
Racke, doth in many of his Oracles acknowledge the Souereine
God, and to make the most of himselfe, he termeth himselfe one of
his Angels, as appéereth by this Oracle of his alledged afore.

And yet notwithstanding, the <hi>Greeke</hi> word <hi>Demon</hi> (which is the
word whereby they termed their Gods, and which in this place I
english Feend) was so odious euen among the learned men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
who knewe the originall thereof, that they would haue bene
loth to call a Slaue so. But when as wee reade further that these
Gods do quake at the naming of the Stigian marris, that is to
say of Hell, insomuch that euen <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe sweareth thereby,
and is afrayd to be forsworne: what els is to bee thought thereof,
but that these Gods which feine themselues to reigne in heauen,
are tormented in hell? Besides this, the miracles and Oracles of
these Gods are come to an end, and their Seruices and Sacrifices
are come to nought, and at length folke haue acknowledged the
only one GOD the maker of Heauen and Earth, and ruler of the
whole world, to be the same whome the Iewes haue worshipped.
And in that respect it is that <hi>Seneca</hi> cryed out, That the Slauish
Iewes had giuen lawe to the whole Earth. But who can maruell
that hee which made both the worlde and man, should in the end
make men to acknowledge him to be as he is? So then, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
for these last three Chapters, That there is but onely one
God; That the same was worshipped, serued and called vpon by
the people of <hi>Israell:</hi> That the Gods of the Heathen were men;
That vnder the names of those men, diuels were worshipped; and
finally that our first marke whereby to knowe the true God, is not
to be found elsewhere then in the Iewish Religion; wherevpon it
followeth that all other Religions were Idolatrie and Uanitie.
For whereas some alledge in excuse, that the seruing of many
Gods may well match with the seruing of the onely one; If they
be Gods in deede, that is to say Angelles; they take themselues to
haue wrong, for they seeke nothing but the honoring of God. And
if they be Deuils, then are they Gods enemies; and then the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of them is a rebelling against God. To bee short, as little
agréement is betwéene the seruice of the true God, &amp; the seruice of
the Heathen Gods, as is betwéene light &amp; darknesse; the true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and vtter naughtinesse; most extreme holinesse of will, (which
is in him) &amp; extreme teaudnesse of wil (which is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>); welfare and
soulehealth, whereof we be desirous, and destruction and wretched
nesse, which they haue purchased to themselues by their rebellion.</p>

Gods glorie and of his owne welfare.
And that ought to warne vs the more,
how néedfull this second marke that I haue giuenfoorth, is in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
namely that Gods woord is the Rule of his seruice. For sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

true God; the more he talketh of Religion and diuine seruis, the
more shal he blaspheme the name of the euerlasting, and the further

séene) did woorship the diuell in stead of the true God; &amp; what seruice
insued thereof? Playes, Fables, Combates; which were Schooles
of whoredome, of Incests and of murder; bluddie Sacrifices, and
ordinarie manslaughters. If their godlynesse, were such, what
might their vngoblynes bee? These extreme mischeeues made
some to suspect that there was an abuse. But what did that auayle
them? One sort sayd, séeing that Religion consisteth in such things,

their wrytings haue let slippe some woords ageinst such vngodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and haue taught that there is but only one God, and that hée
was not serued with such Ceremonies. But when they come too
giue a rule of Religion, at what poynt are they? One speaks one
thing and another another, euery man after his owne fancie. They
dispute and crie out one ageinst another too ouerthrowe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But if ye take the whottest of them aside, &amp; let them coole thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heate
a little; they will tel you that they be scarce sure of that which
they assure you; and that they be but the opinions of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are disputable on both sides; only they think they find more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihod
of truth in their owne, than in the opinion of their aduersaries.
To be short, among all the things which the wisemen of the world
haue written here and there of the seruice of GOD, ye may hap to
finde some one good saying in a hundred yeres, and fome one other
in another hundred: but when ye haue gathered them all together
as diligently as ye can, yet shall ye not bee able to make of them
neither Rules, nor Grounds, nor scarcely good Problemes. So
greatly is man by his corruption, both blinded in things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God, and rechelesse in things that concerne his own welfare.
Yet is it sooth (and so haue we proued,) that God hath set man in
this world to serue GOD his Creator; and that Seruice we call
Religion. Wherevpon it followeth, that euen since the first tyme
that there was any man in the world, there hath also bin Religion.
For the duetie which man oweth vnto GOD, is of the same date
that man himselfe is; and the duetie which he oweth vnto God, is
true godlinesse and Religion. Againe, Religion could not bee the
inuention of Man: for the inuention of men tending to their owne
pleasure or profite, procéed from ground to ground, from principle
to principle, and from experience to experience, and at the first are
rude, and afterward are polished, not by the same man that found
them out, but most commonly a hundred yéere or twaine after:
whereas Religion (that is to say, mans duetie towards God) was
not so much instituted as bred with man, for his owne welfare and
for the glorie of God. The thing (say I) without the which, God
should not haue made man, and man might haue bene sorie that he
had bene made; ought (euen at the first beginning) to be perfect and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:13215:221"/>
fully accomplished to his end: which thing Religion could not be,
if it were deuised by mans brayne, considering that after his fall he
was striken with ignorance in his wit, and with frowardnesse and
leaudnesse in his will. Néedes therefore must it be, that the rule of
Gods seruice was giuen to man by God himselfe, who alonly is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to vtter his owne will,<note place="margin">What and where the true Religion is.</note> to make rules of his seruice, and to tell
vs what things doe please him. Now, true Religion is the true
seruice of the true God: and the true God (as I haue proued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie)
was not knowne in old tyme elsewhere than in <hi>Israell.</hi> As
for the Gods of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were Deuils, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Oracles were the worde of Deuils. Wherevpon it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that there is no seeking for the true seruice of GOD and for
the true word of God, but onely among the people of <hi>Israell;</hi> yea
and that it must of necessitie also be found there. For seeing that of
necessitie there must néedes bee a Religion; and that in Religion
there must néedes bee a rule procéeding from GOD, according to
which rule God will be serued; and that God was serued in <hi>Israell</hi>
and no where els: The Rule which we seeke must néedes be found
in <hi>Israell</hi> too. For as it is vnpossible that it should be elsewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the true God was not anywhere els: so is it not possible that
it should not bee there, forasmuch as there was one there, and that
the true God also was there. Now therefore, the people of <hi>Israell</hi>
had alwaies certeine bookes which we call the Byble or old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which bookes they reuerenced and followed as the very word
of GOD, whereby he hath shewed vnto men after what maner he
will bee serued and worshipped. And those bookes haue bene kept
continually from tyme to tyme, euen since y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creation of the world:
and they haue bene of such authoritie among the true <hi>Israelites,</hi>
that they beléeued not any other bookes, and for the maintenauce
of them haue indured warres, oppressions, banishments, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings,
deaths, and slaughters; which are such things as are not to
bee found among other Nations, notwithstanding that the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
of other Nations, in giuing them their lawes, made them
beléeue that they procéeded from the Gods, because it was a thing
as good as graunted among al men, that the setting doune of rules
for Religion and for mans Soulehealth, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged only vnto God.
And therefore wee might well gather this conclusion, whereof the
premises are proued heretofore; That there is but one true God,
one true Religion, one true Rule of seruing God, reuealed by and
from the true God. And that this true God was not knowne and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:13215:221"/>
worshipped elswhere than among the people of <hi>Israell.</hi> Unto <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>
then was the sayd word reuealed, and that word must néedes be
the Byble or olde Testament, whereby the <hi>Israelites</hi> were taught
the seruice of God. But forasmuch as wee haue to doe with folke
that will sooner be driuen to silence by arguments, than perswaded
by reason to beléeue, as though it stoode God on hand to perswade
them for his honor, and not them to beléeue for their own welfare:
I will by the Readers leaue, set forth this matter at large.</p>
               <p>First of all,<note place="margin">Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to discerne Gods word.</note> forasmuch as there is a Seruice of God to bée had;
and that seruice should rather bée a misseruice than a Seruice, if it
were not according to his will; and his will cannot be conceiued of
vs by coniectures, but must be manifested vnto vs by his word; I
aske them vpon their conscience, if they were to discerne that word
from all others, by what markes they would knowe it, that they
might not be deceiued! This word (say I) is the rule of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and the way of welfare. Unto this seruice is man bound from
his very creation, and it is the marke whereat hee ought to shoote
from his very birth. Will it not then bee one good marke of this
word, if it be auncienter than all other Lawes and Rules, than all
other words, than all inuentions of man? And will it not be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good marke, if it tend to none other end, than the glorifying of
God and the sauing of mankind? If (say I) it withdrawe man
from all other things to leade him to God, and to turne him out of
all bypathes? how great pleasure so euer there be in them, to leade
him to saluation? Nay I say yet more, If we find things in the
Scripture which no Creature could euer haue foretold or spoken;
things which could neuer haue come into any mans mind; things
not onely aboue but also against our nature; Will any man bee so
wilfull and so very an enemy to his owne welfare, as not to yéeld
and agrée, when he seeth both the hand, the signe, and the Seale of
God? In déede I vndertake a matter beyond my abilitie; but yet
the higher it is, the more will GOD ayde mee with his grace.
And first of all,<note place="margin">That the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is of more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie then all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> forasmuch as the worlde was made for man, and
man for God; and man could neuer be without true Religion, nor
true Religion without the word of God: I demaund of the great
Nations and florishing kingdomes that haue giuen Lawes to all
the world, and among whom the liberall sciences, artes, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
haue bene most renowmed; whither any one of them is to be
found that hath had a Lawe set downe in writing, concerning the
true Seruice of the true God? Yea or one worde either right or
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:13215:222"/>
wrong that hath bin beléeued to procéede from him, I meane from
the only one euerlasting GOD the maker of Heauen and Earth?
Also I demaund of them whither among the <hi>Assyrians, Persians,
Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> a man shall find an Historie of Religion
deduced from the first beginning of the world, and continued so on
from tyme to tyme, and from age to age? And on the contrarie
part, whether there be any Heathen man which is not driuen to
confesse, that the very latest writer of our Byble, is of more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
than the auncientest authors that are renoumed among the
Gentiles? And whether that little which the Gentiles haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
concerning God be not borowed from other men; and finally
whether in matters of religion, they haue not walked by groping,
without light and without any direction? This matter is handled
at large by diuers auncient writers. Neuerthelesse, for the ease of
them which cannot reade them all, I will gather them here toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in feawe words.</p>
               <p>The Byble beginning at the creation of the world &amp; of man, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs from tyme to tyme, and from Father to Sonne, euen vnto
Christ. It deliuereth vs a diuision of men into Gentiles and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
into Idolaters and true worshippers of the Souereine
God; and their comming togither ageine into one after a certeine
time, and by a meane appoynted euerlastingly to that end by God.
And the writers thereof are <hi>Moyses, Iosua,</hi> the Chronicles of the
<hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> the <hi>Prophetes</hi> euery of them in his time, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,
Nehemias,</hi> and <hi>Esdras;</hi> of whome euen these latest were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thrée thousand and sixehundred yéeres after the creation, and
yet were they afore any Chronicles of the worlde were in the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of the world. I desire all the Antiquaries of this time, which
make so greate account of the antiquitie of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
or of an old Coyne, or of a whetherbeaten Piller, or of a
halfeaten Epitaphe, what find they like vnto that? <hi>Esdras</hi> is the
latest in the Canon of the Hebrewe writers, and yet liued he afore
the tyme that <hi>Socrates</hi> taught in <hi>Athens.</hi> And what rule of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was there among the <hi>Greekes</hi> of his tyme, who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him for speaking of the onely one GOD? At the same tyme
were <hi>Pythagoras, Thales, Xenophanes,</hi> and the seuen Sages
which haue borne so great fame in <hi>Greece,</hi> who in their whole life
tyme haue sayd some good words concerning maners, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
among men, but as for God, they haue spoken nothing of
him but dreamingly, nor deemed of him, but ouerthwartly, nor
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:13215:222"/>
knowen aught of him but that little which they learned of the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians.</hi>
Thither went <hi>Orpheus, Homere, Lycurgus, Solon,
Pythagoras, Plato, Heraclitus, Democrates, Thales, Oenopis,</hi>
and the residue of them to schole, as they them selues doe highly
boast in their Bookes. And what learned they there but Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as I haue shewed afore? And what els then could they bring
into <hi>Greece?</hi> And what might their ignorance be, séeing they were
counted wise so good cheape? Of the same date are the lawes of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
in <hi>Athens,</hi> and (anon after) of the twelue Tables at <hi>Rome,</hi>
which the <hi>Romaines</hi> sent to seeke in <hi>Greece</hi> by the aduyce of one
<hi>Hermotimus</hi> an <hi>Ephesian.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cicero in his second booke of the Ends of things.</note> As touching GOD and his seruice,
which should be the ground of all good lawes, scarce was there one

which was very little. But shall we seeke the lawe of godlines
at the hand of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romaines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aulus Gellius in his 20. book Cap. 1.</note> who a thrée thousand

must hold vs to this poynt, that since the very first bréeding of man
in the world, there hath alwaies bene Religion in the world. For
he was not bred in vayne: neither could there be any Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reuealing from God. For (as the Philosophers say of nature)
God fayleth not in things néedfull. And therefore where men haue
bene so lateward, and GOD so smally knowne; there we shall not
finde them. For as for the Oracles, that is to say the sayings of the
Deuils that abused them; if they were of elder tyme than the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they spake not to them: and if they were bred after them, then
were they newe. And in very trueth, euen by their owne Histories,
the first original of the false Gods of <hi>Greece</hi> and of their miracles,
tooke beginning about the warres of <hi>Troy,</hi> which befell about the
tyme of the Iudges, towards the two thousand and eight hundred
yéere after the Creation of the world. The great Kings of <hi>Assyria</hi>
be of more antiquitie than the <hi>Greekes;</hi> for they fell into the tymes
of the Kings and Prophets of <hi>Israell,</hi> whereas there was not any
notable thing in the Storie of the <hi>Greekes</hi> afore the Captiuitie
of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But how will they shewe vs any law concerning the
seruice of God, yea or how could they haue any, séeing they forsooke
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:13215:223"/>
the true God and worshipped false Gods? Nay, as touching those
false Gods, what memoriall almost haue wee of them, but in the
Byble, and that is of the victories which the true God had against
them, and of his Conquestes ouer them, which are spoken of from
leafe to leafe, to their ouerthrowe and vtter confusion? Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
what be the Kings of <hi>Israell,</hi> but mainteyners; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
but expounders of the lawe of <hi>Moyses?</hi> These as publishers
thereof from tyme to tyme, to the intent that folke should not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it, which thing wee see not in any other Nation; and the other
as compellers of men to obserue it, as wherunto euen Kings them
selues are bound. But if we goe backe from the tyme of the setting
foorth of the lawe of <hi>Moyses;</hi> what haue the Heathen of that tyme
to set against it? I say not only in respect of Godlinesse, but also for
Iustice, and welnere for the common societie of men? The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
will alledge <hi>Cecrops</hi> the founder of their Citie; &amp; the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi>
their King <hi>Ogyges.</hi> And of them they terme all things of
antiquitie, <hi>Cecropian</hi> and <hi>Ogygian:</hi> And peraduenture they will
tell vs, that at that tyme folk bred out of the earth in the Countrie
about <hi>Athens;</hi> as though they spake of Mussheromes and Gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers.
And when they say so, what shall wee looke for at their
hands concerning the seruice of God and heauenly things, sith they
thinke them to haue bene bred of the earth? But yet they will not
denye that this <hi>Cecrops</hi> was an <hi>AEgiptian,</hi> who brought them
certeyne lawes for the ordering of Mariage; which is a sure proofe
that they were vtterly ignorant of the law of God and Man. Long
tyme after him came their Gods and Oracles; insomuch that al the
<hi>Greekish</hi> Historie is (as ye would say) tungtyde for many hundred
yéeres after, like a brooke that loseth himself within thirtie paces of
his first spring. Among the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> &amp; <hi>Syrians</hi> there was more
forme of gouernement; but as for Religion, they worshipped the
Heauens, the Planets, and the Starres, which are (in very déede)
made for man, and for mans vse are put vnder certeyne lawes by
God, and therefore much lesse are those Gods able to make men
subiect vnto them. And if there were any among them that knewe
more than others, it was the Birdgazers and the Bowelgazers,
which are a kynd of Witches that turned men away from God to
the Creatures, and therefore in no wise directed them to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But what shall wee finde among the people of <hi>Israell</hi> at that
tyme? A <hi>Moyses</hi> that preacheth but the onely one God, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
from him how he will be serued; and a Lawe that setteth the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:13215:223"/>
bounds both of Religion and Policie; and the duetie of man both
towards God and his neighbour; which euery seuenth day is read
openly to all the people; which the Kings haue before their eyes,
the Priestes beare about them, the Fathers teach to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and the Maysters to their Seruants, and which the very
walles and forefronts of their houses doe shewe both to strangers
and to their household folke. At the happiest tyme that ye can choose
in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> (for I am willing to omit their barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
what haue wee, (I say not of Religion, but of Order in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and state of Gouernment) that commeth any thing néere to
that? Contrarywise, what lawe was there euer set foorth among
them, which was not abolished againe ere it was knowne to the
people? Or who made account of it but the Lawyers? Or who
brake not the lawe afore he knewe it? To be short, where haue wee
read that any whole Nation were all Lawyers, and all skilfull in
the Lawes of God and men, but the people of <hi>Israell?</hi> And why
was that, but because the same Law conteined the rule of welfare,
the which it was méet that all folk without exception should know
and vnderstand, because that naturally all men ought to tend vnto
their saluation? And as touching the antiquitie of <hi>Moyses</hi> the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
foorth of that Lawe among that people; I will not haue ye to
beléeue me, but the <hi>Gentyles</hi> themselues. The very ground of the

antiquitie than all Histories. <hi>Numenius</hi> sayth that <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
had nothing but from the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> and

namely from <hi>Moyses;</hi> insomuch that he recyteth his historie almost

a great Diuine, Lawmaker, and Prophet. Also <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie</hi>
sayth, that he vnderstoode by the <hi>AEgiptians,</hi> (who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
were enemies to <hi>Moyses</hi> and to all his race) that he was
the first Lawgiuer of all, and moreouer a man of great courage,
and of very commendable life; and that the <hi>Iewes</hi> estéemed him as
a GOD, as well for the knowledge that he had of GOD, as for
his authoritie and preheminence. And he (sayth <hi>Diodorus</hi>) gaue
a Lawe vnto the people of <hi>Israell,</hi> which hee sayd hee had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

and out of the Chronicles of the cities, &amp; out of the holy bookes
which were woont to be dedicated to temples. And this <hi>Sachonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi>
(saith he) was somewhat after the time of <hi>Moyses,</hi> about the
tyme of <hi>Semiramis.</hi> Now, <hi>Porphirius</hi> giueth vs here more than
we aske. For we set <hi>Abraham</hi> in the tyme of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

<hi>Moyses</hi> dooe leade vs vp from Sonne to Father vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi>
from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Noe;</hi> from <hi>Noe,</hi> to the first Man, and from the
first man to God the Creator, beyond whome it is not possible to
passe any further, as I haue proued alreadie: and in treating of the
Creation we must alwaies néedes come backe agein. And through
out all this discourse <hi>Moyses</hi> telleth vs of the things that GOD
hath discouered vnto men, and the lawes which he hath giuen after
maner of a couenant, to the intent they should be his people, and he
should be their God: The which Couenant it had surely bene both
a shame &amp; folly for him to haue deuised for that hardhearted &amp; stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
people, whom hee burdeneth not with any other thing, but
that which was notoriously knowen vnto them, and thereby they
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:13215:224"/>
were certified of their originall natiuitie. Neither is it to be suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that he wrote these things (as some list to say) to get authoritie
to himselfe and his; for hee brondeth his Graundfather <hi>Leuy</hi> with
an open marke of reproch expressed in these words of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;

will diuide them in Iacob, and scatter them in Israell. &amp;c.</hi> As
who should say, hee ment to disgrade <hi>Leuy</hi> and all his race; to the
saying wherof nothing compelled him. Also he reprooueth <hi>Aarons</hi>
idolatrie and <hi>Maries</hi> murmuriug, notwithstanding that hee was
his Brother and she his Suster: and he repeateth oftentymes, that
for his owne fault, God had told him that he should see the land of

And although wee procéede not so farre as to conclude absolutely,
that he wrote at that time as from God, and not as from man: yet

<hi>Moyses</hi> published the Lawe before all the people, and he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

Trybe, they be read openly euery Saboth day, they be kept
carefully in the Arke, and the Arke is kept as carefully by all the

former histories, as is found to be doone in other Histories; (as for
example, <hi>Hellanicus</hi> reproueth <hi>Ephorus, Ephorus</hi> finds fault
with <hi>Timeus,</hi> and consequently <hi>Timeus</hi> reprehendeth them that
wrote afore him:) But <hi>Iosua</hi> gathereth a certeine and vnfallible
consequence of <hi>Moyses,</hi> the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>Iosua, Samuell</hi> of the <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Dauid</hi> of them all, and so all the rest. And to speake of the
Prophets, they bee not lyke the bookes of our Astrologers, which
reforme one anothers Calculations, and controll one anothers
Prognostications: But as they shoote all at one marke: so they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
in one thing, notwithstanding that they wrote in sundrie
times and sundry places. Nay (which more is) wée see that the
people were so sure of that Lawe, that from age to age they chose
rather to abyde all extremities, than to giue it ouer; insomuch
that they defended it ageinst the <hi>Chananites,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the
<hi>Assyrians,</hi> the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and the
<hi>Romanes.</hi> Who then durst be so prowd and bold as to voilate or
imbace the thing that was hild to be so holy, defended with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lyues, and confirmed with so many deathes? If yee say, the
Heathen; Their intents was not to marre it, but to make it quyte
away. For what profite could haue redounded vnto them of that
payne? to what ende should they haue done it? or how could they
haue corrupted it in the sight &amp; in the knowledge of so many folke?
Moreouer, who knoweth not that the Scriptures were caryed by
the banished Iewes, into diuers countryes of the world afore they
came into the hands of the Gentiles, as of the <hi>Greekes</hi> or <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?</hi>
As for the Iewes; their shooteanker and felicitie consisted in
the kéeping of them, &amp; the reward of corrupting them was death:
and what could it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue benefited them to haue corrupted them?
Nay, yet further, which of them would haue dyed afterward for a
Lawe, which they knewe to bee corrupted or counterfetted? And
soothly we see throughout their Histories, that there passed not so
much as any one halfe hundred yeeres without persecutions and
warres for that Lawe.</p>
               <p>And whereas it myght be sayd, that some suttleheaded fellow
among the <hi>Iewes</hi> had done it to abuse the rest: how could that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:13215:226"/>
séeing it was not in the hands of fower or fiue Prestes only,
as the Ceremonies of the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> were; but in the
hands of the whole people, so as one sillable could not be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but it was to be espyed euen by yoong Children. Considering
also that we reade not of any king how wise so euer he were, that
euer durst presume to ad, diminish or alter any whit thereof; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
notwithstanding, all other Lawes of the world were made by
péecemeale, and Kings and Senats haue alwaies reserued to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
a prerogatiue to correct them and alter them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
specially when they limited their authoritie, and serued not
for the mayntenance of their possession. And if any man to beréeue
vs of this argument, will stepfoorth and say, that our Scriptures
are as an Historie gathered out of the Registers of many ages, by
some one author; as we sée <hi>Berosus</hi> hath done for the <hi>Chaldees,
Duis</hi> for the <hi>Phenicians, Manetho</hi> for the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
let him tell vs then (I hartily pray him,) in what age of the
world that Author is lykely to liued. If in the tyme of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
of <hi>Iosua,</hi> or of the Iudges; how commeth it to passe that he
wryteth of the reignes of the kings? If in the tyme of the first
Kings; how wryteth he of the last Kings? If in the tyme of the
last Kings; how is it possible that the <hi>Iewes</hi> being afore that time
caryed away into diuers places of the world, and scattered abroade
euerywhere lyke the members of <hi>Pentheus,</hi> should carie &amp; keepe
with them the books of <hi>Moyses,</hi> which (by these mens reckoning)
were not yet made, according to which booke both themselues did
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding then liue, and also taught other Nations? I meane
the ten Trybes by name, which by three former remouings were
scattered ouer the whole Earth, whereof the marks are to appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
to be denyed. The first in the the tyme of <hi>Achaz</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
and of <hi>Placea</hi> King of <hi>Israell,</hi> by <hi>Thiglath Phalassar</hi> King of the
<hi>Assirians,</hi> who caryed away <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and the halfe trybe of
<hi>Manasses:</hi> the second in the tyme of <hi>Ose</hi> by <hi>Salmanasar,</hi> who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
away <hi>Isachar, Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthaly</hi> into <hi>Assiria:</hi> and the
third anon after by the same <hi>Salmanasar,</hi> who conueyed away
<hi>Ephraim</hi> and the other half of <hi>Manasses;</hi> as is witnessed both by
the auncient Records of many Countryes, and also by the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And at that tyme whyle Printing was
notyet in vse, what meane was there to disperse those books so soone
and so farre of? Nay, which more is, what will they say when they
shall find the bookes of <hi>Moyses</hi> to haue bin kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> father to sonne,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:13215:226"/>
euen, in the vtmost Coasts of <hi>Ethyopia,</hi> whither the Empires ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
came, which bookes they say they haue had there euer since the
tyme of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that they were brought thither by the Queene
of the Prouince of <hi>Saba?</hi> Thus haue I spoken inough of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
both for them that are contented to be satisfied with reason,
(for if they do but reade our scriptures, they haue whereon to rest,)
and also for those which are otherwise: for it is hard to shewe him
aught, which by his will will see naught. But there are yet further
which tell vs that in the tyme of the <hi>Machabees, Antiochus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
the lawe of <hi>Israell,</hi> and al the bookes of the Byble: and they
think themselues to haue made a greate speake, and hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.
I leaue it to the consideration of all men of iudgment, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be easie for a Prince though he vse neuer so great diligece, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to abolish any maner of booke whatsoeuer, seeing the nature
of man is such, that the more that things are sought to be plucked
from him, the more he streyneth himself to keepe them. But when
a booke is once beleeued and reuerenced of a whole nation, not for
delight of things done by men, therein conteyned, but for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of man therein reuealed; for the trueth whereof men are not
afrayd to indure both death and torments, as was witnessed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the time of the same <hi>Antiochus:</hi> what diligence of man can
suffise to abolish it? But let vs put the cace that it was abolished in
Iewrie: yea and that it was abolished throughout his whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
what can yet insue thereof, séeing that the ten trybes (ouer
whom <hi>Antiochus</hi> could haue no authoritie) had caryed them and
disperced them abroade to the vttermost bounds of the world? And
séeing that the remouing of the other two trybes, had made them
rife among the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians?</hi> And that the <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes</hi>
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ladelph</hi> had caused all the Byble to be translated into the
Gréeke toong by the thrée score and ten interpreters, and had layd it
vp in his librarie as a Iewell? And to be short, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were
at that verie tyme so dispersed among the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselues, as
there was scarcely any Citie which had not receyued them with
their Sinagogs?</p>
               <p>But although none of all these reasons were to be had; then, if
the Byble was lost and abolished, how was it found ageine so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly
in one instant? Who could (as ye would say) cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it vp whole
out of his stomacke at once? Or who hath euer red that the <hi>Iewes</hi>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:13215:227"/>
made any mone for the losse of it, or tooke any peyne for the séeking
of it out ageine? And to cut off superfluitie of spéeche, whereof
then commeth it, that of so manie <hi>Gramarians</hi> beeing of opinion
that they should become wyse men in one day, if they had <hi>Ciceroes</hi>
bookes of Comonweale to reade; none of them all being more sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleheaded
than the rest, hath vndertaken to counterfet them in his
name? No no: let vs rather say the Scriptures are of more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
than all other wryting; and the more they be so, the more
aduersitie haue they indured: the rage of Tyrans hath ouerflowed
them; and yet they could nother drowne them nor deface them: they
haue bin condemned to the fire, and yet could not bee consumed.
Contrarywise, the bookes of the greatest men, how greate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
so euer they had, haue bin lost, and for all the peyne that hath bin
taken to preserue them, yet haue they often come to naught. The
Chronicles of Emperours (say I) bee perished, when the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of the smal Kings of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> and of that poore outcast people,
and I wote not what a sort of vanished Shepeherds despised of the
world and despysers of the world, haue continewed to posteritie in
despyght of the World. Therefore it must néeds be say, that the
Scriptures haue bin preserued by Gods singular prouidence, both
so long time and ageinst so many iniuries of time. And séeing they
be the only wrytings which only he hath preserued from the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world vnto our dayes; surely they were for our behoof.
And séeing they haue bin reiected of the world, and yetnotwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
doo liue and reigne in despyght of the world; surely they be
from somewhere els than of man or of the world; that is to wéet
Reuelations from God to man, continewed from tyme to time for
his glorie and our welfare. And so by this discourse we gayne this
poynt, that our Scriptures which are left vs by <hi>Moyses, Iosua,</hi>
and the Prophets, are the auncientest of all wrytings, and vtterly
voyd of all lykelyhod of mingling or counterfetting: and that sith
that euen from the beginning there hath bin a Religion reuealed
from God, and we find none other than this to haue continewed
fromthe verie Creation vnto vs; we may inferre, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
wherein we reade it, are of God, bycause that from lyne to
lyne they conteyne his Reuelations made vnto mankynd. But let
vs passe from this antiquitie which is but the barke of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and let vs come to the substance of them, which will giue vs
assurance of the place from whens they come.</p>
               <p>Now then, let vs reade the bookes of men as well of olde tyme
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:13215:227"/>
as of our owne tyme, and what is the scope,<note place="margin">The Bible ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth altogither to the glorie of God.</note> the ground, the forme,
and discourse of them, furtherfoorth than they eyther expounde or
followe our Scriptures? Some write to celebrate the Kings and
great Capteynes of their tyme: these be but vauntings of men, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of people, consultations to destroye one another, and suttle
deuyces to disappoynt or vndoe one another. Good men by reading
them become malicious, and euill men become worse. And by the
way there must bee some pretie spéech of Fortune, which swayeth
the Battels. As for God who maketh Kings and vnmaketh them
againe, who holdeth both the enterances and issewes of all things
in his hand, there is not so much as one word in al a great volume.
Who doubteth that these be bookes of men, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyne nothing
but the passions, the subtelties, and the indeuers of men? Another
sort write (as they themselues say) to make themselues immortall.
They write goodly discourses, to make themselues to be had in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.
If they chaunce to stumble vppon some good saying for
maners or for the life of man; they turkin it a thousand waies to
make it seeme good for their purpose. They deliuer their words by
weight, they driue their clauses to fall alike, they eschew nycely the
méeting together of vowelles: and what greater childishnesse can
there bee in graue matters, than that? Yet notwithstanding, they
make bookes of the despising of vaynglorie, and their bookes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
are full of ambition: of the brydling of affections; and their
arguments are ranke poyson and contention. If they happen to
speake of the seruing of God; it is by Sacrifieing to Deuilles, and
to their owne Louers, and friends, as we reade that <hi>Socrates, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
and <hi>Aristotle</hi> did. Who is he then which euen by the first lyne
or by the opening of the booke, maye not perceiue that they which
speake bee men, yea and but very men in déede; considering that in
all their bookes they speake but of man? Men (say I) that seeke the
glorie of men and not of GOD; Preachers of vanitie, and not of
mans welfare?</p>
               <p>On the contrarie side, wee heare how the Scripture sayth, <hi>In
the beginning God made Heauen and Earth.</hi> What is ment
by this enterance, but that the Reader should not in the rest of the
discourse looke for the follies of men, but for the wonderous works
of the Creator? And what other author did euer begin his worke
so? <hi>Herodotus</hi> beginneth his Historie after this maner: <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
of Halycarnassus hath spoken these things.</hi> Though he had
neuer sayd so, it would neuer haue bene surmised that he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:13215:228"/>
any thing but of man. For what is his whole booke but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
Or what hath he which is not inferiour to man? After the same
maner doth <hi>Hippocrates</hi> begin his bookes concerning the nature
of man; and likewise <hi>Timaeus</hi> of <hi>Locres</hi> his treatise of Nature and
of the Creation of the world: which Authors I alledge as auncien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of all others. But if we go through the whole Scripture from
the one end to the other, we shal finde nothing there but that which
is promised at the first word; that is to wit liuely letters, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be falsified, of a booke that procéedeth from God, namely
his own glorie and the welfare of man. As for the glorie of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting,
it leadeth vs to the creation of the world, and of man; to
the sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the corruption of Mankynde; the Flud of
<hi>Noe</hi> that followed therevpon, and the confusion of Tongues; the
calling of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seede, the plagues of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and the
wonders of <hi>AEgipt.</hi> What is there in all these things, that sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of man, or of the vanitie that possesseth him? What hath he
there which maketh him not eyther to stoope vnto God or to sinke
vnto Hell? Againe, on the other side, what els doth that whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
shewe vs, but the highnesse of the Euerlasting, his merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
towards the lowly, and his iustice and iudgements towards
the proude, when wee see all loftinesse of the world cast downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and all the puissance of Empyres giuen ouer to Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers
and to the wormes of the earth? Afterwarde <hi>Moyses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the rehearsing of the lawe that God gaue to that people.
Whence came that extraordinarie wisedome, and why rather in
<hi>Israell</hi> than elsewhere, in the tyme when all other Nations were
so rude? And what maner of lawe was it? Soothly a lawe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in ten Sentences, and yet those ten Sentences conteyne
whatsoeuer can belong to Godlinesse, Uprightnesse and Iustice,
whither it bee of seruice towards GOD, or of duetie towards our
neighbour: Insomuch that all the great volumes of lawes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the world is full, without ground, without end, notwithstanding
that they treate but onely of Iustice, are referred all to that marke,
and haue not any thing more than is there. Again, all these ten say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are vnfolded in two words: namely, <hi>to loue God with the
whole heart, and a mans neighbour as himselfe.</hi> Let the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
shew me the Lawes of their <hi>Draco,</hi> and the <hi>Romaines</hi> the
Lawes of their twelue Tables; if there be one word of true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Iustice in them? Let the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romaines</hi> shewe
all that euer they wrate by the space of a thousand yéeres; and see if
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:13215:228"/>
ye shal finde so much thereof, as is conteyned in those two sayings
only. And as for our Philosophers, which make so great bragges
of the ten Predicaments of their <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which are but the seede
of Sophistrie and vayne babling; I aske them (at leastwise if they
haue any eyes) what account they ought to make of this Lawe,
which hath conueyed in so fewe wordes, both the matters of the
world which are infinite, and the matters of GOD, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
to man, together. The <hi>Israelites</hi> come to take their
iourney into <hi>Chanaan</hi> vnder <hi>Moyses;</hi> they bee brought in thether
by <hi>Iosua;</hi> and they be ruled and gouerned there by the Iudges and
Kings: And in this discourse there fall out many humane things,
many enterprises, surprises, Sieges, Battels, Uictories, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes.
Héere it behoueth vs to enter into our selues, and by our
selues into the naturall disposition of all men. When wee goe to
giue the onset, I meane the better sort of vs; what say wee? Lord,
we set our Battels in aray, but thou giuest the victorie? After that
maner speake the Christians at this day. Nay: but if God prosper
vs, what will we say at our returne? Mary, I wonne such a Hill,
I brake the Uauntgard, the Enemie was discomfited by my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell:
and herevppon rise quarrelles who shall haue the honor of the
victorie. But as for God, we shall heare no more speaking of him,
than if there were no GOD at all. The History writers which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
their Uictories, are curious in naming euen the meanest
Capteynes, for offending any man; and moreouer in describing of
the aduauntages of the places, of the Sunne, of the Winde, of the
Dust, of him that led the Soldiours to handblowes, &amp; of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations
of the Capteynes: so as he balanceth the Battels after
his owne scoales; and as for mens sinnes which are the procurers
thereof, he neuer once thinkes of them. Séeing then that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of our Byble are the auncientest of all others, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

                  </gap>ce haue they learned it,
that in all their Histories they giue the glorie of the Battels and
of all feates of Armes alonly vnto God, both afore and after? Or
whence come these ordinary words, <hi>God giueth them into our
hands, God is our victorie, God is as strong in a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as in a great?</hi> Whence also come the goodly Songs, which
we shall not finde in any of the Heathen Writers; but of this, that
they wrate the warres of GOD and the victories of the Lord, yea
and euen in his behalfe which was the doer of them? If they wrate
on mans behalfe, why wrate they not in mans vsuall order of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyting?
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:13215:229"/>
dyting? Why wrate not <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Iosua,</hi> (say I) as <hi>Polybius</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> wrate? Or who letted them to take to themselues the
glorie of their high enterprises? Or if they wrate for Kings and by
commaundement of Kings; why finde wee no commendations of
<hi>Iosua, Dauid, Iosaphat,</hi> and <hi>Ezechias;</hi> as well as of <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Miltiades, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Traiane?</hi> For what other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
finde wee of them, than that they walked in the way of
the Lord, that they destroyed the high places, that they ouerthrew
the Idols, and such like, howbeit that we reade of heroicall &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
déedes done in their tymes? And what ought we then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
but that, as all other bookes which tend to the glorie of men,
and concerne but themselues or some others, are the workes of
men: so these bookes, which tend alonly to the glorie of God, yea
euen by the contempt of men, are the works of God, that is to say,
inspired by GOD? As much is to be sayd of the Prophets, who
when they speake of any succour that was to come to the people of
<hi>Israell,</hi> or of any enemie that was to come sodeynly vppon them:
they sayd not, your friends shall succour you, or your enemies shall
runne in vpon you; but, the Lord will send <hi>Cyrus</hi> to deliuer you,
the Lord will arme the <hi>Babylonians</hi> to scourge you. Uayne are
all your dealings if your trust be not in him: Uayne are the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of your enemies, if you turne vnto him: and all this is to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you, that all things are subiect vnto him; insomuch that euen
they which thinke themselues to make warre against him, do fight
for him and by him. To be short, if we inquire of them concerning
the state of the earthly Kingdomes; they answer vs of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly.
If a man be combered with this present life; they teach vs the life
to come. And oftentymes a man would thinke that they spake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
materiall to our demaunds, because they answer not directly
to our demaund, but to that which wee ought to demaund. Let vs
consider somewhat nerely of what mynd the Soothsayers are, both
by the Oracles of the Deuilles, and by such as make profession of
Soothsaying. The Deuilles require Sacrifices for their answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to curious questions. The Astrologians are fayne to seeke
out Princes. The foreteller of things to come by Palmistrie, or by
Phisiognomie, or by the inwards of Beastes, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signes of the
Skye, doe the like. And ordinarily who bee more vayne and more
puffed vp with pride, than those kynd of men? What iarring is
there among them, what disagréement in their foresayings? Nay,
which of them haue wee sée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>; which is not a mony man? or that
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:13215:229"/>
would rather dye than not declare Gods wrath to a Prince? Or
that hath not soothed a Prince in his sinnes, to sucke gayne out of
him? Or that hath giuen the glorie vnto God and not to his owne
cunning &amp; skill? Or refused the honor that was offered vnto him,
as a notable iniurie? Witnesses hereof may <hi>Apollonius, Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius,

sought other thing than Images of themselues to be set vp in
Halles of Cities, and Pensions in the Courts of the most vicious
and detestable Princes. And what is to be sayd then of these folke,
who goe willingly to declare the ouerthrowe of States, and the
deaths of Princes? Which for sake their apparant ease, to goe and
shew foorth Gods wrath? Who of all their wonderfull knowledge
yéeld none other reason but this, <hi>The Lord hath sayd it vnto vs,</hi>
nor seeke any other reward than the glorie of GOD, yea matched
oftentymes with their owne death?</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the Poetries of our Scriptures, and let the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
set theirs ageinst them, and who wil doubt but that they shall
blush for shame? To omit the arte, the measure, and the antiquitie
of them, which are but the outsides of them, but yet more beautifull
in ours than in the Poetries of the <hi>Greekes</hi> or <hi>Romanes.</hi> For
what are theirs but the vauntings of men, counterfetted prayses,
and discourses of Loue Songs, not manly, but vnméete for men?
One singeth mée the rage of <hi>Achilles;</hi> another; the wandrings of
<hi>AEnaeas,</hi> and a third the loue of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Helen:</hi> And so farre hath
this kind of dealing passed into custome, that it seemes vnpossible
for man to be a Poet, a Diuine, and an Historiographer all togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So farre are our mirth and songs estraunged naturally from
God and from trueth. What shall wee say then to the Poetries,
specially of Dauid, considering that he was afore all the Poetries
of the Heathen; but that those Poetries are not an imitation, but a
simple affection? If we seeke there for songs of victorie, we haue of
them; but they concerne the God of Hostes, If for Brydesongs,
they bee not wanting; but if they be of God and of them that feare
him; If for hurning loues; there be songs of the very Loue itself,
howbeit kindled of God himselfe: If for Shepeherds songs, it is
full of them, but they concerne the Euerlasting for the Shepherd,
and <hi>Israell</hi> for the flocke. The arte of them is so excellent, that it is
an excellencie euen to translate them. The affections so liuely, that
they quench &amp; choke all others. If he had written in mans behalfe,
had he not as good a ground as <hi>Homere</hi> had? what were his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:13215:230"/>
with <hi>Golias,</hi> his victories ouer the <hi>Philistines,</hi> his loue of
<hi>Bersabee,</hi> and such others? Or thinke we that he was not subiect
to the same passions, or made of the same mould that wee be? Or
that he which wakeneth vs so much, was drowzie himself? Or that
he which speaketh of nothing but Loue and Honor, was without
them hymselfe? No; but in very deede it was another maner of
Pulse that did beate in his Ueynes, than beateth in ours, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
maner of fire that burned in his marow. Which thing no man
can deny that readeth his Psalmes, so lyuely, so feruent, and so full
of affections: howbeit that he directeth his loue and his vehement
desires to another marke, as one that behild a farre other beautie,
coueted a farre other honor, and tasted a farre other pleasure than
of the worlde. For all those bookes aime at none other marke than
the honor of God, contrarie to mans nature, which robbeth God
of his honor as much as can be, to cloth itselfe therewith, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing so much as glorie.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the other marke which followeth this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely,<note place="margin">Mans welfare.</note>
namely the welfare of man. Forasmuch as I haue sayde,
that the marke whereat man shooteth in this life, is his owne wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
If God haue left him any word, or giuen him any reuelation,
to what end ought wee to aknowledge the same to be done, but to
light him in the way of welfare, and to turne him from all crosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathes
and bywayes which might leade him from the ende that he
aimeth at. Now let vs hardely reade all the Bookes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and there is none of them which buzieth not our braynes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Mooneshine in the water, making vs to spend night and day
therein, as though wee had none other resting place to seeke?
whereas none other booke than the Byble doth put vs in minde of
our way? Our welfare is our shooteanker, and the welfare as well
of one of vs as of another, is to liue immortally vnited vnto God.
How shall <hi>Aristotle</hi> put vs in mynde thereof, who leaueth vs in
doubt whether there be any immortalitie or no, and which fetteth
our shooteanker in I wote not what muzings, peraduenture vpon
Logicke and naturall Philosophie, as his own? Or how shall <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
doe it, who suffereth himselfe to be caried away with the comon
error? Or <hi>Seneca</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca in his exhortations.</note> (how high soeuer he sore with his Wings,)
who will haue the wyseman to play the foole, the harebraind, and
the Lechor, and to giue ouer himselfe to all maner of vices, for the
bringing of his affayres to passe, yea euen to his owne harme, and
to the blaspheming of God himselfe? But if we hearken to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:13215:230"/>
Scriptures, we shall perceiue from tyme to tyme, that they bee
no vntrustie guides of our waies, neyther such as stand douting at
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> first fower wayléete, whither a man should take on the right hand
or on the left, but they be sure guydes, such as are able to drawe vs
out of the myre, and to conuey vs through the wyld Forests of the
world, not onely by leading vs by the hand, but also by seruing our
turnes both for a guyde, and for a Cresset, and for a path all togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therfore at the very first enterance they tell vs that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
created the world, made man of the dust of the earth, and that
hee made him after his owne Image and likenesse, and gaue him
power ouer al the things that he had made héere below. And what
els is this, but a teaching of man at the first word, that he is indet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God for all things, that his felicitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in seruing God,
&amp; that he is made to another end than other liuing wights; namely
for God him selfe? From hence it leadeth vs to our disobedience, &amp;
to the punishment that insewed therevpon; to wit, that by seeking
our welfare elsewhere than in God, wee fell into all mischiefe. As
touching the immortalitie of our Soules, and the Prouidence of
God, forasmuch as they be Schoolepoints to brawle vpon, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

grounds to as many as conceiue that there is a GOD,
(which thing all men doe) and such as men ought not to doubt of
or to be taught, but to practise and exercise all their lyfe long, we sée
no disputing there as is among the Philosophers. <hi>Henoch</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
indured many hard things in that froward generation, for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God; and by speciall priuiledge was soone taken out of this
lyfe. And to what intent, but to haue a better. <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob</hi> wayfared from place to place vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. And did they so
in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hope of the land of <hi>Chanaan?</hi> Nay, who would haue indured
so much hardnesse for his Posterities sake? Or for a promise that
should not bee performed till fower hundred yeeres after? Then
was it because they grounded themselues vppon a better inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
and that is the selfesame which God meant when he sayd to
<hi>Abraham, I am thy great reward. Moyses</hi> came somewhat née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
this promesse; for he sawe the Land, howbeit but from the top
of a high mountayne. And wherefore languished he fortie yeres in
the wildernesse among a thousand grudgings, at the poynt to bee
stoned euery howre by his own countrimen, &amp; yet was faine to dye
at the instant of obteining his hope? Soothly he had séene another
countrie néerer him, whervnto he aspired; &amp; farre better (which he
was to possesse in the lyfe to come) then he forewent in this present
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:13215:231"/>
life. The like is to be said of <hi>Iosua,</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Iudges,</hi> of <hi>Samuell,</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
&amp; of the Prophets; whose whole life was not a schoolediuinitie
like vnto the Philosophers, but a continuall practise of this faith:
namely, that mans shootanker is not in this world, nor our welfare
to be sought héere: but that it behoueth vs to seeke it in God, and to
turne againe to him that we may inioye it. To that end tend these
precepts which are giuen to men in the Lawe, <hi>Thou shalt loue
God with all thyne heart, with all thy Soule, and with all thy
strength.</hi> To what end? To bee oppressed by <hi>Pharao,</hi> turmoyled
vp and downe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Desert, beaten by the <hi>Philistines,</hi> ouerthrowne
by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> caryed away by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and troden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote by all Nations? If the loue of God bring vs no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
than so, what gayne wee by being his people? Nay, it is to
shewe vs, that our welfare dwelleth not heere belowe; that these
Hosts which welcome vs into our Inne with smyling countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
doe cut our throtes in our beddes; that the reward of such as serue
God, is not the world nor any worldly thing, but the very maker
both of man and of the world. Then followeth there another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
namely, <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> What
would <hi>Carneades</hi> haue sayd, or rather what would hee not haue
sayd, if he had examined this Commaundement? This Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
being sent Ambassadour on a tyme from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
made an Oration of Iustice before <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor, whereof he
spake wonders. The next day he made another, wherein he proued
that it was but folly and fondnesse; or that the <hi>Romaines</hi> should
be fayne to come backe againe to their Cotages, and that all traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke
and whatsoeuer els it be whereby Cities are made to florish,
would come to nought. What is to be sayd then of this law, which
extendeth so farre as to say, not only, doe not that to others which
you would not haue done to your selues; but also, doe that for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which you would haue done for your selues? And surely if
our welfare consist in this world, what goodlier lawe can there bée,
than for a man to loue himselfe and his owne, and to wrest all his
neighbours affayres to his owne profite? And contrarywise what
greater fondnesse, than to be another mans Baylie, that is to say,
to procure oftentymes a mans owne losse? But the Philosopher
was ignorant that godlinesse is the roote of Iustice, and that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
is nothing els but a rebounding backe of the loue which wee
owe vnto God, vpon Mankind which is his Image. And the ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
poynt of this Commaundement, which beeing restreyned
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:13215:231"/>
within one worde spreadeth it selfe throughout the whole lawe of
<hi>Israell,</hi> is none other than to shewe vs that our chiefe dwelling
place is elsewhere than heere, and that whereas we loue all things
here for our own sakes, we ought to loue other men as our selues,
and our selues for Gods sake, who is our sole and onely welfare.
Hereunto doe all the Scriptures guyde vs, bee it by authoritie of
the lawe, or by example of holy persons, or by the exhortations of
the Prophetes: and there is not that lyne which twitcheth vs not
by the eare, to waken vs out of the sléepe of this world; and which
plucketh vs not from the stoole and the table, and from the glewing
vanities that sticke so fast to vs; to bring vs backe to glorie and to
the inioying of God who is our welfare. Seeing then that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
we thinke so little vppon this glorie of God; what a booke is
that, which speaketh of nothing els? Séeing we be plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged so déepe
in the world, and the world in vs; what a booke is that, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth
vs from it euery hower? And what would become of man
if he had not another spirit than the spirit of man and of the world,
which biddeth battell both to man and to the world? Soothly wee
may well say therefore, that the Scriptures are verily of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring,
which haue so expresse resemblances of him, and so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the hand, stampe, print and writing of the whole world.</p>

glorie; by the examining of man, that his onely
and whole welfare is to cleaue vnto GOD.
Now therefore fith we sée that the Scriptures
preache vnto vs the same thing that wee haue
read both in the world and in ourselues; ought
it not to be a good proofe to vs, that he which made both the World
and man, hath also made the Scriptures to rule them by? And that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:13215:232"/>
he which hath spoken to all Nations by his Creatures, hath also
voutsafed too shewe himselfe more nerely too them by his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
Agein, séeing that the Scriptures commaund vs to loue
God with all our hart, and that the Creatures haue heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
vs to be bound thereto; so as the Creatures teache the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
thing which the Scriptures commaund: what can we say but
that both those bookes haue one selfesame author? Howbeit foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as our eyes be so daseled by our fall, that the Creatures were
vnto vs as a clasped booke, or as a thing written in Cyphers; God
to apply himself to the weaknesse of our sight, hath giuen vs his
Scriptures: and that forasmuch as our wills are wholly turned
from him, it behoued vs to be comaunded our owne welfare, which
(were we according to our first creation) we should couet and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
earnestly at the only sight of the first booke. But forasmuch as
it may still be sayd, that these bookes are rather the woorks of good
men and of such as feared God, than of God himself: let vs sée if they
haue not in them some proper and peculiar markes of Gods spirit.
I meane such as no creature can be partaker of, but by inspiration
from God. For like as in his dooings there are certeine miracles,
wherein euen the wickeddest acknowledge the finger of God: So
in his words or Scriptures, there may vndoubtedly bee some such
thing, as cannot procéede but from God himselfe. Let vs begin at
the Style.<note place="margin">The Style of the Scriptures.</note> In mens affayres we haue two sorts of writing. The
inferiour sort and men of equalitie, indeuer to perswade folke by
apparant reasons; for they knowe they haue no authoritie to giue
them credite. But Princes will of their mere authoritie looke to bée
beléeued whatsoeuer they say: for they thinke they haue the world
at their commaundement, and that they may speak what they list:
and they suppose it to bee some derogation to them to alledge any
reason. Also in humane Sciences the case is all one. For the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is beléeued of his Patient without alledging why: but of an
other Phisition he is not so. Likewise the Schoolemaister is belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the Scholer, yea euen in things which were disputable for
him with one of his fellowes. So much more therefore shall this
rule take place in matters diuine, which surmount both the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the learner, and the skill of the Teacher himselfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
we see how the Philosophers doe mount vp from things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
knowne to things lesse knowne, and from Grounds and
Principles, to Conclusions. And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> intending to
proue that there is a God, made a whole score of bookes of it: and
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:13215:232"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> speaking of things diuine, will haue the auncient Oracles to
be beleeued, and not his owne sayings: which argeweth that euen
by nature men knowe well, that they deserue not to bee beléeued,
further foorth than they make proof, no not euen in the least things;
and therefore that they bee worthie to be laughed at, if they thinke
their sayings to be authoritie in matters diuine. Now then, sith it
is so that the Style is such both of all men in their common dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and of all the Philosophers in high matters: what shal the
Author of our Byble bee, whose will and meaning is to bee belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vppon his bare worde, euen in the things which excéede both
the naturall beléefe of such as heare them, and the vnderstanding
of all men which take vpon them to speake of them? GOD crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Heauen and Earth: Man is falne from his originall state by
sinne. If thou beest a man that sayest it, who will beléeue thee
vnlesse thou prooue it? And yet notwithstanding it appeareth that
hee wrate it to bee beléeued: for hee commaundeth it to bee belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Therefore his speaking is of authoritie, and not by perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yet notwithstanding no body is beléeued vpon his bare word,
sauing in things which lye in his own power and his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Whosoeuer then in things surmounting man, (I meane in
matters concerning GOD and mans saluation) will looke to bee
beléeued of authoritie, only because he sayes it; yea and to be more
beléeued without proofe, than others vpon proof; must néedes be the
Prince and Father of man and not a man. Now, who sees not this
course kept throughout all the Scriptures; and yet where is there
any one Syllogisme or Demonstration in them? sauing such as
these which soothly be more firme than any Syllogisme, and more
néedefull than any Demonstration; namely, The Lord hath sayde
it, and it is doone; the Lord hath spoken it, and he will be beléeues.
And what other booke find we which proceedeth after that maner,
howbeit that some deceiuers haue long time since presumed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
the same?</p>
               <p>Also we haue many bookes of maners written by the Heathen.
How procéede they against Uice? or how deale they with Uertue?
They define, they distinguish, they dispute of the generall and of
the vnderkind, of the meane and of the extremes. It is spoken (say
they) from one Countermatch to another. And if they offend the
Lawes of Logicke, they be afrayd of reproof.<note place="margin">The lawes and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Scripture.</note> The Lawes of God
speake a little more plainly: He that stealeth shall pay fowerfold:
He that killeth shalbe punished with death, Which is as much to
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:13215:233"/>
say, as that the authoritie of the one dependeth vpon their power,
&amp; the authority of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other dependeth vpon their proof. To be short,
euen our spéeche extendeth ordinarily no further than our power:
and therefore the Teacher speaketh after another maner then the
Learner, the Prince than the Subiect, and the Senatour than the
Orator. What maner a booke then I pray you is this, which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to all men alike, to Kings as to Subiectes, to Greate as to
small, to old as to yong, to learned as to vnlearned; sauing that it
surmounteth the capacitie of the one as well as of the other? ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intreating nor perswading any man, but absolutely bidding or
forbidding al men. Nother (which more is) doth it say to any man,
Thou shalt liue as a recluce within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> precinct of thyne owne house
all thy life long, or thou shalt lye in continual prison; but thou shalt
liue or dye for euer without ende. In what other booke reade wee
such commaundements? Ye in what booke reade we such punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; such rewards? And if euery bodies speaking be according
to the abilitie of his power; from whom is this spéech which dareth
pronounce or threaten euerlasting things, but from the partie him
selfe that is euerlasing? If it be a creature that speaketh it, either
it is a good creature or an euill. If it be an euill creature, why for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
he euill so rigorously? and commaundeth good so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
or (to say better) how commeth it to passe, that the mark which
hee aimeth at is Gods glorie and our welfare? Or if it bee a good
Creature, how happeneth it that hee chalendgeth to himselfe that
which belongeth to GOD, and which cannot be imparted to any
Creature, which is the very sinne that ouerthrewe both the Diuell
into Hell, and man into destruction? And if it be no Creature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good nor bad; what remayneth then, but that it must needes
be the Creator? Now what leafe is there in the whole Scripture,
where wee meete not with such matter? And herewithall wee see
that thing in the obseruers of that Lawe, which is not read of any
others: namely that they haue yeelded their lyues, and incurred
the hatred &amp; disdeine of the whole worlde, rather than they would
breake or despise it. Uerily euen in this respect and none other, that
they were sure that they serued such a Lawegiuer, as not only had
power ouer the barke of man and ouer this present wretched lyfe
as other common Lawgiuers haue; but also was of power to giue
either euerlasting lyfe or endlesse death. The same appeareth yet
more, in that the lawes which are giuen to men in the Scriptures,
are not inioyned alonely to the outward man; but doe pearce euen
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:13215:233"/>
to the heart of man. In deede they require Sacrifices; but yet they
preferre obedience. They inioyne fasting; but that is from sinne.
They inioyne Circumcision, but it is the Circumcision of the hart.
To be short, for a Summary of al Sinnes, they forbid lusting and
couering; which thing (as I haue sayd afore) is not to bee found in
any law of the Heathen. Who I pray you knoweth the very ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie
and secret conceyts of our hearts, but he that made them? Or
who can looke into Man, but the maker of Man? And who is he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man or Deuill, that euer durst presume to inioyne a lawe to
mens thoughts? But all these things come still to this poynt, that
the partie which speaketh so vpon authoritie, threatening things
that excéede mans abilitie, and making a law for the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
we cannot come; must of necessitie be of more power than we.</p>
               <p>Agein, what a number of things haue wee taught vs in the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res exceedeth the reach of man.</note> which cannot bréede of mannes brayne, nor come from
elswhere than from about? And if they cannot bréede in his mind,
how can they come from his hand or from his mouth? We can wel
say there is one God; for if wee enter into our selues wee find him
there; and if we goe neuer so little out of ourselues, we meete him
euery where. But that in one Essence there should be thrée persons,
the Father, the woord, and the Spirit; how can it bréede in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of man? Or who could euer haue thought of it? Also,
from the Creatures wee come to the Creator; from mouing to a
rest; from nouelties to a beginning: and there mannes reasoning
stayes. But although the first man myght knowe when hee was
created; yet how could he haue knowen when the world was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
And although that by the new things therein, we déeme it too
be newe: who euer durst to haue limited the first day and the first
houre thereof? Or how could that <hi>Chymera</hi> haue come in any
mannes mynd? And yet in verie déede we haue dyuers <hi>Chymeras</hi>
among the auncient writers, concerning the Creation of the world
according to the diuersities of opinions that were among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
and the diuersities of imaginations among the comon
people. But was there euer any afore this booke of the Byble, that
began his account of tymes or his historie, at the first day of the
world, thought he were of opinion that the world was created? And
séeing that the intent of al wryters of stories is to be beléeued; what
els had this beginning of an historie at that poynt bin, but a crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his credit at his first enterance in, if the maiestie of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

appeasing of Gods Iustice, God himself should be fayne too come
downe and to take mans flesh vnto him; who would say it but only
God? and who could bee beléeued in that case but only he? So is it
also concerning the conception of the Uirgin, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
that were not to come to passe vntill fower hundred yéeres
after, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the comming of the Messias, and such like things;
which would neuer haue come in a mans head to haue written: so
farre of are they from mans wit, I meane as of it self and without

aduisedly and with intent to marke them; shall in euery booke
finde many matters, which euen by his owne iudgement had neuer
come in mans mynd, notwithstanding that they be spoken by wise
men, who both beléeued them firmely, and ment to bee beléeued in
speaking them.</p>
               <p>What shal we say then to the Prophesyings<note place="margin">Prophesies so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> or true foretellings
which are sowen euerywhere in the Scriptures, that is to wit of
Gods spirit which is shed foorth from the one ende to the other; I
say not in scattered leaues as the Prophesies of <hi>Sybil</hi> were, but ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
al at one poynt, notwithstanding that they were vttered both
at diuers tymes, by diuers persons, and in diuers places? I omit
the first Prophesie concerning the womans seede that should crush
the Serpents head, and such like perteyning to the redemption of
man by the Messias, because that that doctrine shall haue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place hereafter; and I will alledge none other things than such
as are alreadie proued and out of controuersie. Unto <hi>Abraham</hi>
was giuen this promise:<note place="margin">Gene. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>They seede shall doe seruice in a strange
Land, and bee hardly intreated there fower hundred yeeres;
and then will I iudge the Nation whom they shall haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
and in the fourth generation shall they come hether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
What Oracle did euer foretell a thing so precisely, so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,
and so long aforehand? And yet was that Prophesie fulfilled
at the appoynted tyme: and it cannot be sayd to be a counterfet; for
<hi>Moyses</hi> in leading the people of <hi>Israell</hi> through so many turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines,
grounded himselfe vpon none other thing. And it stood him
on hand to speake of a Prophesie that was common among them,
and deliuered from hand to hand, considering that he taketh it for
his theam and ankerhold, both to speake vpon and to worke vpon.
And soothly, as it was receiued by <hi>Abraham,</hi> so was it receyued by
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:13215:234"/>
                  <hi>Moyses,</hi> and put in execution by <hi>Iosua. Iacob</hi> made his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>AEgipt;</hi> wherein there are as many Prophesies as words:
not for his owne Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, but also for the Trybes that should
come of them. Neuerthelesse I will stand but vppon one of them.
<hi>Thou Iuda</hi> (sayth he) <hi>thy brothers shall commend thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gene. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; thy
fathers Children shall yeeld thee reuerence. And the Scepter
shall not be taken from Iuda, nor the Law maker fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene
his feete, vntill Silo come.</hi> The effect hereof is, that the Scepter
shall remayne with <hi>Iuda,</hi> and that he shall haue souereine iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vntill the tyme of Messias: and so do the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> interpret
it. Yet were <hi>Ruben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Leuie</hi> the eldest brethren of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
house; and therefore his doing was against the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And <hi>Moyses</hi> who led the people of <hi>Israell</hi> out of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> was
of the Trybe of <hi>Leuie. Iosua</hi> who brought them into the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> was of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> The <hi>Iudges</hi> were raysed vp one while
out of one Trybe and auother while out of another: and <hi>Saule</hi> the
first King chosen by the people, was of the Trybe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi>
which was the yoongest of all. These things therefore were a curst
shaking to the Prophesie. In the meane while the Scepter passed
from <hi>Saule</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> from a King to a yoong Shepheard of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
and there was settled for euer, notwithstanding the murmurings
of the ten Trybes against it, and the falling away of <hi>Israell,</hi> &amp; the
Captiuitie of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And whereas he sayth, <hi>vntill Silo come,</hi>
it sufficed vntill another tyme, that by the sapce of two thousande
yéeres, the house of <hi>Iuda</hi> reigned still in <hi>Israell,</hi> and had the elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
together with a direct obserued pedegree: which thing wee
reade not of any other stocke in the world. Here they will say, who
shall assure vs that <hi>Iacob</hi> spake those things? If I should aske
them as much concerning their Histories, what knowe they more
of them? And what should <hi>Moyses</hi> haue gayned by the deuising
thereof, being himselfe of the Trybe of <hi>Leuie,</hi> and giuing ouer his
charge to one of the Trybe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which had rather bene an
occasion to make <hi>Iuda</hi> (which was the strongest of al the Trybes)
to grudge against him, seeing that that Trybe had bene authorised
both by <hi>Iacobs</hi> last will and by answer from God? Or if he did it
to greatefie <hi>Iuda,</hi> why was he not afrayd to displease <hi>Ruben, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi>
and <hi>Leuie:</hi> or rather why made he not the Prophesie to fall
vpon <hi>Leuie</hi> to authorise himselfe? Nay, what gratefying of <hi>Iuda</hi>
could it yet be, considering that <hi>Iuda</hi> was excluded from it at that
tyme, and came not to it a thousand yéeres after? Surely (the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:13215:235"/>
circumstances being well weyed) eyther there was neuer any
Prophesie vncorruptly reported, or if euer any were, this must
néedes be it. And as touching these good Philosophers, which will
haue prophesying to procéed of a coniunction of the vnderstanding
which they call Possible, with an vnderstanding which they terme
Separated, by meane of imagination: &amp; that old men cannot Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weakenesse of their imaginatiue power: what
wil they say here to <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was an older man tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of their
tyme,<note place="margin">Rabbi Moyses vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the booke Abubacher.</note> &amp; yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding saw so cléerly &amp; so farre of? For if their
doctrine be commonly true, and yet notwithstanding, olde <hi>Iacob</hi>
prophesied; doeth it not followe that his prophesie is extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and commeth from a higher power than the sayd pretensed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
that is to wit from God? And if his prophesying was
according to their rule; doth it not followe that their doctrine is
false, that is to wit, that prophesying commeth not of the force of
our imagination, nor of our selues, considering that it weakeneth
not with vs, but that it cometh by inspiration from God? In the
blessings that <hi>Iacob</hi> gaue to his posteritie, the matter ought not
to be passed ouer so lightly, where hee speaketh of the partes that
should be allotted to euery of his Children in the Land of Canaan,
as if he had made them himselfe, assigning to one the Seacoast, to
another the Cornecountrie, and to another the vynegrounds, euen
after the same sort that they were diuided vnto them certeine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres after by lot. For how could he come to the knowledge
thereof, but by him that ouerruleth all Lots? And seeing that the
foretellings of Astrologie are a meane betwéene necessitie and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
as <hi>Ptolomie</hi> teacheth; and nothing is more casual than lots,
what maner of Astrologie is this, which iudgeth of lottes both so
long aforehand and also so certeinly? But when as in the chapter
going next afore, wee reade that <hi>Iacob</hi> in blessing the Children of
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> preferred <hi>Ephraim</hi> the yonger Sonne before <hi>Manasses</hi>
who was the elder, and being warned thereof by their Father, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
ageine that he was not deceiued, but that the yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should bee the greater, and that his Seede should growe to a
multitude of people: what arte moued <hi>Iacob</hi> to say it, or what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
moued <hi>Moyses</hi> to contriue it? If ye say Phiznomie or Iudicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the good old man was blind. But what lineame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts can foreshew
for a whole race, or what Constellations can shewe what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
to whole Nations that are yet vnborne? If it bee sayde that
<hi>Moyses</hi> loued the one better than the other: The two of whom he
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:13215:235"/>
speaketh were already dead at that time, and the people that were
to come of them, were but then in comming. And yet was that
prophesie fulfilled; for the Trybe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was alwayes migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
than the Trybe of <hi>Manasses,</hi> as appeareth throughout the
whole processe of their Histories, and in the end the kingdom of the
Tenne Trybes was grounded chiefly vpon that. And in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this word, as oft as <hi>Moyses, Iosua,</hi> the bookes of <hi>Kings,</hi>
or the Chronicles speake of those two Children, the yongest is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
named afore the eldest: which thing vndoubtedly the Trybe of
<hi>Manasses</hi> would neuer haue indured without taking exceptio to
it, if they had not thought themselues to haue rested vpon the will
of GOD, and not vpon the fancie of man. What shall we say of
<hi>Moyses?</hi> Hee speaketh to the people continually of the Conquest
of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> according to that promise, and therfore it must néedes
he that it was a prophesie very commonly knowen among them.
And in déede <hi>Ioseph</hi> picked out a long time for it afore his buriall.
Nay, moreouer <hi>Moyses</hi> deuideth the Land vnto them in mynd;
appointeth them arbitrators to make their partitions; giueth them
Lawes to settle themselues vpon; appointeth them what orders
they should kéepe there, setteth them doune the platformes of their
Cities, Suburbes, and houses; inioyneth them the tilling of their
grounds, the resting of the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>th yere, their Feastes and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and appointest them their Cities of refuge for casuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughters.
A man might say that his speaking of these things was
as if a Father should dispose of his goods that he had gotten, and
which hee had already in his hand. What lykelyhod hereof was
there, at such tyme as they burned Bricke in <hi>AEgipt?</hi> or when they
lingered in the wildernes? yea or at the returne of the men that
were sent to spye out the Land, when they reported nothing but
hardnesse to the people? I pray you, if a man should at this day
part <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> among vs in his imagination, to euery of vs
share and share lyke; would we not say accxsording to the prouerbe,
that he parted his Uenison before he had caught it? And yet what
a nomber of men haue passed the Alpes vnder the Standard? And
sith it is so that <hi>Moyses</hi> entered into that Land, and those which
wayted for it dyed in the way, and yet that at the tyme appointed,
the <hi>Chananites</hi> gaue place to that people: who seeth not that of
necessitie the same people were driuen by some other than man to
followe <hi>Moyses,</hi> yea <hi>Moyses</hi> himself to take vpon him the leading
of them through so many distresses; both of them being grounded
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:13215:236"/>
(say I) not vppon mans fancie, but vppon expresse promise which
they by vnfallible records beléeued to be of God? But hée procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
yet further. For as he foresawe them in <hi>Chanaan</hi> afore they
came there: so foresawe hee them there to offend God by seruing
<hi>Baal</hi> after they came there. I say he saw them forget GOD, and
God myndfull of them in his wrath: hee sawe them dispersed and
scattered ouer the fower quarters of the World, and troden vnder
the féete of Straungers: To be short, he sawe the Gentiles called
of God into his Church in their place; yea and he sawe it so cléerly,
that he foretold it to them all in his Song,<note place="margin">Deuter. 32.</note> which hée willed them
to preserue from hand to hand, as a witnesse against them &amp; a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
to himself. Though from the top of Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> he could
behold the land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> to speake so fitly thereof: from what
mountaine could hee see the things that were yet in the reynes and
heartes of men as then to come, yea which lay hidden yet many
hundred yeres after; or in what booke could he haue seen them and
read them; but in the booke of lyfe, that is to say in God himselfe?
The word that was spoken by <hi>Moyses</hi> was performed word for
word by <hi>Iosua,</hi> without adding or diminishing any whit, contrarie
to the ambitious mynd of man which lyketh not to follow another
mans lure; which thing was no small signe that <hi>Iosua</hi> did not so
much obey <hi>Moyses,</hi> as God speaking by <hi>Moyses.</hi> And this curse
that <hi>Iosua</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosua. 7.</note> pronounceth in his booke, ageinst the man that should
build <hi>Iericho</hi> ageine, is not to be forgotten: <hi>He shal lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
thereof vpon his firstborne</hi> (sayth he) <hi>&amp; set vp the gates
thereof vpon his yongest sonne.</hi> That is to say, he shalbe puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with the suddein death of all his Children.<note place="margin">1. King. 16. verse 34.</note> For about fiuehun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeres after, in the time of <hi>Achab, Hiel</hi> of <hi>Bethel</hi> builded vp
<hi>Iericho,</hi> the which he founded vpon <hi>Abiram</hi> his first Sonne, and
hung vp the gates of it with the death of <hi>Segus</hi> his yongest sonne,
and the booke of Kings sayth there, <hi>it was according as the Lord
had spoken by the mouth of Iosua the Sonne of Nun,</hi> to shewe
that Gods word is euerlasting, and that it neuer ouerslippeth the
tyme. And in very déede it lyeth ouerthrowen at this day, and was
neuer repayred since that tyme, howbeit that the beautifull situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof might haue allured euery man, as we reade in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Geographers. In the bookes of <hi>Iosua</hi> and of the <hi>Iudges</hi> wee
sée the things performed which were foretolde by <hi>Moyses,</hi> and the
comming to passe both of the promises &amp; of the threates that were
made by him. For accordingly as the people of <hi>Israell</hi> did either
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:13215:236"/>
turne away from God or returne vnto him; God raysed vp Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
in <hi>Chanaan</hi> to punish them, or deliuerers in <hi>Israell</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them. And as for the bookes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of the <hi>Kings,</hi> and of
the <hi>Prophetes;</hi> either they be prophesies of effectes to come, or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
of prophesies forepast. To be short, in all the discourse of the
Byble, there is not any season to bee found without both Prophet
and Prophesie, as well in prosperitie as in aduersitie: Whereby
we might sée both the heauenlines and the trueth of them the more
clearly, if we could set the places, persones, and state of that time
before our eyes. But out of this continuall prophesying, wee will
drawe some peculiar poyntes, so euident as cannot bée gaynesaid,
which will vndoubtedly be of credit among all indifferent persons.<note place="margin">1. King. 13.</note>
At such time as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the sonnne of <hi>Nebath</hi> made the tenne
Trybes to fall away from <hi>Roboam</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Salomon;</hi> to
the intent they should haue no occasion to returne againe to their
former state by resorting to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to woorshippe there: hee
réered an Alter in <hi>Bethell</hi> contrarie to the Lawe of God. <hi>Then
came a man of God</hi> (sayeth the historie) <hi>to Bethel by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Lord, and sayd to Ieroboam; Behold, a
Sonne shalbe born of the house of Dauid, whose name shalbe
Iosias. He shall sacrifise vppon thee the Preestes of the Hillal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which offer incense vpon thee: And this shalbe the signe
thereof,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. King. 22. verse. 15. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Thyne altar shall ryue asunder, and the asshes that are
thereon shalbe powred downe.</hi> This Prophesie was fulfilled in
all poynts by <hi>Iosias</hi> thrée hundred yéeres after. And when <hi>Iosias</hi>
(sayeth the historie) had so done, he sawe a certeine tumbe, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
whose it was, intending to haue burnt the bones of him that lay
there, as he had done of the other préests in <hi>Bethel.</hi> But it was told
him that it was the tumb of the man of God, which had foretold
those things so long agoe: whereuppon hee forbade any man to
touche it. Now they that knowe how those bookes of the Kinges
were disposed, wilnot call the historie in question. For the histories
of the Kings were written by the priests and Prophets, according
to the measure of the time that they reigned, and were holden so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it was felonie to touche them. Furthermore, séeing if this
Prophesie was written afore the comming of <hi>Iosias,</hi> it could not
be falsified: for who could haue hit vppon his proper name? And if
it were written after, and deuised vppon the euent: how came the
sayd Tumb to bee made at the same instant? Or was there none
other deuise wherewith to haue disguised it, without taking any
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:13215:237"/>
further peyne? Myght it not haue suffised to haue sayd, <hi>One Iosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
shall come &amp;c.</hi> without speaking eyther of the death of the
man of God, or of his méeting with the Lyon, or of the talk which
he had with the Prophet of <hi>Samaria;</hi> but that he must take peyne
to be found a Lyer by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> which knew the originall of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tumb, or could at leastwise haue inquired it? But in verie déede
this Prophesie which dooth so set downe the name, the place, and
the circumstances in the doing; is such as cannot bee fathered but
vpon God, as vnto whome alone things absent or to come are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And to shewe the vncorruptnesse of the Scripture the more
cléerly, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealeth not that the same man of God by whose mouth
God had vttered the sayd Prophesie, was slaine by a Lyon for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back ageine to eate with the Prophet of <hi>Samaria</hi> contrarie to
the word of the Lord: which doth vs to vnderstand, that men are
nothing of themselues, but onely so farforth as they be Gods tooles
and instruments. Now then by what coniecture can we deeme that
man to haue bin the deuiser of a lye, who to tell the trueth, sticked
not to dishonor the remembrance of so great a Prophet, whose sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
appéered by so many circumstances?</p>
               <p>Wonderfull is <hi>Esay</hi> in the things that hee foretelleth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the kingdome of the Messias and the calling of the Gentiles
for he seemeth rather an Euangelist than a Prophet. Also when he
threateneth <hi>Hierusalem</hi> with the captiuitie of <hi>Babylone,</hi> or chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them ageine with hope of their deliuerance: his maner of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sheweth, that he speaketh as one that sawe them both; and in
that respect also were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets called <hi>Seërs.</hi> And in very trueth,
he saith not, <hi>the Lord will doe, the Lord will call, the Lorde will
destroy,</hi> and so foorth: but, <hi>he doth, he calleth, he destroyeth:</hi>
Yea and oftentimes, <hi>he hath done, he hath called, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,</hi>
and so foorth; as though he spake not of things that were
but onely néere the execution or performance; but of things alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
come to passe. After that maner did he foretel things, in the time
that the people prospered and trusted in the allyance of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi>
and that all likelihods were to the contrarie. But I aske of
such as doubt of our Prophesies,<note place="margin">Esay. 44. &amp; 45.</note> by what spirite could <hi>Esay</hi> say; <hi>I
am the Lord that doeth things in deede, which doe say vnto
Cyrus, Thou art my Shepherd, thou shalt fulfill al my will: and
which sayeth vnto Hierusalem, Thou shalt be builded ageine;
&amp; vnto the Temple, Thou shalt be founded agein.</hi> And ageine:
<hi>Thus sayth the Lord to Cyrus his anoynted, whom I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:13215:237"/>
by the right hand to subdue the Nations before him, &amp;
to weaken the reynes of Kings. I will goe before thee, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
the croked wayes. I will breake open the Brazen gates, &amp;
wring asunder the yron barres,</hi> and so foorth, <hi>that thou mayst
knowe how that I am the Lord the God of Israell which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
thee by the name. For loue of my seruant Iacob, and for
Israels sake haue I named thee by thy name, and called thee
though thou knewest me not, &amp;c.</hi> How many wonders shall we
find in these fewe words, if wee list to examine them? At the same
tyme that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> triumphed vnder their allyance with
the <hi>Chaldees, Esay</hi> threatened them with destruction by the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
people. This is somewhat.</p>
               <p>But some will say that mans wisedome may reache as farre as
that. Yea, but he foretelleth, not onely the captiuitie of that people,
the sacking of the Cittie, and the ouerthrowe of the Temple: but
also the destruction of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp of Hierusalem and the Temple by them again. Well may
mans skill wade into Wéekes and monethes; but considering the
vncerteintie of worldly matters, it can neuer wade into yéeres, and
much lesse into hundreds of yeres, and into the whole continuance
of a mightie and long lasting Monarchie, as <hi>Esay</hi> doth there. In
so much that hee nameth <hi>Cyrus</hi> a hundred yeeres afore hee was
borne. And afore his Graundfathers were named in the world, hée
calleth him by name to deliuer <hi>Israel.</hi> And in another place he sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth
the people of <hi>Cethim</hi> (that is to say of <hi>Macedonie</hi>) to the
destroying of the <hi>Persians.</hi> And in his eight Chapter he taketh <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
and <hi>Zacharias</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Iebarachias</hi> by name to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of his Prophesie, who were vnborne a hundred yeres after.
Let the greatest enemies of the trueth enter into their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and tell me what humane skill or cunning there could be
in those things. They cannot say here, that these Prophesies were
forged by some man vpon the euent. For by the remouing of the
<hi>Iewes</hi> vnto <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lawes, Prophesies and Scriptures of
<hi>Israell</hi> which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among that people, were conueied into
diuers places of the world; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the which they had this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
afore <hi>Cyrus</hi> was borne: and beeing in diuers mens hands, it
was vnpossible to be falsified. And in good sooth, sith we see that the
Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> being conquerours, caused the Temple to be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ageine, it ought to bee a marke vnto vs, that in the Idolatrie
out of which they came, they had séene wonders of the God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:13215:238"/>
and that according to <hi>Esaies</hi> saying, they perceiued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be called by him. The same is to bee considered of vs in
<hi>Icremie</hi> and <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> who beeing in places farre one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the one in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the other in captiuitie at <hi>Babylon,</hi>
foretell the selfesame things, as sure Registers of one Court. But
<hi>Ieremie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jerem. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. &amp;c.</note> is the more wonderfull in this behalfe, in that he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieth
expresly that the people which were caryed away prisoners,
should bee brought home againe at the ende of thréescore and ten
yeeres, contrary to all likelyhood, and yet with such assurednesse, as
a man would verely haue sayd, that he had led them home againe
by the hand into <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And in very déede, at the thréescore
and tenth yeeres end, the people were conueyed home againe at the
forenamed instant, as though <hi>Cyrus</hi> had bene bent of set purpose
to verifie the Prophesie, or as though hee had bene waged by the
Prophet. And it appeareth by the nineth Chapter of <hi>Danyell,</hi>
(where this prophesie is alledged,) that it was common among al
the people. As for <hi>Danyell</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 9.</note> himselfe, who being borne vnder the
first Monarchie, seemeth rather an Historiographer than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
as in respect of the Monarchies and things that insewed; (for
he speaketh of the <hi>Persians, Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romaines,</hi> of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of the vnhallowing of the Temple, and of other
things that were done sixe hundred yeeres after his tyme, as of
things alreadie come to passe): like as he closeth vp the Prophesie
from the creation of the world to the comming of Christ; so ought
he to stop all mens mouthes that will speake against him. For if a
man wil not beleue the <hi>Iewish</hi> Chronicles, in that they report that
the Prophesie of <hi>Danyell</hi> was read vnto Great <hi>Alexander</hi> at his
comming to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to shewe him what was foretold of him:
yet is it euident and cannot bee denyed, but that when <hi>Prolomie</hi>
caused the Scriptures to be translated, the Prophesie of <hi>Danyell</hi>
was then extant, and was translated with the residue; which was
long tyme afore the Tyrannie of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the which he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
to the eye. And therefore if it could not bee falsified in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
as little could it be falsified in all the rest, considering that all
of it doth equally and infinitely exceede the reach of all creatures,
and cannot proceede from any moe than one Spirit. Now then,
let vs looke vpon the things that are in this Prophet; and whence
could hee haue them,<note place="margin">Daniel. 5.</note> but from him that maketh and vnmaketh
Kings at his pleasure? He forewarned <hi>Balsasar</hi> the sonne of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bugodonozor,</hi>
that he should haue a fall, because he had not taken
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:13215:238"/>
example at the chastisement of his father, but had aduaunced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
against God. It will perhaps bee sayd, that it is the saying of
wise men, that when pride goes afore, shame commeth after. But
when as <hi>Balsasar</hi> was slayne that same night in the middest of his
iolitie; it was a marking of the thing more precisely, which had bin
foretold by the former Prophets also.<note place="margin">Esay. 13. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is no shift at all. Behold, <hi>Darius</hi> was but newly entered into
the Monarchie, when euen in the first yeere of his reigne <hi>Danyell</hi>
sayd vnto him, <hi>Three Kings shall stand vp yet in Persia, and the
fourth shall be inriched with great riches aboue them all; and
when hee is so increased,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 15</note> 
                  <hi>hee shall stirre vp euery man against
Greece.</hi> These fower or fiue words conteyne the historie of seuen
or eight score yéeres. We haue great learned men, which by reason
of their long experience, haue made (as it were) an Anatomy of our
state: but which of them I pray you durst euer take vpon him to
tell how many Kings should come after, and much lesse to foretell
what should be done by the fourth King that was to come as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyell</hi>
doth here, who maketh expresse mention of <hi>Darius</hi> voyage
against the <hi>Greekes?</hi> Let vs heare him yet further. <hi>But a mightie
King shall rise vp</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>and reigne with great authoritie,
and do whatsoeuer he will.</hi> Who seeth not here how <hi>Alexander</hi>
commeth out of <hi>Greece</hi> against <hi>Darius,</hi> and subdueth the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians?
And when he is in al his royaltie</hi> (sayth he) <hi>his kingdome
shall be broken and diuided to the fower windes of the ayre,
how beit not to his own race, but vnto strangers; for his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
shalbe plucked vp by the roote.</hi> He could not haue payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out <hi>Alexanders</hi> Monarchie more liuely, which was but as a
flash of lightening that passeth from the West into the East, and
tooke ende in it selfe, and was deuided into many Kingdomes, as
<hi>Macedonie, Thrace, Syria,</hi> and <hi>AEgipt,</hi> among Princes that were
not of his race. Whosoeuer would haue made an Abridgement of
the whole Historie of the Monarchie of <hi>Greece</hi> in fewe words; he
could not lightly haue done it in other than these. Neuerthelesse, it
is a glauncing ouerthwart through two Monarchies &amp; two whole
hundred yeeres, whereas all the wisedome of the world put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
could not ouersee so much as two yeeres, no not euen in the
commonest affayres of a household. Now, the storie of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones</hi>
was not the thing that he aimed at: but the chiefe thing that
hee sought into, was the state of the Church to come among the
<hi>Iewes;</hi> and therefore he letteth the rest of the braunches alone, and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:13215:239"/>
goeth on but only with the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>AEgipt.</hi> Therefore
let vs reade the residue of the Chapter. There he paynteth out the
warres of <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of <hi>Syria</hi> against the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> the oppression of the righteous, and the
defyling of all holy things, so liuely and manifestly, that he which
were not told of it afore he reades it, should not be able to say whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were a Prophesie or an Historie.<note place="margin">Daniel. 7.</note> In his eight Chapter he
describeth a battell betweene a Ram and a Goate. <hi>The Ram</hi> (saith
he) <hi>that had two hornes, is the King of Medes and Persians,
because those two states went ioyntly together. The Goate is
the King of Greece; &amp; the great horne that he had betweene
his eyes, is the greatest King,</hi> that is to wit the great <hi>Alexander:</hi>
and yet none of them both liued sixe score yeeres after.<note place="margin">Daniel. 8.</note> In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
Chapter he describeth al the fower Monarchies, but special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Romaine;</hi> which had (sayth he) teeth of yron, wherewith it
brake and deuoured all the rest. And he purseweth it so farre, that
he declareth himselfe to haue had a sight in his mynd, both of the
breeding, of the proceeding, and of the decaying therof. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what <hi>Rome</hi> was at that time, it was then scarce hatched: and
a great while afterwarde, <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing but a small cut ouer
the Sea that is betwixt that and <hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 9.</note> knewe it not. To bee
short, in the nineth Chapter he foretelleth that at the end of three-score
and ten wéekes, (accounting from the day that the word was
vttered by <hi>Ieremie</hi> for the buylding vp of the Temple agayne,)
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> should be destroyed by a prince of the people that was
to come, that is to say, by an Emperour issewing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which at that tyme was not in being: which
thing I could shew here to haue come to passe at the instaut afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
according to the Prophesie. But forasmuch as this poynt
perteyneth properly to the comming of the Messias, wherunto we
reserue many things that may confirme vs more and more in the
holy Scriptures, it shall bee treated of in his peculiar place. Now
then, we haue here a continuance of wonderfull Prophesies, from
the creation of the world euen vnto Christ, vttered and set foorth a
long while afore hand, and come to passe iust in their tymes; not
generall, but marked with their circumstances; not doubtfull, but
such as expresse the things and persons by their names. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to knit vp this matter withall, I demaund vnto what we may
attribute them, but to the inspiration of GOD<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Some in stead of
holding themselues within their bounds, will néedes ouerleape
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:13215:239"/>
them, by denying al. But besides the reasons afore alledged, séeing
that at the same tyme that the <hi>Israelites</hi> worshipped their God,
the Nations about them had Oracles which answered vnto all
questions; and that man is so inquisitiue of things to come, that if
he cannot bee certified at home, he seeketh euerywhere abroade: I
would haue them to answer me, whether this people were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature than all other Nations, whom we knowe to be yet still
at this day more giuen to prophesyings than any other Nation?
And how being so giuen thereunto and not hauing aught at home
wherewith to satisfie their curiositie, they could in the middest of so
many miseries, hold themselues to the seruing of the one GOD,
who alone of all others did not speake, but alonly had kept silence
to all their requestes? For if it seeme straunge and myraculous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs to haue had Prophesies: much more straunge and myraculous
ought it to bee, to haue made more account of a God that gaue no
answers at all, specially in so many distresses and oppressions; than
of the Gods of the Heathen which did nothing els.</p>
               <p>But forasmuch as none of the men of olde tyme was so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as to deny them,<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> but all were inforced either to woonder at
them, or to alledge causes to diminish the estimation of them, Let
vs examine the reasons which they giue them. One saies that they
were tyed to the Starres, and yet they mocked at the diuinations
of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> euery where. Now then, of so many Astrologers
as were among the Gentiles, and haue made bookes thereof, name
me any one that hath foretold the doings, not of an Empire, but of
some one man: not a hundred yeeres aforehand, but a yeere afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
sauing that the diuell now and then by Gods sufferance, hath
executed the same euill which hee himselfe foretold vpon the partie
that asked counsell of him. But <hi>Ptolomie</hi> wil say, the foretellings
of the Astrologers are a meane betwéene necessitie and chaunce: for
they foresée not the euentes or fallings out, but ouely the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or dispositions of things, &amp; as many as promise any further,
doe but abuse men. What thinke wee then that this <hi>Ptolomie</hi>
would haue sayd, if he had read these prophesies, so particular,<note place="margin">Ptolomie in booke of the fruite.</note> that
they séeme rather stories of things past, than foretellings of things
to come. Surely he would haue sayd that they could not haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
but onely from God, as he setteth downe and deemeth very
wel in letter things: And that they which foretell particular things
must needes be inspired of God: And agein, that the iudgements
of such as gaze vpon the Starres, are doubtfull, howbeit that they
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:13215:240"/>
which foretell the good part, approch neerer the trueth, by reason of
a certeine power that beareth sway in their Soule, although that
otherwile they haue no skill at all in the arte. And in very deede,
the best Astronomers haue reiected Iudiciall Astrologie, as in vain
and without foundation, yea euen after they haue well tyred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in it. But in <hi>Israel</hi> we reade of a Neateheard called <hi>Amos,</hi>
whose Prophesies were no lesse euident for the matters they trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, than were the Prophesies of <hi>Daniell</hi> and <hi>Esay. Auerrhoes</hi>
and his followers haue a peculiar opinion of mans Soule, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we haue a certaine capacitie of vnderstanding, which they
terme an vnderstanding in possibility, the which informeth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
by the working of an vniuersall mynd, which by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
imaginations of euery man, commeth to be ioyned to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in possibilitie that is common to all.<note place="margin">The same thing doth Moises of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon say vppon the booke of Abubacher, &amp; Auempare.</note> And therefore
they say that Prophesying proceedeth properly of that Coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in men that haue a strong and liuely imagination. If it be so, I
would haue the disciples of <hi>Auerrhoes</hi> (who had so goodly an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,)
to imagine this, to shewe mee some Prophesie of their
Maisters or of their owne. Also let them answere mée how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
that our Prophetes for the most part haue commonly bent
old men, seeing that (after their doctrine,) old men cannot Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
by reason of the féeblenes of their imagination? But forasmuch
as these men doe preache vnto vs that the worlde is eternall; how
happeneth it that Prophesying hath not bene instilled into men by
the sayde coniunction, euerlastingly concerning tyme, and in all
tymes, séeing that to become a Prophet, there néedeth no more but
to haue a very strong imagination? forasmuch as the separated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
are euermore readie and disposed to the said Coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
How happeneth it also that a man being come to that point,
Prophesieth not of all things that he can imagine? But hereby we
see manifestly that this Prophesying of theirs is not an habit, but
a passion that fadeth a way like the sound of a Lute, when the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ceasseth to strike. Or if they say that a man must first get him
both the actiue and the contemplatiue habits,<note place="margin">Roger Bacon in his booke of the Sixe sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and in his abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e.</note> and then the said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
matcheth it selfe with our imagination, as the forme
of a thing matcheth with the substance thereof, whereof commeth
it that <hi>Dauid</hi> being a Shepheard and <hi>Amos</hi> a Neteheard, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
so wonderfully? Some will haue it, that Prophesying is
deriued into man by the Starres, conditionally that he be disposed
to receiue it. Herevpon they prescribe him a certeine diet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:13215:240"/>
he must make his body equall and euenly counterpeysed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimie;
and afterward he must gather togither the Beames of the
Skie into a mirrour, which they call Alchemusie, made according
to the Rules of Catoptrik: and finally he must stellifie by Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
as well the man himselfe, as the foode that he vseth. And they
say that <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Thianey</hi> prophesied after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner. These
are Toyes to bee laughed at, rather then worthie to bee answered.
And let euery man consider, whether our Prophetes being She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds,
Neateheards and vnlearned, were framed with such curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
to Prophesie according to diet. Nay when his wittes bee
somewhat well wakened, he shall perceiue that they were inspired
with things which the Starres could neither doe, nor betoken, nor
knowe, forasmuch as they bee still in the hand of the first cause,
and are not come downe so lowe as to bee subiect to the second
causes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Platonists</hi> therfore come somewhat nearer the truth, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Iamblychus</hi> and <hi>Porphyrius</hi> by name. For they say that the
foretelling of things farre of aforehand, cannot be done nother by
art nor by nature, but only by inspiration from God. Howbeit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as they speake of many Gods, and tooke the diuels for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
it may be obiected ageinst vs, that our Prophesies proceeded
eyther from diuells or from Angells. But if we call to mynd the
Oracles of diuells, and compare them with our Prophesies, there
will appeare as much difference betwixt them, as is betweene the
discretion of a wise man, and the tittlecattle of a foole. Therefore
let vs heare what they say. <hi>The Gods</hi> (sayeth <hi>Porphyrius) foretel
naturall things by the order of naturall causes which they
marke; and they foretell things that depend vpon our owne
wil, by coniectures take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our doings. But forasmuch as they
be swifter than we, they preuent vs and outrunne vs, and that
in such sort, that as naturall things are deceyuable, and mens
cases are variable &amp; vncerteyne; so they both, as welthe good
as the bad, bee subiect to lying.</hi> What els is this to say but that
they can foretell nothing of vs furtherfoorth than they learne by our
doings; nor of naturall things furtherforth than they reade them in
nature, that is to say than they reade them as in a booke, howbeit
with a sharper and swifter eysight than we? But nother diuell nor
Angell can reade that in the Starres which is not there: nor in
men, that which men themselues knowe not, specially considering
that the greatest learned men doe hold opinion that they enter not
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:13215:241"/>
so farre. In the Starres they could not reade the names of <hi>Iosias,
Vrias,</hi> or <hi>Cyrus:</hi> niether in the hearts of <hi>Iosias, Vrias;</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi>
themselues, (who were not at that tyme in the world) could they
reade the déedes which they were to do certeine hundred yéeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For only vnto God are those tymes present which are to come;
but as for to Angells and vs there is no more of the roll of tyme
knowen, than it pleaseth God of his gracious goodnes to vnfold
vnto vs. It followeth then by the doctrine of these Philosophers,
that our Prophesies being so cléere, so particular, and so neare to
things a farre of; could not be in spyred from many Gods.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding, all Prophesying (say they) procéeds either
of art, or of nature, or of some Spirit, or of God himselfe. Of arte,
as by Astrologie; of nature, as when mannes nature is ready to
receiue the influences of the vniuersall; and of some Spirit, as by
some league or couenant made with him. But of none of all these
three could the Prophesies of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> procéede, as I haue
shewed euidently afore. It remayneth therefore that those Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
are of God; and consequently that their Scriptures are Gods
woord; which is nothing els but eyther those Prophesies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
or the effects of those Prophesies. And to shut vp this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it will not be amisse to rehearse this record of <hi>Porphyrins,</hi> that
the Religious sect of the Essens among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by reason of
their occupying of themselues in those Prophesies, made a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Prophesying, and seldom tymes missed. For in deede there
is greate lykelyhod, that if we vnderstoode all the Prophesies of the
Byble (which thing is vnpossible for vs bycause we cannot lay the
states of all tymes togither;) wee should find there manie things
which are darke to vs at this day, and yet were cléere, well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
and easie, euen to the verie comon people, euery one in his

to bee made knowne to the whole world; to rid away all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of contryuing them vppon the euents; God did put into the
heart of <hi>Ptolomie Philadelph</hi> King of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> to make a Librarie,
in the which (by the counsell of <hi>Demetrius Phalareus</hi> a Disciple
of <hi>Theophrastus</hi>) it was his will to haue the Byble of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi>

in both the Languages, to translate it. And he sayth that <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius

were the onely writings that were diuine in déede;<note place="margin">Aristaeas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the translation of the Threescore and Ten In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.</note> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the King asked him in his presence, how it happened that he
had not those bookes sooner, seeing hee spared not for any cost, and
that <hi>Iewrie</hi> was so nere hand? Wherevnto <hi>Demetrius</hi> answered,
that they were written in a peculiar language, and therefore that it
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:13215:242"/>
behoued him to write to the Highpriest to haue Interpreters: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which aduice, the King sent Ambassadours with letters
and presents to <hi>Eleazar,</hi> (of which Ambassadours he himselfe was
one): And that by the consent of all the people,<note place="margin">Eusebius in his eight booke of the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Gospell.</note> the threescore and
twelue Interpreters were sent into into <hi>AEgipt.</hi> Yea and in this

the letters that were written from <hi>Demetrius</hi> to <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> from
<hi>Ptolomie</hi> to <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and from <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Ptolomie.</hi> And the said
<hi>Aristaeas</hi> addeth, that when the Byble was once translated &amp; peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the presence of the chiefe Péeres of his Realme, the King
caused a solemne curse to be proclaymed with loude voyce, against
all such as should ad any thing to it, take aught from it, or alter
aught in it. And afterward (sayth hee) when the King vppon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reading therof, did maruel that of so many things and so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of remembrance, there was no mention made by the History<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers
and Poets of <hi>Greece: Demetrius Phalareus</hi> answered
him, that it was a diuine lawe, giuen of God, which ought not to
be touched but with cleane hands, (as <hi>Hecataeus</hi> himself writeth)
affirming moreouer that <hi>Theopompus</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Aristotles</hi>
had done him to vnderstand, that whereas some had gone about to
disguise the Scriptures of the <hi>Iewes</hi> with Gréeke eloquence, they
were striken with amazednesse for their labour, and vppon prayer
made vnto God were warned in a Dreame, that they should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to vnhallow or defile those heauenly matters, with the glosse
of their owne inuentions. Yea and that <hi>Theodotus</hi> a Tragicall
Poet had told him, that because he intended to haue intermingled
some matters of the Scriptures with his Tragedies, that is to
wéet, by drawing grounds of his Poetries out of the Byble, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Here followeth another obiection:<note place="margin">An Obiection concerning the style.</note> Namely that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
haue a simple, bare, and grosse style: but if they were of God,
they would speake farre otherwise.<note place="margin">The Solution.</note> I demaund of them, whither
mens styles ought not to be according to the persones that speake,
and whither the grace of eloquence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist not in obseruing séemely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
as namely whither the eloquence of a Subiect, ought not to
differ from the eloquence of a King; the eloquence of a child, from
the eloquence of a father; and the eloquence of an Aduocate, from
the eloquence of a Iudge; or whether by the Rules of Rhetorick,
that which is eloquence in the one, shall not bee foolishnes in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Therefore if the Lawyer or Aduocate will pleade eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he must moue affections: to the intent he may moue other men,
hee must first mooue himselfe. The Iudge must vtter his wordes
grauely, and he must also be vnflexible and vnintreatable, without
moouing and without affection. The King must simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
commaund; for hee is both the voyce of the Lawe, and the
rule of the Iudge. But if either the King come to perswade, or the
Iudge to debate cases; then must the one put on the state of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate,
and the other the state of a subiect, and lay aside the state of
a King and Iudge. What then I pray you shal become of the law
of God the King of kings, who is infinitely further aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Monarkes, than the greatest Monarkes are aboue their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Subiects; and who excéedeth alyke both the Iudges and the
parties that are to be iudged? We would haue him to vse Induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as <hi>Plato</hi> doth, or Syllogismes as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth, or pretie
sleightes as <hi>Carneades</hi> doth, or outcryes as <hi>Cicero</hi> doth, or fyne
conceites as <hi>Seneca</hi> doth. We would haue him to vtter his words
by weight, that they might fall in iust measure and sound; and to
interlace some farre sought words, some allegoricall matters, and
some strange deuises wherwith comon vse is vnacquainted. If we
should sée a Kings Proclamations set foorth in such a style, which
of vs would not by and by note it as smelling to much of the Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne;
and which of our Eares woulde not rather glowe at it;
than lyke of it? Surely then, the simpler that Gods Lawe is, the
better doth it beséeme the Euerlasting; considering that the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler
it is, the more it resembleth the voyce of him that can doe all
things; yea and (which more is) the simpler it is, the better doth it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:13215:243"/>
fitte all people. For the Lawe that is ordeined for all men without
exception, ought to be as an ordinarie foode, or rather as a common
kynd of bread applyed to the taste and relishe of all men. But what
will you say if the Scriptures haue in their lowlynes more state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
in their simplicitie more profoundnes, in their homelines
more allurance, and in their grossenesse more lyuely force &amp; sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
than are to bee found any where els? Wee reade in the first
chapter of Genesis, <hi>God created heauen and earth; God spake,
and the waters were seuered from the earth; Hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the earth brought foorth herbes.</hi> There is not so very
an idyot or so simple a man, but he can vnderstand these things, I
meane so farre as is requisite to his Saluation, yea and consent at
the very hearing of them, that the things must néedes bee as it is
sayd there. But if a man will wade déeper into the matter, as how
God hath in all eternitie chosen (as ye would say) one insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
to begin this worke, without stuffe or matter to woorke vppon;
and how he made it by his onely bare word: they be such bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
déepes, as will make euen the stoutest afrayed, and enforce the
wysest to stoupe to the skill of the lowly and little ones, so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
is the simplicitie of the Scripture, both to instruct the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to confound the prowd both at once. In our Bible we haue
Histories, and in Histories what desire wee? A trueth: for that is
the very substance of them. Now what greater proofe of trueth can
there be, than simplicitie? A style or maner of indyting that setteth
downe things past before our eyes, as if they were presently in
doing? What greater token would we haue thereof, than (in our
reading) to féele the very same affections which those felt of whom
we reade: Let the hardest hearted men, and the most vntoward in
the world go reade the Histories of our Byble, as how <hi>Isaac</hi> was
led to be sacrifized, how <hi>Ioseph</hi> became knowen agein to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
how <hi>Iephthe</hi> was vexed with the méeting of his daughter,
or how <hi>Dauid</hi> was gréeued at the death of <hi>Absalon:</hi> and (if they
will say the trueth) they shal féele a certeine shuddering in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
a certeine yirning in their heartes, and a certeine tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
all at one instant, farre greater than if all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Oracles of <hi>Rome</hi>
or <hi>Athens,</hi> should preach the same matters whole daies togither.
Let them reade the same stories ageine in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> to whom the
Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> caused an Image to be set vp for the elegancie of
his historie, and they shal find that after his inriching of them with
all the ornaments of Rhetoricke, he shal leaue them more cold and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:13215:244"/>
lesse moued, then he found them. And that is because that in very
deede, true beautie desireth no peynting; but the more naked it is,
the more it allureth; and (as Iewellers and Lapidaries say) the
fayrer that any Precidus Stone is, the lesse doth it néede both of
Gold and of woorkmanship. And soothly to set vp our Scriptures
vpon high words, is nothing els but to set vp a well proportioned
tall man vpon a Scaffold, which diminisheth somewhat of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
proportion, and yet addeth not any whit to his stature.</p>
               <p>Also in our Scriptures we haue Prophesies, and in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
we haue threatenings, exhortations, and vehement spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And it is in such matters, that the Orators are woont to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

but by taking Similitudes from things best knowen? And what
manner of ones were the <hi>Metaphors</hi> of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> but at the

they grew to be more corrupted? And what els are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Similitudes
of <hi>Cicero</hi> himself in his treatyse of old age, but lykenings taken
from husbandrie and Uynes, bycause he himself delyghted in those
things? To be short, when it commeth to the pursewing of a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
euidently, to the setting downe of a Desolation lyuely, too
the reprouing of vyces sharply, or to the promising of deliuerance
brauely: our Prophets do setfoorth euery thing so naturally, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
so forcibly, and so lyuely; as that it appeareth manifestly that
they had the persones, the places, the tymes, and the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
whereof they spake, al present before their eyes: yea and that
maner of indyting is comon to all our Prophets vniuersally. Of
all these things I requyre none other witneses, than our verrie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spysers
of God themselues, whose contempt of our Scriptures,
which they neuer had leysure to reade, entereth for the most part
vnder this colour, that some mayster of arte which neuer red any
more than his <hi>Cicero,</hi> ne can skill to discerne what beséemeth ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
others or himself, hath skorned the things which he hath not the
skill eyther to peyse or to prayse. From such people (say I) sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the contempt of our Scriptures, specially in <hi>Italy;</hi> who being
out of their Schooles are not able to say one woord to the purpose,
no nor scarcely so much as simply to talke. <hi>Politian</hi> (sayth <hi>Viues</hi>)
did altogither despyse the reading of the Scriptures. Therefore
let vs sée what he commended. He spent his whole lyfe in scanning
whether a man should pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>Vergilius</hi> or <hi>Virgilius; Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenses,</hi>
or <hi>Carthaginienses; Primus,</hi> or <hi>Preimus:</hi> and if he had
any further leysure, he spent it in making some gréeke Epigram
in the commendation of Lechery and <hi>Sodomy.</hi> A graue iudgment
soothly for vs to set our mynds vppon. Another called <hi>Domitius
Calderinus,</hi> turned yong men from the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
but what goodly matter tooke he to occupye himself withall?
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:13215:245"/>
Forsoothe he passed his lyfe in making a Comment vpon <hi>Virgills
Priapus,</hi> a booke which all men that haue any péece of manhod in
them are ashamed euen too speake of. But what greater proofe of
the prayse of our Scriptures would wee haue, than that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones
doe despyse them? Contrarywise, <hi>Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> and
Iohn Erle of <hi>Mirandula</hi> the honour of <hi>Italy</hi> and of his age for
skill in all sciences, hauing read all the good authors in the world,
came at length to rest themselues in our Scriptures, and were in
the end out of lyking with al others; but as for these they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue their fill of them. If there were no more but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affirmation
of the one, &amp; the deniall of the other; vnto which of them I pray you
ought we rather to yéeld? Nay, I dare say, and I will mainteine it
among all such as knowe what it is to speake to the purpose, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
as may best beséeme euery man; that our scriptures are
written in such wise, as may most fitly beséeme both God the author
of them, and the matters that they treate of, and the partyes to
whom they be spoken; and that a more séemely style than that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagined, eyther for God; (for he is our Prince; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
not Princes to perswade): or for the matters; for they be
holy and graue, and graue matters (as sayeth <hi>Aristotle</hi>) should
not be peynted: or for the partyes to whom they be spoken; for they
were folk of all sorts without exception; and lyke as all of them
were bound to beléeue and obserue them, so was it behooffull that al
should vnderstand them.</p>
               <p>But now enter they into the matter of them. The Scriptures
<note place="margin">Obiections concerning the vncredible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>(say they) doe tell vs things vnpossible and vncredible, more lyke
the fond fables of Poets, than the reportes of sound Histories. I
would haue them tell mée to whom they be vnpossible, &amp; to whom
they bée vncredible? séeing they father them not but vpon God the
maker of Heauen and Earth, to whom all things are alike easie?
The Poets say that <hi>Iupiter</hi> thundreth aboue, and that <hi>Neptune</hi>
turmoyleth the Seas, and rowleth vp the Earth: and wee knowe
that both <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> were men as we be: and therefore
we say iustly that they report Fables; for they father things vpon
men which are aboue the abilitie of man to doe, and which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
the power of all Creatures. But when things that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to Creatures, are reported of GOD, whose power is
infinite: although men doubt whether they were doone or noe; yet
can they not deny but that hee was able to doe them. And if their
suspecting of them bee because they reade the lyke things in their
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:13215:245"/>
owne Fables; I haue proued already, that these things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
long tyme afore they had either wryters of Histories, Poets,
yea or any writing at all. And therefore they ought to thinke that
their Fables were deuised vpon our Histories, and their Leasings
vpon our truethes. For lyke as a man hath bene afore his portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
good Coyne afore counterfet Coyne, a true Seale afore a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Seale, and a true Copy afore a forgerie: so also was the true
declaration of things afore Fables: according to this rule of the
Philosophers, That euill hath not any being of it selfe, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, ne is properly a substance, but a corruption of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Therefore we beléeue not the Fables of <hi>Homere,</hi> nor the
Inuentions of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> made vpon the battell
of <hi>Troy;</hi> and yet wee deny not but there was a Warre of <hi>Troy.</hi>
As little also doo wee beléeue the <hi>Romanes</hi> which vaunt of the
twelue Péeres of Charles the greate the King of Fraunce; and
yet wee doubt not but there was a greate Charles that did greate
things in his tyme, and had greate store of Noble Parsonages in
his seruice. To be short, had there neuer bene any Dogge, Horse,
Beare, or Lyon in the world; neither Poets had feined, nor Pein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
had peinted vs any <hi>Cerberus, Pegasus,</hi> or <hi>Chymere.</hi> Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
had there not bene a trueth of the things whereon the Poets
made their Fables, we should not haue had at this day any Fables
in the Worlde.<note place="margin">The Creation of the world and of Man.</note> Let vs come to particularities. In all the whole
Scripture there is not a more woonderfull thing, than the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world and of man: And if we admit those two poyntes,
nothing ought to séeme straunge vnto vs in the residew of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For all the miracles which wee wonder at, are but sparkes of
the infinite power which vttered it selfe at that tyme in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of all things. Now I haue proued alreadie both by liuely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and by witnesse of the auncient writers, that the world and al
things therein were created, and that they were created by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will of God, at such tyme as pleased him; and that it cannot bée
otherwise imagined. Uppon this trueth haue the <hi>Phenicians</hi> and
<hi>AEgiptians</hi> fashioned their Fables; saying that in the beginning
there was a darknesse, and a spirituall Ayre, and in an infinite
Chaos; that this spirit couered the Chaos: and that of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of them twayne, was bred a certeine <hi>Moth,</hi> that is to say,
a certeyne slyme, whereof all liuing things were ingendred. It can
not be denyed but that this was a mistaken Copy of the holy and

Concerning the creation of Man, the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> say hee was
created both Male and female. Herevpon <hi>Plato</hi> gathereth that he
was a <hi>Manwoman</hi> or <hi>Herkinalson:</hi> and the Scripture had sayd
that God had created them Male and female. So befalleth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to a Portrayture that is drawen by another. That which is
taken at the lyuely image, loseth a little of his nature. That which
is taken at the Patterne, loseth somewhat more; And so from one

to be no straungenes at all. For séeing that the diuell of himselfe is
not visible to our eyes; must hee not bee faine to put on a borowed

shape than the shape of a Serpent? And if he speake; why should
he not speake as well by the mouth of a Serpent, as of another li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wight? and as well of a liuing wight, as of a thing that hath
no lyfe? Nay further, this creature hath a manifest figure, in that
it trayleth vpon the ground, and liueth of the dust: and in that wée
by our winding away from God to the base and Earthly things,
are brought to the same poynt at this day.</p>
               <p>We reade of the men of the first age,<note place="margin">The ege of the first men.</note> that they liued seuen, eight,
or nine hundred yeres: which thing some thinking to be incredible,
haue imagined that those yéeres were but moneths, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that in the historie of the vniuersall Flud which insewed, the
moneth is set downe to be of eight and twentie daies, and the yéere
to be twelue moneths, and that otherwise wee must be faine to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that they begate Children at lesse than ten yéeres of the sonne.
And yet is that one of the griefes which they conceiue against our
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:13215:246"/>
Scriptures; as who would say it were not as easie vnto GOD to
extende our liues vnto ten thousand of yeeres, as to a hundred, to
God I say who hath made both the life it selfe, and the yéeres, and
the worlds of yeeres. Yet notwithstanding, <hi>Manethon</hi> the <hi>AEgip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Berosus</hi> the <hi>Chaldean, Moschus, Hestiaeus,</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi>
who wrate the Stories of the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> doe confirme the saying
of <hi>Moyses</hi> concerning the first men. Also <hi>Hesiodus, Hecataeus,
Acusilaus, Hellanicus,</hi> and <hi>Ephorus</hi> agree thereunto: affirming
that they were ordeyned to liue so long tyme, as well for to studie
the Sciences, as to inuent the Handycrafts; and specially for the
finding out of Astronomie, because (say they) if they had liued lesse
than sixe hundred yéeres, their obseruations had bene in vayne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the great yere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth so long. To be short, the matter was
so cléere, &amp; so common in all auncient Histories, that <hi>Varro</hi> passeth
it not ouer as a light thing, but laboureth to yéeld a cause thereof.</p>
               <p>For the punishment of Mankynd there flowed a generall Flud.<note place="margin">The generall Flud.</note>
What Nation hath not beléeued it, and what Author hath not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of it? Among the <hi>AEgiptians, Phenicians, Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>
nothing was more common. And because they had heard
that it befell in the primetyme of the world, and were ignorant in
the accounts of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tymes; euery writer of Histories did set it downe
in the tyme which he thought to be of most antiquitie: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the <hi>Thebanes</hi> referred it to the tyme of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyans</hi>
to the time of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> and so forth of others. Moreouer,
in <hi>Brasilie,</hi> in the new <hi>Spayne,</hi> and in the <hi>Florida,</hi> the beléef there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is common, and all of them impute it to mans sinne, and to the
wrath of the highest powred out vpon mankynd. But let vs come
yet to more particular poynts. God commanded <hi>Moyses</hi> to make
an Arke for the sauing of himselfe and his household, and for the
preseruing of the seede of the world there. And he reckoneth vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs all the whole length, breadth and depth thereof: which is a
proofe that he had the trueth it selfe, wherof the residue had but the
fame. Yetnotwithstanding, <hi>Alexander Polyhistor,</hi> and <hi>Abydene</hi>
doe write,<note place="margin">Alexander Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhistor. Abydemus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill in his first booke against Iulian.</note> that <hi>Saturne</hi> foretolde vnto <hi>Xysuthrus</hi> the Flud ere it
came; and that he made him an Arke, to saue all kynd of Cattell
with him: That he preserued his holy writings by ingrauing them
in certeyne pillers at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>AEgipt,</hi> and sayled in his Arke
towards <hi>Armenie:</hi> that after certeyne daies he sent foorth certeyne
Birds, which found no drye ground: that at the end of certeyne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
daies, he sent out certeine other Birds: and that in the end per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:13215:247"/>
drye land, hee came downe out of the Arke in <hi>Armenie,</hi>
where (by their saying) the remnants of the Arke are diligently
kept by the Inhabitants, who helpe themselues with it in many
diseases. And their talking of <hi>Saturne</hi> is according to the maner of
the <hi>Greekes,</hi> who surmised y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Iewes</hi> to haue worshipped <hi>Saturne,</hi>
because they kept holy the seuenth day. And it may bee that <hi>Xy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suthrus</hi>
may in the <hi>Assyrian</hi> tung betoken as much as <hi>Noe,</hi> who
in diuers places had diuers names as wee reade. Neuerthelesse,
this difference serueth vs for a profe, because we see it is not a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
supposall, but a firme tradition from the Father to the Sonne.
The same thing is reported by <hi>Berosus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosephus in his first booke of his antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. chap. 3.</note> not the counterfet <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
but the same <hi>Berosus</hi> whom the auncient writers alledge; and
by <hi>Ierom</hi> the <hi>AEgiptian, Mnaseas</hi> the <hi>Phenician,</hi> and others. Yea
and they ad further, that the place where <hi>Noe</hi> came downe out of
the Arke was called <hi>Saleh Noah,</hi> in Gréeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is
to say <hi>Noes</hi> comming downe; and that it was at a certeine Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
called <hi>Baris</hi> or <hi>Paropanisus,</hi> which (according to their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
at that tyme) seemeth to come al to one.<note place="margin">In his treatise that beastes are capable of reason.</note> Also <hi>Plutarke</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
expressely of the Doue that <hi>Deucalion</hi> sent out of the Arke
to seeke drye land: and <hi>Phauorinus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> speake of the
place where the Arke rested; which cannot be vnderstood of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
flud of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> which doubtlesse was contriued out of the
other vniuersall flud. Now therefore not knowing what to replye
in this behalfe, they picke a quarrell at the measure of the Arke, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magyning
it hard for God to doe that which they themselues can
not doe. But besides that the Arke was a figure of the Church
whereinto all Nations should one day be gathered and saued; <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi>
sheweth to <hi>Celsus</hi> the <hi>Epicure</hi> by the Geometricall Cubit,
that it was of a marueilous greatnesse and capacitie. And <hi>Buteon</hi>
a <hi>Mathematick</hi> declareth expressely in a booke, what it conteyned
foote by foote. To be short, sith we reade that the Flud was vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
considering that that could not be but by Gods appoyntment,
who notwithstanding intended to saue those that were his: the
sight of such a myracle ought to make all the residue credible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
alledging of measures in a power which is without measure.
For wheras some will néedes impute that Flud to a certeine great
Coniunction of Planets which was at that tyme; I send them to
the Earle of <hi>Mirandula,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn Picus Erle of Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula against Astrologers.</note> who not only proueth that there was not
then any great Coniunction at al, but also that although there had
bene one, yet they could not assigne it to the named poynt; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:13215:247"/>
that by their owne rules the Coniunction was such at that
tyme, that it betokened rather an vniuersall burning than an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
drowning of the world.</p>
               <p>At the going away of this Flud, the Scripture telleth vs of a
<hi>Ham</hi> or <hi>Cham</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cham.</note> which discouered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shame of <hi>Noe</hi> his father. The
<hi>Chaldees</hi> say it was <hi>Zoroastres,</hi> who would with his Charmes
haue made him barren. The <hi>Greekes</hi> after them feyned their <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter
Hammon</hi> to haue gelded him. Thus turned they the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
into a fable. Likewise <hi>Iaphet</hi> is none other than the <hi>Iapetus</hi> of
the Poets, who tooke the renewing of the world after the Flud, for
the very first creation thereof. Then followeth consequently the
confusion of the tongues.<note place="margin">The confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tongues or languages.</note> It is a very cléere case that languages
are to no vse, but in respect of the diuersitie of them; insomuch that
if there were no moe but one in all the world, it were méere found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to knowe any moe than that. Therefore like as reason hath
led vs to one first man, so ought it also to leade vs to one first lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
which was but one alone, like as there was but one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with his wife. If the diuersitie of them consisted as now, but
in proprietie of phrases and forme of wordes, it might be sayd that
they had bene altered by processe of tyme. But it is well knowne
that there are many Languages, whose very originall words are
farre diuers and vtterly vnlike one another, sauing in some fewe
words that haue bene brought out of other Countries by Trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and trade of Marchandise, which haue euery where reteyned
still the same names they had in the place from whence they came.
Ye will say then that men inuented them when they conueyed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters
abroade to people other Countries. But what a vanitie
had that bin? What life of man could haue suffised to do it? What
benefite could haue insewed of it, either to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuenters themselues,
or to their followers? Nay, who seeth not that it had bene a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
miserie? not a knowledge, but an ignorance; not a pleasure,
but a hell to posteritie? Certesse, wee say therefore that reason lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs to that which the Scripture sayth; namely, that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
there was but one language: That the diuiding of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
came not of men, but that the diuiding of men came of the
diuision of Languages: and that it was not a deuice of men (who
at that tyme were sufficiently occupyed in the néedfull knowledge
of nature, and in the finding out of profitable Arts and Sciences)
but a punishment cast of God vpon mankynd. Let vs see how the
auncient writers do further these reasons. <hi>The common opinion
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:13215:248"/>
is</hi> (say <hi>Abydenus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alexander Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhistor. Abydenus. Sibylla. Euseb. lib. 9. cap. 4. de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par.</note>) <hi>that men being bred of the
earth, and trusting in their own strength, would needes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of the Gods goe reare a Tower vp to the Sunne, in the
same place where Babylon now is: and that when they had
raised it very high, the Gods ouerthrewe it and cast it downe
vpon their heads with a great wind: and that at that tyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the diuersitie of Languages: wherevpon, the Hebrewes
called that place Babel.</hi> Of these things speaketh <hi>Sibill</hi> also in
her verses in the selfesame termes. And <hi>Hestiaeus</hi> and <hi>Eupolemus</hi>
doe ad, that the Priests which scaped from thence, gate themselues
with the misteries of their <hi>Iupiter</hi> (the same was eyther <hi>Nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brod</hi>
or <hi>Iupiter Bele</hi>) into the Plaine of <hi>Sennaar,</hi> from the which
place men departing by reason of the confusion of tongues, began
to seuer themselues abroade to people the rest of the world. Here it
pleaseth <hi>Iulian</hi> to fall to scoffing. <hi>For</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>a great sort of
such globes as the whole earth is, being heaped one vpon an
other, were not able to reach halfe way to the Sphere of the
Moone.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Genes. 11.</note> But the reason of this enterprise of theirs is euident;
namely that their intent was to haue had a refuge ageinst the
height of the waters, if any flud should come ageine, that is to say,
to make a banke ageinst Gods wrath, which it had bene better for
them to haue pacified by prayer. And this pryde of theirs is not to
be thought so straunge a matter, considering how wee reade in the
Histories of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> that one <hi>Xerxes</hi> sent letters of defyance
to the Sea: and in the Histories of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> that one <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>
vndertooke a quarrell against <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And <hi>Iulian</hi> himselfe
was not a whit wiser, when he would néedes take vpon him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
the kingdom of God, by prohibiting the Christians to reade
Poets. And whereas <hi>Celsus</hi> will néedes beare himselfe on hand,
that the sayd Historie was taken out of the fable of the <hi>Aloides:</hi>
all men know that <hi>Homer</hi> was the first Author of that fable, who
came a long tyme after <hi>Moyses.</hi> And in good sooth, these particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of the confounding of Tongues, of the dispersing of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
of the place where it befell, of the naming of <hi>Phaleg</hi> who
was borne at the very tyme of the diuision, and such other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
doe euidently shewe that <hi>Moyses</hi> speaketh not at rouers:
whereof there is also this further profe, that the Originals of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
according to the diuiding of households at that tyme, are not
read of in any other Author.</p>
               <p>As vayne also is this saying of theirs, that the burning vp of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:13215:248"/>
is taken from the tale of <hi>Phaeton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sodom. Galen in his booke of simples. Pausanias in his Eliaks. Solinus in his Polyhistor. Tacitus in his last booke.</note> which is in déede as farre
from it as Heauen is from the earth. For euen at this day there are
yet still to bee séene the remaynders of Gods wrath, noted by
<hi>Strabo, Galen, Mela,</hi> and others: namely the bitter Lake where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
nothing can liue; the banks thereof lyued with Bitumen; the
Stones stiuking and filthie; the trées bearing fruites fayre to the
eye, but falling to Cinder and smoke in the hand; which things we
reade not of to haue bin séene any where els, and yet in a valley
most beautifull to behold, where stoode at that tyme fiue Cities, or
according to <hi>Strabo</hi> thirteene, which were all consumed with fire
for sinne ageinst nature. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> sayeth that the Image or
piller of salt whereinto <hi>Loths</hi> wyfe was turned, was to be séene
there euen in his dayes. These are the greatest woonders of the
booke of <hi>Genesis.</hi> The residew thereof consisteth in the historie of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and of his Children. As for the Princes of those dayes,
we haue nother Pedegrée nor historie of them among the Heathen

haue spoken of our Shepherds.<note place="margin">Eusebius. li. 9. de praepar. Cap. 4.</note> For <hi>Berosus</hi> sayeth that about a

For he had bin conuersant in <hi>AEgipt,</hi> where the renowme

               <p>Now let vs come to <hi>Moyses. Alexander</hi> sayth that he was the

And that <hi>Moyses</hi> demeaned himself so wisely, that the <hi>Ethy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi>
being ouercome, had him in such estimation, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
Circumcision of him: That at his returne, great counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was made vnto him, howbeit that he perceiuing it to be done
vpon an euill mynd, withdrew himselfe into <hi>Arabie,</hi> where he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the daughter of <hi>Raguel</hi> a King of that Countrie: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
meane time, the King of <hi>AEgipt</hi> that had oppressed the <hi>Iewes</hi> with
so many toyles and (to the intent he might the more safely kill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
had appoynted them a certeyne Liuerie; dyed very suddenly of a
Leaprosie. These things are not reported by <hi>Moyses;</hi> for he wrate
not any thing to the aduauncement of himselfe, but treated altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Gods victories, and not of his owne. But in the selfesame
Author there followeth the calling of <hi>Moyses. This Moyses</hi> (saith
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:13215:250"/>
he) <hi>was occupyed in continuall prayer to God for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the people: And one day as he was earnest in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there issewed a fire out of the earth, where was not any fit
matter to burne, and a voyce tolde him that he should deliuer
the Iewes and bring them into their Countrie. Wherevpon
without raising of any force, he by the counsell of his wiues
father, declared the will of God to the King, who by and by
committed him to prison. But the prisondoores were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto him by myracle, and he went to the Kings bedside,
and summoned him again to obey God. And when the King
had asked him the name of the GOD, Moyses told it him in
his eare, whereat he fell into a swound, but Moyses raised him
vp againe by the hand, and the Priestes that made a scoffe at
it dyed out of hand.</hi> He declareth afterward that the King requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
signes, and that <hi>Moyses</hi> turned his Staffe into a Serpent:
That he smote the riuer of <hi>Nyle</hi> and made it to ouerflowe: That
he strake it againe, and it returned within his bankes: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the Priestes of <hi>Memphis</hi> were commaunded to doe the like
matter vppon paine of their life, and that they by Arte Magicke
brought foorth a Dragon, and chaunged the colour of the riuer: by
meanes whereof the King became so proude, that he hardened his
heart against the <hi>Iewes:</hi> That then <hi>Moyses</hi> smote the earth with
his Rod, and the earth brought foorth first venemous Flyes, next
Frogges, then Grashoppers, and afterward other strange things:
<hi>Wherevpon</hi> (sayth this Historiographer) <hi>there hath growen a
custome of keeping and reuerencing a Rod in their Temples
euer since, because they holde opinion that Isis is the Earth,
which beeing striken with that Rod, brought foorth those
things. In the end there was</hi> (sayth he) <hi>such an Earthquake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
al AEgipt, that the King determined to let that people go.
But in this poynt the Priests disagree. For the Priests of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis
say that Moyses marking the tyde passed the Sea at a low
water. But the Priestes of Heliople say, that the Kings intent
was to pursew the Israelites to recouer the Iewels which they
caryed away with them out of AEgipt, and that Moyses being
warned of God strake the Sea, which gaue place to him and al
his people, and that the AEgiptians were partly destroyed with
thunder and lightening, and partly drowned in the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
When they were passed the Sea, they liued thirtie yeeres
in the wildernesse and were fed with a certeyne Snow, which
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:13215:250"/>
God did rayne downe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from heauen. And this Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
was a man of a tall stature, browne, with long heare on his
head and a long beard, and a countenance full of maiestie; and
when he did all this worke of his, he was fowerscore and nine
yeeres old.</hi> We reade the same things written by <hi>Demetrius</hi> and
<hi>Eupolemus</hi> Gréeke Historiographers, who doe ad many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
moe: and <hi>Manethon</hi> nameth the King <hi>Tethmosis</hi> vnder
whom these things were done. Also <hi>Numenius</hi> the <hi>Pythagorist</hi>
sayth, that he had read the life of <hi>Moyses</hi> in Histories worthie of
credite: and he rehearseth how he was taken out of the water; how
he was brought vp in the Court; that afore he was Circumcised,
he was called <hi>Iehoiachim;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secundum Mystas.</note> howbeit that by report of such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the knowledge of Misteries, he had a secret name in heauen,
to wit <hi>Melchi;</hi> that he wrought great myracles before the King of
<hi>AEgipt;</hi> and that certeyne Magicians called <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Mambres</hi>
would haue done the like: which are things that are not set downe
in our Scriptures, but must néedes be had of them out of the holy
Registers of <hi>AEgipt.</hi> And in very déede, in the Coniurations of the
<hi>AEgiptians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Origines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Celsus lib. 4.</note> they vsed these words to the Deuils, <hi>The God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,
the God of the Hebrewes, the God that drowned the
AEgiptians with their King in the red Sea:</hi> which sheweth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
that the matter was commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly knowen and out of al doubt.
And I remember not any Author that denyeth <hi>Moyses</hi> to haue
conueyed the people of <hi>Israell</hi> out of <hi>AEgipt</hi> with great myracles.
For soothly it had bin a myracle of all myracles, to haue made them
to suffer so many aduersities without myracles. But yet some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
haue attributed those myracles to Magicke, and othersome
to naturall reasons. There is (sayth <hi>Plinie</hi>) a kynd of Magicke,
which dependeth vpon <hi>Moyses</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moysessis My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> and the <hi>Cabale;</hi> but yet had Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke
neuer so great scope (sayth he) as vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> neither was
it euer found to be more feeble and vayne. And in trueth, what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is there betwéene the Illusions of a Magician, which vanish
away in the twinckling of an eye, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leading of a mightie great
Nation through the Sea, and (which more is) the mainteyning of
them from hunger &amp; thirst so long a time? But yet hath the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prouided against this slaunder. For no lawe els in the world
doth so expressely forbid Magick, as doth the lawe of <hi>Moyses:</hi> and
the <hi>Cabale</hi> whereof <hi>Plinie</hi> had heard speake,<note place="margin">In sted of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala, Plinie hath Ioca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela.</note> is further of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such
doings, than eyther Arithmeticke or Grammar. And whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe report, that <hi>Moyses</hi> marked the ebbing of the water that
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:13215:251"/>
he might passe the red Sea: surely they make the counsell of the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians</hi>
very grossewitted, in casting themselues away so rashly.
Nay I say further, that if it had bene so, the waters that drowned
the one people would not haue spared the other. But euery man
knowes that the Gulfe of <hi>Arabie</hi> is not subiect to such tydes as
those are: and though it were, yet cannot the like cauill take place
in all the residue of the myracles that are attributed vnto him. As
vnméete also to bee admitted, is the slaunder of <hi>Iustine</hi> the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer
and others, That <hi>Moyses</hi> was driuen out of <hi>AEgipt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was a Leaper, and that he caryed all the Leapers of the
Realme away with him. For it is a cléere case by record of all aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
writers, that the people whom he caryed away, was a straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in <hi>AEgipt:</hi> and when he himself rehearseth openly the benefites
which that people had receiued at Gods hand, <hi>You knowe</hi> (sayth
he) <hi>that there hath not bene any sicknesse or disease among
you, since the tyme you came out of AEgipt.</hi> And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
part he menaseth them with the Plagues, Byles, and Botches
of <hi>AEgipt,</hi> if they offended God. Insomuch that whereas in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
auncient lawes, there is no mention made of any order for
them that are infected with the Leaprosie: in this Law (as though
GOD had ment to preuent that slaunder) they be separated from
the companie of men, their clothes are to bee layd away, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be scraped, and certeyne other things are to be done; which is
a sufficient proofe, that those which gouerned that people and had
authoritie ouer them, were no Leapers.</p>
               <p>This people then went out of <hi>Egipt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> and the Scripture sayeth
that they were Sixhundred thousand men on foote, besids women
and Children.<note place="margin">The nomber of the children of Israel.</note> Heare ageyn they krye out: They were but three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten when they went into <hi>Egipt;</hi> and how then is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that they should be so manie at their going out? I wilnot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any miraculousnes, though the Scripture declare that that
people increased very greatly; insomuch that it termeth them by
the woord <hi>Frye,</hi> as though it spake of Fisshes. But I beséeche them
to make somewhat a nearer reckening, not with the largest, but
after the ordinarie maner, what nomber myght rise of threescore
and ten persones in fower hundred yeeres or thereabouts, which
was the tyme that they were in <hi>Egipt;</hi> and they shall find their full
nomber afore they come to Twohundred and fiftye yeeres. After
the same maner do we sée that Thréescore households of <hi>Arabians,</hi>
passing into <hi>Affrica</hi> in the tyme of the diuision vnder <hi>Calis,</hi> had
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:13215:251"/>
peopled it throughout in lesse than thréehundred yeeres: insomuch
that euen at this day, the Prouinces beare the names of <hi>Beni
Megher, Beni Guariten, Beni Fensecar</hi> and so foorth; that is too
say the Children of <hi>Megher,</hi> of <hi>Guariten,</hi> and of <hi>Fensecar.</hi> And
there was not that Familie which peopled not some one Shire or
other. Also the West <hi>Indyes</hi> which haue not bin knowen vnto vs
aboue one hundred yeeres, will within one hundred mo be peopled
with Spanyards. To be short, <hi>Viues</hi> saith, he sawe an honest man
in <hi>Spayne,</hi> which had peopled a village of a hundred houses with
the issew of his owne body, so as the names of kinred fayled. And
this present yeere there dyed a noble Ladie in <hi>Germanie,</hi> which
had seene a hundred and threescore Children borne of hirself and
hirs; and yet the one half of hir Children dyed afore they were
maryed; and those that are maryed are of age to haue manie mo.
Their saying therefore bewrayeth a manifest ignorance, lyke as
theirs doth who being ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of progression in Arithemetik, will
easely bargayne for a horse or some other thing, to giue euery day

vs a notable marke thereof in these words.</hi> Al the Country (<hi>saieth
he</hi>) which lyeth from Sidon to Egipt, was in old tyme called
Phenice; and they that wrate the History of the Phenicians,
report that in old time it was all vnder one only King. In these
costes dwelt the Gergesites, Iebusites &amp; other nations, who at
such tyme as they sawe the great army of Iosua comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, remoued into AEgipt. But within a while after, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Country could not beare them, they passed into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frik,
where they buylded many Cities and peopled the whole
Country euen to the Pillers of Hercules, and their language is
half Phenician. Also in Numidy (among other Cities) they
builded Tingit, the seat whereof is very strong, where are two
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:13215:252"/>
Pillers of white stone to be seene nere vnto a greate Fountain,
wherein are grauen these words in the Phenician tongue: we
be those that fled from the Robber Iosua the sonne of Nun.
Such (<hi>sayeth he</hi>) is the original of those Nations, whom we call
at this day Maurusians. <hi>And</hi> Eupolemus <hi>sayeth that</hi> Iosua <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
a hundred and ten yeeres, and placed the Tabernacle in</hi>
Silo. <hi>From thence he leapeth to</hi> Samuel, <hi>&amp; form</hi> Samuel to Saule,
<hi>whom he affirmeth to haue bin anointed at Gods commandment;
and so to</hi> Dauid, <hi>whom (taking the one for the other) he calleth the
sonne of</hi> Cis.</p>
               <p>But betwéene <hi>Iosua</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> we haue the time of the Iudges;
in the storie of whom some haue marked, that the mightie deedes
of <hi>Hercules</hi> are feyned out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doings of <hi>Sampson,</hi> and the vow

and made the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> and the <hi>Phenicians</hi> tributarie to him.
Afterward and Angell called <hi>Nathan</hi> shewed him the place where
the Temple should bee builded, for the which he prepared woorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and rigged foorth Shippes at the Cittie of <hi>Melan</hi> in <hi>Araby.</hi>
and sent them to an Ile of the red sea called <hi>Vrphen,</hi> from whence
he fetched great quantitie of Gold, Copper,<note place="margin">The Scripture of the Prophet.</note> Ceder wood and such
other things. Notwithstanding (saieth hee) the Angell would not
that he should buyld the Temple, because he had bene steined with
blud in the Warres; and so that worke was reserued to <hi>Salomon</hi>
his Sonne, who came to the Crowne at the age of twelue yeeres.

               <p>And whereas they obiect, that wee see no such myracles in our

bene seene since, which haue proceeded from the same power. But
it is enough for me at this tyme to put them in remembrance, that
if true myracles had not bene wrought in the world, we should not
haue had so many false myracles among the Heathen. Nay, I say
more, wee should not haue so much as the very name of Myracle,
which could not haue bene giuen at the first, but to things that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede

               <p>Now remaine the Absurdities which they will néedes finde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they vnderstand not the reason.<note place="margin">Obiections concrneing Absurdities.</note> That law of yours (say they)
stands talking of Beastes, of Pastures, of Oxen that dosse with
their hornes, and of such other things. These are too base things
for the word that procéedeth from GOD. Why say they not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that they were too base things for God to create? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are Lawes made, but for the benefite of man? And although
they might seeme vyle in respect of God; can they denye them to
haue bene profitable in respect of men, at that tyme when men for
the most part liued by grazing? But of these nice fellowes I would
knowe what the Lawes of <hi>Plato</hi> were, and what the Lawes of the
twelue Tables were, at such tyme as the <hi>Romanes</hi> were Tilmen
and Grazyers? or what the Lawes of <hi>Venice</hi> were, when they
were but Fishers? Yet do we reuerence those Lawes for their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie;
insomuch that if wée find but some old fragment of them,
we thinke we haue a Iewell: and the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> being
in their chief glorie, raced not out of their Digests the Lawes that
begin thus, <hi>If Cattell:</hi> nor the <hi>Venetians</hi> their Statutes of Fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing:
nor the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> their ordinances of Hunting and Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
which might in many Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries seeme matters to be laughed
at in our daies, and yet there were euen then which caryed them
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:13215:254"/>
into other Countries, as necessarie to appease strifes in their due
tyme and place. To bee short, as long as <hi>Rome</hi> was champyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
it made Lawes against the harmes of Cattell. But when
it fell once to building, it made Lawes for Gutters, Chanels and
Sinkes. When it began to seeke the ruine of other men, it made
Lawes of Battell, of Warfare, and of the sacking of Cities. And
when it listed to destroye it selfe, it made Lawes of Rebellions,
prescriptions and banishments. All the which were alike behoofull
and necessarie in their tymes: and the first Lawmakers were no
lesse honored than the latter: howbeit that the state of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale
was worse and more corrupted in the latter tyme than
in the other, because that whereas in the former tymes it had to do
but with the repressing of Beasts, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latter tymes it had to deale
with the brydling of men worse than wyld Beastes, or to speake
more truely, men that were become wood beastes themselues.</p>
               <p>They ad, God (say you) created all things: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Moyses</hi> denounceth some beastes to bee cleane and some
vncleane. Whereto may these bee good? They ought to consider,
that oftentimes the things which of themselues are cleane, become
vncleane by the abuse of them, like as the thing that is good and
wholsome by nature, becommeth euill and vnwholsome by excesse
or surfeting. And in that respect hath Wine bin prohibited among
many people, and there are fewe which haue not abhorred some
Beastes or others; after which maner wee see that at <hi>Rome,</hi> such
as had murthered their fathers or their moothers, were put into a
Sacke with an Ape, a Cock, and a Uiper, and cast into the water;
a thing whereof it were vneasie to yéeld a reason. But the sayd law
of <hi>Moyses,</hi> not being vnprofitable, ne tending any higher than this
present life, did not without cause put a difference betwéene brute
things.<note place="margin">Origen ageinst Celsus lib. 4.</note> For if we looke well to it, it denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth al those brute things
vncleane, whereby the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> made their diuinations or tooke
their foretokens, as the Woolfe, the Foxe, the Dragon, the Hare,
the Sparehauke, the Kyte, &amp; so foorth. And that was to make the
people of <hi>Israell</hi> to abhorre the vanities and abhominations of <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt;</hi>
like as if a man would keepe his children from fire, he would
prohibite them euen the Chimney. And because those abuses were
knowen among them; the end and aimingpoynt of that Lawe, was
the redresse of them. And therefore vppon this poynt, I desire our
despisers to suspend their iudgement in the things they vnderstand
not. For as in that tyme no fault was found with this difference
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:13215:255"/>
in the Lawe of <hi>Moyses;</hi> so should no fault be found with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at this day, if wee could set before vs the same tyme againe.
I omit concerning the things that liued vpon pray, that ouer and
besides that men tooke foretokens at them, they had this doctrine
in them without much stepping aside from the letter, that men
should not take away one anothers goodes. And as touching the
Swyne, it is well knowne that for the inuention of Tillage which
hee shewed to the <hi>AEgiptians</hi> by wrooting vp the ground with his
groyne; they worshipped him as a God; in consideration whereof
he was declared to be abhominable: besides the which thing, there
appeared this euident allegorie, that men should not bemyre them
selues in the dirt and dung of this world.</p>
               <p>As for the Sacrifices, I haue touched them heretofore, and will
treat of them more at large hereafter, forasmuchas they did put
men hourely in rememberance of death dew for sinne, and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of a sacrifice to cleanse away the same, namely of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice
of Iesus Christ then to come, which should serue for the clensing of
all mankynd. But admit that God to bring vs to obedience, had
listed to giue vs Lawes whereof we could not conceiue the reason?
What is it more than many Princes and Lawemakers haue done,
as <hi>Plutark</hi> sayeth? Or than we our selues do to our Children and
Seruants? And yet who will think it méete that they should aske
vs a reason why we do so? Surely I desire no more, but that they
which come to our Scriptures, should yeeld at leastwise the like
regarde that they yeeld to <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgill.</hi> If they find in them
any dark sentences; they say they will mark them with crosses and
leaue them too <hi>Grammarians</hi> too martyr themselues withall.
Therefore let them not thinke it straunge, that God hath left such
things in his Scriptures, to humble the mynds of diuines withal.
If in the Poet they meete any Solecismes, that is too say, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities
of speeche; byandby they be elegancies or figures. Let
them consider in the Scriptures also, that the thing which they
think doth disagree at the first sight, wilbee found verie fit of him
that vnderstandeth the figure. To be short if a Poet haue spoken
a woord that seemeth needlesse or without reason; the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayster
turneth it into al sences to find some sence in it: the Scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is out of patience if his Mayster find none: and the Scholler
will rather find fault with his Mayster, and the Mayster with his
owne ignorance, than confesse any imperfection ar ouersight in the
Poet. Now then if in these bookes confirmed with so manie Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

good reason that wee should bee the more diligent and heedfull in
serching them and in turning them into al sences. And if in the end
of all this, we find not wherewith to satisfie vs; let the hearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
his dulnesse of vnderstanding, and the teacher acknowledge
his owne ignorance; and let vs pray God to voutsafe to inlighten
vs with his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now I thinke I haue sufficiently shewed, by the antiquitie, the
style and the matter, by the ende also and by the particularities of
our Scriptures; that they be of God, and that they cannot procéede
from any other than him. By antiquitie; for they bee the first of all
writings, and God hath bin reuealed in them euer since there were
any men. By their style: for they instruct the lowly, and pull downe
the highmynded, speaking with like authoritie to all men. By their
matter: for their onely treating is of Gods doings and of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
of himselfe to men. By the marke whereat they aime:
for they tende not to any other thing than Gods glorie and mans
welfare. And by their singularnesse: for there are things without
number, which cannot bee bred in the mynd eyther of man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell.
The absurdnesse which wee suppose to be there, is but a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
so to our ignorance: and the impossibilitie which to our see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
is in them, is but in comparison of our disabilitie. The truth
of them is witnessed vnto vs in Histories, at leastwise if the case so
stand that Gods word haue neede of mans record. He that is the
Child of God knoweth his fathers voyce: but yet it may be that for
the better confirming of him, my writing hereof shall not bee in
vayne. Who so refuseth that, no man can perswade him thereto:
but yet shall this serue to conuict him; and (by Gods helpe) a great
sort which as yet haue had their eares so dulled with the noyse of
this world, that they haue hetherto but ouerheard it, shall hereafter
incline both their eares and their hearts thereunto. Now I beséech
the almightie who spake the worde and the world was made, to
speake effectually in our daies, and that the world may beléeue him.
And because the marke that beléef shootes at, is the welfare of man:
let vs see what welfare wee finde in this word; which is our third
marke of Religion, and shalbe the matter of the Chapter next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

and vayne. Howbeit forasmuch as
this Doctrine importeth the welfare of
the world, and I haue interlaced many
things by the way, which may dim the remembrance thereof: Let
vs here call ageine to mind how néedfull this marke is in religion.
And soothly it will be one further marke of the heauenlynes of our
Scriptures, if we find that they teache vs the necessitie of that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meane, and also direct vs to it from the beginning foorthon from
tyme to tyme.<note place="margin">The needeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this third marke.</note> We haue read in the booke of Nature, that Man is
immortall: that his happinesse is not here beneath, but in the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
lyfe: that the blessednesse of that endlesse lyfe, is to inioy God
aboue: and that the meane to atteyne thereto, is to serue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him here beneath with all our heart. But the same booke hath
taught vs also, that by sinne we bée falne from our originall: that
we be falne from Gods fauour into his wrath: that we be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed away both from seruing him and from sticking to him:
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently that we be gone a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then for vs, but vtter despayre? And whereto serueth the said
endlesse lyfe, but to be turned into endlesse death? And the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

grief? vnlesse some Boord be left vs at hand to saue vs from
our shipwrecke: I meane vnlesse God doo make vs some way, both
to appease his wrath, and to come ageine into his fauour. In this
extremitie therefore wee méete with Religion, which directeth vs
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:13215:256"/>
to the true God. But what els is that, than a sending of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Iudge? or a laying of Strawe to the fyre? considering
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is infinitely good, that is to say, infinitely contrarie to euill,
and if contrarie to euill, then also vnto vs, whose thoughts, sayings
and dooings are altogether euill. The same Religion hath set vs
downe the Scriptures, wherein wee reade the will of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
But what haue we yet found there? That mankind is corrupt
from his roote, and as it were rotten at his Core: That all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of mans heart are alwayes vtterly euill: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
that God commaundeth vs to loue him with all our
heart, and our neighbour as our selfe; behighting to them that doe
it euerlasting lyfe, and to them that doe it not, euerlasting death.
Which of vs feeleth not a stryuing in all his members ageinst
the will of God? And consequently who is hée that ought not too
feele a very Hell, when he entereth into himselfe and into the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to reade his Arreignement and Condemnation? And so,
what is Religion but vanitie, and what is the Scripture or Gods
word but a harthyting, if wee find not there the Charters of grace
and remission, which reconcyle vs to God, and knit vs ageine vnto
him, and by that vnyting doe restore vs the happynesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
we were created? So falleth it out, that God cannot be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
of his purpose, and that the Religion which hee hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
so déepely in mans heart, cannot be in vayn. Néedes then must
it be, that in the true religion and in the Scriptures we must find
our grace and the meane thereof, which is the third and chief mark
that we séeke.</p>
               <p>Let vs expresse this Doctrine yet playnlier, for it is the very
knot and forme or inshape of all Religion. The happynesse of man
is to be vnited vnto God, and the way to be vnited vnto him, is to
sticke vnto his will. The first man being created free and capable
of good, disobeyed GOD, and by his disobedience became a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaue
to sinne. So was hee farre remoued from God and from his
owne welfare, and (had not grace stepped in) he had bin in extreme
miserie, which we call Hell. Of this Rebell are we all borne, and
his flesh hath begotten vs both fleshly and bondslaues of sinne as
he was. By Nature than we can looke for none other than the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of sinne, which is death; neither can wee haue any other inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
than our Fathers, who hath left vs nothing els to inherit
but damnation. Now let vs see what we our selues haue brought
to this decayed succession. In sted of discharging our Obligation,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:13215:257"/>
we ronne on further in arrerages: and lyking well thereof, we da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
increase our debt. For none of vs al dischargeth himself to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
of the things which he requireth of vs iustly in his Law, and
therefore wee continue still behind hand. Nay, there is none of vs
which offendeth not the Lord infinite waies daily in thought, word
and deede, by meanes whereof we plundge our selues in euer dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and déeper. Now then, though we found not our succession so
decayed; yet doe wee our selues make it such by our excessiue debts
and continuall offences; which in effect is all that wee can bring
thereto. And against whom see wee these offences? Euen against
God, against our father, against our maker; al which is a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating
of our fault: namely, that the Child should rebell against
his father, or that a thing of nothing should turne away from his
creator; yea and (which worse is) take wages of the Deuill to fight
against him. The crime is so out of al measure great, that it cannot
nor ought not to bee inhaunced. But were there no further matter
than this, that forasmuch as God is infinite, the offence is multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
according to the person against whom it is commited: our
offence against GOD cannot but bee infinite, and consequently so
must our punishment be too. Now therfore we poore wretches sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to infinite paynes without number, which by our continuall
misdeedes doe daily multiply the infinitenesse of our punishments
still euen to the vttermost; haue néede of a remedie. And what shall
that remedie be? Gods mercie? Nay, mercie may not be contrarie
to his Iustice. What then? Gods Iustice? No, wee haue neede of
mercie. By what meane may GOD execute his Iustice without
disanulling his mercie; or exercise mercie without preiudice of his
Iustice; so as both of them may be verified, as well that God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
gracious, as that he infinitely hateth all euill, both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
If he shewe mercie absolutely to an infinite offence, where is
his Iustice? Or where is his vniuersall gouernment, whereby he
yéeldeth good to the good and euill to the euill? Yea, and where is
our owne Iustice become, which is but a shadowe of Gods? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if he execute mere Iustice, what shall become of Mankynd
after this life? Or rather, why hath he mainteyned him euer since
his first fal, that his Iustice hath not deuowred vs of al this while,
vs I say in whom is not any thing which burneth not before his
wrath? It remayneth then, that to appease his wrath and to make
way to mercie, which wrath of his is nothing els but a iust intent
to punish, and which mercie of his is likewise but a iust intent to
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:13215:257"/>
forgiue: there must come some satisfaction betwene God and Man,
without the which there would bee (as ye might terme it) an vtter
Emptinesse in the world, whereunto nature it selfe cannot agree.
But what a depth is here yet still, considering that the fault is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and the punishment must be proportionable to the fault, and
the satisfaction likewise to the punishment, that is to say, that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
infinitely infinite is required at our hands? Let man offer
the whole world vnto God; and what offereth he but that which he
hath receiued of GOD, and that which he hath lost by his disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
And sith GOD hath created this world of nothing; how
should a thing of nothing multiply so infinitely, as to satisfie for an
infinite offence? Let Man offer himselfe; what offereth he but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
and disobedience, blasphemie and froward déedes?
That is to say, what shall he els do but prouoke Gods wrath more
and more against him? Nay, let the very Angels step in, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to pacifie the Creator; the thing that is finite in goodnesse to
couer an infinite euill; the indebted in all respects, to discharge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more indebted: and what els will this be, than a couering that
(as the Prophet sayth) doth but halfe couer; and a plaister infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too little for the sore?<note place="margin">One Mediator God &amp; Man.</note> Surely, let vs say therefore that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
must bée fayne to step in betwéene his Iustice and his mercie,
and as he created vs at the first, so to create vs newe againe; and
as he created vs then in his fauour, so to acquit vs now from his
wrath; and as he vttered his wisedome then in creating vs, so to
imploye the same now againe in repayring vs; and soothly so much
the more (if more may bee) because that in our creation nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
the goodnesse of the Creator, whereas in our reparation our
naughtinesse withstandeth him as much as is possible. Out of one
bottomlesse deepe wee goe still into another: but God bee praysed,
they bee the deepes of his grace. Who then (say you) shall bee this
Mediatour, God vnto God, Infinite vnto Infinite, and able both
to discharge the bond, and to asswage the infinite punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Here
let vs bethinke vs againe what hath bene sayd afore in the fifth and
sixth Chapters. I haue declared there, both by reason and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of all antiquitie, that in God there are three persons or Inbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in vnitie of one essence, and that the same are coeternall and
coequall in all respects: The Father as the ground and welspring;
the Sonne, as the euerlasting word and wisedome of the Father;
and the holy Ghost as the bond of kyndnesse and loue, whereby the
Father and the Sonne are linked together: and I pray the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:13215:258"/>
that for the refreshing of his memorie, he will voutsafe to reade
ouer those Chapters againe vpon this poynt. Needes then I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you must one of those three persons step in betwixt Gods
wrath and our infinit Fault. And sith it is so, which of them should
rather doe it than the wisedome, considering that the case standeth
vppon the new creating of vs againe, and that we were created by
the same at the first? or than the Sonne, seeing wée bée to be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that is to say, to bee admitted to an inheritance? Nay moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
it behoued this Mediatour to step in for euer. For inasmuch
as the world was created for man, and man is falne away from
God: neither the world nor man now after his fall, could haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
before God one moment of an hower. Behold, in the maner
of this mediation, there is againe another incomprehensible Miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
howbeit such a one, as when it is once reuealed vnto vs, wee
deeme it vnpossible to haue bene otherwise. We haue God infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iust, and Man infinitely sinfull. The infinite Iustice due to so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
offence, could not bee satisfied, but eyther by infinite punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or by an infinit reparation: and this infinite reparation could
not proceede but from him that is infinite, that is to wit from God
himselfe. It behoueth then that our Mediatour be God, and of his
gracious goodnesse such a one haue we. But this infinite Godhead
is not to recompence our disobedience otherwise than with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
nor our vndesert, otherwise than with desert; not our stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse
otherwise than with lowlynesse: neither againe is he to
purchace vs grace, but by punishment; or life, but by death. And to
the intent he may obey, he must abase himselfe; to deserue, he must
serue; to become lowly, he must stoope downe beneath himselfe; to
suffer, he must become weake; and to dye he must become mortall.
Certesse we say therefore, that it is conuenient and behoofull, that
our Mediatour should be both God and Man. Man, to bee borne
vnder the Lawe; God, to performe the Lawe: Man, to serue; God,
to set free: Man, to humble himselfe to the vttermost; God, to exalt
himselfe aboue all things: Man, to suffer, God to ouercome: Man,
to dye; and God to tryumph ouer death. Nay moreouer, forasmuch
as he submitteth himselfe willingly to such things, for our sakes
say I, and not for his owne: néedes must his obedience become a
discharge for the disobedience; his desert a discharge of the vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
and his lowlinesse a satisfaction for the stubbornnesse of them
that beleeue in him; yea and moreouer, a purchace of obedience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
and lowlynesse vnto them; so that looke what is due to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:13215:258"/>
that is to wit, loue; to his desert, that is to wit, reward; to
his humilitie, that is to wit, honor; to his sorowe, that is to wit,
ioye; to his death, that is to wit, life; and to his victorie, that is to
wit, Tryumph; the same is purchaced and giuen by him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
and made due at Gods hand to all such as honor that great
benefite, and call vpon the father in his name. From this poynt we
may proceede afterward to other conditions and circumstances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in the Mediatour God and Man, seeking him alwaies as
may be most conuenient and agreeable, both to Gods Iustice, &amp; to
the office &amp; dignitie of the Mediatour.<note place="margin">Man borne without Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> It is necessarie for our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare

men, &amp; to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile Mankynd. And if he were not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; then like as
we should haue no part in him nor he in vs: so should he not auayle
vs any whitte, neither in way of satisfaction, nor in way of desert.
Méete it is therfore that he should be borne of our race, and that he
should be flesh of our flesh &amp; bone of our bone, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that as in
<hi>Adam</hi> we be al become bondserua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to sinne; so in him we may be
deliuered and set frée from the reward of sinne, which is death. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine,
forasmuch as he was to ouercome sinne, it behoued him to
bee without sinne; and forasmuch as it was for him to make vs
cleane, it behoued him to be without vncleannesse. For we knowe
that all of vs are conceiued in iniquitie; and borne in vncleannesse
and corruption; and therefore it behoueth him to be such a man, as
is conceiued after an other maner than man is. And this after so
many wonders ought not to be counted a wonder: for he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
woman out of man without helpe of woman, can also deriue
man out of woman without helpe of man. To these particularities
we shall come time enough hereafter, and if suffizeth at this tyme,
that Gods Iustice and mans offence haue euen by humane reason
directed vs to a verie necessitie of a Mediator God and Man, able
to discharge ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euerlasting death ageinst God, and to purchase
him the souerein felicitie of lyfe. And this is it that I meant in the
beginning of the chapter; namely that this marke is so of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
substance and inshape of Religion, that Religion without that,
should be vtterly vnauaylable and vayne. The Heathen séeme to
haue perceyued this necessitie by many examples. They knewe
that man was created to liue for euer,<note place="margin">The opinion of the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning the cleansing of Mankind.</note> and that hee could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
that benefite, but by turning again vnto God. But in this they
fell short, that they considered not that from vs to God the way is
vnpossible to man, if God himself be not our way whereby to come
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:13215:259"/>
thither. It may be that they haue heard, that it behoued a man to
dye for the sinnes of the world. And therevpon the diuell did put in
their heads to sacrifice men, and so to lay the sinnes of a whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or countrie vpon the backe of some one poore wretch. And looke
who was the greatest offender of all others, and whom they had
vowed to the gallowes for the multitude of his misdéedes; him did
they put to the pacifying of Gods wrath towards them. Such are
the accustomed Apish toyes of the Diuell. But how shall he that is
in Gods displeasure, appease his displeasure? And what shall the
worst doo, if the best can doo nothing? The Emperour Iulian could
not tell how to rid his hands of this necessitie in his disputations
ageinst the Christians. By reason whereof, perceiuing that there
must néedes bee a meane betwéene God and man for the cleansing
of mens Soules, hee bare himselfe on hand, that <hi>Esculapius</hi> the
Sonne of <hi>Iupiter</hi> was manifested to the world by the lyuely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring
of the Sonne, and that hee shewed him selfe first in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurus,</hi>
and afterward in diuers other places, to heale mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and to amend their Soules: Which is a proof, that the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie
of the Incarnation of the Sonne of God, which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by some, séemed not to him to be vnpossible, forasmuch as the
Iucarnation of <hi>Esculapius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> God (in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iulian,</hi>) and the sonne of God, seemed to him not onely possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but also come to passe. And in verie déede, why should it seeme
strange that he which hath knit the Soule of man being a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
substance, vnto his body being an earthly; should bee able to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
himselfe vnto man? But I haue shewed afore, that this <hi>Escu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi>
was a man; and that the spirit which abused his name, was
a diuell, and that both of them were wicked creatures. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
who euer beléeued or setfoorth this Fable of <hi>Esculapius,</hi> but
onely <hi>Iulian?</hi> Nay verily, <hi>Porphyrius</hi> hath outgone all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in this behalfe.<note place="margin">Saint Austin concerning the Citie of God. lib. 20. Cap. 9. &amp; 23. &amp; 32.</note> For hauing laid this foundation, That the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
welfare of the Soule is to sée God, That it cannot see hym
vnlesse it be first cleansed from the silth thereof, and therefore that
by Gods prouidence there must be some meane procured to cleanse
mankind: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he commeth to the seeking of it out, he saith, That
the Artes and Sciences doo well cleare our wits in the knowledge
of things, but they cannoth so cleanse vs, that wee may come vnto
God. And wheras many men deceiued themselues in séeking this
cleansing by Magik and Theurgie: he sayd that imagination and
common sence might well bee helped thereby in the perceyuing of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:13215:259"/>
bodily things; but they atteyned not to the purging of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the Soule, neyther could they make a man to see his
GOD or the trueth it selfe. Againe, whereas some Philosophers
sought this clensing in the Misteries of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
that is to say, in communicating (as they surmised) not with
Deuils, but with such as were estéemed to be good Gods, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that there was as small likelyhood thereof in their Misteries,
as in the Misteries of the rest: and moreouer that those things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
but to very fewe men, whereas this clensing ought to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall
to the benefite of all mankind. In the end, hauing reiected
all other clensings; his conclusion is, that the Beginnings onely
and none others, can worke and bee the meane to worke this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Clensing. What he meaneth by the Beginnings, the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi>
can tell well enough: and I haue declared it by many sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of his in my fifth and sixth Chapters; that is to wit, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or proprieties that are in God, whom <hi>Porphyrius</hi> calleth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
the <hi>Father, the vnderstanding of the Father, and the
Soule of the World.</hi> He could not almost haue come any néerer
vs, vnlesse he should haue met iumpe with vs: and surely he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to haue had this of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> from whom he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
himselfe to haue receyued many diuine Oracles concerning
this matter. But it is enough for vs that wee haue gayned these
poynts of him, That there must of necessitie be some meane ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of GOD for the clensing and sauing of mankynd: That none
can worke that Cleannesse, except it bee some one of the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
that is to say, except it hee God himselfe; and that he neuer
met yet with any Sect in all Philosophie that setteth foorth the
meane thereof. Therefore it standeth vs on hand to seeke it; not in
Philosophie, but in our Scriptures. For seeing they bee of God,
and are reuealed for the welfare of Man, they ought to direct vs to
the only meane of the Saluation which we long for. And like as
Religion was bred and borne as soone as Man, as I haue sayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
so must it needes be, that the meane of Saluation was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as soone as Religion, and set foorth in the holy Scriptures from
tyme to tyme. And if we finde it so; it will be an vnfallible testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
both of our Religion, and of our Scriptures together.<note place="margin">The Mediator promised in the Scriptures, from the one end of them to the other.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs then begin with the Creation of man. The Scripture
sayeth that as soone as he was created, God gaue him this Lawe:
<hi>If thou eate of the tree of the skill of good and euill; thou
shalt dye the Death.</hi> That is to say, If thou turne away neuer so
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:13215:260"/>
little from the obeying of me, thou shalt fall into my displeasure,
and from my displeasure into endlesse death. Byandby after, man
is seduced by the Serpent, that is to say by the diuel, and breaketh
the Lawe of his Creator; by meane whereof he is in his displeasure,
and by sinne is become subiect to endlesse damnation. Now seeing
that this man was alone; and that the world was made for him;
what should haue followed but the vtter destruction of the world
out of hand, and the burning of man euerlastingly in Gods wrath?
But see how Gods wisdome stepped in for the sauing of man, and
for the preseruing of his owne woorke; and sinne was no sooner
bred, but the scripture immediatly sheweth vs the remedie thereof.
<hi>I will set emnitie</hi> (sayeth the Lord to the diuell) <hi>betweene thy
seede and the womans seede.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Hir seede shall crush thy head,
and thou shalt byte it by the heele.</hi> That is to say, I will cause
one to be borne of the womans seede, which shall subdew the diuell:
and the diuell shal do his indeuer to trip vp his heeles by tempting
him all maner of wayes; but he shall treade the diuell vnder his
feete, and make him to yeeld vp his weapons, that is to wit, Sinne
and death. Now, who seeth not that to ouercome the diuell, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
him to be God; and that to be borne of a Woman, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him to be man, that is to say both God and man, as I haue
sayd afore?<note place="margin">Christ is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall King, contrary to the opinion of the Iewes of our tyme.</note> Here beginneth our controuersie ageinst the <hi>Iewes</hi> of

whom we vphold to be the Mediator betweene Gods Iustice and

them from bodily oppression; whereunto I haue answered at large
heretofore.<note place="margin">Let the reader beare in mynd once for all, that the word Messias in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe, &amp; the word Christ in Greek, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both one thing, namely the Lords A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted.</note> Howbeit, they cannot denie, but that by the death which
God threateneth to <hi>Adam</hi> for his transgression, <hi>Rabbi Moses Ben
Maimon</hi> vnderstandeth a spirituall death, that is to wit, the death
of the Soule wounded with sinne and forsaken of hir lyfe which is
God: and that by the venoume of the Serpent, he meaneth sinne
it self, <hi>which shall ceasse</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>vnder the Messias;</hi> and that
the same is also the Interpretation of the auncient <hi>Cabalists:</hi> and
lykewyse that the Sinagog of old time vnderstoode the sayd text to
be ment of the Messias, as the Interpretation of the thréescore and
ten Interpreters, and the auncient Translation of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">The Thargu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r of Hierusalem</note>
do giue vs cause to beleeue. <hi>For</hi> (sayeth this Latter expresly)
<hi>so long ô Serpent as the womans Children keepe the Lawe,
they kill thee: and when they ceasse to doo so, thou stingest
them in the Heele, and hast powre to hurt them much. But
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:13215:260"/>
whereas for their harm there is a sure remedy, to heale it, for
thyne there is none. For in the last dayes, they shal crushe thee
al to peeces with their Heeles, by meanes of Christ their King.</hi>
Now if the death bee spirituall, and the enemy spirituall, and his
weapons spiritnall: how can it be denyed that the battell betweene
him and the Messias who is to vanquish him, is lykewise spiritual,
his power spiritual, and his Kingdome spirituall? Moreouer, what
were <hi>Adam, Henoch, Noe,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> benefited by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
if it extend no further than to temporall things? Which of
vs would indure here a thousand miseries, vnder pretence that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
thousands of yeres hence, we should haue an Emperour borne
which should he redouted euerywhere? Now lyke as the scripture
beginneth with the promise of the Messias, that is to say of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer
of our Soules: so doth it shewe euidently, that it aimeth
not at any other mark than that. For leauing the great States of
the world, and the breeding of Kingdomes and Principalities,
which are things whereon Histories stand so curiousely; it leadeth
vs directly too the birth and ofspring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereof the
Messias was to be borne. And vnto the same <hi>Abraham</hi> doth God

                  </gap> is to say, that one should be borne of his seede, by
whom Saluation should be profered to all nations of the Earth?
And age in, that in <hi>Isaac</hi> the seede should be called vnto him: which
thing surely is not spoken of the Posteritie of his Sonne <hi>Ismael,</hi>
notwithstanding that GOD told him that his fleshly posteritie
should be verie florishing. But this preface which the Lord maketh,
shall <hi>I hide any thing from my seruant Abraham &amp;c.</hi> Sheweth
euidently how it is a misterie that passeth al vnderstanding of man,
and whereunto <hi>Abraham</hi> had no lesse ryght than his seede. From
<hi>Abraham</hi> this promise passed by hand to <hi>Isaac,</hi> from <hi>Isaac</hi> to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
and <hi>Iacob</hi> left it by his last will too his children with these

to this text, if his comming should haue bene but to spoyle
them and make hauocke of them. But he was to reigne, yea euen

then shalbe according to the first promise, namely ouer mens

were all of them Memorialles for the people, to put them in mynd

without spot were kept for the sinnes of the Congregation: That

And this later clause is shet vp with this worde <hi>Selah,</hi> which the
Hebrewes are not wont to vse, but in some profound misterie. To
be short, in the thréescore and twelfth Psalme, after he hath sayde.
<hi>All Kings shall worship him, and all Nations shall serue him:</hi>
Hée addeth, <hi>for he shall deliuer the poore that cry vnto hym,
and the distressed that hath no helpe.</hi> Yea and which more is,
<hi>All Nations shall report themselues to be blessed in him, and
they shall also blesse him. Dauid</hi> is full of such sentences, which
shewe that he speaketh of a King, howbeit of another than <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
his owne sonne. For <hi>Salomons</hi> kingdom extended not much
further than his fathers, neither did the Nations méete togither
vnder him; and as for his kingdome, it ended wich his beath, and
within day or twayne after was rent in peeces. And therefore the
auncient Synagog did alwayes vnderstand those texts to be ment
of Christ, who was to be borne of the séede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as we may
perceyue by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> translation, which interpreteth them to
be spoken concerning the same partie. Howbeit sith it is not said in
any of the Psalmes, <hi>Reioyce thou Israel, for thou shalt reigne
ouer the Gentiles;</hi> but, <hi>Reioyceye Gentyles, be glad ye Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Kings, for I will giue you a King:</hi> surely it is euident
that the ioy which he reporteth to be so greate, is not for that they
should haue a Iewe to be their king, for euery Nation had leuer to
haue one of their owne countrie; or for that this King should haue
a souereine Monarke aboue them all to controll them, for euery of
them had leuer to reigne by himselfe alone: but rather because this
King should bee of a farre other nature and qualitie than all other
Kings, namely a King of soules, a deliuerer of men from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of sinne, and a spirituall Monarke. Also the Song of Songs
is an expresse poetrie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceruing the vnion of Christ &amp; his Church,
and hath bene so vnderstoode of the Iewes, as it appeereth by the
<hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase therof which we haue. As for the Prophets,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:13215:263"/>
we find nothing els in them almost line by lyne, but foretellings of
Christ to come, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nature of his Kingdome, of the calling of the
Gentiles, of the stablithing agein of godlynes, and such other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
as wel to put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people then present in remembrance of them,
as to prepare the aftercommers to receiue them. Insomuch that if
the Prophets speake of the returne from Babylon, of the stablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ageine of the kingdome, of the building ageine of the Temple,
and such other things? by and by within two or thrée verses, yee
shal see them caried away to the spirituall kingdome of Christ, and
to the true Temple which is the Church: as though they had ment
to say vnto vs, that we must not rest vpon these temporall things
which are but shadowes; but remember that we be men, that is to
say Soules; and that our welfare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth not in liuing, in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and in reigning heere, but in seruing God that we may be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
vnto him, &amp; ruled by him, howbeit not so as we should reigne
in the world, but that God should reigne in vs by the Scepter of
his word, and by the power of his spirit, and be obeyed of vs. <hi>It
shall come to passe</hi> (sayth <hi>Esay</hi>)<note place="margin">Esay. 1. Micheas.</note> 
                  <hi>that in the latter dayes the hill

and that all Nations shal come flocking to it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
folke shall say, Come, let vs goe vp to the Lords hill, and to

Christ and of his reigne, and of the blessing that was to be shed out
vpon all Nations by him. But let vs reade further. <hi>He will teach

from Hierusalem. He shall iudge among the Heathen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue

&amp; their Speares into Sythes.</hi> Here is no speaking of wars,

were not expounded, some would thereby behight here a triumph.
But <hi>at the same time</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord will wash away the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes
of the daughters of Syon, and clense away the blud of
Hierusalem from the middes thereof, by the spirit of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the spirit of burning.</hi> It is then a glory, yea and a true
glorie, but yet a farre other glorie then the flesh vnderstandeth.

Which of all these things can bee vnderstood otherwise than of a
spirituall kingdome? On the contrary part, let vs see how the same
Prophet speaketh of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the great Emperour, which was to
deliuer <hi>Israell</hi> by the force of armes out of the hands of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees.
I haue taken thee by the right hand</hi> (sayth the Lord) <hi>to
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:13215:264"/>
make Nations subiect vnto thee, and to weaken the reynes of
Kings; to set open the doores vnto thee, and to vnlocke the
gates against thee. I will breake open the gates of brasse, and
burst asunder the barres of yron. I will giue thee the hoorded
treasures, and the things that lye hid in secret places.</hi> What
likenesse is there betweene this maner of speaking and the other,
and consequently betwéene the deliuerances or the deliuerers them
selues? But in the two and fiftie and three and fiftie,<note place="margin">Esay. 52. 53.</note> he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all doubt. <hi>Behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>my seruant shall behaue himself
happely, and be exalted and aduanced very high. As how? He
shall bee despised of men</hi> (sayth the Prophet) <hi>and thrust out of
their companie. A man full of sorowe and heauinesse shall he
bee, and euery bodie shall hide his face from him. He shall bee
wounded for our misdeedes, and smitten for our sinnes. The
chastisement of our peace shal lye vpon him, and by his stripes
shall wee bee healed.</hi> And he sayth afterward, <hi>Although there
was not any vnrightuosnesse in him, yet was it the Lords will
to breake him with sorowe. And because he shall giue his life
for sinne, the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand, and he
shall see the labour of his Soule, and inioy it. For by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he shall make many rightuous, and he shall take their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities
vpon him.</hi> Now this text is interpreted expresly of the
Messias by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast.<note place="margin">In the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud in the treatise intitled Sanhedrin in the Chapter Helec.</note> And in the <hi>Talmud, Rabbi
Iacob</hi> being asked the name of the Messias, sayth he shalbe called
<hi>Leaprous;</hi> and there he bringeth in this text to proue it. By which
reckoning his life should be but languishing and paine, sauing that
he tryumphed ouer the Deuill and Death, and that we vnderstand
it spiritually. To be short, in the fiue and fiftie he is called <hi>the Law
giuer of the Gentiles:</hi>

which he bringeth to the people;</hi> not that he Lordeth it, but that
he is holy; nor that he giueth lawes to other Nations of the earth,
but that he hath the word of GOD in his owne mouth and in the
mouthes of his seede; sauing that in the kingdome of his Christ,
God will giue a better place to straungers then to them.</p>
               <p>As for al the other Prophets, like as they shoote not at any other

to that which we haue sayd heretofore. I will <hi>rayse vp a
braunch vnto Dauid</hi> (sayeth the Lord), <hi>and hee shall reigne as
King, and prosper, and execute Iustice and Iudgment vppon
Earth.</hi> And if ye aske the Prophet what maner of prosperitie this
shalbe: <hi>It is</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>that in his dayes Iuda shalbe safe, and
Israel shal dwell without feare, and the name whereby he shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
called, shalbe the Euerlasting, our Ryghtuousenes;</hi> that is
to say the Iustifier of vs. For (sayeth he) <hi>the Lord hath sayd it.
Dauid shall neuer want a Successor sitting vppon his Throne,
neither shall there euer want a Priest of the Priests the Leuites
to offer sacrifice before me: Neither is it any more possible
for you to breake this couenant; than to breake the couenant
that I haue made with day and nyght.</hi> Now, the <hi>Iewes</hi> cannot
denie, but that euen by the record of their owne Paraphrast, this
text is ment of Christ, and yet notwithstanding, that there hath not
wanted a Successor both to <hi>Dauid</hi> and to <hi>Leuie;</hi> and that both the
Kingdome and the Preesthod are come to an end; and therefore that
he speaketh here of another Kingdome and of another Preesthod:
Likewyse sayeth <hi>Ezechiell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezcehiel. 34. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>I will set a shepherd ouer my flocke,
which shall feede them, namely my Seruant Dauid. I will bee
their God, and he shalbe their Prince among them. I wil enter
into a Couenant of peace with them, and make noysom beasts
to ceasse from the earth. I will rayse them shortly a plant of
Renowne, and they shall no more bee the iestingstock of the
Gentyles.</hi> And if we aske, how? <hi>They shall nomore be defiled</hi>
(sayeth he) <hi>with their Idolles, nor with their abhominations,
nor with their misdeedes: but I will saue them from all their
sinnes, and make them cleane, and they shalbe my people, and
I wil be their God.</hi> And that this text also is ment of the Messias,
the <hi>Iewes</hi> cannot deny. For in their very <hi>Talmud</hi>

Siluer, Brasse, and yron.</hi> But when the Dreame representeth vs
the stone heawen without hand, which stryketh the Images yron
feete and breaketh them apeeces: it is as much as if it had told vs,
that the Kingdom of the Messias shall seeme to be of small stuffe,
without stay and without force of man; and yet that it shall indure
for euer, bycause it is set vp by God. And therefore whereas he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in another place, That all People, Nations and Toongs shal
serue that Kingdome, it is to be vnderstoode of another kynd of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
than the ordinarie. But in his fifth Chapter he sheweth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the same peculiarly consisteth. <hi>It is</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>in bringing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sobedience
to an end, and in sealing vp sinne, to clense away
iniquitie, and to bring ryghtuousnes into the world; to close
vp prophesying and visions, and to anoynt the holy of Holyes.</hi>
Yea and it is so little ment that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> should be the seate of

And this shalbe done</hi> (sayth the Lord) <hi>not by bowe,

he expoundeth himselfe in these words following. <hi>Thou shalt bee

from the waterlesse pit.</hi> Now, that this text is ment of
Christ,<note place="margin">In the treatise Sanhedrin: cap. Halec.</note> it appeareth by <hi>Rabby Samuel</hi> and <hi>Rabby Ioseph</hi> in the
<hi>Talmud.</hi> And <hi>Rabby Selmoh ben Iarchi</hi> (as great an enemy as
he is to vs,) expoundeth it not otherwise. Agein, <hi>In that day</hi> (saith
he) <hi>a Welspring shalbe opened to the house of Dauid, and to
the Inhabiters of Hierusalem, to wash away their sinne and
their filth; &amp; I will roote out the names of the remembrance
of ydols from the earth sayth the Lord of Hostes.</hi> All this is
nothing els but the clearing of men from their sinnes, and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of Sathans reigne. To bee short, <hi>Malachie</hi> telleth vs of
Christ, That he shall bring vs an Attonement betwéene GOD
and vs. And of the Ambassadour whom GOD ment to send
afore him to prepare his wayes, He sayth that hee shall turne the
heartes of the Children to their Fathers, and the heartes of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:13215:266"/>
the Fathers to their children. By the preparation of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
we iudge of the Office of his Maister: namely that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
is properly to reigne in our Soules, seeing his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
prepareth them for him, exhorting vs to turne away from
our sinnes. Now of this long but yet néedefull discourse, wee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two things. The one against the Gentyles, which is, that the
meane of cleansing mankind hath bin promised and preached euen
from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that the same promise is from time to
time brought to our remembrance by our scriptures: to wit that it
is doone by Christ, who was to bée borne of the womans séede by
<hi>Abraham, Iuda, Dauid</hi> and others. The other is against the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
of our tyme, who looke still for a Christ to come: which is, that
the deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce promised by him, is not ment of the tyranny of some
earthly Prince ouer vs; but of the Tyranny which the diuell exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
in our Soules by the vnrighteousnes of sinne, the rewarde
whereof is euerlasting death. The Gentiles of old tyme yéelded
vnto these texts, when they had once imbraced the spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ: and it may be that if we had to doo with the Iewes
of elder tyme, the matter should soone bee dispatched.<note place="margin">The Iewes of old tyme loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall King. Misdrach Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cleansing away of sinne and the heating of the contagious venome
which the Serpent did shed into <hi>Adam,</hi> and by him into the whole
ofspring of man: was to bee wrought by the Messias. Yet for all
this, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forecasts of mans wit, we want not some
euen of the newer sort of Writers, which haue vnderstoode it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the Monarchie which they imagin as oft as there is any speaking
of the calling of the Gentiles. To bee short, the notablest of their
Rabbines are ashamed of the feastings &amp; extraordinarie pastimes,
which the Iewes behight themselues at the comming of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias;

possible.<note place="margin">It is the 13. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef of the Iewes Rabbi Moyses ben Maimon.</note> They hold it for an Article of their faith, both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and by tradition, that there shalbe a Messias. He that denyes
that (say they) denyes the Lawe &amp; the Prophetes, and is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Helfyre. And therefore (say they) he that denyeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Messias, cannot be saued. If he which is to reigne in
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:13215:267"/>
Israell and to giue them prosperitie, bee a temporall King: what
skilles it me greatly whether I knowe him and beleeue in him, or
no? or what ioy can it bee to me, sith I cannot see him? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what a griefe is it to mee that I shal not see him, and what a
peine is it to pyne away in wayting for him? Ageine, what good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is it in GOD to haue foretold vs it: if by beléeuing it we fare
neuer the better, &amp; yet must dye euerlastingly for not beléeuing it?
In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Articles of their faith, they beléeue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only one God. There
is greate reward in beléeuing well. They beleeue a blessed lyfe.
As it is the Soule that beleeueth; so doth the reward redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her. And euen so is it with all other things which are no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of fayth, furtherfoorth than a man hath benefite by beleeuing
them. But as for this Article of the Messias, what booted it <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Moyses,</hi> so many Kings, so many Prophetes, &amp; such a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of people; if there were no further secret in it? Why was it
foretold so carefully by the Prophetes? Why was it so oft repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
no lesse in the prosperitie than in the aduersitie of that people,
and no lesse vnder the good Kings than vnder the Tyrants? Nay,
which more is; why was it more, yea farre more carefully repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to those which were not at the tyme when he should come,
than to those which were to be borne in his time; if the Messias be
not certeinly more than simply a good King, and the prosperitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
maner of prosperitie than any is on earth, and the ioy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
maner a ioy than is conceiued by the sences? And yet for all
that, vnto a Iewe it is an Article of fayth, and of the necessitie of
saluation. We say therfore, that the Messias is not a King of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
delightes, but the King of Saluation and welfare.</p>
               <p>Agein, they beleeue that the Scriptures are of God, and that
they teache them the way to Saluation. Now the ordinarie voyce
of them is ageinst the Pompe, the brauery, and the vanitie of the
world: saying that God will turne them into sorrowe, mourning
and dung. Herewithall, the same Scriptures turne vs away from
all other delights, to talke of that, and from all honor and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the atteynement of that kingdome. Who seeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that this ioy which the Scriptures doe so much commend, is
of another kind, than the ioy which they discommend, and that the
kingdom which they make vs to couet, is to be possessed in heauen
and not on earth? Be glad O Daughter Sion (say the Prophets)

For certeine thousand yeres hence, there shall rise vp a great
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:13215:268"/>
King in Israell. What greater fondnesse can there bee than this?
He shall make a good peace say they: what passe I for that, if I
my selfe be in Warre? He shall open the Prisons: what is that to
mee, if I in the meane whyle doe rotte there? He shall triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
al the Nations in the word. What am I y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better for that, if in
the meane season other Nations trample me vnder their féete, and
leade mee in triumphe ouer all the worlde with my hands bound
behind mee? The father [say they] reioyceth for his Sonnes wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
yet is that but a light and flightfull ioy, and who is hee that
wilbe moued for the afterspring of his children that are long hence
to come? And who would not count him a foole for reioycing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
and much more for beléeuing it? Surely, then doth this ioy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
farther, so as euen the foretellers thereof doe feele it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and are cheered therewith, and the hearers thereof doe
taste of it and finde themselues comforted: and both of them in
their Soules inioy the Fraunchises and Freedomes of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
aforehand, ere the sayde King whom they looke for he borne
into this world. Let vs put the case farther, that they which shall
attend vpon the Messias, shalbe rewarded abundantly with all the
pleasures of this lyfe: what shall become of him in the ende? Hee
shall dye (say they) and his generation with him, and therevppon
they keepe a sore contention how many yeeres hee shall liue. How
farre of is this geere from that which the Prophetes speake of,
concerning a ioy that shall neuer haue end? What if they passe a
hundred yeres in all ioy? what is it but a long feast, which as soone
as a man sleepeth is quite and cleane forgotten? And if ye dye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
what remayneth of it any more? And if ye liue out of the
world, what remayneth thereof but greef? And what reason haue
the Fathers to reioyce so much at that flash of Lightening, which
passeth away in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Soothly much lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a Mariage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feast,
at leastwise which is accompanied with the birth of some
children. In very deede these things are toyes to laugh at, but yet
among the Iewes they bee earnest matters, and they rest vppon
them at this day lyke silly soules as they be, as though there were
none other lyfe for man than this, or as though they should euer
be babes still in this life. But some to shunne this absurditie, haue
falne into another, namely that all they which haue hoped for the
Messias, shal come to lyfe agayne as they were afore, yea and euen
the wicked sort too, that they may burst for spight and sorrowe.
They that be in the glorie of God shall come backe again to see the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:13215:268"/>
glorie of that man. They that are free from this Prison of sinne,
shalbe shut vp againe in it to see this licentiousnes. They that
liue euerlastingly in all felicitie aboue, shall come downe to eate
of fat beastes. What is this but a tittletattle of Children, which
in their conferences can go no higher than Tartes and Iunkets,
nor conceiue any higher pleasures than those? And what els in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is all this, than to ryse from Bed to Boord, and from Boorde to
Bed ageine to sléepe? But if all this must be done in <hi>Palestine,</hi> so
as all that are spoken of afore shall come thither: How will <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
or <hi>Iewrie</hi> suffice to receiue them, or what <hi>Leuiathan</hi>

as they say: what maner a Temple shall there be? And if all men
shall bring their Sacrifices thither, what shall Hierusalem be, but
a continuall slaughterhouse of beastes, and all Iewrie an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

in Hierusalem, but Hierusalem shall be spred out among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles?
And that they shall not come ronning from a farre to the

their heartes, where God shalbe serued and worshipped: And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

That the Christ our Messias pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in the holy Scriptures is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemer
from spiritual bondage. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as I haue proued, that he ought
not to fetch vs out of prison without
Raunsome; nor could pay the Raunsome
being infinite, vnlesse he were God and
Man; Man to suffer, and God to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:13215:269"/>
it followeth that I must shew, that Gods word hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vs that he shalbe such a one: and that shall serue as well against
the Gentyles, as against the Iewes. Now, if wee had none other
proofe thereof than this, that Christes office is to vndoe sinne and
death, and to appease Gods wrath against mankynd, as I haue
sayd; seeing that these things are such as no creature can doe, nor
ought to presume to doe: as oft as we reade that his office is such,
wee must needes conclude that the Messias must needes then bee
God. For (as the <hi>Gymnosophist</hi> of <hi>India</hi> sayd vnto <hi>Alexander</hi>)
he is God in very déede, which doth that which no creature can do.
But the Scripture<note place="margin">That by the Scriptures, Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is both God and Man</note> intending to succour our infirmitie, the elder
the world waxeth, speaketh euer the more manifestly thereof vnto
vs; and surely after such a sort, that the skilfullest among the <hi>Iewes</hi>
of late tyme become most vnskilfull when they goe about to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it. First of all at the making of the promise in <hi>Genesis,</hi> it is
sayd that this seede, that is to say this Christ, shall crush the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head: and this Serpent (as I haue said afore) is the Deuill;
and his venome is sinne:<note place="margin">Gen. 3</note> and by meanes of sinne we be all become
thralles to the Deuill, against whose power we know that no force
of man can doe any thing. It followeth then that this Christ must
haue another nature than mans, yea or than Angels: For the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and the Deuils differ not in power, that is to wit, diuine. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
where the promise is repeated to <hi>Abraham;</hi> of what man
can it be verifyed, <hi>In thy seede shall all Nations be blessed?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 21. ver. 8</note> Or
who can blesse so effectually but only God, who commaundeth his
blessing (sayth he diuers tymes) and then doth it shead it selfe out
vpon vs and our workes. But as the Prophetes doe preach the
Messias vnto vs, so also doe they describe vs his natures and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
so as we neede not any other Commentarie vpon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
than the Prophets themselues. Unto <hi>Dauid</hi> therfore it was
renewed, and in his issew was it to be accomplished. See here how
he speaketh of it in the 45. Psalme.<note place="margin">Psalm. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>My heart</hi> (sayth he) <hi>intendeth

himselfe interpret it:) <hi>Thou art more perfect than the
Children of men.</hi> This might be ment of a man: but let vs reade
further: <hi>O God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>thy Throne is from euerlasting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting,

And therefore God thy God hath annoynted thee
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:13215:269"/>
with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes.</hi> These so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
words cannot bee spoken, (specially among the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>
who were not so lauish of Gods name as other people are) but of
one that is very God and very man both together. In the hundred
and tenth Psalme,<note place="margin">Psalm. 110.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord sayd vnto my Lord</hi> (sayth <hi>Dauid)

thy footstoole.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Thou art a Priest for euer after
the order of Melchisedeck.</hi> To sit at Gods right hand, and to be
a Priest for euer, cannot be attributed to a man. Nay (which more
is) <hi>Dauid</hi> who knewe well that there is but one Lord, calleth him
his Lord. And wee reade that with this selfesame text Christ stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the mouthes of the Pharisies. Now, that the fathers of olde

Insomuch that the <hi>Iewes</hi> Commentarie vpon the second Psalm,<note place="margin">Midrasch The hilim vpon the second Psalm, verse. 7. Esay. 9.</note>
sayth expressely that the Misteries of the Messias are rehearsed in
the hundred and tenth Psalme. And <hi>Esay</hi> in his nineth Chapter
sayth thus: <hi>A Babe is borne vnto vs and a Sonne is giuen vnto
vs, and his kingdome shalbe vpon his shoulder.</hi> Ye see here the
birth of a man. But he sayth further, <hi>His name shalbe called, the
wonderfull, the Counseller, the mightie God, the euerlasting

<hi>Behold, a Virgin shall bee with child and bring forth a Sonne.</hi>

we find by the Scripture, that the same second person is he that
was promised. In <hi>Genesis</hi> the Messias is called <hi>Silo,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be of the stocke of Iuda. Now the woord <hi>Silo</hi> (sayeth
<hi>Kimhi</hi>)<note place="margin">Kimhi in his booke of Rootewordes.</note> signifieth the <hi>Sonne of him,</hi> and is deryued of a woord
which signifieth a womans <hi>Afterbirth</hi> as they terme it, which
thing is not to be passed ouer lyghtly. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

                  <hi>Israell shall be saued by the Euerlasting.</hi> To bée
short, like as we say that the Sonne as in respect of the Father, is
as a Riuer in respect of the Spring, or as Reason is in respect of
the Mynd: so say the <hi>Cabalists</hi> that the light of the Soule of the
Messias,<note place="margin">In the booke intitled the Gate of light. cap. 2.</note> is in respect of the liuing God as Reason is in respect of
the Mynd; and that the liuing God, as in respect of the Messias, is
as a Fountaine or Welspring of liuing water, in respect of the
streame or riuer of life that floweth out of it.</p>
               <p>Now then, we haue in our Scriptures a Mediatour that is both
God and Man. But reason hath led vs to two circumstances moe:
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:13215:273"/>
The one is that this Man must be of our race; and the other is that
he must be borne after another maner than wee bee; the one for our
behoofe,<note place="margin">And of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> the other for his owne dignitie; and therfore let vs enquire
yet further of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> concerning these poynts. As touching
the first poynt, it is euident enough of it selfe, and néedeth no long
proofe. For Christ is promised to come of the seede of <hi>Adam, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac, Iacob, Iuda,</hi> and <hi>Dauid;</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> haue belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it so certeinly, that euen during the tyme of their Captiuitie at
<hi>Babylon,</hi> they chose their <hi>Resch Caluta,</hi> that is to say, the chiefe
Capteyne of their Banished folke, out of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as
from whence they looked for a deliuerer. And as touching the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
poynt, <hi>Behold</hi> (saith <hi>Esay</hi>)<note place="margin">Esay. 11. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>a Virgin shall conceiue &amp; beare
a Sonne, and call his name Emanuell;</hi> which is as much to say,
as that the Messias shalbe the sonne of a Uirgin, and that he shall
bee begotten without fleshly copulation. The late writers of the
Iewes say it is not written <hi>a Virgin or mayden, but a wench or
yoong woman.</hi> I will not vrge them that the Hebrewe word <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
is taken ordinarily for a yoong Mayden or Uirgin, as in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and twentie of <hi>Genesis</hi> where. <hi>Rebecka</hi> is so called; and in
the second of <hi>Exodus</hi> where it is spoken of the Sifter of <hi>Moyses.</hi>
And euen in this place, the thréescore &amp; ten Interpreters translate
it in Gréeke, <hi>idou he Parthenos,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, <hi>Behold a Virgin &amp;c.</hi>
But I would haue them to tell me what the token is that is giuen
here to the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and whether a token ought not to bee
some speciall and notable thing, and whether it bee not a matter of
earnest, sith it is God that giueth it, who sayth expresly, <hi>Aske me
a token, whether it be from beneath or from aboue?</hi> I beséech
them what straunge signe or token is there, in that a yoong woman
beareth a Child? What thing is more ordinarie in the world, and
consequently more fond to bee giuen or taken for a myracle? Nay,
the auncient <hi>Rabbines</hi> haue well waded euen into the depth of
this matter. And therefore <hi>Rabbi Moyses Hadarsan</hi> writing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the 85. Psalme,<note place="margin">R. Moyses Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darsan vpon the 85 psalme.</note> vppon these words, <hi>Trueth shall bud out of
the earth,</hi> sayth thus. <hi>Rabbi Ioden noteth here, how it is not
sayd here, shalbe borne, but shall bud, because the begetting
and birth of the Messias shall not be after the maner of other
worldly creatures, but he shall bee bred without companie or
copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And it is certeine that no man nameth his father,
but he is concealed and kept secret, vntill he himselfe come
and reueale him.</hi> And vpon Genesis,<note place="margin">Vpon the 25. of Genesis.</note> 
                  <hi>You haue sayd</hi> (sayth the
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:13215:274"/>
Lord) <hi>we be fatherlesse: and so shall the Redeemer be whom I
will giue vnto you, according to that which is sayd in the 4. of
Zachary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 4. vers. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Loe, this is the man whose name is Braunch; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this which is sayd in the 110. Psalme;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 110.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art a
Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedech.</hi> Also he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that <hi>Rabbi Berachia</hi> gathereth the like. But <hi>Rabbi Simeon
ben Iohai</hi> sayth yet more expresly vpon <hi>Genesis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> That the spirit
hauing bin shut vp in a [womans] wombe, should come foorth with
great force to bee the highest Prince, which is Messias the King.
And the holy <hi>Rabbine</hi> procéedeth so farre,<note place="margin">Hacadosch.</note> as to seeke out by the
proportion of their <hi>Cabalie,</hi> what should be the name of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litish</hi>
Uirgin that should beare the Messias. There remayne many
other things to bee treated of concerning the tyme, the place, the
life and the death of the Messias, which are reserued for another
place, peraduenture more conuenient for them. Let it suffice vs for
this tyme, That in the Religion of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> there was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
from tyme to tyme euen from the beginning, the Mediatour
betwéene Gods Iustice: and Mans Sinfulnesse, the Sauiour of
mens Soules, and the Author of the selfesame clensing which the
very Heathen themselues déemed to bee so néedfull; namely Iesus
Christ, God and Man, the euerlasting Sonne of GOD, borne of
woman in his due tyme, without sinne, frée from [desert of] Gods
wrath as in respect of himselfe, and able to appease it towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
cleane in his humane nature, and sufficient through his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
nature to cleanse ours. And this is the third marke which I
haue shewed to be so néedfull in Religion, and so peculiar thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that wheresoeuer the same is found, there is Religion, that is
to say, a way to Saluation; and wheresoeuer the same wanteth,
there is no Religion at all.</p>
               <p>Sothen, in the Religion of <hi>Israell</hi> we haue all the three marks
of the true Religion,<note place="margin">The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the three Markes of the true Religion in Israel.</note> namely, the true God, the Lawe of God, and
the Mediator of Saluation. And I beseeche all men to sooke well
about them and to see whether they can find them elsewhere in any
other of the Religions that haue bin of old time. Nay, asfor in them,
in sted of the true God, we shall find diuells, men, and Stocks. In
sted of Gods woord to inlyghten vs to Soulehealth, we shall find
doutfull Oracles and answers of Idolls, vayne, fond, without
ground, without end, which speake not a whit of Gods glorie nor of
mans welfare. Insted of a sufficient Mediator, wee shall find a sort
of wasshings that passe no further than the skin; we shall find man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughters,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:13215:274"/>
and sacrifising of wretched kaytifs condemned for their
misdéedes. But how should there be any religion, where is no God?
Or how should Religion be certeine, where God speaketh not? Or
how should it be a healthful one, where he himself is not the meane
of attonement? Certesse therefore let vs say, that only in <hi>Israell</hi>
was the true Religion; and that <hi>Israell</hi> was as a Schoole or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie
founded by God, wherein he himself voutsafed to teache,
that men myght learne their owne Saluation.</p>
               <p>But behold here is yet one obiection ageinst God.<note place="margin">Obiections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
it (say they,) that this schoole was among this people only?
why was it not in all Nations? Why was it not (at leastwise) in
some other as well as in that? O man, it becommeth man to hold
his peace when God speaketh, and to yeeld to whatsoeuer he will
haue done. Thou art ryghtuous but so farre foorth as thou doest
rightuous deedes: but as for God, it is farre otherwise with him:
for with him, things are not rightuous furtherfoorth than hee doeth
them. Neuerthelesse, I pray thee what canst thou say? That in
<hi>Adam,</hi> God the Creator made all mankynd: and in <hi>Adam</hi> al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
is forlorne. But the wisdom of the Creator stepping in byand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
reuealeth his woord, and vttereth the promise of the mediator to
all men. Here now thou seest no distinction of Nations or people.
Of <hi>Adams</hi> Children, some imbraced the seruice of God and the
promise; and some forsooke it, and regarded i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not. Some (say I)
tooke part with the Diuell; and othersome stacke to the gracious
goodnesse of God. What haste thou too alledge here ageinst the
Rightuousenes of the Creator? After this followeth a general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of mankynd; and God exhorteth them by <hi>Noe</hi> to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
threatening them with his wrath if they did otherwise. Still
they refuse Gods mercy, and for so doing are all drowned by his
Iustice, sauing only <hi>Noe</hi> and his household, who were saued in the
Arke. Now were not all men hitherto onely one people still? And
so; were not Gods woord and the reuealing of himself directed still
to al men? Ageine, ye see that in the Arke al mankind was gatherd
ageine into one Howsehold. At that tyme there was no difference
of circumcysed and vncircumcysed, of <hi>Iew</hi> or Gentyle. Anon they
turned away vnto Idolls and forsooke the Couenant that God had
made with them. Who hath not cause here to honour the patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God in bearing with them, and to woonder, not that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
men to take their owne wayes, but rather that he voutsafed
to reserue any men aliue in the world? Yet notwithstanding, euen
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:13215:275"/>
at that tyme he chose <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the mids of Idolatrie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
himself new ageine vnto him, vttered his secrets vnto him,
deliuered him his promises in pawne, and entered into couenant
with him and his seede. All which things were not doone alonly
for him and his seede, but to blesse all the Nations and kinreds of
the earth in the partye that was to be borne of his seede, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his Couenant with them. Who then seeth not here, both that
the couenant was offered to all Nations, howbeit that all of them
had refused it; and that when God of his infinite mercy renewed it
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he renewed it in effect with all men? Thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
that God should be iust; and yet wouldest thou also continew
still. Were he iust after that maner which thou wouldest haue him
iust, thou hadst bene vndone in <hi>Adam;</hi> thou hadst, bene swept away
with the flud; thou hadst bene destroyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouerflowing of vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlines
&amp; Idolatrie after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flud; thou hadst (say I) bene either vtterly
fordone, or continued forlorne for euer. Thus desirest thou things
both contrarie in themselues, &amp; contrary to thine owne meaning.
And therefore appeale not to Gods iustice, but cry vnto him for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with both thy hands. And yet in thy desiring of this his mercy, or
grace there is yet another error; in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wilt néedes appoint him
the maner &amp; measure thereof; and thou wilt haue him to do it at thy
pleasure: whereas notwithstanding, if he should do it according to
thy deuice, thou wouldest find fault with him for it; &amp; if thou hadst
liked well of it, another man would haue misliked it. But what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
couldest thou haue giuen him for the creating of thée, who as
then wast not? Or what counsell wouldest thou giue him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating
of thée, who art but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worse for that which thou hast alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
Thou wouldest that God should haue reuealed himself alyke
to all men. He did that at the beginning. Well, such Reuelations
tend to a Mediator, and the same Mediator must be God and man:
and to be man it behoueth him to bee borne of some one stocke or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And thou seest that that priuiledge must néedes befall to some
one certeine stocke: for he that is to saue all men cannot be borne of
all men. If thou be a Romane, the gloriousenes of thy Citie will
seeme to deserue it: But yet will <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Niniue</hi> stand in
contention with thee for it, and <hi>Athens</hi> will thinke to be no lesse
regarded for hir learnings sake. How much speedyer way were it
for vs, to cut of this stryfe by yéelding vnto God who sayeth, The
case here standeth not vpon merit, but vpon mercy: and to the intent
al men may perceyue it to be so; I wil haue the welfare of al king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:13215:275"/>
too come of a Hillocke that is hidden in the middest of the
world, in the digging downe whereof they haue taken soo much
peynes &amp; pleasure. And lesse this same Hillok itself should growe
proud, I wil make it to spring, not out of the top, but out of the foote
thereof; nor out of the head Citie, but out of a little village that is
vnregarded. Yea and moreouer, (as we shall see hereafter) where it
springeth vp, there shall it be refused, and straungers shall set it on
fire;<note place="margin">Obiections.</note> insomuch that where the foundations of the Kingdome thereof
are layd, one stone shalnot be left standing vppon another. Let all
the wyse men of the world wey these Circumstances, yea euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their owne wisdome; and seeing that Saluation is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of free fauour, and not a recompence of desert; a thing that
concerneth Gods glorie which is the finall ende of all things, and
not mans vanitie: let them tell mee where the Mediator of mans
Saluation could bee borne, or where the Mysteries of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ought rather too be bestowed, than in <hi>Israell?</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
if we consider still all circumstances; the world shall still
be found vnexcusable. For the first Kingdomes were in <hi>Siria, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siria,
Persia, Arabie</hi> and <hi>Egipt:</hi> vppon the borders of all which
Kingdomes, <hi>Hierusalem</hi> stoode as a Watchtower, for them to looke
at, or as a Lanterne to giue lyght to all those nations round about
it. And as the Empires began to remoue further of, into the Lesser
<hi>Asia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> we see how Gods prouidence did disperse
the <hi>Iewes</hi> and their Sinagogues into them throughout the whole
world as Preachers of the true God, Schooles of his seruice, and
Heraults of the Mediator that was to come, to bring saluation to
all mankynd. Now forasmuch as the ende of Religion is mans
Saluation; and the end of our Scriptures is Christ the Mediator
the bringer thereof: we must hencefoorth see how he hath bin promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from tyme to tyme since the first beginning, and whether hee
haue bin exhibited to the world in the tyme aforelimited vnto him.
And that is the thing which we haue to treate of in the Chapters

(sayth <hi>Iacob) shall not be taken from Iuda, nor the Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
from betweene his feete, vntill Silo come.</hi> This text is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of the Messias, by the <hi>Zohar</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The booke called Zohar. Kimhi vppon Genesis, and in his booke of Rootes.</note> of the <hi>Cabalistes,</hi> and by
the <hi>Talmudistes</hi> in diuers places, by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrases,
and by <hi>Rabbi Dauid Kimhi</hi> himselfe. And the Sence is cléere;
namely that the souereintie and chéef authoritie of gouernement,
should continue in the Trybe of <hi>Iuda</hi> vntill the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ,<note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is cessed Bereschith. Rabba.</note>
as the Onkelos and the Commentarie vpon <hi>Genesis</hi> expound it.
Wherevpon <hi>Rabbi Hama</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hauina</hi> sayth in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,
The sonne of Dauid shall not come, so long as any soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
authoritie be it neuer so small remayneth in Israell:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Talmud in the Chapter Chelek.</note> and
to the confirmation thereof he alledgeth a text out of the eightéenth
Chapter of <hi>Esay.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 18. vers. 5 and 7.</note> Also <hi>Rabbi Mili</hi> alledging <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> the

Chapter of <hi>Esay.</hi> Therefore when they once sawe that the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reintie
and all maner of Iurisdiction ceassed in <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> they
should haue taken it for a sure token, that the Messias was at their
doores. Now therefore let vs see if this alteration be come to passe,
and the very peculiar tyme when it came to passe. <hi>Saule</hi> (say some
of their newe <hi>Rabbines</hi>) was chosen King in <hi>Silo</hi> of the Trybe of
<hi>Beniamin,</hi> and it may be that these things were spoken of hym.
Nay: for it is sayd, <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from Iuda.</hi> And
seeing that the Scepter had not as then bene in <hi>Iuda,</hi> nor was to
come into that trybe, vntill <hi>Dauid</hi> was afterward anointed King:
the Scripture should rather haue sayd, <hi>The Scepter shall not be
in Iuda, vntill it haue bene taken from Silo.</hi> Whereby it appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that the sayd text cannot bee meant of <hi>Saule.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Kings. 12.</note> Others say that
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Nabath</hi> remoued the state of <hi>Ephraim</hi>
from the subiection of <hi>Iuda,</hi> by the Rebellion of the ten Trybes,
and was crowned in <hi>Silo.</hi> Yea say we; but the Scepter remayned
still in <hi>Iuda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sedar Olam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Zura.</note> and the chief Senate in <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and the state of

                  <note place="margin">Origen in his 4. booke of Princes.</note> yea &amp; <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was crowned in <hi>Sichem,</hi>

<hi>Nabuchodonosor.</hi> For (say they) he tooke <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> caried <hi>Iuda</hi>
away to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and destroyed the Temple; and by that meanes
they thinke to shift of the sayd Prophesie. But euen in the time of
the captiuitie, the <hi>Iewes</hi> had a <hi>Reschgaluta,</hi> that is to say a Chéef
or head gouernour of their Captiuitie, whome they chose of the
Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and peculiarly of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as their own
Histories do testifie, wherein they set downe the succession of their
Princes very carefully from <hi>Zorobabell</hi> foorth.<note place="margin">This Hillel was a great Doctor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them out of whose Schoole issewed many greate lerned men in the Lawe.</note> And therefore the

of the Captiuitie; and by the <hi>Lawgiuer,</hi> the Sonnes of <hi>Hillell,</hi>
that is to say the disciples of <hi>Hillel;</hi> of whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two cheefest were
<hi>Ionathas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Vziel</hi> the author of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis

is made in S. <hi>Luke.</hi> To be short, the <hi>Machabies</hi> them selues
who held both the Souereintie and the Priesthod in <hi>Israell,</hi> were
(as they themselues report) of <hi>Iuda</hi> by the Moothers side,<note place="margin">Rabbi Dauid Kimhi vppon Haggeus.</note> and of

togither by alyance) or rather (as othersome report) of <hi>Iuda</hi> by the
Fathers side, and of <hi>Leuy</hi> by the Moothers side. And as for the
<hi>Sanhedrins,</hi> that is to say, the thréescore and ten Iudges, (who in
the opinion of <hi>Rabbi Moyses Hadarsan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rabbi Moyses Haddarsan vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Genesis. chap. 49.</note> were not to ceasse afore
the comming of the Messias) they continued still euen vnder the
captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; vnder the Dominion of <hi>Machabies.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
therefore the Messias could not be come: and besides that,
it were an vtter wresting of the Text, to conuey it any other way
then to the comming of the Messias, against the whole consent of
all <hi>Israell.</hi> But (sayth <hi>Iosephus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosephus in his first booke of the warres of the Iewes. cap. 5. &amp; 25. lib. 15 cap. 9. &amp; 10.</note> the Iewe) after the Warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Aristobulus</hi> and <hi>Hircanus</hi> the last of the <hi>Machabies,</hi> the
<hi>Romanes</hi> being Lords of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> did set vp one <hi>Herod</hi> the sonne
of <hi>Antipater</hi> an <hi>Edomite,</hi> that is to wit a mere Stranger) to bee
King there. Which <hi>Herod</hi> for the easier stablishing of his state,
maried the daughter of <hi>Hircanus</hi> then prisoner in <hi>Parthia.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when hee sawe that <hi>Hircanus</hi> (who onely remayned of the
stocke of the <hi>Machabies,</hi> was returned home; fearing least the
<hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sedar Olam.</note> who bare an affection to hym, should set him vp againe in
the kingdome: he killed both him and his daughter whom he had
taken to wife, and also the Children whom he had begotten of her.
And not contented with that outrage, he rooted out as many of the
house of <hi>Iuda,</hi> as liued in any countenance or credit, defaced their
styles and tytles, and burned their Pedegrees. Also he made High
Priestes whom it pleased him, but not according to the Lawe, nor
according to their Trybes. Finally (as sayth <hi>Phylo</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philo in his booke of Times.</note> the Iewe) hee
slew all the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> that is to wit the Thréescore and twelue
Senators of the house of Iuda, which were assistents to the king,
and did put <hi>Proselites</hi> and Straungers in their place; insomuch
that hauing by his crueltie abolished both the Priesthod and the
Senate, &amp; vttterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded the whole state; he brought to passe,
that at length about the thirtieth yere of his reigne, he was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of all men for King, and ruled all things as he listed himselfe.
This is the time (say I) wherein the Souereintie and Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iuda</hi> did ceasse; and that not lyke an Eclipse for a fewe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
dayes or yeeres, but for a continuall tyme. Insomuch that
from that tyme foorth (which is now aboue fifteene hundred yeres
ago) there hath not risen vp any one man in all the world, beeing a
Iewe borne, that hath any where had any authoritie great or small
among the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Nay further, <hi>Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi>
and diuers other Emperours of Rome, haue indeuered to
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:13215:277"/>
roote out the whole house of <hi>Iuda;</hi> and they of the Trybe of <hi>Iuda</hi>
haue sought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale themselues, and manifestly to corrupt their
owne Pedegrees, to rid themselues from the rigorous inquisition
that was made for them. Insomuch that at this day, there is not a
Iewe (I report mee to themselues whether I say not true) which
can vaunt that he hath his pedegree certein, yea or which can shew
any lykely coniecture that hee is of the Trybe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that is to
say, of the blud Royall of the which Christ was promised. That
which I haue sayd appeareth sufficiently by the present state of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> which haue so long tyme continued, and yet still be without
King, without Gouernour, without Priest, without Iudge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Genealogie, and without certeyne succession. But forasmuch
as they refuse the witnesse of the whole world; let vs heare their
owne. In the 17. Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> where mention is
made of the King, it is sayd thus: <hi>Thou shalt set him ouer thee
to be thy King, whom the Lord thy God shall giue thee from
among thy brethren, and thou shalt not set a straunger ouer
thee.</hi> And the custome was to deliuer the Lawe to the King to
reade therein,<note place="margin">Midrasch vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deuteronomy</note> as is expresly commaunded there. Now (sayth the
Commentarie vpon that place) when <hi>Herods Agrippa</hi> who was
a <hi>Iewe</hi> in Religion, came to the reading of that verse, he fell a wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
Neuerthelesse, all the people bad him be of good courage, and
told him that he was their brother, notwithstanding that he came
of the stocke of a bondwoman. And in another place it is reported,
that at the tyme of this chaunge,<note place="margin">In Bauaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra cap. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutaphim.</note> there was heard a voyce from
heauen saying, <hi>Now shall the seruant prosper without doubt,
which steppeth vp in Israell against his maister:</hi> Whereby <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode</hi>
the great, tooke courage to pretend tytle to the Kingdome:
And that as touching the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> (that is to wit the Senate
of <hi>Israell,) Herode</hi> the great slew them euerychone saue only one
whose name was <hi>Bota,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem in the chap. Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin.</note> who could not create any moe Senators,
because it could not bee done without the laying on of the hands of
moe than one: And that a while afore, the <hi>Romaines</hi> had driuen
them out of the Palace of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and that therevppon they
tooke themselues to Sackcloth and Ashes, and cryed out with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
great sorowe,<note place="margin">Rabbi Asse &amp; Rabbi Raha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo vnto vs, for the Scepter is taken away
from Iuda, and the Lawgiuer from betweene his feete; and yet
for all that, the Sonne of Dauid is not yet come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the foresayd place of the Talmud.</note> Thus ye see
that the tyme of Christes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming fell out in the reigne of <hi>Herode,</hi>
in whom the Kingdome was conueyed to Straungers,<note place="margin">Seder Olam.</note> and the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:13215:278"/>
Iewish Senate was vtterly rooted out, which thing had neuer
happened at any tyme afore.</p>
               <p>Here followeth another marke of his comming. Wee knowe
there had bene in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> two Temples:<note place="margin">The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> the first builded by
<hi>Salomon</hi> &amp; destroyed by <hi>Nabugodonozor;</hi> the second builded by
<hi>Zorobabel</hi> vnder the protection of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> Kings of
<hi>Persia,</hi> and destroyed afterward by the Emperour <hi>Tytus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Haggeus. Cap. 2. vers. 4.</note> Now,
of the second Temple thus speaketh the Prophet <hi>Haggeus</hi> who
was one of the builders therof; <hi>Who is left among you that saw
this house in her first beautie? But what thinke you by it now?
Is it not in your eyes as a thing of nothing?</hi> This doth vs to
vnderstand that the second Temple was nothing comparable to
the first in Maiestie and statelinesse. And in deede wee reade in <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi>
that the good old Fathers which had seene the first, could not
forbeare wéeping when they behild the second. Also the <hi>Rabbines</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rabbi Samuel in the treatyse Sanhedrin. In the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. R. Aha in his booke of Dayes.</note> do report, that there wanted chiefly fiue things in the second which
were in the first: namely, Fire from heauen that consumed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings,
the glorie of God among the Cherubins, the manifest
breathing of the holy Ghost vppon the Prophetes, the presence of
the Arke, and the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim.</hi> And they affirme, that to
the same end it is sayd in <hi>Salomons</hi> Ballet, <hi>Wee haue a little Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Midrasch on the Canticle. Cap. 8. vers. 8. Seder Olam.</note> which they say is meant of the Church vnder the second
Temple, which in outward showe should not match the Church
that was vnder the first Temple. To bee short, the Chronicle of
the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> beginning the Historie of the Church of <hi>Israell</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the second Temple, sayth these wordes: <hi>Hitherto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
haue spoken by the holy Ghost: but henceforth bowe
downe thyne eare, &amp; hearken to the voyce of wise men:</hi> which
is as much to say, as that in all the tyme of this second Temple,
wee see not one Prophet rise vp. Yet notwithstanding, the same
Prophet sayth thus also;<note place="margin">Rab. Selomoh vpon the first of Haggaeus, in the word <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The glorie of the latter house shall be
greater than the glorie of the first.</hi> And therefore he exhorteth
<hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Iosua</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iosedec</hi> and al the people to be
of good cheere. It was méete then that vnder this second Temple,
there should be some peculiar and extraordinary gift giuen of God,
which should excel both the Arke, and the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim,</hi> and
the Prophesying, and whatsoeuer other glorious thing the former
Temple had.</p>
               <p>Some say that of the newe things the stuffe was much richer
than of the former. Admit that the first was of Siluer and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:13215:278"/>
of Gold. What is there herein that can match the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying?
Another sayes, that the fashion and workmanship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was more curious. What is that to the presence of God, who
shewed himselfe so openly in the first? Some (because the text is
flat against them) haue accounted that the second Temple conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
longer than the first by ten yéeres, the second hauing stood fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
hundred and twentie yéeres, whereas the first stood but fower
hundred and ten yéers. What can be more vayne or more cold, or
lesse beseeming, either for God to teach, or for a man that hath any
wit, to heare? I say, for God before whom a thousand yéeres are
but as one day; or for Man, whom one day of aduersitie in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
doth more gréeue, than a thousand yéeres continuance of his
buildings can pleasure him after his death? Moreouer, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not that this second Temple was oftentymes defiled, and
spoyled by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> by <hi>Pompey,</hi> by <hi>Crassus,</hi> and by others?
But the Prophet speaketh shirle enough to them that list to heare.
<hi>As yet</hi> (sayth he) <hi>there remayneth a little tyme sayth the Lord,
and then will I remoue both Heauen and Earth; I wil remoue
all Nations; and they shall come; the desire of all Nations shall
come, and then will I fill this house with glorie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 59.</note> What is this
<hi>desire of all Nations?</hi> We knowe it is Christ, of whom it is sayd
in another place, that he is <hi>the hope of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp; that they
shall bee blessed and happie in him. And the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast
hath transtated here, <hi>the Anoynted.</hi> Also in the <hi>Talmud, Rabbi
Akiba</hi> vnderstandeth that text of Christs comming, howbeit that
he mistake his person.<note place="margin">Malachie. 3. In the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud, in the Treatyse San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin, Chapt. Helec.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> who prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
at the same tyme, expoundeth it in these wordes. <hi>The Lord
whom ye seeke, and the Ambassador of the league which you
desire, shall come incontinently into his Temple.</hi> The very
meaning hereof is, that vnder this second Temple, the Church of
<hi>Israell</hi> shall haue the good fortune to see Christ the Lorde whom
they looked for so long tyme. Now at the same tyme that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Israell</hi> fayled, that is to wit in the reigne of <hi>Herod,</hi> about
a fortie yeres afore the destruction of the Temple,<note place="margin">The Talmud in the Treatise Pirkei auoth: and in the Treatyse Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> the little beautie
that was in it did vtterly ceasse. For the spirit of the great Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
(say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iewes</hi>) which after a sort supplied the want of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes,
came to an ende in <hi>Simeon</hi> surnamed the Rightuous (of
whom mention is made in the first Chapter of Saint <hi>Luke.</hi>) And
then also ceassed all the speciall blessings of the second<note place="margin">Tereph Becal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi.</note> Temple
reckoned vp in the <hi>Talmud.</hi> Yea and God shewed visibly that he
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:13215:279"/>
abhorred them, in that (say they) the ordinarie appearing of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
at the entering in of the Sanctuarie, was turned into an vgly
and blacke Bugge. And whereas aforetymes thirtie men could
scarce open the doore of the Temple; now it opened of it self, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<hi>Rabbi Iohanan Ben Zaccai</hi> one of <hi>Hillels</hi> Disciples was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sore amazed. And in the end, the Temple was so destroyed, that
one stone was not left standing vppon another. And notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> had leaue to buyld it again,<note place="margin">Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. 23.</note> specially vnder the
Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> the deadly enemie of Christians, who of his
owne purse gaue greatly to the building thereof: yet could they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bring it to passe; but (as the very Heathen writers of that tyme
doe witnesse) fires issewed out of the earth, and thick Lightenings
from the Skye, and burnt vp the workmen and beate downe the
workes which they had begun with so extreme pride and so exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
cost. Soothly wee may well say therefore, and hardly can the
Iewes geynsay it, that the second Temple is destroyed long ago,
without hope of recouerie; and that Christ was promised to come
afore the destruction therof. Therfore it must néedes be that Christ
is already come into the world. And that the hope of <hi>Israel</hi> was so,
it appeareth yet further. For vpon the last chapter of <hi>Esay</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 66. vers. 7.</note> where it
is sayd, <hi>Afore her pangs came vpon her, she brought forth a
manchild: Rabbi Moyses Hadarsan</hi> saith, <hi>The Redeemer of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
shal be borne afore the birth of him that shal bring Israel
in bondage.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rabbi Moyses Hadarsan.</note> And <hi>Ionathas</hi> the great Disciple of <hi>Hillell</hi> saith vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the same text, <hi>Israel shall be saued afore her extremitie come, &amp;
the Anoynted shalbe shewed openly afore the throwes of her
Childbirth come.</hi> Also <hi>Rabbi Moyses</hi> of <hi>Tyroll,</hi> and <hi>Bioces,</hi>
both according to this Text and by their owne reckoning vppon
<hi>Daniell,</hi> doe looke for this thing towards the ende of the second
Temple. Likewise the booke which they call <hi>Bereschith Rabba</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bereschith Rabba.</note> maketh this Parable, <hi>As a certeyne Iewe was at plough, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian
passing by heard one of his Oxen lowe: and herevpon
willed him to vnyoke his Oxen, because the destruction of the

repeated the same in another place, saith thus: <hi>What neede we to
learne it of the Arabians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Echa Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathi vpon the lamentation of leremie.</note> 
                  <hi>seeing the text it selfe declareth it?</hi>
Surely I passe not for their Parables, which haue no very good
grace with them, and oftentymes bewray that they wanted wit in
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:13215:279"/>
very déede: but my intent is to gather of them, that it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion among them, that Christ or the Messias should come
into the world a little afore the destruction of the Temple.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare what the Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> sayth to <hi>Daniell:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniels Wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> for
he goes néerest of all to the matter. <hi>Threescore and ten weekes</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>are determined vpon thy people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and vpon thy holy
Citie, to make an end of the disobedience, and to anoynt the
Holy of Holies. Knowe thou therefore and vnderstand, that
from the going foorth of the commaundement for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
againe of Hierusalem, vnto Christ the Prince, there are
seuen weekes, and threescore and two weekes; and then shall
the streates and the broken walles be repayred again in short
tyme. And after threescore &amp; two weekes, Christ shalbe slaine
and nothing shall remaine vnto him. And the people of a
Prince that is to come, shal destroy the Citie and the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
and the end thereof shall be as with an ouerflowing, and it
shall bee digged vp with desolations to the end of the warre.
And he shall stablish his couenant with many in one weeke,
and in the middes of the weeke shal he cause the Sacrifice and
Oblation to ceasse, and for the spreading out of abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he shall lay it waste, &amp;c.</hi> This only one Prophesie is enough
to conuince the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and therefore it behoueth vs to examine it
from poynt to poynt. First, that this text is ment of the Messias, it
is so euident and absolute, that it is a starke shame to denye it. And
so is it applyed by <hi>Rabbi Saadias</hi> vpon <hi>Daniell,</hi> by <hi>Rabbi Nah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
of <hi>Geround,</hi> and by <hi>Rabbi Hadarsan,</hi> who be the notablest
among them. For as for <hi>Rabbi Selomoh,</hi> who vnderstandeth it
of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> or <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> who applyed it to <hi>Nehemias;</hi> or <hi>Rabbi
Leui</hi> the sonne of <hi>Gerson,</hi> who vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it of <hi>Iosua</hi> the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest:
there is not that word in this text, which doth not disprooue
them;<note place="margin">In the treatise Sanhedrin in the Talmud of Hierusalem,</note> besides that the Anoynting which is spoken of here, must
needes be a spirituall anoynting, considering that there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more anoynting at all vnder the second Temple. <hi>There are</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>threescore and ten weekes.</hi> Let vs see what maner of
wéekes they be. The Scripture telleth vs of wéekes of daies, and
of wéekes of yéeres; and examples of them both are in <hi>Leuiticus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leuit. 23. &amp; 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>
and in diuers other places. The wéekes of daies serue for ordinary
matters; and the wéekes of yéeres for matters of great weight and
of long continuance. But <hi>Daniell</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 10.</note> may bee his owne expounder.
For in the next Chapter hee speaketh expresly of mourning three
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:13215:280"/>
weekes of daies; whereas here in a matter of estate, which passeth
with slower steppes and requireth larger measure; he speaketh of
weekes simply without addition. And in very deede <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
could not bee builded agayne in seuen weekes of daies; but it was
to be builded agayne in many weekes of yeeres. After that maner
are they taken by <hi>Rabbi Saadias, Rabbi Moyses,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomoh</hi>
also, vnto whom all the best of them consent: and there is
not any one of them (to my knowledge) which taketh these wéekes
to be wéekes of daies. But as for the yoonger <hi>Rabbines,</hi> whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they bee pressed, they say these weekes conteyne eyther ten
yéeres a péece, or fiftie yeres, yea or a whole hundred yeres a péece;
a thing without reason in this text, and without example in all the
whole Scripture.</p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>from the going forth of the Commaundment
for the building again of Hierusalem to the anoynted Prince,
are seuen weekes and threescore and two weekes.</hi> That is to
say, (as the Prophet himselfe expoundeth it) for the building vp of
the Citie of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and the Temple, <hi>seuen weekes,</hi> which
make nine and fortie yéeres. And from the building againe of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
vnto Christ, <hi>threescore and two weekes,</hi> which make
fower hundred thirtie and fower yéeres; all which together amount
vnto fower hundred fowerscore and three yéeres. And in good sooth,
if wee begin (as the Prophet teacheth vs) to account the wéekes
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day wherein the word was spoken that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> should
be builded againe, that is to wit from the thréescore and tenth yere
of the Captiuitie,<note place="margin">Ieremy. 29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

building againe of the Temple, vnto the tyme of <hi>Herode</hi> King of
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or of <hi>Tyberius</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome:</hi> we shall finde
that in that very tyme were fulfilled the fower hundred fowerscore
and thrée yeres, yea and the very thréescore and tenth weeke wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Christ was to stablish the Couenant of God with men. And it
seemeth that <hi>Daniell</hi> or rather the Angell ment in these thréescore
and ten wéekes, to allude to the thréescore and ten yéeres spoken of
by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie;</hi> as if he should haue sayd, At such tyme as
ye were led away captiue to <hi>Babylon, Ieremie</hi> assured you that
you should bee deliuered from that temporall Captiuitie within
thréescore and ten yéeres, and ye see it is so come to passe. And now
I tell you that within thréescore and ten weekes of yeeres, ye shall
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:13215:280"/>
be deliuered from the spiritual captiuitie, by Gods couenant made
vnto you, whereof the Anoynted shalbe the Mediatour. I am not
ignorant how some writers begin the account of these weekes at
the first yéere of King <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and some at the second yéere of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes;</hi>
&amp; othersome at the twentie yeere of the same <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
because at that tyme there went out another Proclamation in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of <hi>Nehemias,</hi> by reason that the building of the Temple had
bene stayed. But which way soeuer they goe to worke,<note place="margin">2. Esdr. 2.</note> the ende of
these weekes falleth still vpon the tyme of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Tyberius,</hi>
and méeteth iumpe with the prophesies that went afore. And it can
not bee denyed but that they were accomplished according to the
circumstaunces set downe here by the Prophet. For the Prince of
the people that was to come, destroyed the Citie; that is to wit, the
Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> did ouerthrow <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and beate downe
the Temple, and abolish their Sacrificings through the whole
Land of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> and bring vpon them the extreme desolation that
is spoken of here by the Prophet. And therefore some of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi>
being vnable to shift of this text, haue presumed to say that
<hi>Daniell</hi> had sayd well in all the rest, but that he ouershot himselfe
in this account.</p>
               <p>The very traditions<note place="margin">The traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Moyses of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round.</note> of the Iewes themselues doe bring vs to

                  <note place="margin">The Talmud in the treatise Sanhedrin, Chap. Helec, &amp; euerywhere els.</note> is this saying of the schoole of <hi>Elias</hi> so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the first two thousand yeeres ended in the tyme of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the
second about the destruction of the Temple (which thing he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by an account of the tymes) at the ende of which latter twoo

captiuitie.<note place="margin">The Talmud in the treatise Auodazara.</note> Thus farre he agreeth with vs. But he addeth, <hi>for our

text. For in other places it is sayd flatly, that the tyme of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Messias is past now seauen hundred and fortie yeeres
ago, which thing they lament in both their <hi>Talmuds.</hi> And vppon

                  <hi>Rabbi Iosua</hi>

at leastwise if they be worthy [addeth <hi>Rabbi Iosua] In his time,</hi>
[sayth the text] that is to say, euen when they would not, [addeth
<hi>Rabbi Iosua</hi>] which meaning of his he might haue expressed much
more fitly in saying, That Gods grace geinstandeth our sinnes in

               <p>We haue another Tradition vpon the ninth Chapter of <hi>Esay.</hi>

him, <hi>razi li razi li,</hi> that is to say, <hi>I haue a secret:</hi> which by the
consent of them all, concerned the Messias. But some of them passe
further, and say that this cyphred Letter importeth sixe hundred,
that is to wit, sixe hundred yeeres, which are to be reckened from
this Prophesie vnto the Messias. And in very deede, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fourth
yeere of the reigne of <hi>Achas,</hi> at which time the Prophesie was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
we shall find by account that they fall not out long after the
time of <hi>Herod.</hi> Another is read in the <hi>Talmud</hi> in these wordes:
<hi>Rabbi Elias sayth to Rabbi Iehudas brother of Rabbi Sala

come without doubt; but whether in the beginning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
or in the end thereof I cannot tell. Rabbi Asse</hi> is of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the same case. To be short, <hi>R. Moyses Ben Maimon</hi> sayth
in his Epistle to the <hi>Iewes</hi> of <hi>Affricke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">R. Moyses of Geround vpon the fiue bookes of Moyses.</note> that there is an auncient

<pb n="573" facs="tcp:13215:281"/>
by their owne account is expired more than two hundred yeeres
since. Finally after much alteration and vayne expectation to no
purpose, the conclusion of the greatest <hi>Rabbines</hi> commeth to this
poynt, That it is needeles to calculate any more for the comming
of Christ, That all the tymes limited by the Prophetes are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
past, and that there remayneth not any thing els than repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

                  <hi>When the Messias

Is not this a liuely description of the maners of
the Iewes, yea euen of the Pharisies themselues, in the tyme of
<hi>Herod</hi> and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destruction of the Temple? Let vs hearken what

at that time</hi> (sathi he) <hi>a Den and Harbour of Theeues, of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
of Inchaunters, and of Seducers of the people. And
doubtlesse God was offended at their extreme vngodlinesse;
insomuch that he abhorred both Hierusalem &amp; the Temple,
and brought in the Romaines thither to purge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were
with fire. Yea, and I beleeue</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that if the Romanes had
staied neuer so little to come to destroy them; either the earth
would haue swallowed them vp, or some great waterflud must
haue drowned them, or els they had bin burned vp as Sodom
was. For that generation was much worse than euer Sodom
was.</hi> Thus then aswell the writings as also the notablest Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the auncient <hi>Iewes,</hi> doe poynt vs to the tyme of <hi>Herod.</hi>
And truely, <hi>Tacitus, Suetonius,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Hegesippus. lib. 3.</note>
And it appeareth by the whole Historie of that age, that
all the people, yea and <hi>Herod</hi> himselfe had their eyes and eares e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
open wayting and watching for the Messias, the one to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him and the other to destroye him. For as in all the former
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:13215:282"/>
tymes, wee reade not that any man tooke vpon him to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,<note place="margin">False Christes in that age.</note>
&amp; much lesse that any was receiued as he: so in this age there
scarsly passed any one yéere, but some one or other stepped vp to be
he, verely because that (to their seeming) they had the disposition of
the people, and the very tyme it self answerable to their intent. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
therefore who perceiued himselfe to haue bene but newly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed
King by the <hi>Romaines,</hi> fearing to bee dispossessed of his
Crowne, did what he could to destroye the blud royall of <hi>Iuda,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
their Genealogies, and not sparing euen his owne sonnes.
Yea and there stepped vp certeine Courtyerrabbins, which would
néedes make the world beléeue that <hi>Herod</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promised Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,
whereof some will haue the <hi>Herodians</hi> to procéede which are
spoken of in the Gospell. And this sect was greatly furthered by
the opinion of the fleshly sort, which by the Messias looked for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of their State; that is to wit, of Uineyards, of gorgeous
buildings, of precious Stones, and of all things sauing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Also about the same tyme stepped vp one <hi>Iudas</hi> a <hi>Gawlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi>
who called the people to libertie, and mainteyned with some
assistence of the Pharasies, that they ought not to pay tribute to
the Emperour.<note place="margin">Iosephus in his Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. lib. 18. cap. 1. &amp; 2. &amp;. lib. 17. cap. 8. lib. 20. chp. 2. &amp; 6.</note> So also did another <hi>Iudas</hi> the sonne of one <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi>
a Capteyne of Cutthrotes, and a certeyne Shepheard na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Athrouges,</hi> whose pretence was no lesse than to bee Kings,
and to deliuer their followers from the yoke of bondage. Likewise
vnder the gouernement of <hi>Faelix,</hi> and in the reigne of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a
certeyne <hi>AEgiptian</hi> taking vpon him to be a Prophet, led certeyne
people vp to Mount Oliuet, and made them beléeue that from
thence they should see the walles of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> fall downe, and
then they should goe in thither. Againe, vnder the President <hi>Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius
Fadus,</hi> one <hi>Thewdas</hi> vndertooke the like enterprise. Al which
are signes that they tooke aduauntage of the tyme, and abused the
hope of the people to the maintenance of their owne ambition. But
(which more is) we reade in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

by the former,<note place="margin">Talmud in the treatise Col. Israel.</note> (so greatly were they perswaded of the tyme) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this man neuerthelesse, and made him also to be receiued of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
applying vnto him this text of the booke of Nombers, <hi>A
Starre shall come out of Iacob,</hi> because the Hebrewe word <hi>Cocab</hi>
signifieth a Starre; and saying that in stead of <hi>Cocab</hi> it ought to be
written <hi>Cozab</hi> or <hi>Cozba,</hi> which was his name. And this is written
by their owne Histories, and confirmed afterward by ours, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the very Heathen writers which wrate the life of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Adrian.</hi> Yet for all this, they were still the more wasted, and
caryed away into <hi>Spayne,</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was peopled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And as many as went about afterward to abuse the <hi>Iewes</hi>
vnder that pretence, (as one did not long since in <hi>Italie</hi>) were by

Let vs adde yet further, that since that tyme (which is now aboue
fiftéene hundred yéeres agoe) they neuer had any Prophetes, any
comfort from GOD, any extraordinarie gifts, no nor any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their Tribes: which is a most euident token, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
which amed chiefly at Christ, are fulfilled, and that in him
the Church is comforted and indewed with the giftes which it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for; and to bee short, that he for whose sake the pedegrees were
to be kept certeyne, is not now to be borne. And therefore wee see
how some of them doe say with <hi>Rabbi Hillel, That the daies of
Ezechias haue swallowed vp the Messias;</hi> that is to say, that he
is not to bee looked for any more; and that folke haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnworthie of him: and that some others through extremitie
of despayre, do pronounce them accursed which determine any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
tyme of the comming of the Messias.</p>
               <p>Thus then we see now that the holy Scripture and the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

If thou turne thee ageine ô Israell: seeing it is a conditionall

then by this Text, I heard the man that was clothed in linnen
and stood vppon the Water of the Riuer, and he lifted vp his
right hand and his left hand vp to Heauen, and sware by him
that liueth for euer, and it shalbe for a tyme and tymes, and
halfe a tyme?</hi> And the <hi>Talmud</hi> sayth that at this tert <hi>R. Eliezer</hi>
was blankt and held his peace, which was as much to say as that
he condescended to that which <hi>R. Iosua</hi> had sayd, namely that the
offences of <hi>Israell</hi> should not stay the comming of Christ, but that
God would preuent <hi>Israell</hi> with his holy grace. Agein, if the want
of a generall Conuersion do withhold the comming of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;
then considering that the punishment which lyeth vppon that
Nation is vniuersall, and their banishment of so long continuance
and so farre from whome, In so much that their Temple, Cittie &amp;
Countrie be destroyed, and they may not so much as once sée them

and so continuall among them? I meane what is the fault
peculiar to that Nation, and not common to them with all other
Nations of the world? The first Temple (say they) was destroyed
for Idolatrie, for superfluitie, and for sheading of giltlesse blud,
and specially the blud of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Esay.</hi> Yet notwithstanding
they wanted not Prophetes in the time of their Captiuitie; nay
they neuer had mo than then; so mercifully did God measure his

                  </gap>at now in so many hundred yeres they haue not

Lawe; and in effect lesse giuen to Royot and lesse bluddy than
euer they were? Nay further, séeing that vnder the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they shewed so great zeale against the <hi>Romaines,</hi> that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
not any Idolatrie among them, but chose rather to dye a

or the Romayne Standard peinted with an Eagle; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they left the breache of the wall of the Citie vngarded,
rather than they would breake their Sabboth day: What might
be the cause that God should withold the open manifestation of the
Messias, whom they affirme to haue bene borne at that tyme, or
multiply their miseries so extreemely? Some say it was for their
worshipping of the Golden Calfe in the Wildernes, that is to say
for a fault that was committed a two or thrée thousand yeres ago,
when as (notwithstanding) the people were then presently puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for it out of hand, and many recoueries and ouerthrowes had
ensewed since in the meane whyle. Others say it is for the selling
of <hi>Ioseph</hi> by his brethren; and therevpon some of them bring vp
againe the fleeting of Soules fathered vpon <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Why
doe they not rather acknowledge herein their owne colde absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?<note place="margin">The booke Mechilta.</note>
nay (sayes one of their bookes) it is for a fault which they
knowe not, and therefore it is not foretold them when they shalbe
deliuered, as it was to the Captiues of <hi>Babylon.</hi> If they knowe
not the fault, then can they not acknowledge it; and if they cannot
acknowledge it, in vayne are all their Penances and Repentance.
And yet in very deede they haue from tyme to tyme (and that not
long ago) done publick and open penances, much more exactly to
outward apparance, than euer they did; of purpose to hasten their
Messias, who notwithstanding (by the report of their <hi>Talmud</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Talmud in the treatise Sanhedrin. Ch. Helec.</note>) is
so néere and ready at hand, that (by their saying) he wilnot stay one
day, if they turne vnto God according to this saying of the psalm.<note place="margin">Psalm. 90.</note>
                  <hi>Tooday if yee heare my voyce.</hi> But wee say, that forasmuch as
their punishment is so vniuersall, so long, and so extreme; their

they not rather that he was the sonne of <hi>Ioseph;</hi> but that <hi>Ioseph</hi>

so many Pharisies, and so many Iudges inraged ageinst one sily
woman,<note place="margin">Suidas vpon the word Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</note> and yet not daring to charge her with any cryme? But
the talke of one <hi>Theodosius</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> with a Christen Merchantman
named <hi>Philip</hi> in the time of the Emperour <hi>Iustinian,</hi> is worthy to
be noted in this behalf. <hi>In the Temple</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (ꝙ the <hi>Iew</hi>)
<hi>there were two and twenty ordinary Preestes; and as soone as
any of them dyed, the residew chose another in his place.
Now it happened that Iesus for his singular Godlynes and
doctrine was chosen by them. And to the intent they myght
knowe the name of his father and moother, and inregister it
according to their custome; they sent for them, &amp; Mary came
thither alone, bycause Ioseph was then dead. She being asked
the name of the father of Iesus, answered vppon hir othe that
she had conceyued him by the Holy Ghoste, and reported to
them the woords of the Angell. Moreouer she told them the
names of the women that came to hir labour vnlooked for;
vppon dew inquisition whereof, when all things were found
to fall out true, they registred his name in the Register of the
Priestes in these words. IESVS THE SONNE OF THE
LIVING GOD AND OF THE VIRGIN MARIE.
And this Register (ꝙ Theodosius) was saued at the sacking of
Hierusalem, and afterward kept in the Citie Tiberias, where
it is preserued in secret, and I haue seene it as one of the cheefe
among the Iewes, and as one from whom in respect of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

not ignorance that holdeth me in the Iewish Religion, but the
honor which I haue among my Countrymen, the lyke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I could not haue elswhere.</hi> Now there is greate lykelyhod
that this should be true, considering that Iesus (as we see) did

seeing the Messias was so precisely promised to be of that race; let
vs not doubt but that the Scribes would willingly haue verified
the contrarie, if they had could, for then had the Goale bene wonne
on their side. To be short, to come backe againe to the virginitie of
Mary, she was not a woman of such kindred, alyance, and wealth,
as might be bold to hope that her single word would bee beléeued

calleth <hi>Rabbi Iohanan</hi> the greate Preest. Concerning this <hi>Iohn</hi>
the <hi>Baptist,</hi> forasmuch as they suspect our Gospel, let them beléeue
their owne Storywriter.<note place="margin">Iosepus. lib. 18 Cap 7.</note> 
                  <hi>There was</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>a very good
Man that exhorted the Iewes to vertue, and specially to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes
and vpryght dealing, inuiting them to a cleannesse both
of body and mynd by baptim. But when Herod perceyued
that great multitudes of people followed him, which (to his
seeming) were at his commaundment; to auoyd insurrections
he put him in prison, where anon after, he cut of his head. And
therefore it was the common opinion, that when Herods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was afterward ouercome and vtterly put to the swoord, it
was through Gods iustiudgement for putting of Iohn Baptist
vniustly to death.</hi> By this witnesse of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> we sée what his
office was, namely to preache repentance and to Baptize, or (as
<hi>Malachie</hi> sayth) <hi>to turne the heartes of the Fathers to their
Children, and the heartes of the Children to their Fathers.</hi>
But the thing which we haue chiefly to note here, is that hauing
the people at commaundement, yet when Iesus came, he gaue Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
place, and humbled himselfe to him, and yeelded him the glory:
the which thing man beeing led by affection of man would neuer
haue done. Insomuch that after that Iesus had once shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
the Disciples of this greate maister shewed not themselues
as his disciples any more; and that was because his trayning and
teaching of them was not for himselfe, but for Iesus. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the peculiar act of Baptizing, it seemeth that the Leuites
wayted for some speciall thing vpon it, in that they asked of Iohn,
<hi>How happeneth it that thou Baptizest, if thou bee neither
Christ, nor Elias the Prophet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let vs come now to treate of the lyfe of Iesus, not according
to our Gospells, but according to such Histories as the <hi>Iewes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
cannot denie: and what els is it than the verie body of the
shadowes of the old testament, and the very pith and substance of the
words that were spoken afore concerning the Messias? Let vs call
to rememberance to what end he came, namely to saue Mankind:
and the nature of his Kingdome,<note place="margin">The kingdom of Iesus is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</note> how it is holy and spirituall.
Whereof are all his Preachings, but of the forgiuenesse of sinnes,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:13215:287"/>
and of the Kingdome of Heauen? his Disciples were alwayes
importunate vppon him in asking him, <hi>Lord when wilt thou set
vp the Kingdom of Israel agein?</hi> In sted of contenting their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
he answereth them concerning the Kingdome of Heauen.
They Imagined some Empyre of <hi>Cyrus</hi> or <hi>Alexander:</hi> that their
Nation might haue bene honored of all other nations of the earth.
One of them would néedes haue sit on his right hand and another
on his left. What answereth he to this? Nay (saith he) whosoeuer
will be greatest, let him be the leaft; and if I béeing your Maister
be as a Seruant among you, what ought you to bee? Yee shalbe
brought before Magistrates: that is farre from reigning. Ye shall
be persecuted, imprisoned, tormented, and crucifyed: that is farre of
from triumphing. I wil giue you to vnderstand how great things
ye be to suffer for my names sake: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is very farre from parting of
Countryes. Yet notwithstanding, happy shall you bee when you
suffer these things, and he that holdeth out to the end shalbe saued.
Who can imagine any temporall thing in this kingdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the first and last Lesson is, that a man to saue his lyfe must lose
it? and to become happy must wed himselfe to wretchednes? The
people followe him for the miracles which hee woorketh: and the
Iewes deny not but he did very greate ones. But let vs see wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they tended. He fed a greate multitude of people in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
with a feawe Loaues. This miracle was matter enough for
him to haue hild them with long talke; but he preacheth vnto them
of the heauenly bread which feedeth vnto euerlasting life. Also hee
healeth all sicke and diseased folke that come vnto him: howbeit, to
shewe that that was but an appendant or rather an income to that
for the which he came; <hi>Thy sinnes</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be forgiuen thee.</hi>
To be short, from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Well, hee directeth the Woman of
<hi>Samaria</hi> to the Fountaine of lyfe. Béeing shewed the goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and of the Temple, he foretelleth the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
of them both. Beeing required a sittingplace at his right
hand or at his left; he answereth of a Cuppe that such a petitioner
is to drinke. When men go about to make him King, he steales a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from them. And whereas his Apostles looke for some greate
triumphe; his accomplishing of it is after the maner that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Zacharie</hi> speakes of, namely by ryding vpon a shée Asse, euen
vpon the Colt of an Asse. And yet neuerthelesse <hi>Herod</hi> the King
trembleth at him in his throne, the whole Counsell of the Realme
are in a perplexitie, and all the people are astonished. And in his
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:13215:288"/>
doings he maketh it to appeare sufficiently, that he hath the hearts
of all men in his hand, and that if he himselfe listed hee should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
both of the greatest persons and in the greatest matters.
Surely then wee may well say, that the marke which this Iesus
and the marke which the Messias leueleth at, are both one; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to drawe men from the earth, and to make them to plant their
whole hope by his meanes in heauen.</p>
               <p>It followeth that to this office which he did euidently take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him, he brought the qualities requisite to the executing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that is to wit, that he was both God and Man: I say, God as
the Sonne of God, and Man<note place="margin">God and Man</note> as borne of a woman, without sinne,
and such in all poyntes as he was forepromised to be. Of this hope
we haue some footesteppes in the Gospell. For some say, <hi>We haue
heard say that Christ endureth for euer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 12. vers. 34.</note> And <hi>Nathaneel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
sayth, <hi>Sir, Art thou the Sonne of GOD and the King of
Israell?</hi> That is to say, art thou the Sonne of GOD whom we
looke for to be the King of <hi>Israell?</hi> To the same purpose may wée
set his two natures heere one against another. Hee himselfe was
hungrie; and yet hee fed many thousands with a feawe Loaues.
He suffered thirst; and yet he gaue other men liuing Waters that
ouerflowed. He was wéerie, and yet he saide come vnto mée all yee
that are weerie. He payd tribute, but he commaunded the Fish to
pay the Tributemony for him. He was dumb as a Lamb, but yet
was the very spéech itself. He yéelded vp his spirit and dyed, but he
told them hee had power to take it to him againe. To be short, hee
was condemned, but he iustifieth: He was slayne, but he saueth:
He prayed; but his praying was for vs, and hee heareth our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
For these countermatchings and the lyke doe wee reade of in
our Euangelists, in whom wee haue the dooings of both natures
distinguished, and yet notwithstanding ioyned togither in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone.
But if they will vtterly deny our Gospels; then shall wee in
that poynt be more vpright than they: for we will not deny al their
writing. Now they agree with vs that hee was man; and for all
their casting vp of their Foame against him in their bookes, yet are
they not able to charge him with any vice euen in his priuate lyfe:
and therefore the chiefe thing that wee haue to stand vppon, is the
proofe of his Godhead.</p>
               <p>Iesus (sayth our Gospell) wrought miracles.<note place="margin">The Miracles of Iesus.</note> Hee healed the
sicke, restored Limmes to the lame, gaue sight to the blind, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

many: nor in a corner, but in the open sight of the world: and there
are many thousands of men which will rather dye vpon the Racke
than deny him, yea or not preach him. I aske them vpon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
if they will deny that he wrought any miracles. If they
deny it: then what a mirac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is this, that so many people doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
a poore abiect without miracles, and are contented to dye for
his sake, euen when he himselfe is dead? And if these miracles of
his (as namely the restoring both of sight and lyfe, &amp; such others)
were not very great and farre surmounting all nature of man; yet
who would lose his lyfe, but for a better? and how could hee giue
the better, which could not giue the other? And if it bee a miracle
to woorke vppon a man by touching him, and much more without
touching him, and most of all without seeing him: what a miracle
is it to worke in the heartes of whole Nations farre of, without
seeing them; and to touche them without comming at them; and
to turne them to him without touching them? And if the bones of
<hi>Elias</hi> bee commended for prophesying in his Tumbe; what shall
this Iesus bee for ouercomming so many people, and for conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
so many Nations after his death, yea and (which is a greater
matter) euen by the death of his seruants, who preached nothing
but his death? But the <hi>Rabbines</hi> saw welly nough that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Iesus could not be denyed. And truely <hi>R. Iohanan</hi> sayth
in the <hi>Talmud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Talmud of Hierusalem in the treatise Auodazara.</note> that a Neuew of <hi>R. Iosua</hi> the sonne of <hi>Leuy</hi> had

was healed out of hand: and this is a verifying of that which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

whether he ought to call him Man or God. And they ought not to

and some to the power of the name of God which they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to haue vsurped: in the examining of both which poynts,
I beseech them to ioyne with mee without affection.</p>
               <p>As touching Magicke, they say that their thréescore and tenne
Senators whom they call <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> were very skilfull in it; and
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:13215:289"/>
so sayth <hi>R. Selomoh</hi> also, the better to conuince the Inchaunters.
And we reade in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that Magicke was neuer more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
in <hi>Iewrie</hi> then it was among the Doctors at this tyme.
Now if their meaning was to conuict Iesus as an euill doer; why
did they not put him to shame? why did they not vse the rigour of
the Lawe against him? How happeneth it that in their accusing
of him, they charge him not with any Magicke at all? Or if they
meant to ouercome him by the arte; why did not some one of them
woorke the like things or greater? Why did not their miracles
swallowe vp his? Nay contrariwise, whereof commeth it that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
calleth Iesus a worker of miracles, and the other sort Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
and deceitfull Cowseners? And that his miracles worke
still euen after his death, whereas theirs vanished away afore they
were dead? But like as in the tyme of <hi>Moyses,</hi> God suffered great
Magicians to be in <hi>AEgipt,</hi> that hee might make his owne power
the more euident in <hi>Moyses:</hi> so at this tyme there was great store
of them in <hi>Iewrie,</hi> to the intent it might appeare what difference is
betwixt that which man can doe by the Diuels abusing of him, and
that which the fingar of God himselfe can doe in man. And in good
sooth I dare well say, there is not any arte in the worlde, that doth
more clearely verifie the miracles of Iesus, than Magicke doth.
For by <hi>Plinies</hi> report, there were neuer mo Magicians, than in
the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> (which was the tyme that Christes Disciples
did spread his doctrine abrode) neither was the vanitie of that Arte
euer more apparantly knowen (as he witnesseth) than at that time.
And euen among the Iewes of our time, that science is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at this day, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among al other people. For they make bookes
thereof, specially in the Eastpartes of the world. But what are they
els than casts of Legierdemayne or Iuggliugtrickes, and toyes
for Babes to play withall? And as for the Magicians which the
Princes of Christendome mainteine in their Courts, to the shame
of vs all and to their owne confusion; what are the things which
they doe, but (to speake fitly) mere illusions that vanishe away
out of hand, as which consist in some nimble tricks in playing at
Cards and Dyce, or in slipper deuises of slight and vayne things?
Of which kind of folkes and dealings, I say not who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
dye for them, but who would not be ashamed to liue with
them? As for Iesus, wee see it is farre otherwise with him. Hee
wrought very great miracles in the world: and although hee was
crucified, yet (sayth <hi>Iosephus</hi>) his Disciples forsooke him not:
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:13215:289"/>
and therefore euen after hee was gone from them, they wrought
miracles still: and what maner of Miracles? Surely euen such
as within the space of twentie yeres or thereaboutes, filled all the
world full of Christians: and that miracle continueth still vnto this
day. The Empires which had not heard any speaking of Christ,
were conuerted to the Kingdome of Christe, and beléeued hym
for his doings afore they heard of his name. The Emperours
vnder whome hee had bene crucified, and his Disciples diuersly
persecuted, are glad to doe him honour, and to build Temples
vnto hym. Let the Iewes tell mée what Magician they euer
heard of, that wrought such miracles after his death? If they say
that Christes Apostles and Disciples also were Magicians; then
séeing that no man which is well aduised, doeth any thing but to
some end; let them tell mée what gayne the Apostles could get by
exercising this Magike, which procured them nothing but hatred,
sorrowe, imprisonment, torments, and cruell death? And seeing
that Magicians doe hyde themselues and conceale their arte when
they be pursued for it: what kind of Magicke is this, which will
needes be knowen and exercised, euen in despite of Princes, and of
the world, yea and of death; that is to say, euen in despite of the
man himselfe (if I may so say) that doth practise it? If it be further
replied that some extreme vainglorie led them: how happeneth it
that euery of them did not cause himselfe to be worshipped alone?
And that they did not their workes in their owne names, but refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all to Iesus, yéelding vnto him the power, the honour, and the
glory of all? If they say (as of force they néedes must) that the
power of the crucified Man wrought still in them and by them: Let
them say also that the same man liued still euen after his crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yea and a farre other lyfe than all other men (considering that
after this lyfe he maketh men to be more than men) that is to wit,
a lyfe not onely free from death, but also euerlasting and diuin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

deede; and so is farre of from the punishment appointed by them
to Magicians, that is to wit from béeing in Iayle and vnder tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or (as they themselues terme it) in endlesse death. But as soone
as they perceyue themselues stopped on that side, by and by they
seeke to scape out another away.</p>
               <p>Iesus (say they) wrought his miracles by vertue of the vnvtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
name of God, which he mynded. And therevpon they fall to
an account, which sheweth (as many other in their <hi>Talmud</hi> doe)
that in Gods matters they wanted not only the spirit of God, but
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:13215:290"/>
also euen the humane wit and reason: and God knoweth I would
be ashamed to rehearse it, but for their owne welfare. Their saying
then is, that in <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple there was a certeine stone of
very rare vertue, wherein <hi>Salomon</hi> by his singular wisedome had
ingrauen the very true name of God, which it was lawfull for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to reade, but not to cun by hart, nor to write out: And that
at the Temple doore were two Lyons tide at two Cheynes, which
rored terribly, that the feare of it made him to forget the name that
had commited it to memorie, and him to burst asunder in the mids
that had put it in writing. But Iesus the sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> (say they)
regarding neither the curse annexed vnto the prohibition, nor the
roring of the Lyons; wrate it out in a bill, and went his way with
it with great gladnesse: And least he might be taken with the thing
about him, he had a little opened the skinne of his Leg and put it
in there, and afterward wrought his miracles by the vertue of that
name. Now ye must thinke that if I was ashamed to repeate this
géere, I am much more ashamed to stand confuting of it. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelater,

of that rare stone, or of those Lyons that were so zealous of Gods
name: whence I pray them haue they this so fayre tale? And how
commeth it to passe that <hi>Iosephus</hi> was ignorant thereof, who had
so diligently perused their matters of remembrance; or how come
they to the first knowledge thereof, so many hundred yeres after?
Ageine, where became those Lyons at such tymes as the <hi>AEgipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Bahylonians</hi> spoyled <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and defyled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
How found they them ageine in the second Temple? Or if
they were immortall, where became they afterward? Nay further,
how happeneth it that <hi>Salomon</hi> that great king who consecrated
and ingraued the sayde Stone, wrought not the lyke miracles
himselfe, specially sith wée reade not that he wrought any miracle
at all? And what godlynes had it bene for him, to haue concealed
and kept secret that name, which would haue cured so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of body and infirmities of mind? whereby folke might haue
bene turned away from idolatrie, and the whole world might haue
bene wonne vnto the lawe of God? But if I must néedes answere
fooles further according to their folly; then if Iesus be the seruant
of the liuing God, and vse his name to his glory, why doe they not
beléeue him? Or if he serued not GOD, how was it possible that
the name of God should bee waged by a mortall man, ageinst the
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:13215:290"/>
glorie of God? And what a blasphemie is it to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

teaching, that Iesus did great miracles,<note place="margin">In the treatyse Sanhedrin. ch. Helec.</note> both in the name of God
and in the power of GOD, and that God gaue power vnto his

shall iudge of things by their only smell; it cannot bee soundly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of any thing els, than of an excellent gift of Prophesying.
To let passe a thousand particular Prophesies, and a thousand
texts whereby we perceyue that Iesus read things in the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
hearts of the Pharistes, and sawe things in the hearts of his
Disciples, which they themselues neither sawe nor perceiued: who
will not woonder at these which wee see so peremptorilie come to
passe, namely, <hi>Ye shalbe brought before the Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of the earth; men shall thinke they doe seruice vnto
God, when they murder you for my names sake; that the glad
tydings of his kingdome should bee preached through the
whole world, notwithstanding all impediments; That Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
should bee destroyed; That all things should bee wasted
and vnhalowed there; That of the same Temple which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
so much, one stone should not be left standing vpon
another; And that the tyme wherein these things should bee
done was then so neere hand, that euen those which led him
to death, had cause to bewayle themselues and their Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi>
For what I pray you could those poore Fishermen thinke, when
he spake to them of being led before Kings; and (which more is)
when he told them that they should driue Nations like flockes of
Shéepe afore them at the hearing of the Gospell? What likelihood
was there hereof in his owne person or in theirs, considering the
lowlinesse of his life, and the reprochfulnesse of his death? And as
touching the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which befell about a fortie
yéeres after; sith we reade expresly in their owne Histories, that the
Emperour <hi>Tytus</hi> offered them peace, sought the preseruation of
their Temple, graunted them the free vse of their Religion, and
during his seege did seeke as it were by intreatance to them being
beseeged, that he might saue and preserue them; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

vp a Prophet</hi> (sayth the Law) <hi>and giue thee a signe or myracle,
and therevppon he come and counsell thee to turne aside to
straunge Gods: thou shalt not hearken vnto him.</hi> Therfore let
vs see what doctrine Iesus matched with his signes and miracles.
Let vs reade the Gospell from the one ende to the other, and wee
shall see nothing there but to loue God with all our heart, and our
neighbour as our selfe. Also he came not to abolish the Lawe, but
to fulfill it; nor to destroye the Temple, but to purge it. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies
had extended the Lawe but to the outward man; he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
their hypocrisie, and bringeth it backe againe to the inward
man. They sayd, hate your enemies: but he sayd, if ye loue none
but your friends, what are ye better than the Publicanes? They
sayd, Thou shalt not commit adulterie; thou shalt not kill: But he
sayd, If thou looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a woman to lust after her, thou hast broken
the Lawe: and if thou say to thy brother, <hi>Racha;</hi> thou hast alreadie
killed him. To bee short, a neighbour by their interpretation, was
but in <hi>Iericho</hi> or néere thereabouts: but he told them that a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in <hi>idumea,</hi> &amp; in all the corners of the world.
Also if a case concerne God, he taught men to forsake Goods, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
Father, Moother, Wife, Children, and all that euer is,
for loue of his seruice. As for Saluation and Welfare, he taught
men to hoord vp treasure in Heauen, and to shake off the world in
this life, that they may be clothed with glorie in another. What is
there in all this, I say not which turneth a man away, but which
setteth him not in the right way, and which tendeth not in effect to
the glorie of the true God, to the doing of our duetie towards our
neighbours, and to euery mans owne saluation and welfare? By
the way, this doctrine is not a declaiming, nor an exercise of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
who (as <hi>Seneca</hi> affirmeth) pretended slaues by their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and conteyned poyson and venome in their boxes: but it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in his life, and read in his Disciples, whom neither <hi>Iewe</hi>
nor <hi>Gentyle</hi> haue euer blamed, but for their simplicitie and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie:
Insomuch that <hi>Philo</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philo concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue life.</note> the <hi>Iewe</hi> made a booke expresly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
for a woonder. For whereas <hi>Celsus</hi> the <hi>Epicure</hi> obiecteth, that
Iesus chose Publicanes and men of wicked conuersation to be his
Disciples: euen therein peculiarly hath he shewed the effectualnes
of his doctrine in the curing of mens soules, as a Phisition doth in
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:13215:292"/>
healing those that are sorest sicke and furthest past hope of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in a Citie. To be short, at his word the Nations that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Deuilles, Men, Planets, Stockes and Stones, turned to the
only true God. The Deuils that had abused them, hid themselues
away, and their Oracles lost their voyces, as shalbe sayd hereafter.
But as for the lawe of God and the holy Scriptures, (I meane
euen those (ye Iewes) which you your selues beléeue &amp; reuerence;)
they come to be read, imbraced, and expounded through all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
and in all Languages. If this doctrine then bee of the Deuill; by
what marke shall we know the doctrine of God? And if to giue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to the Byble ouer all the world, be the destruction thereof;
what shal we call the stablishing thereof? And if Iesus haue by his
doctrine stablished the seruice of the true God, authorised the Law
of <hi>Moyses,</hi> and rooted vp the seruice of the Deuill by the bottome:
how can it be sayd that the Deuill hath eyther inspyred him, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him in his myracles and Prophesyings, both for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, and against the Deuils owne Tyrannie?</p>
               <p>Yea (say you) but he professed himselfe to be the Sonne of God.<note place="margin">An obiection.</note>
So much the rather (say I) ought you to imbrace him, seeing that
by the record of your auncetors, the Messias ought so to be. And in
reporting himselfe to be so, if you reade your owne Doctors well,
ye shal finde that he turneth you not away to diuers Gods, nor yet
to straunge Gods.<note place="margin">Looke the 6. Chapter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</note> For according to your owne Scriptures and
Traditions, these three, namely the Father, the Sonne, and the
holy Ghost, are but one God. I would knowe but this one thing
of you; whether you take him for a true Prophet, or for a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
for the seruant of God, or for the seruant of the Deuill. You
haue sayd heretofore that he vsed the power of the name of God in
his myracles, whereby ye haue graunted me very much: and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
haue proued vnto you, that such particuler and speciall Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
as these, cannot procéede but from God himselfe. But what a
seruant is he to the Deuill, which ouerthroweth his maister? How
is hee not an ouerthrower of him, which saueth vs? How is he a
false accuser of vs, which iustifieth vs? How is he a deadly enemie,
which setteth vs againe in life? For what els hath the doctrine of
Iesus done throughout the whole world, but destroyed the Altars
of the Deuils, beaten downe their Temples, broken their Images
in peeces, abolished their gamings, their feastes, their Sacrifices;
and moreouer withdrawne the rest of men from Murder, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Theft, &amp; all other abhominations wherein they were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:13215:292"/>
and from the vaine seruices whereabouts they occupied them
selues, and wherewith they deceyued their owne Consciences? If
ye say he was the seruant of GOD; the very Turkes confesse as
much. Therefore procéede yet further, and graunt that sith he is
the Prophet and seruant of God, he is to be beléeued. For God the
Creator being altogether good and wise, would not lende him his
spirit to deceiue vs. And if we ought to beléeue him, we ought also
to heare him: and if wee heare him, he telleth vs that he is Christ
the Anoynted, that he is the trueth, that he is the way, that he came
from God his father, and that the father and he are but one. And
in déede, one while to shewe that he was sent of his father, he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth
vnto him: and anotherwhile to shewe that he is equall with
him, he commaundeth absolutely and of himselfe. Surely therfore
we may well say, that this Prophet Iesus being assisted by Gods
spirit, both in his Prophesyings, and in his Myracles, and in his
Doctrine; and beeing borne of a Uirgin, in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and at the
tyme appoynted afore hand by the Prophets; is Christ the Lords
anoynted, GOD and Man, euen such as he was declared and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>highted
vs in the holy Scriptures, as I haue shewed alreadie.</p>
               <p>But lo here the stumblingblock of the Pharisies and the Iewes.<note place="margin">The stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blocke of the Iewes.</note>
What likelyhood is there (say they) that our Christ by whom wee
looke that Israell should be so renowmed, should be so bace and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
a person? Nay moreouer, if he be both God and Man (as you
Christians say he is) what can bee imagined more against all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than that he should bee buffeted, whipped, crucified, accounted
among théeues, and in the end reprochfully killed, as your Iesus
was? Soothly, to folke that haue imagined and reckoned vppon a
Monarchie of the whole world, and behighted themselues places
among the chiefe in the same; it must néedes bee a great corsie and
greefe to bee defeated of that hope. But had they well chewed and
digested this text of <hi>Zacharie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zacharie. 9. &amp; 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, thy King commeth vnto
thee, rightuous, Sauiourlike, and lowlie, ryding vpon an Asse,
euen the Colt of an Asse:</hi> which text their <hi>Rabbines</hi> expound of
the Messias, and wee reade it to haue bene fulfilled in Iesus at his
comming into <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> they would not thinke it so straunge
that in the same person also should be performed this saying of the
same Prophet in another place, <hi>I will powre out the spirit of
grace and mercie vpon the house of Dauid, and vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters
of Hierusalem; and they shall looke vppon me whom
they haue pearced:</hi> which text likewise the <hi>Rabbines</hi> expound of
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:13215:293"/>
the Messias, as well as the other. Now I haue shewed heretofore,
that the Messias should reconcile vs vnto God, by the satisfaction
and amends which he should make vnto him for vs: and also how
agreeable the sayd amends was both to Gods Iustice and mercie,
which cannot bee contrarie one to another, and also to the order of
dealing that is among men. For in asmuch as man would néedes
through his pride become equal with God, and by his disobedience
bee as God: it was méete that his Suretie should be abaced euen
beneath man, and yéeld perfect obedience, euen to the most reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
death that could bee. Againe, to turne man againe and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyne
him from sinne, nothing could bee more effectuall, than to
make him knowe the horriblenesse of his sinne, by the greatnesse of
the penaltie and satisfaction thereof: neither could any thing bee
more forcible to allure him to the loue of God and of his neighbor,
than to see God redéeme him from wretched thraldome by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death
of his owne Sonne God and Man; and the same his own Sonne
crucified and dying for the raunsome, not of his brethren, but of
his enemies whom he voutsafeth to admit to be his brethren. But
forasmuch as the Iewes beléeue the Scriptures, they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
them in this poynt, and therefore let vs examine them here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>As touching Christs Lowelynesse in abacing himself, I haue
treated thereof heretofore, and all the whole scripture teacheth it vs
sufficiently. At one word, in the place where it is sayd. <hi>The Scepter
shalnot bee taken from Iuda;</hi> it is added byandby, <hi>Tying his
Assecolt to the vyne, and the foale of his sheeasse to the hedge.</hi>
Uppon which text <hi>Rabbi Hadarsan</hi> sayeth thus;<note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note>

                  <hi>he shal gird his Asse with a girt, and

same maner that is spoken of in the nynth of Zachary.</hi> But to
auoyd often repetitions, let vs beare in mynd what hath bin sayd
afore, that it may leade vs the more gently to the passion of Christ,
which is our only welfare and their vtter stumbling blocke. Wée
haue in the Lawe a great nomber of Sacraments and Sacrifices,<note place="margin">The passion of Iesus foretold in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>
as well solemne at set feasts as continewall and ordinarie, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, the Easterlambe, the Sacrifice of the red Hekfar, the
sending of the Scapegote into the Wildernesse, and such other
lyke: of all the which it is sayd, that their blud wassheth and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away the sinne of the congregation, and that the sprinkling
thereof turneth away the Angell of destruction from their houses.
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:13215:293"/>
Now forasmuch as this was done with so greate solemnitie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
commaunded to be obserued, and conueyed ouer from age to
age and from father to sonne: I aske them vpon their consciences,
whether they bee signes and figures of a sacrifice too come which
should clense away sinne; or whether those sacrifices themselues
had that vertue. If they say the Sacrifices had that force in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
what vertue is there in the blud of a Lamb or of a Hekfar,
ageinst Sinne? And wherefore sayeth God so often vnto vs, <hi>I wil
none of your sacrifices, I will none of the blud of your Bulles
and Goates, al such things are but smoke and lothlynes in my
sight?</hi> And at such tyme as they were prisoners at <hi>Babylon,</hi> or
scattered abroade in the world, where they might not by their lawe
offer any Sacrifice; was there then no forgiuenesse of their sinnes?
Yes surely: and therefore they were signes and figures of Christ
as then to come, who was to dye sor our sinnes: which signes do
now cease and haue ceassed now these many hundred yeres through
the whole world, euersince the comming of him that was betokened
by them, namely of the Lamb of whome it is said in <hi>Esay:</hi>

let vs reade the Historie of the lyfe and death of Iesus whole togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of <hi>Esay. There was neither fauor</hi> (sayth he) <hi>nor beawty
in him, neither sawe we any fayrenesse in him that was to bee

<pb n="562" facs="tcp:13215:294"/>
man full of infirmities &amp; inured to sorrow by reason whereof
we accounted him so vile, that we hid our faces from him. Yet
in very deede he bare our infirmities, and was loden with our
sorrowes: but we thought him to be wounded and stryken of
God, whereas he was wounded for our misdeedes, and smitten
for our sinnes. The punishment of our peace was layd vppon
him, and by his strypes are we healed. Al of vs went astray lyke
sheepe, and turned aside euery man after his owne way: and
the Lord hath cast vppon him the iniquities of vs all. Being
misintreated and smitten, hee opened not his mouth. As a
Lamb was he led to be slayne, &amp; yet hild his peace as a Sheepe
before the shearer. He was lifted vp from prison and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet who is he that can recken vp his generation? He
was plucked vp from the liuing vppon the earth, and couered
with woundes for the sinne of my people. His graue was giuen
him with the wicked, &amp; with the Riche in his death, Although
hee neuer committed vnryghtuousenes, nor any gwile was
found in his mouth; yet was it the Lords will to breake him
with sorrow; that when he had giuen his lyfe in sacrifice for
sinne, he myght see a longlasting seede. Which deuyce of the
Lord shall prosper in his hand, and with the labour and trauel
of his Soule shall he get greate Riches. My ryghtuous seruant
(sayeth the Lord) shall with the knowledge of him make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men ryghtuous, and take their sinnes vppon himself. I will
giue him a portion among the greate ones, and he shal deuide
the spoyle with the mighty ones; bycause he yelded his Soule
vnto death, and did muster himself among the transgressers,
and tooke vppon him the sinnes of many, and prayed for the
offenders.</hi> Who seeth not in this text, both the apprehension and
the sorrowes and the wounds, and the death of Iesus? Yea and his
meekenesse, Lowelynes, and innocencie? His apprehension, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to our deliuerance; his sorrowes, to our ioye; his wounds, too
our health; his death, to our lyfe; his ryghtuousenes to our inrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousing;
and his punishment, to our obteynement of grace? And
when we reade, <hi>He was abhorred of men, and we made none
account of him;</hi> do we not see men spitting in his face? Also when
we reade these words, <hi>We tooke him to be wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of God;</hi> do

the transgressors, and yet prayed for them, notwithstanding
that he bare the sinnes of other men: what is it els but the crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Iesus betwéene the two théeues, and the very spéech of the
repentant théefe which sayd, <hi>As for vs, wee receiue worthely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

done?</hi> Yea &amp; the very prayer which Iesus made vpon the Crosse,
saying, <hi>Lord forgiue them, for they knowe not what they do?</hi>

of persons that haue imbatteled themselues against their
own Saluation. To turne this text from Iesus, <hi>Rabbi Selomoh</hi>
                  <pb n="564" facs="tcp:13215:295"/>
and <hi>Dauid Kimhi</hi> (afore whom the sayde wilfulnesse of opinion

                  <note place="margin">The fond shiftes of the Iewes,</note>) haue turned away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the writers of

And this serueth well to shewe what oddes is betwéene
the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Reason and of Affection. For I presume so much
vppon their vnderstanding, that if they had bene borne in the tyme
of <hi>Ionathas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Vziel,</hi> or at leastwise at any tyme afore
the comming of Iesus, they would haue bene vtterly of another

when he saith, <hi>He was despised of men, and we hid our faces

there in not beléeuing it? For who doubteth but that euery man is
woorthie to beare the blame of his owne fault? But will any man
gaynsay the Prophet himself, who expoundeth his owne meaning
so plainly afterward? <hi>He was plucked vp out of the land of the

the healing of them? betwéene <hi>Israell</hi> whose sores are brought to a

scarre, and the partie that beareth away his sores? The Prophet
addeth, <hi>There was no vnrightuousnesse in him, neither was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
guyle found in his mouth.</hi> Surely there is pride in men, yea
and euen in these men; and yet I can hardly beléeue, but that they
would be ashamed to chalenge the verifying of this text vpon them
selues. And as for the people of <hi>Israell</hi> that were afflicted by the
<hi>Chaldees;</hi> the <hi>Rabbines</hi> affirme that their first Temple was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
for their Idolatrie, Superfluitie, and sheading of giltlesse
blud. And concerning the second Temple which was destroyed by
the <hi>Romaines,</hi> they say the cause thereof was the peoples coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
their hating of their neighbours without cause, and their
selling of the rightuous person. And whereas they reply, That the
people of <hi>Israel</hi> suffered so much affliction at one season, as suffised
to discharge their successors that liued afterward in another season:
surely besides that it is contrary both to the Iustice and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God; that glose cannot be verified of any one lyne of the sayd
text: but it appeareth by experience, that the afflictions which the

at this day, than euer they were afore. Loe how one false and

               <p>But let vs here further, how this text is expounded by other of
the Prophetes. <hi>Seuentie weekes</hi> (sayth <hi>Daniell</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 9. vers. 14. and 16.</note>) <hi>are set downe
for the ending of disobedience, &amp; for the Sealing vp of sinne,
and for the cleansing away of iniquitie and the bringing of
rightuousnes for euer.</hi> As how? <hi>For vnto the anoynted Prince</hi>
(saith he) <hi>shalbe seauen weekes and threescore &amp; two weekes;
after which tyme the Anoynted shalbe slayne, and nothing
shalbe left vnto him, and the Prince of a People to come shall
destroy the Citie. &amp;c.</hi> Here ye see how Christ must dye, &amp; namely
for sinne, according to this saying of <hi>Esay, He hath giuen his lyfe
for sinne.</hi> And (as I haue shewed already) Iesus was put to death
euen the very same tyme. As touching the Circumstances of his
death,<note place="margin">Psalm. 22. vers. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>They perced my feete and my hands</hi> (sayth <hi>Dauid) and
parted my garments among them, and cast lots for my coate.</hi>
We reade not that <hi>Dauid</hi> was serued so, but rather Iesus who
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:13215:296"/>
was crucified (howbeit that that king of punishment was not vsed
among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but among the <hi>Romaines</hi>) and lottes were cast
for his Coate: and the Euangelistes alledged this Text to the

                  <note place="margin">Iosephus in his Antiquitie Lib. 18. cap. 4.</note> sayth, <hi>In the
tyme of Tyberius there was one Iesus, a wise man (at leastwise
if he was to be called a man) who was a worker of great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and a teacher of such as loue the trueth, and had a greate
trayne as well of Iewes as of Gentyles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The booke of Collections.</note> 
                  <hi>Neuerthelesse, being
accused vnto Pilate by the cheefe of the Iewes, he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
But yet for all that, those which had loued him from the
beginning, ceassed not to continue still. For he shewed himself
alyue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a three dayes after his death, as the Prophetes
had foretold of him both this and diuers other things. And
euen vnto this day doe those continue still which after his
name are called Christians.</hi> Certesse then let vs conclude as this
Iewe doth in the selfesame place, and in his owne words, <hi>This Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was in very deede the Christ.</hi> For as for the goodly tale, That
Christes Disciples stole him out of his Graue, and that for feare
they did cast hym downe in a Gardyne where he was found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
the fondnesse and fabulousenesse thereof appéereth in this,
that whereas because hee had sayd in his lyfetyme. <hi>Destroy this
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:13215:298"/>
Temple, and in three dayes I will rayse it vp ageine;</hi> And also,
<hi>There shall none other signe be giuen vnto you but the signe
of the Prophet Ionas,</hi> and so foorth; therevpon the <hi>Iewes</hi> caused
<hi>Pylate</hi> to set a sure gard about the Sepulchre: Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<hi>Pylate</hi> writing afterward to the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised
him of the resurrection of Iesus, so as the greater and surer
the gard was that <hi>Pylate</hi> did set, the mo and the stronger were the
witnesses to proue the Iewes lyars in that behalf. Also the high
Priestes béeing so inraged against Iesus as they were, would not
haue sticked to haue hanged vp the sayd found Carkesse openly in
the Marketplace, whereby they might haue abolished all the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Iesus out of hand. Ageine on the other side, the Apostles
were men so afrayd of death, so weakeharted, so féeble in faith, and
so vtterly without credit; that there is not any lykelihod that they
durst take the matter in hand. Nay (which more is) what benefite
could they haue had by his dead Carkesse? what should it haue boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to haue forgone their Children, their Wyues, yea and
themselues too for such a one? Should they not rather haue had
cause to haue bene offended at his cowsmage, and therevpon bene
the readier to haue condemned the remembraunce of him them
selues, and to haue turned all men away from him? Contrariwise,
they preach nothing but his resurrection; for that are they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to dye; for that doe they teache other men to dye; alonly by that
doe they hope too liue and dye most blessedly; and of all the whole
no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of them, there was not so much as one that could be brought
to say otherwise: nay rather which could bee made to conceale it,
and not to speake of it, though they were let alone, yea or for any
promise or threatning that the greatest personages in the worlde
could make vnto them. Surely therefore, if euer any deede were
true, we must needes say that this is it.</p>

and ouerthrowe, is not to bee fathered vpon any other thing, than
vpon their putting of Iesus to death? Iesus was apprehended in
Mount Oliuet;<note place="margin">Iosephus in his Antiq lib. 20. Cap. 6. 8.</note> and from Mount Oliuet was <hi>Hierusalem</hi> besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
He was crucified on the day of the Passouer; and on that day

voyce that gaue warning from heauen, &amp; the opening of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

was to light vpon them. Again, the Fountayne of <hi>Silo</hi> which was
dryed vp afore, swelled vp to giue water to the <hi>Romaine</hi> Hoste.
Insomuch that their owne Historywriter, beholding so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:13215:299"/>
of Gods wrath, was in maner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>streyned to come somewhat
nye the cause thereof, which he affirmeth to be, that the Highpriest
<hi>Ananus</hi> had vniustly and hastily caused <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to be stoned to death, and certeine others with him, to the great
griefe of good men, and of such as loned the Lawe. To the which
purpose also may this saying of the notablest of their <hi>Rabbines</hi> be
applyed, <hi>That the second Temple was destroyed for their sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Rightuous, and for hating him without cause;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this saying of Iesus concerning them, <hi>They haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me without cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas some <hi>Iewes</hi> at this day doe say, that they bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
because some of them receiued this Iesus for the Christ:
there is no likelyhood of trueth in it. For considering that Gods
maner is, to saue a whole Citie for some ten good mens sakes, if
they be found in it: he would much rather haue saued his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for so many mens sakes, being the chiefe and representing the
state of the Realme of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> which did put their hands to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
of Iesus; and for so great a multitudes sake, which cryed
out, <hi>Away with him, away with him, crucifie him.</hi> And if God
confirmed the Priesthood vnto <hi>Phinees,</hi> for his zealousnesse in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
a simple <hi>Israelite:</hi> what thinke you your selues to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
for crucifying (as you beare your selues on hand) an enemie
of God, one that named himselfe Christ the Lords Anoynted, yea
and which sayd he was very God himselfe? Yet notwithstanding
in the middes of all these calamities, the Citie and Temple of this
Iesus were builded vp, first in <hi>Iewrie</hi> it selfe, and afterward in the
whole world; and according to <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophesie, the Couenant
of Saluation was stablished among all Nations by the preaching
of his Apostles; and the Sacrifices of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were then put
downe, and neuer anywhere reuyued againe since that tyme. And
within a while after, the very ydolatries of the <hi>Gentyles,</hi> which
had possessed the whole world, were likewise dasshed also, as wée
shall see hereafter. Whereof <hi>Rabbi Hadarsan</hi>
                  <note place="margin">R. Hadarsan vpon Daniel.</note> writing vpon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi>
seemeth to haue giuen some incling, in that he sayth, <hi>Halfe a
weeke, that is to say, three yeeres and a half, shall make an end
of Sacrificing.</hi> And so doth <hi>R. Iohanan</hi> in that he sayth, <hi>Three
yeeres and a half hath the presence of the Lord cryed out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Mount Oliuet, saying, seeke God while he may be found,
and call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him while he is nere hand.</hi> And vpon the Psalmes
it is sayd,<note place="margin">Midrasch Thehilim.</note> 
                  <hi>That by the space of three yeeres and a halfe, GOD
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:13215:300"/>
would teache his Church in his owne persone.</hi> Now it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
knowen, that Iesus preached betwéene thrée and fower
yeres about <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and that his preaching was pursewed
and continued afterward by his Apostles.</p>
               <p>Sothen, we haue in the Prophets a Christ the sonne of God,
which was to be borne of a Uirgin, in the end of the thréescore and
and ten wéekes mention in <hi>Daniel,</hi> at <hi>Bethleem</hi> in <hi>Iewrie;</hi> whom
being foregone by an <hi>Elias,</hi> it behoued to preache the kingdome of
God, to dye a reprocheful death to mans Saluation, and to ryse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
with glorie; shortly wherevpon should follow the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and of the Temple. And at the very selfesame
tyme, we haue in our Gospels &amp; in the stories of the Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
one Iesus the sonne of God, borne of the Uirgin Marie, at
<hi>Bethleem</hi> in <hi>Iewrie,</hi> who beeing foregone by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
preached the kingdome of Heauen both in woord and déede, was
crucified at Hierusalem, beléeued on by the Gentiles, and reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged
by the ouerthrowe and destruction of the Temple. And all these
circumstances and markes are so peculiar vnto him, that they can
by no meanes agrée to any other. Wherefore let vs conclude, that
this Iesus is the very same Christ that was promised from time
to time in the Scriptures, and exhibited in his dew time according
to our Gospell. For that is the thing which wee had to proue in
these last two Chapters.</p>

               <p>Yet they reply still and say:<note place="margin">Esay. 1.</note> What lykelyhod is there that this

not we (at least wyse) woorthie to be excused for not knowing him,
comming disguysed after that manner? Nay, I demaund of you,
after what other sort he could or should come, considering that hee
came to humble himself, and to be crucified for vs? You looked to
haue had him princelyke, and he was forepromised poore: a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryour,
and it was told you he should be beaten and wounded: with
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:13215:302"/>
a greate trayne, and he is descrybed alone vppon an Asse: with a
companie of wyues, and there was no mo spoken of but only one:
with tryumphing and feasting, and yee were informed aforehand

these two commings, which is most meete, both for Gods glorie,
and for his owne? Admit he had the Empyre of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>

                  </gap> by his winning of a
battell ageinst the <hi>Egiptians</hi> with so greate a nomber of men, or by
ouerthrowing them with one stroke of a rod? In reducing the
King to reason by force of armes, or in making him to seeke mercy
by an hoste of fleas and lyce? Let vs come now to Christ. He was
to subdewe the world vnder his obedience. Whether was it more
to his glorie and more correspondent to his Godhead, to haue done
it by inuesting himself in an Empyre, or by ridding himself of all
worldly meanes, by force of armes, or by his only word? By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
men with shewe of pompe, or by winning them with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
reproche at their hand? By tryumphing ouer them, or by
being crucified by them? By being alyue, or euen by being dead?
By killing his enemyes, or by yéelding vnto them? By ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
his foes; or by sending his seruants to suffer whatsoeuer they
would do vnto them? For who séeth not, that in the victories of
Princes, their men bée partakers with them of their glorie? And
that in battells betwéene men, the Horse and the speare haue their
part? And that oftentimes the harnesse and the very shadowe of the
Crests of their helmets (as yee would say) do step in for a share?
Surely therefore, wee may well say, that Iesus could not haue
shewed his Godhead better, than in comming like an abiect &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable

nor his myght, than in infirmitie; nor his glory, than in despisednes;

finally his quickening life, than in conquering the world by the
death of his Diciples. For had he come otherwise, man had had the
glory thereof: the stronglyer he had come, the lesse had bin his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie;
and the more pomp he had pretended outwardly, the lesse had
he alwayes vttered his Godhead, and the more excusable had both
the <hi>Iewes</hi> and Gentyles bin in not receyuing him. To be short, wil
ye sée that he was the same sonne of God, which was present with
God at the creating of the world? God created the world without
matter or stuffe whereof, and without help, by his only word: And
Iesus being destitute of all help and meane, hath conquered the
world with his only word, euen by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to haue bene a cleare dispatch of him? What greater maiestie or

and specially the euerlasting peace which Christ was to
bring vnto the world, which should turne Swords into Mattocks

at what tyme euery Countrey, euery Citie, euery Household, and
euery person had his peculiar God and his Idols by himselfe: and
they shall finde that within a little while after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the doctrine of Iesus to the world, they were all gone, and not
so much as any rememberance of them had now remayned, but
that in publishing the glorie of God, wee had also declared their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe.
Let them reade the Histories of the Heathen and aske
of them what is become of their Oracles, I meane the Deuilles
which hild them in with their Lyes and Dreames, and would not
bee pacified but with the Sacrificing of men, yea and euen of their
owne Children: and of all those wickednesses, which had taken
roote all the world throughout, can they now shew any print at all?
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:13215:304"/>
Euen in the tyme of <hi>Tyberius</hi> began men to aske these questions,
namely what was the cause that Oracles spake not any more; that
Deuils wrought not as they had done aforetymes; And that their
Priestes wanted liuing? And the Heathen themselues were driuen
to answer, that since the tyme that Iesus had dyed, and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
had preached abroade, Arte Magicke and the Deuils had lost
their power. So sodeine, so vniuersall, and so wonderfull to our
very enemies was the chaunge in that tyme; and of so great force
was the onely name of Iesus in the mouth of those poore men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Kings and Emperours, against their Kingdomes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyres,

himselfe sayth that <hi>Many be called, and fewe chosen.</hi> And it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiseth

but we see not the seede of Iesus to bee so. They say very well, in
that by the word <hi>Seede,</hi> they meane Christs Disciples; and in their

the Lawe of God his father deliuered by <hi>Moyses,</hi> beeing (as hath
bene sayd alreadie) both holy and inuiolable, which who so doth,
how can) hee bee receiued for the Messias? Surely in this poynt
where they charge Iesus with the changing and abolishing of the
Law; we be flat contrarie to them; affirming that he did not change
it or abolish it, but more plainly expounded it and fulfilled it. Nay
say they, Circumcision was expressely commaunded by God vnto

the shadowe for the substance and trueth of the promises. But wée

shall cure the venome of the Serpent, make a new Couenant, and
take away the necessitie of Circumcision. As touching Sacrifices,
I haue declared alreadie heretofore that they were signes. It is

the Sacrifices were not the very things themselues, but onely
signes of things, that is to wit, partly of the lustes and affections
which wee feele in our hearts, and partly of the Saluation which
wee looke for by the Messias; and that if wee passe no further than
the bare Sacrifices, thei be vtterly vnprofitable. But <hi>Dauid</hi> saith;

as were more solemne, they betokened that vniuersall Sacrifice
for the sinne of Mankynd which God had ordeyned euerlastingly,
that is to wit, the death of the Messias. For that those Sacrifices
should haue an end, namely, the signe by the presence of the thing

in their tymes, and according to their circumstances, the things
which he had promised to his people? He had said, <hi>Circumcyse me
all your male Children.</hi> This was a signe. And he sayd also, <hi>He
shall Circumcyse your harts and the harts of your posteritie;</hi>
and that is the verie true signification of the signe. Now Iesus
himself was circumcysed, and that was bycause he was borne vnder
the Lawe. But yet hath he circumcysed our harts by regenerating
vs, which is as much to say as he performed the Lawe. And why
should it bee thought straunge that Circumcision is not reteyned
now that the Gentyles are called. Verely bycause there is not now
any peculiar people, nor consequently any peculiar marke to bee
coueted of any one People or Linage, as a seuerall marke of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
betwéene God and them. Also God hath sayd, <hi>Take a Cowe
for a Sinne offering,</hi> And ageine, <hi>Take euery of you a Lambe.</hi>
But he hath sayd lykewise, <hi>The sacrifice that I require is a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

my Christ, who shalbe led as a Lambe to be slayne for you, and
vpon him shall your sinnes be layd.</hi> Therefore the Moother of

but she caried her Sonne with her also according to this scripture.
<hi>Euery manchild that first openeth the womb, shalbe holy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

crucified for our sinnes, wherein he accomplished the onely Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
that had bene betokened by so many Sacrifices in the Lawe,
and therefore he made an ende of all sacryficing and offering of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
as one that came to fulfill the Ceremonies of the Lawe,
and to set vs free and discharge vs of them.</p>
               <p>On the contrarie part, how delt he with the Lawes which were
no signes but matters of substance in deede? It is written. <hi>Thou

land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they haue told you lowd inough by all their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that it behoued you to haue a further reache of mynd, namely
to the things which (as <hi>Esay</hi> saith) neitheir eye hath séene, nor eare
heard, nor heart of man conceiued. The seruice then which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of you is spirituall, and the reward which we ought to looke
for, is spirituall also. But you, lyke Children as ye be, thought not
but (as the most part of you doo still at this day) vpon the body and
the world; whereas GOD spake to you concerning your Soules
and the welfare of them, which lyeth in him. Euen so the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister
promiseth his yoong Scholer a Marchpaine or some other
banketing stuffe to make him to learne; not that vertue shall not
like the Child much bettter, and be a greater reward to him when
he hath atteyned vnto it; but because that if he should talke to him
of vertue or of honour at that tyme, he can no skill of any of them
both; and he would bee the negligenter to his lesson, and the more
vnable to conceiue a greater thing. And truely ye would haue sayd
vnto <hi>Moyses; Let not God speake vnto vs, but to thee;</hi> and yet
was he fayne to couer his face, because ye could not abide it. To
the same purpose doth <hi>Esay</hi> say, that ye were fayne to haue line af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
line, and precept after precept, and lisping Prophets to dallie
with you like newe weaned children, that they might make you to
vnderstand. Also S. <hi>Paule</hi> sayth in the same sence, that ye were
trained vp like babes vnder the discipline and tutorship of the law.
To bee short, all Mankind (after the maner of one only man) hath
his birth, his Childhood, and his youth, and his spirituall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proportionable to euery age, as well as euery of vs hath by
himselfe. Nature ought to be a Lawe vnto vs. And verely GOD
ment to make vs to feele how sore it is corrupted in vs; and because
that in those first ages wee did transgresse it and breake it so many
and so sundrie waies, like yoong Scholers, which (to speake right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
cannot write one right letter without a sample: therefore God
gaue vs the Law written; and there remayned at leastwise so much
conscience in vs all, as that none of vs could say but it was most
iust. Neuerthelesse, it was Gods will that wee should trye our
strength for a tyme in the doing thereof; whereby we perceyued in
the end, that wee could not atteyne thereto, like as the Child that
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:13215:308"/>
indeuereth to followe the Copie of a good Skriuener, and cannot
atteyne to the fashioning of one letter aright, furtherfoorth than his
maister guideth his hand. At length came Gods grace brought by
Iesus Christ, when our accusation (I meane the accusation of all
Mankynd and specially of the Church) was made and concluded
both by Nature and by the Lawe the Interpreter of Nature, and
that so apparantly, as none of vs can denye but that he deserueth
very great punishment, nor any of vs say that he deserueth any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
at the hand of the euerlasting God, whose reward being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
(if I may so terme it) to the giuer, cannot be but euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
So then, Nature hath made man readie to receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law;
the Lawe hath made him readie to imbrace grace: and God (as sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
conuenient to his wise prouidence) hath in this last age of the
world, caused his grace to be brought and preached vnto vs by his
Gospell, euen vnto vs which were as folke standing on the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
readie to bee executed: to the intent that such as perish should
acknowledge his Iustice, &amp; such as are saued should acknowledge
his onely grace in Iesus God and Man, the onely Sauiour and

that we ought to receiue him for such a one, and to imbrace
his doctrine with all our heart. Howbeit to take all cause of doubt
from the Heathen, let vs shewe them yet further, that Iesus is
God the sonne of God, without the testimonie of the Scriptures.
For it may be, that although they will not beleeue Iesus to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
God by meanes of our Scriptures, yet they will beléeue our
Scriptures to be of GOD in very deede, when they shall see that
Iesus is God, whose comming hath bene declared so plainly and
so long aforehand in our Scriptures. But to begin withall, let vs
call to mynd this saying of <hi>Porphyrius, That Gods prouidence
hath not left mankind without an vniuersall cleansing, and
that the same cannot be done but by one of the beginnings,
that is to wit, by one of the three Persones or Inbeeings of
Gods essence.</hi> And likewise these poynts which I haue proued
already, namely, That man is created to liue for euer: That by
his corruption hée is falne from Gods fauour into his displeasure,
and consequently excluded from that blessednes: That to bring
him in fauour ageine, a Mediator must step in, who must be man,
that he may susteine the death which mankind hath deserued; and
God, that he may triumphe ouer death, and decke vs with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
And such a one doe we say the same Iesus is which was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and beleeued on among the <hi>Gentyles</hi> of olde
tyme: And God of his grace graunt in our tyme, to inlighten all

that, (which is a greater matter) in such termes, and with such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities,
as it seemeth to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very Gospel turned into verse, as
though God had meant to vtter his misteries more manifestly by

aforehand, and namely to the hope of the Redéemer. And as for
them which thinke those bookes to haue bene counterfetted in those
<hi>Sibils</hi> names, surely they may more easely say it than proue it; but
I passe not greatly for that. For (as <hi>Suetonius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suetonius in the lyfe of Augustus. cap. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Tranquillus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth)
the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> made them to bee locked vp in
two Cofers of gold, at the foote of the Image of <hi>Apollo</hi> on mount
<hi>Palatine</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> where it was hard for men to haue falsifyed
them. And in the tyme of <hi>Origen,</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
of <hi>Iustine</hi> the Martir, which was not long after the preaching of
the Apostles; those bookes were abrode in the world, as appeareth
by the discourses of <hi>Celsus</hi> the Epicure, who sayth in deede that
they were counterfet, but hee proueth it not. Also the Emperour
<hi>Constantine</hi> in a certeine Oration of his, witnesseth that hee had
séen and read them, and referred the Gentiles of his time to them.
Well it cannot be denied but that there was at leastwise some such
like thing. For <hi>Cicero</hi> in his bookes of Diuination<note place="margin">Cicero in his first booke of Diuination.</note> writeth these
words, <hi>Let vs obserue the bookes of Sibyll. We must name vs
some King, if we will liue in safetie.</hi> And yet all men knowe how
hatefull a thing the name of King was, both to all the <hi>Romaines</hi>
and to <hi>Cicero</hi> him selfe. Also he maketh mention of <hi>Sibils Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke,</hi>
that is to say, of certeyne verses of hirs whose first letters
made the name of that King, of which sort wee haue some in the
eighth booke of the <hi>Sibyls;</hi> wherevpon he concludeth, that they had
a sound and wel setled mynd. Moreouer, the Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
affirmeth, that <hi>Cicero</hi> had translated the booke <hi>Sibyll</hi> of <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi>
&amp; that <hi>Antonie</hi> would haue had it abolished. In these bookes

                  <note place="margin">Cicero in his first Epistle to Lentulus lib. 1. epist.</note> who

                  <note place="margin">Vincent. lib. 11. cap. 50.</note> and one <hi>Verian</hi> a Peinter, and one <hi>Marcelline</hi>
an Orator, became Christians vpon the onely reading and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of those Oracles. And therefore the first writers among the
Christians, as <hi>Iustine, Origen, Clement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iustine in his Apologie. Origen against Celsus. Clement in strom:</note> &amp; such others, doe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Heathen to the bookes of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> because they would
not with their good willes haue beléeued ours; and also to a former
prophesie of one <hi>Histaspes,</hi> which spake plainly of the comming of
the sonne of God into the world, and of the conspiring of all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
ageinst him and his. And therefore all those bookes were
forbidden by the Heathen Emperours, vpon peyne of death. But
God of his wonderfull prouidence had prouided for the Saluation
of the Gentyles, by scattering the Iewish nations with their books
and prophesies, into all the fower quarters of the World; howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
that we reade not of any other Linage or Nation to haue bene so
scattered without losing their tytles, their bookes, their name, and
the very knowledge of their original; which prerogatiue the <hi>Iewes</hi>
had, to the intent they should bee Preachers of the comming of the
Mediator, and witnesses of the antiquitie, trueth, and vncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Prophestes, ageinst the effect whereof neuerthelesse they
set themselues with all their power. For what better witnesses I
pray you could the Gentyles haue; than the Iewes themselues?
namely in that they being the putters of Iesus and of his disciples
to death, were ready notwithstanding to dye for the trueth &amp; sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the bookes wherein he was foreshewed, foretold, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promised

and the giuer of this Lawe; which who will not obey, shall flee
from himselfe as if he disdeined to be a man; which dooing of

were sure to scape all other punishments.</hi> Who seeth not here,
that this Heathen man espyed, that all Lawes of man are but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and that he looked that God himselfe should come openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sight of the world, to giue a good lawe to Mankind? Now,
Iesus hath manifestly giuen this Lawe, causing it to be published
by his Apostles, and their voyce sounded to the vttermost bounds of
the earth. And for proof hereof, what is more conuenient and meete
for man in the iudgement of conscience, than to loue God with all
his heart and all his Soule; and his neighbour as himself? which
yet notwithstanding doth more surmount our abilitie to performe,
and more bewray our corruption, and more condemne whatsoeuer
is in vs of our owne, than doth the Lawe it selfe vniuersally in all
mankind. On the contrarie part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what find we in all the writings
of the Heathen, but a Hireling vertue, and a teaching to cloke vice,
that is to say Hipocrisie? But as this Lawe is verily of God, so
let vs see whether the bringer thereof bee God. And I beseech all
worldly wise men, not to hearken vnto mee by halues, nor to looke

Who seeth not then, in the mightinesse of the one, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
weakenesse; and in the weakenesse of the other, a diuine
mightinesse? Wee woonder at the Conquests of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And
why? Because that beeing but a meane King of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> he
passed into <hi>Asia,</hi> and conquered it with fortie thousand men and no
moe. Had he caryed a hundred thousand with him, we would haue
had the lesse estimation of his deedes. But how much greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
would we haue made of him, if he had done it with halfe his
number? And had he done it with the tenth man, O how we would
haue wondered! And if wee made a God of him for conquering so;
what diuine honor would we think sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for him now? At least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
who would not haue thought him, if not a God, yet (at the
least) assisted with the power and might of GOD? But had these
Souldiers ouercome their enemies by being beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their hands;
had they conquered by causing themselues to bee killed; had they
brought Kingdomes in obedience by submitting themselues to
their Gibbets: had it not bene a cryme to haue left them vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
for Gods? For if betwéene the able man and the vnable
man, the skilfull and the vnskilfull, the difference bee that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
can doe nothing vnlesse he haue very well and abundantly
wherewith: but the skilfull can worke much vpon little, and by his
cunning ouercome the awknesse of his stuffe: What is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwéene the skilfullest man and God, but that the man can
of a little make somewhat, whereas God can of nothing and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
helpe of any thing make great things, yea and euen one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of another and by another? Which is as much to say, as that
he is of infinite power, able to fill vp the infinite distance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:13215:312"/>
contraries, and specially betwéene nothing and something.
Now, let vs see what Iesus hath done; and let vs bring with vs
the same eyes and the same reason, which wee did to the iudging
and discerning of the Historie of <hi>Alexander.</hi> First, our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was borne destitute of al worldly helps. From ten to tenthou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and from tenthousand to ten millions, men doe atteyne: but
who can atteyne from nothing, to so huge a thing? He was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
by a fewe ignorant Fishermen of grosse wit. And yet is it
no small matter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could cause them to giue ouer their Trade to
follow him. But what Instruments were they to make Preachers
to the whole world, being rather cleane contrary to such a purpose?
And to incourage them, he sayes vnto them: <hi>Blessed are ye when
ye indure all maner of aduersities for my names sake.</hi> This
had bene enough to haue driuen them away, and yet they followe
him. At length, he sendeth them of Ambassage to al Nations; And
what was their message? <hi>He that taketh not vp his Crosse and
followeth me, is not worthie of me.</hi> What is he that would at
this day take such a charge vpon him, no though he were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for his labour? <hi>They shall whippe you in their Synagog</hi>
sayth he. Who would vndertake to deale in such a case? Specially
vppon such a perswasion as this, <hi>Hee that will saue his life shall
lose it?</hi> In the ende, he dyeth. And how? Crucified betwéene two
Théeues. Those fewe followers of his are at their wits end. He
leaueth neither Children nor kinsfolke behinde him to vpholde his
sillie kingdome. The kingdome of Heauen that he had talked of,
seemeth to bee buryed in the earth. What worldly kingdome had
not perished in this plight? How long did the throne of <hi>Alexander</hi>
reigne, notwithstanding that it was vphild with the hope of some
Children, with the policie of great Capteynes, with the force of
victorious Armies, and with the very terrour of his name? In the
meane while, those sillie Shéepe of Christ came together, and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and preached to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and afterward to all the world. And
what preached they? That Iesus had bene crucified, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed
them to beléeue in him. If he was a man; what was more
vayne? If he was a God; what was more absurd? Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if they may haue audience, they teach men to suffer for
him: if they be shut out, they will rather dye than forbeare to speake
of him: and if they bee accused for it, they preach their cryme before
their Iudges. Malefactors are tormented to make them tell their
fault, and these are tormented to make them to conceale it. Those
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:13215:312"/>
hold their peace, to saue themselues from death; and these dye for
speaking. Their persecutors crye out, what a miserie is this, that
we cannot ouercome an old man, or a woman? what a shame is it
for vs, to be more wearie of tormenting them, than they bee of the
torments? Yet notwithstanding, in lesse than fortie yéeres y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
is filled full of this doctrine, and the Countries are conquered to
Iesus Christ by those fewe Disciples preaching his bludshed and
sheading their owne, from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to <hi>Spayne,</hi> yea and from
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> to the <hi>Indyes.</hi> And looke by what meanes this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is founded, by the same also is it stablished, and from tyme
to tyme increased and mainteyned. What man (if he knowe how
farre man can extend) can attribute these things vnto man? Hée is
God (sayth a wise man) which doth that which no creature can do:
And who euer did such things either afore Iesus or after him? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, that of nothing can nothing bee made: that in
deede is a rule in nature. But what els are these doings of Christ,
but a making not only of some thing, but also of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greatest things,
of nothing? And who can vyolate or ouercome the lawe of nature,
but only he that created nature? Now God spake the word, and it
was done: this surpasseth nature. But when Iesus sayth, <hi>He that
doth not take vp his Crosse and followe me, is not worthie of
me:</hi> to our fleshly vnderstanding it is as much as if he should say,
<hi>Flee from me;</hi> and yet men followe him, and seeke him. The word
(say I) which were enough to driue vs away, draweth vs vnto
him: by disswading, he perswadeth vs: in turning vs away, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs to him: in throwing vs downe, he setteth vs vp: and in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vs, he maketh vs euerlasting. Who can drawe one contrarie
out of another, as, the effects of water out of fire, and the effects of
fire out of water; but he that made both fire and water? And who
can drawe perswasion out of disswading; and conuerting out of
diuerting; but he that made both the heart of the man that hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and the speech of the partie that speaketh? And what is the
conquering of the liuing by the dying of himselfe and his; but as ye
would say a working of an effect by taking away the cause? What
is this subduing of the world by disarming, tying, and deliuering
of himselfe; but a taking of a way contrarie to his businesse, and a
choosing of instruments most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to his working? And he that
doth a thing by instruments contrarie thereunto, nay rather by
such instruments as are directly hurtfull to it and can no way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it; doth he not shew that he could do it by his only word, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:13215:313"/>
other helpe? But let vs see yet more. It is against nature to
make something of nothing: Here the Philosophers must stoope.
It is against nature to make a thing by speaking the contrarie:
Here the Orators are put to silence. What wilt thou say then, if
besides all this, there bée an extreame resistance in the thing it selfe:
if thou be a Phisition, in the Complexion: if thou bee a Capteyne,
in the Conquest: if thou be an Orator, in the willes of men? <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
did great things with fewe men. I graunt. But if men had
made head against him as they might haue done, in what case had
he bin. Let vs see contrarywise what resistance men made both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
and particulerly to shut Iesus out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doores. If ye speake
of force; he could scarsly preach without perill of death. His Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
could not open their lippes, but thei were by and by whipped,
stoned, racked, crucyfied or burned. The cruellest Emperours, as
<hi>Caligula, Nero, Domitian,</hi> and such others, wrought vpon them
the chiefe déedes of their cruelties. If any of those Emperours
chaunced to bee more mield, O what Iustice vsed he! Forsooth, <hi>If
they bee not sedicious,</hi> (say they) <hi>let them not be sought. But
come they once in Question, wherefore soeuer it be, let them
not escape.</hi> I would fayne learne what sect of Philosophers in all
<hi>Greece,</hi> would not haue ceassed at the least commaundement of a
Magistrate. And of what trueth doe we finde any monuments of
Conquests ouer all the world; but of the trueth of Iesus Christ?
If ye haue an eye to policie; those that followed him were excluded
from all promotions and offices: And what a hell is that to a man
of an ambicious nature? Their Children were prohibited to goe to
Schoole: and what was that but a cutting vp of the tree by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote,
if it had not growen by grace from Heauen? Also certeyne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
Dialogs, forged concerning Pylate and Christ, full of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
lyes and blasphemies, were inioyned to bee read in Schooles,
and to be conned of Children by hart, to steyne the name of Iesus,
and to make it odious and lothsome to all men for euer. And what
more pernicious policie could the Deuill himselfe haue deuised?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> worse than all others, (to whom notwithstanding
he was promised) were false Traytors to him; and whereas they
should haue preached him, they did most eagerly accuse him; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
that there scarsly came any of his Disciples into any towne,
but that they made Hew and crye vppon him to murder him. Nay
(which more is) in euery seuerall persone there was an inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
and an extreame resistance ageinst this word. Yea? [sayd
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:13215:313"/>
men within themselues] shall I beleeue in Iesus? An abiect man?
A crucified God? Shal I beleeue his Disciples, the ofscourings
of the World, and the outcasts of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> Shall I beleeue in
him for a two or three dayes, to leaue behind me a wretched wyfe, a
reprochefull rememberance of myself, and the report of a foole too
my posteritie? If the Emperours made so cruell warre ageinst
this doctrine both by swoord and by their Lawes; we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture
what Warre euery man maynteyned ageinst it in himself.
And if we haue knowen what persecution is, let vs here bethink vs
of the battells betwéene the flesh and the spirit; and of the lyuely and
sharpe arguments which a man in that cace maketh ageinst him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Notwithstanding all this, in the end whole Nations yeelded
themselues to the word of those men, and euen Empyres worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Iesus Christ crucified. If weakenesse wrought this; why did
not force get the vpper hand? If foly; why did not wisdome try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ouer them? If manhod; why did not multitude preuayle?
No surely, it was Iesus the sonne of God, who repayred the world
by his spirit as God had created it at the first by his word. <hi>Cicero</hi>
could not woonder ynough at <hi>Romulus,</hi> for that (sayeth he) in a
time which was not rude, he had compassed so much as to be called
a God. And certesse I maruell at <hi>Cicero,</hi> that he shewed himself so
grosse in that behalf. For if he were called a God, who euer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him to be so? And what was <hi>Rome</hi> at that tyme, and a long
tyme after, but a rout of ignorant and silly Shepherds? But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee may deeme, what iudgment hee would haue giuen vppon
Iesus. <hi>Romulus</hi> was called a God; but the Senate beleeued it
not. The Senate did put the people in feare, and by that meanes
made them to say it. But all the whole Empyre of <hi>Rome</hi> could not
scare one Disciple from professing of Iesus. What resemblance
then is there betweene them two? The same may be sayd of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
as greate an Emperour as he was, when he made men too
woorship him as God. For euen then did his army fall to mutinies,
he lost his estimation, he disteyned his victories, &amp; his owne howse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdseruants
were contented too be beaten rather than they would
knéele downe to woorship him. And asfor <hi>Caligula, Domitian, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus,</hi>
and others, they were Laughed to skorne as long as
they liued; and they were not so soone dead, but their Godheads
were dragged in the myre lyke doggs, and men voutsafed them
not so much as a Tumb to be buryed in. But what say yee to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who being despysed all his lyfetyme, was woorshipped as God
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:13215:314"/>
after his death? Whose Godhead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Disciples preache euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the racke, and whom the very Emperours <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> honored in their harts and woorshipped
as God in their priuichambers? And in what time? Surely in the
Learn eddest tyme that euer was, and in the full florishing state of
knowledge in all arts, skills, and sciences: when <hi>Rhetoryk, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke,</hi>
and all Philosophie were at their pryde; and at such time as
<hi>Magik</hi> and all maner of curious seiences had their full scope and
were at their hyghest pitch. If he be woorshipped for his wisdome;
what a nomber of graue Senators were there at that time? If for
Learning and Doctrine; what a nomber of learned men? If for
Riches and parentage; how would those greate men haue yeelded
to such an ofcast? If for his giltlesse death, why not others also, of
so many which preached him and followed him? And why was not
<hi>Gabinius</hi> woorshipped so to, being a Citisen of <hi>Rome,</hi> a man of
honour, and vniustly crucified, in whose behalf <hi>Cicero</hi> vttered all
the goodly eloquence that he had? Nay surely, they sawe such a
chaunge in the World, so sodeine, so greate, and so vniuersall; that
they could not impute it to any other thing, than to the power and
operation of him that ruleth the world, whose myghty power they
perceyued in Iesus.</p>
               <p>That this so suddein turning of Nations to woorship a man;<note place="margin">Records of the wonderfull proceeding of Christes King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> of
Emperours to reuerence reproche, and of wise men to haue folly (as
sayeth S. <hi>Paule</hi>) in admiration, is verie true: I will take none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
witnesses than themselues. We reade in <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
that the name of Christ was knowen in <hi>Rome,</hi> and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>Italy:</hi> For they persecuted the Christians a fresh contrarie
to the custome of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> insomuch that <hi>Nero</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sueton. in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</note> made them
to be put to the slaughter,<note place="margin">Tacitus lib. 5.</note> as if they had bin the authors of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he himself had caused to be set on fire. And
we reade that in the same time, the Senate made certeyne decrées,
whereby many thousands of Christians, infected with the Iewish
superstition, (for so did they terme them bycause they had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
from the <hi>Iewes</hi>) were banished into dyuers Iles. Which
thing the Senate would not haue done, (considering their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
maner of proceeding in caces of Religion) if the hastie increase
of that spirituall kingdome had not put them in feare. And within
a whyle after, we see how all the Emperours were amazed at this
flocking of people togither vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for counsel how to extinguish
that doctrine; and how fires were kindled ageinst them on all sides;
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:13215:314"/>
and yet how Nations neuerthelesse were shaken at the voice of the
Apostles, and the verie Courts of Princes with their Legions of
Souldyers, were made to inclyne vnto Christ. Sufficient witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
whereof be the Lawes of that age; wherein it was inacted that
the Swoordgirdle of a Souldyer should not bee worne of any
Christian: that they should not beare any office or haue any charge
in the Court, and such other. And <hi>Vlpian</hi> the Lawyer did himself
write fower bookes ageinst the christians. And truely we reade that
a greate many gaue ouer their charges, rather than thei would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Christen fayth. Moreouer in the tyme of <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xiphilus in the lyfe of M: Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius.</note>
there was a Legion that was called the Legion of <hi>Malta,</hi> which
was altogither of Christians; of which Legion hee witnesseth in a
certeine Epistle of his,<note place="margin">The Epistie of M. Aurelius in the Apologie of Iustine.</note> that being vpon a time brought to vtter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
by the <hi>Marcomanes,</hi> this Legion obtayned by prayer beth
Thunder from Heauen ageinst the enemie, and Rayne wherewith
to refresh the whole army, whereupon that Legion was afterward
called the Thunderer. And therefore saieth <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertulian in his Apologie.</note> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
<hi>If as many of vs as be Christians should get vs away into
some corner of the world; ye would woonder to see how feaw
people ye should haue remayning to you, &amp; ye should be fayne
to seeke other Cities to commaund; or rather you to flee away
out of hand and too hyde yourselues; for yee should haue mo
enemyes than Citizens left ye. We haue filled now whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Ilands and Castles; Counselles, Palaces, and Courtes;
Trybes, Legions, and Armyes. What warre were we not able
inough to vndertake, if we listed? And what is it that we might
not bring to passe, dying so manfully and so willingly as wee
do? Nay, the Lawe of our warre teacheth vs to dye, and not to
kill.</hi> Now what kingdome euer had so greate increase, in so short
tyme? But (which is a greater matter) what a thing is it to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
by yeelding, to be furthered by retyring, and to conquer by
dying? We reade of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that vppon a letter
written to him from <hi>Pilate</hi> reporting the miracles of Iesus,<note place="margin">Egesippus in his Auacepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leosis.</note> his

Iesus to bee God; and that the Senate refused it, because
they themselues were not the authors thereof; but that <hi>Tyberius</hi>
abode still in his opinion. And therevpon <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayth, <hi>Goe

                  <note place="margin">Antonine the Emperour in an Epistle of his to the cities of Asia.</note> but to
another end: namely, <hi>because that</hi> (as he himselfe writeth in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of his) <hi>persecution did stablish the Church of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
To bee short, <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dion in the life of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</note> the sonne of <hi>Mammea,</hi> did in his

his<note n="*" place="margin">The deuice was this, Do not to another that which thou wouldest not haue done to thyself.</note> Poesie, and therefore the <hi>Antiochians</hi> called him the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest
of <hi>Syria.</hi> And it is reported that for Christs sake, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Adrian</hi> builded many Temples without Images. Finally,
the good Emperours of <hi>Rome, Vespasian, Adrian, Traiane, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>
the méeke and such others, had Christ in estimation and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of the Christians. But how farre? Surely as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in their hearts that they were good and honest men, and that
Iesus had more in him than was of Man. But yet for all this, <hi>If
they be accused,</hi> (say these good Emperours) <hi>let them bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
if not, let them not be sought.</hi> This is a good proofe and
allowance of their innocencie: but surely it is but a slender reléefe
for them. Contrarywise, the wicked Emperours <hi>Nero, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Valerian, Commodus, Maximine, Decius,</hi> and such others,
condemned them, and by their condemning of them did iustifie
them. For what did they euer allowe, but euill? But what maner
of condemning is this? Kill all, burne all, yea whole Cities, haue
no respect of sex, of age, or of qualitie. Scarcely had the Christians
any breathingtime, but a new counterbuffe came vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they were no sooner from the torture, but they must too it againe.
And yet God did so rule all things by his prouidence, to the intent
the whole glorie in this misterie should redound to himself, that the
mield dealing of the good Emperours did in déede iustifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth,
but yet durst they not aduaunce or further it: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part, the malice of the other sort condemned it and persecuted
it to the vttermost, but yet could they not destroye it. To be short,
in fewe yéeres there passed ten horrible persecutions vppon that
poore Church; and yet in the end the Emperours themselues sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselues to the Crosse of Christ, and their Empyres
sought their welfare there. Therefore we may alwaies come back
to this poynt, That he, yea only he which first created the world of
nothing, when there was not yet any thing to withstand him; is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to recouer the world from Sathan and to subdue it to himself,
without the helpe of any thing, euen by instruments repugnant to
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:13215:315"/>
him, and in despight of the whole world bending itself ageinst him.</p>
               <p>But what will ye say if he subdue, not onely men,<note place="margin">The aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the False Gods &amp; of their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> but also their
Gods? not only the world, but also the Souereynes of the world;
I meane the Diuels which at that time held the world vnder their

That the spirites which had the managing of those Oracles, are

notwithstanding he commonly vpholdeth that all spirites are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
but in déede he should haue sayd that they were shut vp as

<hi>Epitherses,</hi> who sayling néere the <hi>Vrchinyles,</hi> heard (and al those

one of those Iles, which bade them declare that the great <hi>Pan</hi> was

sighing, and lamentations without nomber. Which storie (sayth
he) was reported to <hi>Tiberius</hi> then Emperour; who beeing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to knowe the trueth of the matter, enquired very earnestly
the opinions of all the Philosophers, What that great <hi>Pan</hi> should
be. Now let vs marke that this was done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reigne of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
vnder whome Christ was crucified, and that this <hi>Pan</hi> was one of
the chéef Idols of the Heathen, as appéereth by this his Oracle in

In déede <hi>Apollo</hi> andswered vnto <hi>Diocletian,</hi> that <hi>The Rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

the Rightuous he meant the Christians. Wherevpon <hi>Diocleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
fell to persecuting them. Also the same <hi>Apollo</hi> told <hi>Iulian</hi> (who
would néedes waken him vp ageine by Coniurations) that hee
could say nothing till he had first remoued the bones of <hi>Babylas</hi> a
Martyr of Christs away, which were an impediment to him; which
is as much to say, as he could not ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mouth, but to pronounce
the sentence of condemnation against himselfe. And therefore, <hi>It is
no maruell</hi> (sayth <hi>Porphyrius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Porphyrius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Christians.</note>) <hi>though our Cities bee smitten
with the plague, seeing that Esculapius &amp; the rest of the Gods
are put so farre from them. For since the tyme that Iesus hath
bene worshigped, we haue taken no benefite by any of all our
Gods.</hi> Then let this great Philosopher tell me, whether Iesus
be a Man, and they Gods or no? What maner of Gods are those,
which shrinke away at the presence of a Man? and what a man is
he, that maketh Goddes to hide their heads? Nay further, what a
man is he whose Disciple commaundeth their Maisters, &amp; whose
seruant commaundeth their Gods? Will ye sée how it is the name
of Iesus whereat they tremble, and which they shun? Loe herr the
tryail whereto the Christians submit themselues before the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles.
Let a man</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertullian in his Apologie.</note>) <hi>that is possessed in deed with
a Deuill, bee brought before your Iudgmentseate; and at the
commaundement of the meanest Christian, the Spirit shall
speake, and confesse himselfe to be an vncleane Spirit. Let one
of those folke be brought whom you thinke to be inspyred of
a God; be it the same God that promiseth you rayne, or beeit
Esculapius that playeth the Phisition among you. If hee dare
lye before a Christian, or if hee confesse not himselfe to bee a
Deuill; take the Christian to bee presumptuous, and let him
dye for it out of hand. Now, none will speake his owne shame,
but rather that which may sound to his honour. Surely they
will not tell ye that Iesus is a deceiuer, or of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon stamp
of men, or that he was stolne out of his graue, as hath bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
vnto you: but that he is the power, the wisedome, and
the word of God; that he sitteth in heauen, and that he shall
come to iudge vs; and on the contrary part, that themselues
bee Deuilles damned for their naughtinesse, and wayting for
his dreadfull doome; and that is because that being afrayd of
Christ in God, and of God in Christ, they yeeld to God and
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:13215:317"/>
Christ, and to the seruants of God and Christ.</hi> If <hi>Tertullians</hi>
saying be true, what els is this, but that Iesus commandeth them
as slaues, yea euen by his seruants? Or if it be false, how easie had
it bene for the Heathen to haue giuen him the foyle, by putting the
matter in proof? And why did they not put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christians to shame,
in the open face of the world? Nay (sayth <hi>Lactantius) when they
offered sacrifice to their Goddes, the presence of a Christian
would haue dashed their misteries:</hi> and therevpon came vp this
spéech which we reade in <hi>Lucian:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lucian in his Alexander.</note> 
                  <hi>If there be any Christian here,
let him get him hence.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they asked any question of their
Gods, their spéech fayled them: and it was as easie for a Christian
to driue <hi>Apollo</hi> out of his Priest or Pythonesse, as to driue a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
out of one that was possessed. And <hi>Iulian</hi> himselfe (as <hi>Zosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
dareth not denye) found by proofe in his Magical works, how
weake his Gods were, and how strong Christ is. Moreouer, some
curious Princes haue by their Magicians caused <hi>Iupiter, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
Vulcane, Mercurie, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> himself, that is to
say, the Deuilles that decked themselues with their names) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
which thing they could neuer cause Christ to do, with all the
Coniurations that they had: and that is because all those Gods of
theirs were Deuilles, ouer whom good men haue power by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
them in the name of GOD, and euill men by pleasing
them. But as for Iesus Christ the very sonne of God, he stoopeth
not to any creature, but is serued by Angelles and good men as by
his Seruants, and by Deuils and wicked men as by his Slaues.</p>
               <p>Also at the same tyme that Iesus came, there was scarsly any
Countrie in the world, where these Deuilles had not men offered
ordinarily vnto them in Sacrifice, as we vnderstand by <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
himselfe, and as I haue declared heretofore. But in the reigne
of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> they were forbidden in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and the Priests that
Sacrificed them were hanged vp in their hallowed Groues. And
vnder the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> all Sacrifices and all Idolles were
abolished almost euerywhere. And therfore sayth S. <hi>Austin</hi> to the
people of <hi>Medaure; See how your Temples are partly decayed
for want of reparation, and partly shut vp, and partly altered
to another vse.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. Austin in an Epistle to the people of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daure.</note> 
                  <hi>To worship your Idols, you haue put the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to death; &amp; the Christians by their dying haue cast your
Idols downe to the ground.</hi> And in another place he cryeth out;
<hi>where be your Gods, where be your Prophets, where be your
Oracles, your Bowelgazings and your Sacrifices?</hi> And we reade
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:13215:317"/>
not of any that reprooued him of vntrueth; notwithstanding that
many (and among them one <hi>Zosimus</hi>) bewayleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decay of them;
and yet doth not any of them step foorth for him, to shewe any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynder
of them. And whereas <hi>Iulian</hi> sayth, <hi>As our Oracles are
ceassed, so also be your Prophets:</hi> Let him first shewe vpon what
cause his Oracles are ceassed, which many haue sought and none
yet found. As for ours, they had an eye to Christ, and amed at him
as their marke: and now that he is come, the office of the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ceasseth in the presence of the maister, and the representing of
saluation by Sacrifices ceasseth, because the Saluation it selfe is
come.</p>
               <p>Iesus therefore hath ouercome both the world and the Prince
of the world,<note place="margin">Miracles which could not proceede but from God</note> by a force (in outward showe) cleane contrarie to all
victorie, and by a way contrarie to the end that he intended; that is
to wit by his word, which to the sight of the world is folly &amp; féeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Let vs see now how in his workes he passeth all the abilitie
of al Creatures, according to this saying of his, <hi>The works which
I doe, doe beare witnesse of me.</hi> And soothly it is a myracle that
so many people haue beléeued at the preaching of the Apostles: but
a farre more wonder that so fewe folke in these our daies should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it, though Iesus Christ and his Apostles had neuer wrought
other myracle than that, as I haue often sayd afore. But that they
wrought very great myracles besides, I see fewe of the Heathen
that dare denye it; and against the Iewes I haue sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it alreadie. Wee haue a Letter of Pylats, wherein he witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that Iesus gaue sight to the blynd, cleansed Leapers, healed
them that were diseased with the Palsey, deliuered men from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles,
ouerruled the waters, raysed the dead, and rose againe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
after he had bene dead thrée daies. Also our Diuines of olde
tyme say vnto the Heathen, <hi>Reade your owne Commentaries,
and search your Registers, &amp; you shal finde there the myracles
of Iesus.</hi> And the Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> speaking of him in skorne,
sayth thus; <hi>What hath this Iesus done worthie of memorie or
of any account in all his life; sauing that he cured a fewe blynd
and lame men, and deliuered some from Deuils that possessed
them, in the Villages of Bethsaida and Bethania?</hi> To be short,
as well the Turkes as the Iewes confesse and commend his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
and the Emperours would neuer haue estéemed of him, if it
had not bin for his myracles. <hi>Apollo</hi> himself in his Oracles called
him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to say, <hi>The wise in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:13215:318"/>
workes.</hi> But let vs take <hi>Iulian</hi> at his word, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
will bee enough. Put the case that he had done no more but
cured the blynd, and that he had cured no moe than one. Who is so
blynd, that in this healing of the blynd, seeth not this singuler po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God? Is not the eyesight one of the excellentest substances
in the world? And what is the restoring of sight, but the restoring
of a substance? and what is the restoring thereof, but a newe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therof, euen of nothing? And what can make a substance (how
small soeuer it bee) of nothing, but an infinite power? The which
who can haue, but the only one God? or who can be the instrument
or disposer thereof, but only he that pleaseth God? To be briefe, is
he not without the bounds of nature, which can create a substance?
And whence hath he then that power, but from the maker of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
at leastwise if he be not the maker himself? But our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
wrought infinite myracles, as the Iewes that sawe them haue
witnessed and doe witnesse still; and not only he, but also his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;<note place="margin">Austin concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true Religion.</note>
and not onely his Apostles, but also their Disciples. And in
deede they haue contriued certeyne bookes vnder the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
as dedicated by him to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> conteyning an Arte of
working Myracles; by likelihood because they had seene them pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, howbeit that <hi>Paule</hi> (as is well knowen) kept not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
with Christ while hee liued in the flesh, but persecuted his
Disciples a good while after. And S. <hi>Paule</hi> sayth expresly, that he
himselfe came in signes and myracles: wherein if he lyed, it was an
easie matter to disproue him. Againe, Christ wrought some such
myracles, as <hi>Iulian</hi> being vnable to denye, falleth to rayling and
reuyling him, calling him the greatest Magician that euer was in
the world. And of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> they report that by his Magick he
made the Christian Religion durable for the space of thréehundred
thréescore and fiue yeres, and that he did it without the priuitie and
consent of Iesus. Whence rise these great slaunders, but of the
greatnesse of the workes of Christ and his Disciples? And if they
had not done both great and manifest myracles; had not the shortest
way bene to haue denyed them? But let vs consider of what spirit
these contrarieties procéede. Iesus (say they) did dedicate a booke to
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule:</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> was a persecuter at that time and long
time after. Likewise, <hi>Peter</hi> (say they) stablished Religion without
the priuitie and consent of Iesus: and how then had he learned it
of him? To be short, if there bee any such bookes, why doe they not
shewe them? If they be good, why should they hyde them? If they
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:13215:318"/>
bee euill, why estéeme they him wise? Or if they bee effectuall, why
doe they not put them in practise? As touching this poynt, I haue
answered the Iewes alreadie. But let vs come to the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Magicke neuer florished more in Princes Courts, than in
the tyme of the Apostles. Why did not some bodie step foorth to
vanquish them or to conuict them? <hi>Denis</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> were great
Philosophers; and <hi>Origen</hi> was the Disciple of <hi>Ammonius,</hi> &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowdisciple
to <hi>Plotin,</hi> that is so greatly allowed &amp; so highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them. Were these men such as would suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to bee led with illusions; or attribute that to Gods speciall
working, which depended vppon nature? Specially <hi>Origen</hi> who
had bene trayned vp in <hi>Platoes</hi> Philosophie, and at that tyme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Magicke, as well the naturall by the consent of dispositions
in things, as the deuilish which they call <hi>Theurgie</hi> by entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fellowship and compact with Spirits? <hi>Iulian</hi> also, (who to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the myracles of Iesus, did what he could to reuiue Magicke
by the help of <hi>Iamblichus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi>) did he euer cure a blind
man, or make a lame man goe? Nay, what got he by it, but gastly
feare, such as serued not to heale mens diseases, but to driue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
out of his wits? As for those which attribute the Myracles
wrought by the Christians, to a strong and forcible imagination
so vehemently fixed and fast set in the beléefe that Iesus is God,
that it doth things wonderfull to our mortall nature: therein they
followe the opinion of <hi>Auicen,</hi> who attributeth vnto fantasie or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
the operations that seeme to excéede nature.<note place="margin">In his sixth booke of the nature of things.</note> If it bée
so, I would fayne haue these good Philosophers tell mée, if of so
many phantasticall <hi>Arabians</hi> as haue bent their whole force to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
all their liues long, they can name me one that hath
wrought any myracle? And of them all, who should rather haue
done it, than the author of this imagination? Also say they, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these hath the greater force? an abilitie that is bred in vs, or
a qualitie that doth but come into vs? fire as it is in it selfe, or as it
is in a thing that it hath heated? Now, these Philosophers worke
(as they thinke) by imagination applyed to naturall things, which
imagination is an abilitie bred in man by nature: But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
(say they) worke by an imagination or perswasion that they
haue concerning Christ, which imagination is not naturall, but
commeth from without. Why then did not these Philosophers
worke myracles in naturall things, yea and more euident than the
myracles of the Christians.</p>

denyed, specially at this day. For in our Gospells wee reade his
foretellings, and in the Histories of the Heathen we reade the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of them. What will ryse then of all this? Uerily that Iesus
hath conuerted the World by the bare Preaching of his Apostles,
and by his owne only word; and that is, of nothing to make greate
things. This woord considered in itself, could not but turne men
away from him: and that is a drawing of an effect out of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.

the Lord Iesus had wrought by the Prince of the diuells, [as hee
was slaunderously reported to haue done,] would he haue preached
innocencie and holynesse of lyfe, reuerence towards God, charitie
towards our neybour, yea and that both in word &amp; déede? For who
could euer find fault in his conuersation? And seeing that the Gods
of the heathen were diuels (as I haue proued afore); would he haue
ouerthrowen their Idolls, beaten downe their Altars, abolished
their Sacrifises, shut vp their Temples, and stopped the mouthes
of the diuells themselues? Or if they were Gods, as the heathen
reported them to be; were they not goodly Gods, that would flee
away for the diuell, and rank Traytors to the souereine God, that
would forsake their places, and cast away their armour and weapon
so cowardly? Or if (as the suttlest and cankeredest sort of them do
say) the diuel thought himself more woorshipped in Iesus and more
serued by his alone ageinst the glorie of God, than by all the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that had gone afore; (wherein notwithstanding I appeale to
their owne consciences whether thei speake as thei thinke): would
God (think you) haue giuen his spirit, and committed his power to
the diuell or to the diuells instrument, too procure obedience and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:13215:319"/>
seruice to the diuell? Specially séeing that our Lord Iesus did such
things as surmounted the nature power &amp; reache of all creatures,
and which could not bee done but by or from the Creator himself?
Nay, séeing that God is altogither good; what a blasphemie were
it? And séeing he is altogither wise, what an absurditie were it?
And seeing he is our father, what a contrarietie were it? And séeing
he doeth all things to his owne glorie, how should hee further his
enemie, specially an enemy that laboreth by al meanes he can to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reue
him of his glorie? Surely therefore the woorking of Iesus
was from God and for Gods glorie; insomuch that neither he nor
any of his Disciples, did euer speake vnto vs of any other thing;
and therefore God himself reuenged his death, both vppon <hi>Herod</hi>
that had persecuted him, and vppon the <hi>Iewes</hi> which had betrayed
him (accordingly as hee had foretold them) and also vppon <hi>Pilate</hi>
which had condemned him: and lykewise vppon the <hi>Neroes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitians,
Valerians, Maximies, Diocletians</hi> and such others as
had persecuted his Disciples; the end of all whom cryeth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymeth
with open and loud voyce, <hi>Take warning at vs to deale
iustly and to feare God.</hi> Nay further, this Iesus woorking mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
by the power of God, telleth vs playnly that he was the sonne
of GOD, that the father was in him and he in the father, and that
both of them were one. Also he did oftentymes of his owne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
commaund nature as Lord thereof, and cause men too woorship
him as God, euen among the <hi>Iewes</hi> who abhorred nothing more
than a straunge God. On the other side the Prophets of old tyme
which Prophesied of him, wrought miracles also, howbeit by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vppon the name of God; and lykewise the Apostles that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
him, howbeit in his name: and all they refused the honor that
was offered them, and rent their garmenes when men honored
them, acknowledging themselues alwayes to be but his seruants
and instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his glorie. And had he not bin the sonne of God;
surely in so saying he had not bin Gods seruant, but his enemie, and
a rank rebell and Traytor and whatsoeuer woorse is if any can bee
worse, and consequently vnder the extreme wrath of the creator, as
a persone puffed vp with passing pryde, which is the cause both of
mans falling from his state, and of the diuells condemnation at
Gods hand. Therefore let vs say that Iesus is the Sonne of God
as he himself hath told vs, and that we ought to here him, to yeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Iesus was despised and full of infirmitie: so much the greater is

Battell: how much more commendable had it bene, if he had done
it with a blast of his mouth? If he had liued, he would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered

he had tryumphed ouer the world by dying? <hi>Alexander</hi> increased
his kingdome by oppressing; and Iesus by yéelding. <hi>Alexander</hi>
by killing, and Iesus by dying. But <hi>Alexanders</hi> Empyre decayed
by his death; whereas the kingdome of Iesus was both founded
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:13215:321"/>
and stablished by the death of himself and his. The difference ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
betwixt them is as great, as is betwixt him that dyeth and
him that quickeneth; or betwéene him that of all maketh a thing of
nothing, and him which of nothing maketh all things. To bee
short, if ye looke for vertue; A man that excelled in vertue, was in
old tyme a wonder. The Philosophers themselues (sayth <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Nepos</hi>) condemned themselues in their owne teachings. But
after the tyme that Iesus was once preached, what a number of
men, women, and euen children, in Towne and Countrie, yea and
in Wildernesses, taught vertue to the world by their example? If
ye require rightuousnesse; what were the first Christians but tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of equitie, of vncorruptnesse, and of vprightnesse. Yea what
enemie of theirs doe wee finde, that once openeth his mouth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them? If ye seeke the despising of death; in déede they make a
great a doe of one <hi>Zeno</hi> an <hi>Eleate,</hi> for spitting out his Tongue at
a Tyrant, least he might confesse what the Tyrant demaunded:
and likewise of one <hi>Leena</hi> a woman of <hi>Athens,</hi> that indured all

a matter; what a thing is it, that in one age, ye shal haue whole mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of all fexes, of all ages, of all states degrées and conditions,
go willingly and ioyfully to death: insomuch that the Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Arrianus,</hi> makes a generall rule of it, That all Christians
made in effect no account of death? not to conceale any fault of
theirs, as those others did, who had leuer to haue suffered torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
than to haue dyed: but for professing the thing openly before all
people, which they had learned of God, as folke that would haue
thought themselues vnworthie to liue, if they had hild their peace.
To bee short, what Disciples, what Subiects, what Souldyers
had <hi>Socrates, Lycurgus,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> in all their life, that came
any thing nigh this? these (I say) which were taught, ruled, and
trayned vp by Iesus euen after he was departed hence, and by his
Apostles which were rude, ignorant, and weake as long as he was

               <p>Besides this notable alteration,<note place="margin">The obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologie.</note> I sayd also that at that tyme

that according to the diuersitie of Images in the Skye, there are
also diuers Religions and diuers Goddes in diuers Nations; and
therefore they deuide the world into seauen Clymates, and vn to

And which they are brought into againe euen in despite of them,

commeth it that in the Countries where <hi>Venus, Mercurie,</hi> and

                  <pb n="617" facs="tcp:13215:322"/>For the saluing of this absurditie, they runne into another. Not
the Clymates in very déede (say they) doe make the differences in
Religion, but the great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunctions of the Planets: and yet euen
about this poynt they bee at great oddes among themselues. For
some say that the great Coniunctions of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> and
none other,<note place="margin">Albumazar. Roger Bacon.</note> do dispose of Religion. Others say that properly <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
betokeneth Religion, and that after as he is accompanied, so
bringeth he foorth the diuersities of them; as for example, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed

<hi>Mercurie,</hi> the Christian; and with <hi>Luna,</hi> the Antichristian; and that
there cannot be aboue sixe of them. If I should aske both of them
a reason, or an experience of their saying, I doubt which of them
would be most graueled. But because I will shewe my selfe more
indifferent, I require first that they agree among themselues, to
tell mee which is a great Coniunction, which is a meane one, and
which is a small one: for as yet they varie vppon that poynt. And
likewise whether the nineth house or the seuenth house is the house
of Religion. Herewithall I would haue them to set me downe the
beginnings of the great Coniunctions, that they might iump with
the originall springings vp of Religious and with the chaunges
of them: which thing they haue not hetherto done. Thirdly, if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
depend vppon the Coniunction of the Planets; let them tell
me whither vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ceassing of those Coniunctions, the Religions
shall not ceasse also, or at leastwise anon after, as light fayleth by
the going away of the Sunne: and wherevppon it commeth then
that the Christian, the Iewish, and the Heathen Religions haue
continued so many hundred yéeres, seeing there was neuer any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer

so vniuersall, so speedie, nor so durable; and yet euen by their owne
confession, there was not at that tyme nor neere about that tyme,
any Coniunction either great or small that could be perceiued. To
be short, if only <hi>Iupiter</hi> &amp; <hi>Saturne</hi> be the authors of such chaunge;
which of them maketh the difference in Religions? If <hi>Iupiter</hi>
make the diuersities of them according as he is accompanyed, how

they gaue their iudgment that the Christen Religion should not

And infinite men receyue shape and birth euery hower. Al these are

thou séest them euery day, thou regardest them not; and yet the leasf
of them would make thée to wonder, if it were rare. To succour
thyne infirmitie, the Sunne forgoeth his lyght, a drye sticke flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,
water is turned into wyne, and the dead are raysed to lyfe:
and all this is too shewe vnto thée, that the same power which
wrought in creating things at the beginning, woorketh now still
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer it listeth; and that if the effects liue, the cause of them is
not dead. And if thou shouldest sée euery day some miracle in the
Sunne, in Plants, and in man; surely in lesse than a hundred yeres
miracles would be chaunged into nature with thee, and the helpes
of thyne infirmitie would turne thee to vnbeleef; and to make the

hauing their meate, their drinke, their trayning vp, and their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
altogither of miracle, did in lesse than forty yeres turne
them al into nature; and lyke folke accustomed continewally to phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
which turne their medicines into nourishment of their bodies;
they abused the stayes of their fayth, by turning them into occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

giuen it a Lawe, which Lawe he will haue it to followe. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
sometymes for our infirmities sake he interrupteth it, to

than of the motions of the eyghth Sphere; and we would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
all those interruptions and chaunges, to the nature of nature
itself. Therefore it is both more conuenient for his glorie and more
behooffull to our saluation, that nature should still followe hir na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that miracles should continue miracles still; that is to say,
that they should be rare, as necessarie helpes to the infirmities of

<hi>Iulian</hi> when thou listest: for thou sayest that <hi>Esculapius</hi> the sonne
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke humane flesh to come downe vnto the earth: and
thyne owne Philosopher <hi>Amelius</hi> doth vnder hand approue, that
Gods eternall word toke flesh and clothed himself with the nature
of man, alledging the very words of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> for the matter. To
be short, thou haste a spirit vnited to thy body; thou ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, and yet thou séest it not. And if thou wert lesse than man, thou
wouldest also deny it to be in man: and yet for al that, what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is there betwéene a body and a spirit? And what may seeme
more ageinst reason, than that a Spirit which occupyeth no place,
should not only be lodged, but also imprisoned in a place? But hee
which made both the one and the other of nothing, can do what he
thinketh good with both of them. And seeing that to glorifie man,
he voutsafed to take him vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to ioyne him vnto him,
(<hi>Plotin</hi> saies so, and therefore thou wilt willingly here it and allow
of it:) why should he be lesse able too come downe if he list, and too
vnite and ioyne himself to man vpon earth, if he list to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>
               <p>But why did God send his deare Sonne into the world rather
in that tyme than in any other?<note place="margin">Why Iesus came at the same tyme that he did.</note> Why sent hee him not soouer or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
These are questions for maysters to vse to their Seruants,
and not for silly Creatures to vse vnto God, who by his only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
made vs to be borne, and by his only grace hath begotten vs
new ageine. But (as I haue sayd afore to the <hi>Iewes,</hi>) man liued
for a tyme without the Lawe, too make him too learne that hée was
not a lawe to himself: and a certeine tyme vnder the lawe, to make
him find by proofe that he was not able to performe it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grace was offered vnto him, as vpon a scaffold where he sawe
nothing but death: and so the knowing of nature corrupted made
man the more able to receyue the Lawe; and the Lawe made him
the more ready to imbrace Gods grace. Moreouer it is a woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
confirmation to vs, when we consider that from the beginning
of the World vnto his comming, we haue alwayes had Prophets
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:13215:327"/>
from tyme to tyme, agréeing in one mynd and one voyce, as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds
and Trumpettors euerychone of them, to publish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme
the maiestie of this King, which was to come into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
For had he come anon after the Creation of the World, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of ours had bin greately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, bycause they that were
the first had bin surprysed by his comming vnlookedfor, and those
that haue come after should haue bin in daunger to forget it or to
make the lesse account of it, as though his comming had not belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to them; whereas now all of vs are partakers both of ioye and
of Gods admonitions; both afore the Lawe, for he was promised
to them; and vnder the Lawe, for they lykewyse heard the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petts,
and also in the tyme that he came, for hee himself spake to
them; and finally in our tyme, for his returne draweth nygh. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
it was his will too come in the tyme when learning did
moste florish, and when the greatest Empyre was in the cheefest
pryde, to the end that all worldly wisdome should acknowledge it
self to be foolishnes, and all strength and power acknowledge itself
to be weaknesse before him.</p>
               <p>Now, therefore let vs all conclude, as well <hi>Iewes</hi> as Gentyles,
that Iesus Christ is the eternall sonne of God, the Redeemer, and
the Mediator of mankynd. And let no question or obiection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
vs from it. <hi>Iewes;</hi> for he is such a one as he was promised to
them, borne in <hi>Bethelem</hi> of a virgin of the Trybe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> at such
tyme as the kingdome was gone from the house of <hi>Iuda,</hi> humbled
beneathe all, exalted aboue all, put to reproachefull death for our
sinnes, and raised ageine with glorie to make vs rightuouse. <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles;</hi>
for he did woorks which could not proccede but from God; he
created things of nothing, drue one contrarie out of another, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
the nature of man, and ouercame the nature of Angells:
his doing of which things (beeing not possible too bee done but by
God,) declared him to be very God. And both togither; for all of
vs desire eternal lyfe, al of vs knowe the corruption of our nature,
all of vs perceyue what Gods Iustice requyreth, all of vs find that
we haue néede of his mercy, and all of vs sée that betwéene his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and his mercy, none can (by reason) step in to be the Mediator
but GOD, and to be the Satisfier, but man, euen Iesus Christ,
borne of the virgin, and the sonne of God. And seeing it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the father to giue vs his sonne, let vs imbrace him; and seeing
he hath sent him too bring glad tydings too our Soules, let vs here
him. Finally let vs hearken to the rule and doctrine which he hath
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:13215:328"/>
left vs, that we may indeuer to liue vnto him in all godlynes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that he hath voutsafed of his vnspeakable Loue, to suffer

(for I think I may now so call him
without offence to the <hi>Iewes</hi> or scorne
of the <hi>Gentyles</hi>) he hath not left vs any
of his owne life or doctrine written by
himself. For soothly had he writte it him
selfe, men would haue conceiued some
suspition thereof. Againe, had he set
downe those high things in a high style;
the common sort would not haue vnderstood them: and had he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them in a simple stile, they would haue concluded (for so farre
as they had vnderstood,) that it had bene but the worde of a Man,
and not the word of God himselfe; as wee see it is a very common
fondnesse in the world, to estéeme more of the bookes that are darke
by reason of their ouerhigh style, than of those which stoope as low
as they can to the capacitie of the readers, to instruct them. But his
life and his doctrine be recorded by his Apostles and Disciples as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by his spirit,<note place="margin">The sinceritie of the writers of the Newe Testament.</note> from whom we haue the Gospels, the Acts, and
the Epistles, all which together we call the newe Couenant or the
newe Testament. And whether this Testament ought to be of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
among vs or no; I reporte me to the iudgement of all the
world. For the writers therof liued in the same tyme that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things
were done, and sawe the doing of them. And although that at the
tyme of their writing, they were farre asunder; yet agrée they both
in the Historie and in the Doctrine; and looke what they wrate, the
same did they preach and publish openly euerywhere, euen while
those were aliue which could witnesse thereof, yea euen while their
enemies liued which would haue bin very glad to haue taken them
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:13215:328"/>
with an vntrueth: and in the end they signed it with their blud, and
sealed it with their death in all places of the earth: which thing we
reade not to haue bene done for any other writing or Testament
whatsoeuer, though it came from neuer so great a State or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke,
how authenticall soeuer men laboured to make it. If wee
looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authors, their writing is not to flatter some Prince,
as some doe. For had Iesus bene but a Man, what could haue bin
gained by flattering him when he was crucified? Againe, they were
none such as made their gayne of writing. And such would <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
Tacitus</hi> haue men to beléeue. Nay rather, they gaue ouer
the world, and gaue their owne liues for the things which they
wrate. If ye haue an eye to the style, it is natiue, simple, playne;
preaching Christes Godhead without concealing his infirmitie,
and confessing his infirmitie without graunting away his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
The weakenesse, the curiousnesse, and the ambitiousnesse of
the Apostles, that is to wit of the writers themselues, are registred
diligently there. Of bragging, of boasting, of vanitie, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praise
of Iesus himselfe, there is not one word. <hi>Peter</hi> stept aside, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
his Maister thrée tymes: and <hi>Mark</hi> his Disciple (who wrate
the Gospell vnder him) hath set it downe in writing. <hi>Iohn</hi> and
<hi>Iames</hi> the Sonnes of <hi>Zebedie</hi> desired to sit, the one on the right
hand and the other on the left hand of Iesus in his Kingdome; and
who vrged them to tell such tales out of Schoole, which might
seeme to abate their owne credite and authoritie? Also Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was wearie, and thirstie, and wept: these are infirmities of
man: yet doe they preach him to be God and dye vppon it. Might
thei not haue concealed these things without preiudice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth?
yes to our seeming, and euen with aduauncement thereof; at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if they had not wirtten in the behalfe of the trueth it selfe, and
that they had not bin sure that his mightinesse vttered it selfe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie.
To bee short, they set downe the particularities of tyme,
place, and person, day, Citie, and house. The more particularly
that they declare things, the more easie was it to haue discouered
their vntrueths, and to haue conuinced them. For they spake not
in <hi>Iewrie</hi> of things done in the <hi>Indyes,</hi> but at the gates of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
in <hi>Bethanie,</hi> in <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> and in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it self, in such
a streate, at such a gate, by such a poole and so foorth. The witnesses
were then aliue, the blynd saw, and the dead walked vp and downe
among them. Had the Apostles lyed, how easie had it bene to haue
disproued them? What weapons gaue they to their enemies to
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:13215:329"/>
haue ouercome them selues withall? And yet for all this, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it that of so many Pharisies enraged ageinst them, which
tooke exception so precisely to the healing of a man vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both
day, and to this saying of Christs misunderstoode, <hi>Destroy
this Temple and in three dayes I wil rayse it vp agein;</hi> and of so
many men which were ready both to do euill and to say euill; none
of them all stoode vp to geynsay them? Where was the zeale of
Gods house become at that time, than at the which there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mo zelouse persones to be seene? At leastwise how happeneth
it that in that houge heape of nyne or ten volumes of the <hi>Talmud,</hi>
they bring not foorth their exceptions and geynsayings, ne set vs
downe some Countergospell? Seeing then that Hatred picketh
out proofes and testimonies where none are; and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the extreme hatred of the Pharisies findeth none, no not euen
in the tyme and place where the things were done, and when their
owne authoritie was strongest and at the hyghest pitch: what may
we conclude thereon, but the infallible trueth of the Historie of the
Gospell?</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, let vs yet satisfy vnbeléeuers, by prouing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things
vnto them which they esteeme to be most vncredible in the Historie
of our Lord Iesus Christ. When Iesus was borne in <hi>Bethelem,</hi>
a Starre<note place="margin">The Starre that led the Wise men.</note> (sayth the Gospell) was marked by the wyse men in the
East, the which they followed, and it gwyded them to the place
where Iesus was. Some perhappes will flatly deny this Starre
to haue bin. (Let any man iudge, how little credit to himself and
authoritie to Christ, the Euangelist could haue purchaced by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with a lye which all men could haue disproued, specially
seeing he taketh the Scrybes, and Pharisies themselues to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
therof.<note place="margin">Plinie lib. 2. cap. 25.</note> But we reade that the very same time, (<hi>Augustus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
then the cheefe charge of the Games kept in the honor of his
moother <hi>Venus</hi>) at <hi>Rome</hi>) there was seene a Blasingstarre or
Comet (that is the name whiche they giue too all extraordinarie
Starres) whereof the Preests of that Colledge gaue their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that for the singular markes which it had, it betokened not
warre, plague, or famin, as other ordinarie Comets do; but the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of mankynd to be at hand. And vnto this Comet (bycause
of the rarenesse thereof) there was an Image set vp in the Citie,
<hi>And that onely Comet</hi> (sayeth <hi>Plinie) is woorshipped ouer all
the World.</hi> Whereunto relyeth this verse of <hi>Virgill</hi> in his fourth
Eglog, made to flatter <hi>Augustus</hi> by applying vnto him the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:13215:329"/>
of that Starre; <hi>Behold how noble Caesars Starre steppes
foorth with stately pace.</hi> After which maner hee wresteth vnto
<hi>Augustus,</hi> all the happinesse with <hi>Sibyll</hi> promised by the birth of
the Redeemer. Also <hi>Cheremon</hi> a <hi>Stoik</hi> Philosopher,<note place="margin">Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Celsus.</note> iudged the
same Starre to betoken welfare and happynesse; and thereuppon
perceyuing his Gods to be weakened, he traueled into <hi>Iewry</hi> with
certeine Astrologers, to seeke the true God. And <hi>Chatcidins</hi> the
<hi>Platonist</hi> sayth expresly, that the <hi>Chaldees</hi> had obserued that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened
the Honorable comming of God downe vnto vs, to bring
grace to mortall men. Here the Astrologers had matter whereupon
to excercyse their Contemplations. For this Starre appeared in
December, when the Sunne was in <hi>Sagittarius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marsilius Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Starre that led the Wise men.</note> in which signe
(say they) both <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the Sunne, and <hi>Venus</hi> were met altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
al which thrée (by their principles) betoken a most ryghtuouse,
a most myghtie, and a most mercifull King, but yet poore, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Sunne which was come in betwixt them. How should
he be myghty, if poore? <hi>Frutefull also,</hi> bycause of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the
Angel of the ascendant; but yet baren and Chyldlesse by reason of
the Moone which was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first face of <hi>Virgo.</hi> Of these their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties
we myght, according too their art, gather some profit.
But I will let these curiosities alone too such as delyght in them.
But in very deede, this Starre appearing in December without
rayes, and being healthfull, was not an ordinarie Comet, but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Starre in deede. The lyke whereof we haue seene ourselues in
the same season of the yere, in the yere of our Lord a thousand fiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred
threescore and twelue, the signification whereof God will
reueale vnto vs when he sees tyme. How had the former Starre
bin one of the ordinarie Starres that are fixed in the firmament;
what a miracle was it that it should leaue his place and charge, not
to reigne ouer Iesus, but to serue him? And if it were newly then
created; by whome could it be created, but by the Creator; and for
whom, but for himself? And whereas <hi>Iulian</hi> the Renegate not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to deny the trueth of the Historie, and the cunning of the
Wise men by the gwyding thereof, would beare men on hand that
it was the Starre named <hi>Asaph,</hi> which the <hi>Egiptians</hi> haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to be séene but once at euery fower hundred yeres: besides that
we reade not of any lyke to haue bin séene in all the former ages; it
hath not bin séene any more in these full fiftéene hundred yeeres
which are passed since that tyme. Now by this inquirie of the wise
men, <hi>Herod</hi> was moued to kill all the Children about <hi>Bethelem,</hi>
                  <pb n="632" facs="tcp:13215:330"/>
which were two yéeres old and vnder, meaning among them to
haue killed the Child whom the Starre betokened: in doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
bycause a Sonne of his owne was killed with the rest; we reade
in <hi>Macrobius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Macrobius in his Saturnals.</note> that the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> héering thereof gaue
him this taunt, <hi>I had leuer be Herods Swyne than his Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agein, that Christ should be borne of a Uirgin, they thinke it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
straunge.<note place="margin">Borne of a Virgin. Clement in his Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Petrus Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> I haue discussed this poynt already ageinst the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
GOD had foretold it; and what could then let him to bring it to
passe? For who can dout of his power, when he is sure of his will?
But this was so true, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to the intent he myght
not seeme inferior to Christ in any thing, Preached to his owne
Disciples, that he himself was the sonne of a Uirgin, which thing
Iesus Christ neuer Preached of himself. And wee reade that the
same day that Christ was borne, the Temple of Peace fell downe
at <hi>Rome;</hi> at the laying of the foundation whereof, <hi>Apolo</hi> told the
<hi>Romanes</hi> it should stand till a Uirgin did beare a Chyld; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
they thought it should haue continewed for euer. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Simeon,</hi> who hauing Iesus in his armes acknowledged him
to be the Sauiour of the world, I haue declared what the <hi>Iewes</hi>
say of him.<note place="margin">Iosephus lib. 18. cap. 7.</note> And as for <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> our Lords foregoer, the
Historie of his godly life and doctrine and of his death also, is set
downe after the same maner in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that it is in our Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.
If we consider Christes works, all the whole course of his
life was nothing but myracles, the which I haue proued true long
ago. And this only poynt, namely that they be described &amp; set forth
with so many circumstances, whereunto neuer any man hath yet
presumed to take exceptions, doth sufficiently giue credite to the
matter; and therefore let vs passe vnto his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the sixth hower</hi> (saith our Euangelist) <hi>vnto the nineth

                  <note place="margin">The Eclips. Mark. 27. vers 45. Mark. 15. verse 33.</note> that is to say, at

of all Chronaclers,<note place="margin">Phlegon Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian in the 13. booke of his Chronicles. Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Celsus. Suidas.</note> noteth that in the fourth yéere of the two
hundred and tenth Olympiade, there was the greatest Eclips of
the Sunne that euer was seene, and therewithall a very straunge
Earthquake. And that was the very 18. yéere of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> in the
which yere Christ suffered his passion. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> sayth he had
read the like in the Commentaries of the <hi>Gentyles.</hi> Also <hi>Lucian</hi>
a Priest of <hi>Antioche</hi> cryed out to such as tormented him: <hi>Search
your owne Chronicles, and you shall finde that in the tyme of
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:13215:330"/>
Pylate the light fayled in the chiefe of the day, and the Sunne
was put to flight as long as Christ was a suffering.</hi> And <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertullian in his Apologie.</note> in his Apology doth summon them to the same bookes. Now,
that it was no naturall Eclips, it appeareth playne: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne
was then so farre of from Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction with the Moone, that it was
euen full against it, according to the Lawe of the Passouer, which
was to bee kept the 14. day of the Moone. And if they take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Epistles of <hi>Dennis</hi> of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> wherein he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
the spectacle of this wonder at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth; <hi>Esculus</hi> the Astrologian
a man of small Religion sayth, that at that tyme the Sunne was
in the first degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the Moone was newly entered into
<hi>Libra.</hi> Others say, that the Moone was in <hi>Virgo</hi> and the Sunne
in <hi>Pisces,</hi> which commeth al to one in effect: and therfore that there
could bee no naturall Eclips by reason of this opposition. To bée
short, some say it was vniuersall ouer all the world; and then was
it a speciall worke of God, for the order of Nature can doe no such
thing in the world. Othersome say it was peculiar to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only Land
of <hi>Iewrie;</hi> and then is Gods speciall working yet more manifest:
for it is (as yée would say) a poynting at the cause of the Eclips
with his finger; namely, the suffering of the Sauiour of the world.
And as little also could that Eclips be by the order of Nature, as
the other. For who but onely God could dim the sight and light of
the Sunne in such sorte without a Coniunction thereof with the
Moone, that it should giue light to all places sauing onely <hi>Iewrie,</hi>
as who would say, he sholed out <hi>Iewrie</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the rest of the world?
And as touching the Earthquake<note place="margin">The Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> that accompanyed it, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
<hi>Phlegon</hi> speaketh thereof, ioyning it to the Eclips as our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelistes
doe. And these cases are so rare and vnseene, not in
some one age, but in the whole course of the world, that seeing they
be reported to haue bene in one selfesame yéere, and both together;
they cannot be vnderstood of any other than those which our Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
and Authors speake of. To be short, the Ueyle or Curteine
of the Temple did rend asunder. For the beléeuing or discrediting
of this poynt, there néeded no more but to goe to the place and see
whether it were so or no. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaking of the foreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of the destruction of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> reporteth the like thing.</p>
               <p>Behold, Iesus is now dead: but the third day he ryseth againe,<note place="margin">The Rysing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of Iesus from the dead.</note>
as he himselfe had told aforehand. If he had sayd as <hi>Mahomet</hi>
sayd, about an eight hundred yéeres hence I will come see you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
he had taken a good terme for tryall of his lye. But when he
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:13215:331"/>
sayd I will come againe within these three daies; his deceyt (if he
had ment any) would soone haue bin discouered. Here they crye out
and cannot admit the storie to bee true. And yet notwithstanding
when they reade that one <hi>Erus</hi> an <hi>Armenian,</hi> that one <hi>Aristeus,</hi>
or that one <hi>Thespesius</hi> rose againe to life; they thinke no euill of

of all men without witnesse and vnrequested; and yet no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
can suffice to make them beléeue their owne saluation? Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
sawe Christ, men touched him, the vnbeléeuers felt him with
their fingars; he did eate and drinke and was conuersant among
them, dyuers tymes and many daies: and yet all this they stoutly
denye. But <hi>Pylate</hi> witnessed it; and the Apostles being earst asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at it, did afterward preach it, publish it, &amp; signe it with their
blud. He whom the Chambermayd had made amazed, and who
had denyed him thrée tymes in one hower when he was aliue; doth
preach &amp; publish him euen in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> before the Magistrates,
and before the Priestes; and no threates can make him holde his
peace. If Christ rotted in his graue: what hope of benefite was to
be had of his dead carkesse? Nay if he liued not in <hi>Peter;</hi> who vrged
<hi>Peter</hi> to preach him? And if he spake not in him; who would haue
beléeued him? Who (say I) would haue beléeued it, at leastwise so
farre as to preach and publish it, and to signe and seale it with their
blud, vpon his report, and also after that he was gone? Uerely, the
very slaunderers themselues giue light vnto this trueth. For ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it is that the <hi>Iewes</hi> haue feyned, that his bodie was stolne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
for they found it not there: but <hi>Pylate</hi> prooueth them lyers
expresly. And therevppon also did some of the <hi>Gentyles</hi> surmise,
that they had crucified a Ghoste or Sporne in stead of him: which
thing the <hi>Iewes</hi> vphold to bee very false, who tooke offence at his
death, as which thei knew to be a matter of trueth, in respect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they call him still the Crucified. But hee liued then, and liueth
still for euer and euer. And therefore as he had promised his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
afore his death,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming downe of the holy Ghost.</note> Sainct <hi>Luke</hi> sayth that he sent them the holy
Ghost in firie Tongues within a few daies after his rising againe:
wherby they receiued the gift of Tongues or Languages, yea and
that in such wise, that the same gift came doune vpon many others
by their laying of their hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. This is one of the things
which they will not beléeue, as who would say it were not as easte
for God to giue one man the vnderstanding of many Tongues, as
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:13215:331"/>
it was to deuide one language into so many when he was displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
But if it be a bragge, as they surmise: to what end was it? and
what might haue bin more easely disproued? The Magistrate had
them in his hand: why did he not examine them before the people?
<hi>Hierusalem</hi> was as the Musteringplace of all the East: and where
then might they haue bene disproued and made to recant it? Nay,
the effect that followed vpon it confirmed it. For the Apostles, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but Fisshers, and Publicanes, and at the beginning ignorant
persons, men which ordinarily knewe no more than their owne
moother tongue, and that but grossely; did afterward write bookes,
and trauell ouer the whole world, preaching in all places. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what lyking either the <hi>Iewes</hi> or the <hi>Gentyles</hi> would haue had
of such folke, to haue made them their spokesmen to the people.
And yet the Disciples did it so effectually, that in lesse than fortie
yéeres, the whole world that was inhabited, was replenished with
the name and doctrine of Iesus. How could that haue bin done, if
they had not had an extraordinarie skill of the Languages? Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Historie thereof was so true and so commonly knowne, that
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> to countenance himselfe withall, reported himselfe
to bée the same that came downe vpon the Apostles in firie tungs,
vnder pretence that by the helpe of the Deuill, he counterfetted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a sort the gift of tongues.</p>
               <p>And as for some searchers and sisters of words, it is not for them
to carpe at the Hebrewe phrases which they finde in our Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes;
seeing that in <hi>Horace</hi> or in <hi>Virgill</hi> they count Gréeke phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for an elegancie. For to the intent they may perceiue that it is
done to expresse Christes matters the more pithily, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them the more néerely: let them reade S. <hi>Paule.</hi> and there they
shall finde so fayre a Gréeke tongue, so full of pithie wordes, so
full of excellent and chosen phrases, and so peculiar to the Gréeke
tongue it selfe, that the best learned doe confesse he had the very
ground of it, and alledge him for an example of eloquence. Let vs
come to the historie of him. This S. <hi>Paule</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielles,</hi>
was sent with Commission to persecute the Christians. In
his way (sayth <hi>Luke</hi>) a light shone about him,<note place="margin">Acts. 9. &amp; 22.</note> and being smitten
to the ground, he heard this voyce, <hi>Saule, Saule, why persecutest
thou me.</hi> To bee short, of a Iewe he became a Christian: and of a
Persecuter, a Martir.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 8. 2. Cor. 12. 2. The Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. Paule,</note> And if thou beléeuest not S. <hi>Luke;</hi> S. <hi>Paule</hi>
himselfe toucheth his owne historie in diuers places. What hath
vnbeléefe to bring against this, saue onely peraduenture a bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:13215:332"/>
according to common custome? If <hi>Peter</hi> sawe it: he is but a
Fissherman say they. If <hi>Paule</hi> heard it: he is an Orator. So then
belike, if God offer thee his grace in an earthen vessell, thou misly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
of it: and if he offet it thee in a vessell of some valewe, thou sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectest
it: eyther the one is beguyled, or the other beguyleth thee,
sayest thou. What wilt thou haue God to doe to make thee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
him? Examine this case well. <hi>Paule</hi> in the way to growe
great, he is in good reputation with the Magistrate &amp; the Priestes,
and sodeinly he chaungeth his Copie out of one extremitie into an
other, to bee skorned, scourged, cudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Put the case that neither S. <hi>Luke</hi> nor S. <hi>Paule</hi> did tell thee the
cause thereof. What mayst thou imagine, but that it was a very
great and forcible cause, that was able to chaunge a mans heart so
sodeynly and so straungely? Is it not daylie s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that men are soone changed and vpon light causes? Yes, fooles are.
But he debateth the matter, he vrgeth his arguments, and he dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his conclustons to an ende. The best learned of his enemies
finde fault with his misapplying (as they terme it) of his skill, and
yet commend his writings. Yea, and he knoweth that vnto thee
his preaching will seeme folly, and yet that (as much folly as it is)
it is the very wisedome of God; and that by following it he shall
haue nothing but aduersitie, and yet for all that, he doth not giue it
ouer. How shall he be wise, that counteth himselfe a foole? or rather
which of the wiser sort is not rauished at his sayings and doings?
But if he be wise, learned, and weladuised as thou seest he is; what
followeth but that his chaunge proceedeth of some cause? And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chaunge was great, the cause must néedes be great also: and
seeing it was extreame and against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; surely it must needes
proceede of a supernaturall and souereine cause. Uerely the reason
that leadeth thee to this generall conclusion, ought to leade thee
to the speciall also: that is to wit, that it was a very great and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
cause that moued him: namely, the same which Sainct
<hi>Luke</hi> rehearseth, and which he himselfe confirmeth in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for the which he estéemeth himselfe right happie to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Theatre being full, clad in robe or cloath of Siluer, which by
the stryking of the Sunnebeames vppon it, made it the more
stately. Then began certeyne Clawbacks to call him God, and
to pray him to bee gracious vnto them. But forasmuch as he
did not refuse that flatterie, he sawe an Owle sitting vpon his
head, and by and by he was taken with so straunge torments,
that within feawe daies after he dyed, acknowledging Gods
iudgement vpon him, and preaching thereof to his flatterers.</hi>
This Historie is set out more at large by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> which in effect
is all one with that which is written by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who sayeth that
the people cryed out, <hi>It is the voyce of God, and not of a man:</hi>
and that thervpon an Angell of God strake him, and he was eaten
with wormes, and so dyed. These bee the things which they finde
scarce credible in the historie of our Euangelistes: which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the histories of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles,</hi>
who report the things with words full of admiration, which
our Euangelistes set downe simply after their owne maner. And
seeing that in these things, which exceede nature, they bee found
true; what likelyhoode is there that they should not also deliuer vs
Christes doctrine truely; specially being (as I haue shewed afore)
miraculously assisted with the power of his spirit according to his
promisses, and moreouer hauing witnessed the sinceritie of their
writings, by suffering so many torments, and in the end death?
Seeing then that the new Testament conteyneth the trueth of the
doctrine of Iesus, and proceeded from the spirit of Iesus, whom I
haue shewed to be the Sonne of God; what remayneth for vs, but
to imbrace the Scriptures as the worde of life and Soulehealth,
and as the will of the Father declared vnto vs by his Sonne, and
to liue thereafter, and to dye for the same; considering that by the
same wee shall be raysed one day to glorie, and reigne with him for
euer?</p>
               <p>But forasmuch as we make mention of rysing ageine from the

Lawe on them both togither, so as they must suffer togither and

this lyfe: and what Iustice then were it to separate them in another
lyfe? He will do it: for he made the whole man; who if he were but

saue the Soule, it had bin inough for him too haue taken but a
Soule: but he that made the whole man, will also saue the whole
man. To be short; he will do it; for he hath sayd it: and he will doo
it; for he hath done it already. He hath sayd it by his Sonne, and he
hath also done it in his Sonne, and his sonne adorneth vs with his
victorie; and he will surely adorne vs with his glorie. Looke vpon
the grayne that is cast into the ground; if it rotte not, it springeth
not vp; if it spring not vp, it yeldeth no foyson. Agein, of one graine,
come many Eares of Corne; of a kernell, a goodly Tree; of a thing
of nothing (as yée would say) a perfect liuing Creature. Which of
all these things resembleth the thing that commeth thereof, eyther
in substance, or in shape, or in quantitie, or in qualitie? To be short,
what straungenesse is there in this? Of a handfull of Earth God
made thée, and all the Earth of nothing, and of a handfull will he
make thée new ageine? This body of thine which in time past was
not, is of his making; this body which one day shall ceasse to be, he
wil one day make new agein. Uerily this doctrine was common to
all true <hi>Iewes,</hi> and among all the Teachers of the Lawe, who had
gathered it out of the old Testament, (as we reade in <hi>Iosephus</hi>
and in the Acts of the Apostles) for they agrée fully with S. <hi>Paule</hi>
in that behalf. And in the <hi>Talmud</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Talmud. cap. Helec. treatise. Sanhedrin.</note> there are infinite places thereof.

Neither would our owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences sumon vs so often as they do,
if we were not to appeare before other than men. For sith it is the
Soule that cheefely receyueth the Commaundement and cheefely

tryall; which cannot be done in this world, wherein there is but a
shadowe of Iustice, and whose Lawes and Iudges extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

lyfe:<note place="margin">Chapt. 14. and 15.</note> that in that lyfe is the souereine welfare or good, which alonly
can content mans will, and satisfie, his wit;<note place="margin">Chapt. 18. 19.</note> and therefore that he
must tend and indeuer thither with all his heart and bend all the
powers of his wit to that end: And to be short, that the meane for
man to atteine thereunto,<note place="margin">Chapt. 20.</note> is to serue the true God with al his hart,
with all his Soule, and with all his strength; that is to say, to vow
all his thoughts wordes and déedes to the glorie of God. But I
sayd also that man is falne from his Originall,<note place="margin">Chapt. 16 17. 20.</note> through the pryde
and disobedience of the first man, whereuppon hath followed fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
in his will, and ignorance in his wit: Ignorance making
him vnable to discerne his owne welfare, and frowardnes turning
him away from it, yea euen when it is shewed him, and making
him vnwoorthy to atteyne to it, and finally causing him to abuse
his abilities and powers to all euill, and so consequently plunging
him in the gulf of al miserie, both according to his owne desert, and
according to the Iustice of God; Whereuppon it insueth that man
is forlorne in himself, vnlesse God recouer him by his mercy; blind,
except God inlyghten him ageine; vtterly Lame to the doing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good, and to the atteynement of any good, vntill Gods grace do
releeue him.<note place="margin">Chapt. 20.</note> And therefore I sayd, That he hath left vs a Religion
for a guyde, A Religion that turneth vs from all Creatures, as
which are but vanitie; and conuerteth vs to him the only Creator

of Heauen and Earth; and that the same is the Religion of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelytes;</hi>

and that in al other places there was nothing but the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of Diuells, and Idolatrie. That the Religion of <hi>Israell</hi> had
the kéeping and custodie of his word, his reuelations, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
