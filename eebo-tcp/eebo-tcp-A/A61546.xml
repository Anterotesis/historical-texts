            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It being the main thing struck at by those who are the followers of that noted <hi>Physitian,</hi> who handled the <hi>Church</hi> so ill, as to deprive her of her <hi>expulsive</hi> faculty of <hi>Noxious humours,</hi> and so left her under a <hi>miserere mei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall therefore endeavour to give the <hi>Church</hi> her due, as well as <hi>Caesar</hi> his,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> by making good this following <hi>principle</hi> or <hi>hypothesis,</hi> upon which the whole <hi>hinge</hi> of this controversie <hi>turnes,</hi> viz. <hi>that the power of inflicting censures upon offenders in a Christian Church, is a fundamentall right, resulting from the constitution of the Church, as a society by Jesus Christ, and that the seat of this power is in those Officers of the Church, who have derived their power originally from the Founder of this society, and act by vertue of the Laws of it.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note>For the cleare <hi>stating</hi> of this <hi>controversie,</hi> it will bee necessary to explain, what that <hi>Power</hi> is, which I attribute to the <hi>Church,</hi> and in what notion the <hi>Church</hi> is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it <hi>Exerciseth</hi> this Power. <hi>First,</hi> concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of <hi>Power,</hi> by it I cannot see any thing else to bee understood, then <hi>a right of Governing, or ordering things which belong to a Society.</hi> And so <hi>Power</hi> implies only a <hi>moral faculty</hi> in the person enjoying it, to take care <hi>ne quid civitas detrimenti capiat,</hi> whereby it is evident that every well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted

Society must suppose a Power within its self of ordering things belonging to its welfare, or else it were impossible, either the <hi>being</hi> or the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of a <hi>Society</hi> could bee long preserved. <hi>Power</hi> then in its general and abstracted notion, doth not necessarily import either <hi>meer authority,</hi> or <hi>proper coaction,</hi> for these to any impartial judgement, will appear to bee rather the severall <hi>modes</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by power is exercised, then any proper ingredients of the <hi>specifick nature</hi> of it; which in generall, imports no more then <hi>a right to Govern a constituted Society,</hi> but how that right shall bee exercised, must bee resolved not from the notion of Power, but from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>constitution</hi> of that particular Society in which it is <hi>lodged</hi> and <hi>inherent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears then from hence to bee a great <hi>mistake</hi> and abuse of well natured readers,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> when all <hi>Power</hi> is necessarily restrained, either to that which is <hi>properly coercive,</hi> or to that which is <hi>meerly arbitrary</hi> and onely from consent. The originall of which mistake is, the stating the notion of <hi>Power</hi> from the use of the <hi>Word,</hi> either in ancient <hi>Roman authors,</hi> or else in the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> both which are freely acknowledged to bee strangers to the exercise of any other <hi>Power,</hi> then that which is <hi>meerly authoritative</hi> and <hi>perswasive,</hi> or that which is <hi>Coactive</hi> and <hi>Penal.</hi> The ground of which is, because they were ignorant of any other way of <hi>conveyance</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> besides <hi>external force</hi> and <hi>arbitrary consent,</hi> the one in those called <hi>Legal Societies</hi> or <hi>Civitates,</hi> the other <hi>Collegia</hi> and <hi>hetaeriae.</hi> But to us that do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>God</hi> hath a <hi>right</hi> of <hi>commanding</hi> men to what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hee please himself, and <hi>appointing</hi> a <hi>Society</hi> upon what terms best please him, and giving a <hi>Power</hi> to particular <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> that <hi>Society,</hi> in what <hi>way</hi> shall tend most to <hi>advance</hi> the honour of such a <hi>Society,</hi> may easily bee <hi>made appear,</hi> that there is a kind of <hi>power</hi> neither properly <hi>coactive</hi> nor meerly <hi>arbitrary,</hi> viz. such a one as <hi>immediately results</hi> from <hi>Divine institution,</hi> and doth suppose <hi>consent</hi> to submit to it as a <hi>necessary Duty</hi> in all the <hi>members</hi> of this <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Power,</hi> it is evident,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> is not <hi>meerly arbitrary</hi> either in the <hi>Governours</hi> or <hi>members,</hi> for the <hi>Governours</hi> derive their <hi>Power,</hi> or right of Governing from the <hi>institution</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>

and are to bee <hi>regulated</hi> by his <hi>Laws</hi> in the <hi>execution</hi> of it, and the <hi>members,</hi> though their <hi>Consent</hi> bee <hi>necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</hi> yet that <hi>consent</hi> is a <hi>Duty</hi> in them, and that duty doth imply their <hi>submission</hi> to the <hi>Rulers</hi> of this <hi>Society</hi>: neither can this power bee called <hi>coactive,</hi> in the sense it is commonly taken, for <hi>coactive power,</hi> and <hi>external force</hi> are necessary <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relates</hi> to each other, but wee suppose no such thing as a power of outward <hi>force</hi> to bee given to the <hi>Church</hi> as such, for that properly belongs to a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> But the power which I suppose to bee lodged in the <hi>Church,</hi> is such a power as <hi>depends</hi> upon a <hi>Law</hi> of a <hi>superiour, giving right to Govern, to particular persons over such a Society, and making it the Duty of all members of it to submit unto it, upon no other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, then the exclusion of them from the priviledges, which that Society enjoys.</hi> So that supposing such a <hi>Society,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> is, to bee of <hi>Divine institution,</hi> and that <hi>Christ</hi> hath appointed <hi>Officers</hi> to rule it, it necessarily follows, that those <hi>Officers</hi> must <hi>derive</hi> their <hi>Power,</hi> i. e. their right of Governing this Society, not meerly from <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>confederation</hi> of parties, but from that <hi>Divine institution,</hi> on which the Society depends. The want of understanding the right notion of power in the sense here set down, is certainiy the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Erastianisme,</hi> and that which hath given occasion to so many to question any such thing as <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> especially, when the more <hi>zealous</hi> then <hi>judicious</hi> defenders of it have rather chosen to <hi>hang</hi> it upon some <hi>doubtful places</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> then on the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> as a <hi>Society instituted</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being then the nature of <hi>power</hi> in general, it is, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose clear,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> that an outward coactive <hi>force</hi> is not <hi>necessary</hi> in order to it; for if some may have a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>govern,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may bee obliged to obedience to those <hi>persons antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,</hi> to any <hi>civil constitution</hi>; then such persons have a <hi>just power,</hi> to <hi>inflict censures</hi> upon such as transgress the rules of the society, without any outward force.

my self with the event of such things as depend upon <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institutions.</hi> I know it is the great <hi>objection</hi> of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Erastus,</hi> that <hi>Church censures</hi> are <hi>inflicted</hi> upon <hi>persons</hi> unwilling to receive them, and therefore must imply <hi>external</hi> and <hi>coactive force,</hi> which is repugnant to the nature of a <hi>Church.</hi> But this admits (according to the principles here established) of a very easie <hi>solution</hi>; for I deny not, that <hi>Churchpower</hi> goes upon <hi>consent,</hi> but then its very plain here was an <hi>antecedent consent</hi> to <hi>submit</hi> to <hi>censures</hi> in the very <hi>entrance</hi> into this <hi>Society,</hi> which is sufficient to denominate it a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act</hi> of the persons undergoing it; and my reason is this, every person entring into a Society, <hi>parts</hi> with his own <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> as to <hi>matters</hi> concerning the <hi>governing</hi> of it, and <hi>professeth submission</hi> to the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> of it: now a man having <hi>parted</hi> with his freedome already, cannot <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume it</hi> when hee please, for then hee is under an <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>stand</hi> to the <hi>Covenants</hi> made at his <hi>entrance</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his <hi>undergoing</hi> what shall bee laid upon him by the <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>society,</hi> must bee supposed to bee <hi>voluntary</hi> as <hi>depending</hi> upon his <hi>consent</hi> at first entrance, which in all soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties must bee supposed to hold still, else there would follow nothing but <hi>confusion</hi> in all <hi>Societies</hi> in the world, if every man were at liberty to <hi>break</hi> his <hi>Covenants</hi> when any thing comes to lye upon him according to the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> which hee out of some private <hi>design</hi> would bee <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>undergo.</hi> Thus much may serve to settle aright the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>power;</hi> the want of understanding which, hath caused all the confusion of this controversie.</p>

That one <hi>Phrase</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> so frequently used by our <hi>blessed Saviour,</hi> of <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven</hi> (importing a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel state</hi>) doth evidently <hi>declare</hi> a <hi>society,</hi> which was consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him, on the <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Gospel Covenant.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should our <hi>Saviour</hi> call <hi>Disciples,</hi> and make <hi>Apostles,</hi> and send them abroad with full <hi>commission</hi> to <hi>gather</hi> and <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate Disciples</hi> by <hi>Baptism</hi>; did hee not intend a <hi>visible society</hi> for his <hi>Church?</hi> Had it not been enough for men to have <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially beleeved</hi> the truth of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but they must bee <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd</hi> in a <hi>solemn visible way,</hi> and <hi>joyn</hi> in <hi>participation</hi> of <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Symbols of bread and wine,</hi> but that our <hi>Saviour</hi> required <hi>external profession</hi> and <hi>society</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> as a necessary <hi>duty,</hi> in order to <hi>obtaining</hi> the <hi>priviledges</hi> conveyed by his <hi>Magna Charta</hi> in the <hi>Gospel. I would fain know, by what argument wee can prove, that any humane Legislator, did ever intend a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to bee governed according to his mode,</hi> by which wee cannot prove that <hi>Christ by a positive Law, did command such a society, as should be governed in a visible manner, as other societies are?</hi> Did he not appoint officers himself in the <hi>Church,</hi> and that of many <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>degrees?</hi> Did hee not <hi>invest</hi> those <hi>officers</hi> with <hi>authority</hi> to rule his <hi>Church?</hi> Is it not laid as a <hi>charge</hi> on them, <hi>to take heed to that flock over which God had made them Overseers?</hi> Are there not <hi>Rules</hi> laid down for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106329:9"/>
the peculiar <hi>exercise</hi> of their <hi>Government</hi> over the <hi>Church</hi> in all the <hi>parts</hi> of it? Were not these <hi>officers</hi> admitted into their <hi>function</hi> by a most <hi>solemn visible</hi> rite of <hi>imposition</hi> of <hi>hands</hi>? And are all these solemn <hi>transactions</hi> a meer peece of <hi>sacred Pageantry</hi>? and they will appear to bee <hi>little more,</hi> if the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> bee a <hi>meer arbitrary</hi> thing, depending onely upon <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>confederation,</hi> and not <hi>subsisting</hi> by <hi>vertue</hi> of any <hi>Charter</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> or some <hi>positive Law,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all <hi>Christians</hi> to joyn in <hi>Church Society</hi> together.</p>
            <p>But if now from hence it appears (as certainly it cannot but appear) that this <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>subsist</hi> by vertue of a <hi>Divine positive Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> then it must of <hi>necessity</hi> be <hi>distinct</hi> from any <hi>civil Society,</hi> and that on these <hi>accounts, First</hi> because there is an <hi>antecedent obligation</hi> on <hi>conscience</hi> to <hi>associate</hi> on the <hi>account</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> whether <hi>Humane Laws prohibit</hi> or <hi>command</hi> it. From whence, of necessity it follows, that the <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is really different from that of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; because whether the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> bee for, or against this <hi>Society,</hi> all that own ir are <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>profess</hi> it openly, and declare themselves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. Whereas were the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth really</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> all <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>Church Society</hi> would arise meerly from the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi> But now there being a <hi>Divine Law, binding</hi> in <hi>conscience,</hi> whose <hi>obligation</hi> cannot bee <hi>superseded</hi> by any <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law,</hi> it is plain and evident, where are such vastly <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent obligations,</hi> there are different <hi>Powers</hi>; and in this sense I know no <hi>incongruity</hi> in admitting <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi> if by it wee understand no <hi>external coactive power,</hi> but an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power laying obligation on conscience, distinct</hi> from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <hi>lodged</hi> in a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> considered as such. An <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coactive power</hi> was alwayes <hi>disowned</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> but certainly not an <hi>internall Power</hi> over <hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> all his <hi>Disciples</hi> to what <hi>Duties</hi> hee thought fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> I argue from those <hi>Officers,</hi> whose <hi>rights</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> this Society are <hi>founded</hi> on that <hi>Charter,</hi> whereby the <hi>Society</hi> its self subsists. Now I would willingly know why, when <hi>our Saviour</hi> disowned all <hi>outward power</hi> in the world, yet he should <hi>constitute</hi> a <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>appoint Officers</hi> in it, did hee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106329:9"/>
not <hi>intend</hi> a peculiar <hi>distinct Society</hi> from the other <hi>Societies</hi> of the world. And therefore the argument frequently used against <hi>Church-power,</hi> because it hath no <hi>outward force</hi> with it by the <hi>constitution</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is a strong <hi>argument</hi> to mee of the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of a <hi>Christian Society</hi> from a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> because <hi>Christ</hi> so <hi>instituted</hi> it, as not to have it Ruled at <hi>first</hi> by any <hi>outward force</hi> or <hi>power.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> saith his <hi>Kingdome was not of this world</hi>; hee implies, that hee had a <hi>Society</hi> that was <hi>governed</hi> by his <hi>Laws</hi> in the world, yet <hi>distinct</hi> from all <hi>mundane Societies</hi>: had not <hi>our Saviour</hi> intended his <hi>Church</hi> to have <hi>been</hi> a <hi>peculiar Society,</hi> distinct from a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> why <hi>our Saviour</hi> should <hi>interdict</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> the <hi>use</hi> of a <hi>civil coactive power</hi>: Or why instead of <hi>sending abroad Apostles</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> hee did not imploy the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Common-wealths</hi> to have inforced <hi>Christianity</hi> by <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>temporal edicts,</hi> and the <hi>several Magistrates</hi> to have impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red several <hi>persons</hi> under them to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> in their several <hi>Territories?</hi> And can any thing bee more plain, by our <hi>Saviours</hi> taking a contrary <hi>course,</hi> then that hee <hi>intended</hi> a <hi>Church Society</hi> to bee <hi>distinct</hi> from <hi>civil,</hi> and the power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, (as well as the <hi>Officers</hi>) to bee of a <hi>different</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from that which is <hi>settled</hi> in a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> I here suppose, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath by a <hi>positive Law</hi> established the <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> upon <hi>Officers</hi> of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which I have largely proved elsewhere,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iren. p.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suppose it now. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I argue from the peculiar <hi>rights</hi> belonging to these <hi>Societies.</hi> For if every one <hi>born</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> have not thereby a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; nor every <hi>one</hi> by being of the <hi>Church,</hi> any <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>benefits</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that these are <hi>distinct</hi> from one another. If any one by being of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> hath <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Church priviledges,</hi> then <hi>every one born in a Common-wealth may challenge a right to the Lords Supper</hi> without <hi>Baptism</hi> or open <hi>professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> which I cannot think any will bee very <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>grant.</hi> Now there <hi>being</hi> by <hi>Divine appointment</hi> the several <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>Baptisme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> as peculiar <hi>badges</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>visible Society,</hi> it is evident, <hi>Christ</hi> did intend it a <hi>Society distinct</hi> from the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I argue from the different <hi>ends</hi> of these <hi>societies,</hi> a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> is <hi>constituted</hi> for <hi>civil ends,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>spiritual</hi>: for <hi>ends</hi> are to be <hi>judged</hi> by the <hi>primary constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but now it is <hi>plain,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of civil <hi>society</hi> is for <hi>preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of mens rights as men (therefore <hi>Magistracy</hi> is called by St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) but this <hi>Christian society</hi> doth not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect men</hi> under the <hi>connotation</hi> of men but as <hi>Christians.</hi> The answer given to this is very short, and insufficient when it is said, that every man in a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> is to act upon <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> accounts and ends: For there is a great deal of <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Christianities</hi> having an influence upon mens <hi>actings</hi> in a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> and making a <hi>society</hi> the same with a <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> To <hi>argue</hi> therefore from one to another, is a <hi>shortness</hi> of <hi>discourse</hi> I cannot but <hi>wonder</hi> at: unless it could bee proved, that <hi>Christianity</hi> aimed at <hi>nothing</hi> else but <hi>regulating men</hi> in the <hi>affairs</hi> of a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> which is a taske I suppose will not bee undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I argue from the <hi>peculiar offences</hi> against this <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> which <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>may bee distinct</hi> from <hi>those</hi> against a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, I deny not, but most times they are the same</hi>; but <hi>frequently</hi> they <hi>differ,</hi> and when they are the <hi>same,</hi> yet the <hi>consideration</hi> of <hi>them</hi> is <hi>different</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,</hi> for which I shall suppose the <hi>six arguments</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the last <hi>Chapter</hi> of the first part to stand good,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iren. p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. §. 4.</note> which will strongly hold to <hi>excommunication</hi> in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> though there produced only for the <hi>Jewish.</hi> I would fain know what is to bee done in many <hi>offences,</hi> known to bee <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and which tend to the <hi>dishonour</hi> of the <hi>Christian society,</hi> which the civil and <hi>Municipal Laws,</hi> either do not, or may not take <hi>cognizance</hi> of? Thus much may serve, as I think to make evident, that the <hi>Church</hi> in it's own <hi>nature</hi> is a <hi>peculiar society distinct</hi> from a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> which was the first <hi>proposition</hi> to bee proved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, <hi>That the power of the Church over it's mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in case of offences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> 
               <hi>doth not arise meerly from confederation and consent, though it doth suppose it.</hi> This <hi>Church power</hi> may bee considered <hi>two waies.</hi> Either, <hi>first,</hi> as it implies the <hi>right in some of inflicting censures.</hi> Or <hi>secondly, as it implies in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the duty of submitting to censures inflicted</hi>; now as to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106329:11"/>
both these, I shall prove that their <hi>original</hi> is higher than meer <hi>confederation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the right of inflicting censures,</hi> on these accounts. <hi>First,</hi> what ever <hi>society</hi> doth <hi>subsist</hi> by <hi>vertue</hi> of a <hi>divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> doth by vertue thereof <hi>derive</hi> all <hi>power</hi> for it's <hi>preservation,</hi> in <hi>peace, unity,</hi> and <hi>purity</hi>; but it is plain, that a <hi>power of censuring offenders,</hi> is necessary for the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es preservation in peace</hi> and <hi>purity</hi>; and it is already proved, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath it's <hi>Charter</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore from him it hath a <hi>power</hi> to inflict <hi>punishments</hi> on <hi>offenders,</hi> suitable to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>society</hi> they are of. I am very prone to think that the <hi>ground</hi> of all the <hi>mistakes</hi> on this <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> have risen from hence, that some, <hi>imprudently</hi> enough, have fixt the <hi>original</hi> of this power on some <hi>ambiguous places</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which may, and it may bee, ought to bee <hi>taken</hi> in a different <hi>sense</hi>; and their adversaries, finding those places weak and insufficient proofes of such a power, have from thence rejected any such kinde of power at all; But certainly if wee should <hi>reject</hi> every truth that is <hi>weakly proved</hi> by some who have undertaken it, I know no opinion would <hi>bid</hi> so fair for <hi>acceptance</hi> as <hi>Scepticisme,</hi> and that in reference to many weighty &amp; important truths; for how weakly have some proved the <hi>existence</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> the <hi>immortality</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> and the truth of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by such arguments, that if it were enough to <hi>overthrow</hi> an <hi>opinion</hi> to bee able to answer some <hi>arguments</hi> brought for it, <hi>Atheism</hi> it's self would become <hi>plausible.</hi> It can bee then no evidence, that a thing is not true, because some <hi>arguments</hi> will not prove it; and truly, as to the matter in hand, I am fully of the opinion of the excellent <hi>H. Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">in Luk. 6.22</note> speaking of <hi>excommunication</hi> in the <hi>Christian Church: Neque ad eam rem peculiare praeceptum desideratur, cum ecclesiae caetu, a Christo semel constituto, omnia illa impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta censeri debent, sine quibus ejus caetûs puritas retineri non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</hi> And therefore men spend needless pains to prove an <hi>institution</hi> of this <hi>power</hi> by some positive <hi>precept,</hi> when <hi>Christs</hi> founding his <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>particular society,</hi> is sufficient proof hee hath <hi>endowed</hi> it with this fundamental <hi>Right,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the <hi>society,</hi> were <hi>arena sine calce,</hi> a company of persons without any <hi>common tye</hi> of <hi>union</hi> among them; for if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106329:12"/>
there bee any such union, it must depend on <hi>some conditions,</hi> to bee <hi>performed</hi> by the <hi>members</hi> of that society, which how could they require from them, if they have not <hi>power</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them upon <hi>non-performance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I prove the divine original of this power from the <hi>special appointment</hi> and <hi>designation</hi> of <hi>particular officers</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> for the ruling this <hi>society.</hi> Now I say, that <hi>Law</hi> which provides there shall bee <hi>officers</hi> to <hi>govern,</hi> doth give them <hi>power</hi> to <hi>govern,</hi> suitable to the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>society</hi>: Either then you must <hi>deny,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath by an <hi>unalterable institution</hi> appointed <hi>a Gospel Ministry,</hi> or that this <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> hath no <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> or that their <hi>Power</hi> extends not to <hi>excommunication.</hi> The first I have already proved, the second <hi>follows</hi> from their <hi>appointment,</hi> for by all the <hi>titles</hi> given to <hi>Church Officers</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi>; it appears they had a <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Church,</hi> (as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) all which as you well know, do import a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> the <hi>Society</hi> over which they are set. And that this power should not extend to a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>exclude, convict offenders,</hi> seems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strange, when no other <hi>punishment can</hi> bee more <hi>suitable</hi> to the nature of the <hi>Society</hi> than this is; which is a <hi>debarring</hi> him from the <hi>priviledges</hi> of that <hi>Society,</hi> which the <hi>offender</hi> hath so much <hi>dishonoured.</hi> Can there bee any <hi>punishment</hi> less imagined towards <hi>contumacious offenders</hi> then this is, or that carries in it less of <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>coactive force,</hi> it implying nothing but what the <hi>offender</hi> himself freely yeilded to at his <hi>entrance</hi> into this <hi>Society?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I can find replyed by any of the <hi>Adversaryes</hi> of the opinion I here assert,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> to the <hi>argument</hi> drawn from the <hi>insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> and <hi>titles</hi> of the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is, that all those <hi>titles</hi> which are given to the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that do import <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>government,</hi> are all to bee taken in a <hi>spirituall sense,</hi> as they are <hi>Christs Ministers</hi> and <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to preach his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>declare his will</hi> to his Church. So that all power such persons conceive to lye in those titles, is onely <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>declarative</hi>; but how true that is, let any one judge, that considers these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there was certainly a power of <hi>discipline</hi> then in the <hi>Churches constituted</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which is most evident
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106329:12"/>
not only from the passages relating to offendors in Saint <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> especially to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but from the continued practice of succeeding ages, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and many others. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a power of <hi>discipline</hi> in <hi>Apostolical Churches,</hi> there was a <hi>necessity</hi> it should be administred by some <hi>persons</hi> who had the care of those <hi>Churches</hi>; and who were they but the several <hi>Pastors</hi> of them? It being then evident that there was such a power, doth it not stand to common sense it should be implyed in such <hi>titles</hi> which in their natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance do signifie a right to govern, as the names of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> do?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>diversity</hi> in Scripture made between <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Ephes.</hi> 4.11. Though this may not (as it doth not) imply a <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>two distinct offices</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet it doth a <hi>different respect</hi> and <hi>connotation</hi> in the same person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so imports that <hi>ruling</hi> carries in it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then meer <hi>teaching,</hi> and so the power implyed in <hi>Pastors</hi> to be more then meerly <hi>doctrinal,</hi> which is all I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, <hi>viz.</hi> A right to govern the flock committed to their charge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What possible difference can be assigned between the <hi>Elders that rule well, and those which labour in Word and Doctrine,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) if all their <hi>ruling</hi> were meerly <hi>labouring in the Word and Doctrine?</hi> and all their <hi>governing</hi> nothing but <hi>teaching?</hi> I intend not to prove an office of rulers distinct from teachers from hence (which I know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this place, nor any other will do) but that the <hi>formal conception</hi> of <hi>ruling,</hi> is different from that of <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106329:13"/>
any confederation; for the confederation was subsequent to their admission; and therefore they who had power to admit, could not derive their power from confederation. This argument, to me, puts the case out of dispute, that all Church-power cannot arise from meer confederation.</hi>

            <p>And that which further evidenceth that the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> doth not arise from meer <hi>consent,</hi> is that <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Gift</hi> whereby our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> did confer the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> on the <hi>Apostle Peter,</hi> as the <hi>representative</hi> in that <hi>action</hi> of the whole <hi>Colledge</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> of which power all the <hi>Apostles</hi> were actually <hi>infeoffed, John</hi> 20.23.

And this we find likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fulfilled in the person of the <hi>Apostle Peter,</hi> who opened the <hi>door</hi> of <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> So the <hi>Jews</hi> by his <hi>Sermon</hi> at <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost,</hi>

The <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> is most annexed to <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Admission</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> and thence it seems evident that the <hi>loosing</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> should be by <hi>admitting</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="1">1. I must confess my self yet <hi>unsatisfied</hi> as to any <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing argument,</hi> whereby it can be <hi>proved</hi> that any were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works.</hi> But now under the <hi>Gospel</hi> those <hi>ordinances,</hi> which suppose <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>baptism,</hi> do thereby suppose an <hi>alsufficient sacrifice</hi> offered for the <hi>expiation</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and consequently the <hi>subsequent priviledges</hi> do not immediately <hi>relate</hi> to the <hi>obtaining</hi> of that, but a <hi>grateful comemmoration</hi> of the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> and a <hi>celebration</hi> of the <hi>infinite mercy</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the way of <hi>redemption</hi> found out by the death of his <hi>Son.</hi> And therefore it stands to great reason that such <hi>persons,</hi> who by their <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>unworthy lives</hi> dishonour so holy a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> should not be <hi>owned</hi> to be as <hi>good</hi> and <hi>sound members</hi> of the <hi>society</hi> founded on so sacred a <hi>foundation,</hi> as the most <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> persons. To this, I know nothing can be objected, but that <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>passeover was commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative among the Jews</hi>; and <hi>secondly, That the priviledges of that people were then very great above other people, and therefore if God had intended any such thing as excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation among his people, it would have been in use then.</hi> To these I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I grant the <hi>passeover</hi> was <hi>commemorative</hi> as to the <hi>occasion</hi> of its <hi>institution</hi>; but then it was withall <hi>typical</hi> and <hi>annunciative</hi> of that <hi>Lamb of God who was to take away the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106329:16"/>
sins of the world,</hi> and therefore no person who desired <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> was to be debard from it; but the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi> hath nothing in it <hi>propitiatory,</hi> but is <hi>intended</hi> as a <hi>Feast</hi> upon a <hi>sacrifice</hi> and a <hi>Federal rite,</hi> as hath been fully cleared by a very <hi>learned person</hi> in his <hi>discourse</hi> about <hi>the true notion of the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I grant the <hi>Jews</hi> had very many <hi>priviledges</hi> above other <hi>Nations:</hi> Nay so far, that the whole <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> were looked upon as <hi>Gods chosen,</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>holy people</hi>; and from thence I justly infer that whatever <hi>exclusion</hi> was among the <hi>people</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> from their <hi>society,</hi> will far better hold as an argument for <hi>excommunication</hi> under the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> then if it had been a meer <hi>debarring</hi> from their <hi>Levitical Worship.</hi> And that I should far sooner insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the reason assigned, as the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> then the other <hi>infirm</hi> and <hi>profligated argument</hi>; and so the <hi>exclusion</hi> out of the <hi>Camp</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> and the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> (whatever we understand by it) may <hi>à pari</hi> hold to a <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>exclusion</hi> from the <hi>Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>: In <hi>imitation</hi> of which, I rather suppose that <hi>exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> out of the <hi>Synagogues</hi> was after taken up, rather then as a meer <hi>Out-lawry,</hi> when they were deprived of Civill power.</p>
            <p>The question then being thus clearly <hi>stated,</hi> it amounts to this, <hi>Whether under the Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 22.</note> 
               <hi>there be any power in the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church by vertue of divine institution to exclude any offenders out of the Christian society, for transgressing the Laws of it</hi>? And according to our former <hi>propositions,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it will be sufficient to prove that <hi>power</hi> to be of <hi>divine institution,</hi> if I prove it to be <hi>fundamentally</hi> and <hi>intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally resident</hi> in the <hi>society</hi> its self. For what ever doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>result</hi> from the <hi>society</hi> it self, must have the same <hi>original</hi> which the <hi>subject</hi> hath, because this hath the <hi>nature</hi> of an <hi>inseparable property resulting</hi> from its <hi>constitution.</hi> For the clearing of which, I shall lay down my thoughts of it as clearly and methodically as I can; and that in these following <hi>hypotheses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Where there is a power of declaring any person to be no true member of the society he is in, there is a formal power
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106329:17"/>
of excommunication</hi>: for this is all which I intend by it, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>authoritative pronouncing</hi> virtute officii, <hi>any convict offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have forfeited his interest in the Church as a Christian society: and to lose all the priviledges of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> So that if this power be lodged in any <hi>Church officer,</hi> then he hath power <hi>formally</hi> to <hi>excommunicate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Where the enjoyment of the priviledges of a society is not absolute and necessary, but depends upon conditions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by every member, of which the society is judge, there is a power in the rulers of that society to debarr any person from such priviledges, upon non-performance of the conditions.</hi> As supposing the <hi>jus civitatis</hi> to depend upon <hi>defending</hi> the <hi>rights</hi> of the <hi>City</hi>; upon a <hi>failing</hi> in referente to <hi>this</hi> in any person <hi>admitted</hi> to <hi>Citizen-ship,</hi> the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> have the same <hi>power</hi> to take that <hi>right</hi> away, which they had at first to <hi>give</hi> it; because that <hi>right</hi> was never <hi>absolutely</hi> given, but upon <hi>supposition</hi> that the <hi>person</hi> did not <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>ends</hi> for which it was bestowed upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Church is such a society in which communion is not absolute and necessary, but it doth depend on the performance of some conditions, of which the Governours of it are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges:</hi> And that appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church, depends</hi> upon <hi>conditions</hi> to be <hi>judged</hi> by <hi>Pastors,</hi> as in case of <hi>adult persons</hi> requiring <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Infidels</hi> being <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:</hi> in both which cases it is evident that <hi>conditions</hi> are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite,</hi> of which the <hi>Pastors</hi> are <hi>Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because the <hi>priviledges</hi> of this <hi>Society</hi> do require a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> from other <hi>Societies</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and calls for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of life; and those very <hi>priviledges</hi> are <hi>pledges</hi> of greater benefits which belong only to persons qualified with suitable <hi>conditions</hi>; it would therefore be a very great <hi>dishonour</hi> to this <hi>Society,</hi> if it lay as <hi>common</hi> and <hi>open</hi> as other <hi>Societies</hi> in the world do, and no more <hi>qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> required from the members of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have <hi>instances</hi> in the sacred <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Apostolical times,</hi> of such <hi>scandals</hi> which have been the ground of the <hi>exclusion</hi> of the <hi>persons</hi> guilty of them from the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Christian Society.</hi> And here I suppose we may (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106329:17"/>
all the little evasions which have been found out) fix on the <hi>incestuous person</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth.</hi> As to which I lay not the <hi>force</hi> of the argument upon the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>execution</hi> of the <hi>censure</hi> then, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from an <hi>Apostle,</hi> or the <hi>Apostolical rod,</hi> or <hi>delivering to Satan</hi>; for I freely grant that these did then import an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> over <hi>offenders</hi>; but I say the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>exercise</hi> of that <hi>power</hi> in such an <hi>extraordinary manner</hi> at that <hi>time,</hi> doth still <hi>continue,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in that <hi>visible extraordinary effect</hi> which it then had. And whatever <hi>practice</hi> is <hi>founded</hi> upon <hi>grounds perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>common,</hi> that <hi>practice</hi> must continue as long as the <hi>grounds</hi> of it do, and the <hi>Churches capacity</hi> will admit; (which <hi>hypothesis</hi> is the only <hi>rational foundation</hi> on which <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> doth stand <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken,</hi> and which in the former discourse I am far from <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining</hi> of, as any intelligent Reader may perceive) now I say that it is evident that the <hi>reasons</hi> of the <hi>Apostles censure</hi> of that person, are not <hi>fetched</hi> from the <hi>want</hi> of Christian <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but from such things which will hold as long as any <hi>Christian Church:</hi> which are the <hi>dishonour</hi> of <hi>the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5, 1. <hi>the spreading of such corruptions further,</hi> if they pass uncensured. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>and amendment of the person,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. Upon these <hi>pillars</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> rests it self in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which are the main grounds of <hi>penalties</hi> in all <hi>Societies whatsoever,</hi> viz. <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the honour of them, and preventing of further mischief, and doing good to the offending party.</hi> And that which seems to add a great deal of <hi>weight</hi> to this <hi>instance,</hi> is, that the Apostle <hi>checks</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that before the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical rod,</hi> they were not of themselves <hi>sensible</hi> of so <hi>great</hi> a <hi>dishonour</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> as that was, and had not used some means for the <hi>removing</hi> such a person from their <hi>Society. And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed may be taken away from among you,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.2. Therein implying, that whether there had been such a thing in the <hi>Church,</hi> or no, as the <hi>Apostolical rod,</hi> it had been the <hi>duty</hi> of a <hi>Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> to have <hi>done</hi> their <hi>endeavour</hi> in order to the <hi>removing</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106329:18"/>
such a person from their <hi>number.</hi> But further, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, how it should be a <hi>duty</hi> in <hi>Christians to withdraw from every brother who walketh disorderly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Thess. 3.14.</note> and <hi>Church-officers</hi> not to have <hi>power</hi> to <hi>pronounce</hi> such a <hi>person</hi> to be <hi>withdrawn from,</hi> which <hi>amounts</hi> to <hi>excommunication.</hi> It is not to me at all material, whether they did immediately relate to <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Sacred converse,</hi> (concerning which there is so much dispute) for in which soever we place it, if <hi>Church-officers</hi> have a <hi>power</hi> to <hi>pronounce</hi> such a person to be <hi>withdrawn</hi> from, they have a power of excommunication; so we consider this <hi>penalty</hi> as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi> on the <hi>person</hi> in his <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>Society</hi> as a <hi>Christian</hi>; and withall, how nearly conjoyned their <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>spiritual eating</hi> were together, 1 <hi>Corinth,</hi> 11.20, 21. and how strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>argument</hi> will hold from <hi>Civil</hi> to <hi>Sacred,</hi> viz. <hi>à remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione unius ad remotionem alterius,</hi> not from any fancyed <hi>pollution in Sacris</hi> from the company of wicked men, but from the <hi>dishonour</hi> reflecting on the <hi>Society</hi> from such unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons <hi>partaking</hi> of the highest <hi>priviledges</hi> of it. Thus from these three <hi>Hypotheses</hi> this <hi>Corollary</hi> follows, that where any persons in a <hi>Church</hi> do by their <hi>open</hi> and <hi>contumacious offences,</hi> declare to the world that they are far from being the persons they were supposed to be in their <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> there is a <hi>power resident</hi> in the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>debar</hi> such persons from the <hi>priviledges</hi> of it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> 1. Because this expresseth the <hi>nearest union</hi> and <hi>closest confederation,</hi> as the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> among the <hi>Grecian Common-wealths</hi> did. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this hath been alwayes looked on with greatest <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>Church of God</hi>; and therefore it is least of all fit those persons should be admitted to the highest <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which are unworthy of the lowest of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 23.</note>There remain only some few <hi>objections</hi> which are levelled against this opinion concerning the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which from the Question being thus stated and proved, will be soon removed. The <hi>first</hi> is <hi>that this excommunication is an outward punishment, and therefore belongs not to Church-officers, but to the Magistrate.</hi> 2. <hi>Because it neither is nor ever was in the power of any Church-officer to debar any offending
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106329:18"/>
member from publick worship, because any heathens may come to it.</hi> 3. <hi>It cannot lie as to exclusion from the Lords Supper, because Christ is offered as spiritual food, as well in the Word Preached as in the Sacrament.</hi> To these I answer. 1. I do not well understand what the <hi>Objectors</hi> mean by an <hi>outward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>; for there can be no punishment belonging to a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Society,</hi> (such as the <hi>Church</hi> is here considered to be) but it must be <hi>visible,</hi> i. e. <hi>outward,</hi> or a thing to be taken notice of in the world; and in this sense I deny that all <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble punishment</hi> belongs only to the <hi>Magistrate</hi>; but if by <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> be meant <hi>forcible punishment,</hi> then I grant that all <hi>coactive power</hi> belongs to the <hi>Magistrate</hi>; but I deny that <hi>excommunication formally</hi> considered, is a forcible punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. Because every person at his entrance into this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> is supposed to <hi>declare</hi> his <hi>submission</hi> to the rules of the <hi>Society</hi>; and therefore whatever he after undergoes by way of <hi>penalty</hi> in this <hi>Society,</hi> doth depend upon that <hi>consent.</hi> 2. A person stands <hi>excommunicate</hi> legally and <hi>de jure,</hi> who is <hi>declared authoritativly</hi> to be no <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> though he may be present at the <hi>acts</hi> of it; as a <hi>defranchised person</hi> may be at those of a <hi>Corporation.</hi> 3. A person falling into those <hi>offences</hi> which <hi>merit excommunication,</hi> is supposed in so doing, <hi>voluntarily</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> his <hi>interest</hi> in those <hi>prvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of <hi>which</hi> doth <hi>depend</hi> upon <hi>abstaining</hi> from those <hi>offences</hi> which he wilfully falls into; especially if <hi>contumacy</hi> be joyned with them, as it is before <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>; for then nothing is done <hi>forcibly</hi> towards him; for he first <hi>relinquisheth</hi> his <hi>right,</hi> before the <hi>Church-Governour</hi> declares him <hi>excluded</hi> the <hi>Society.</hi> So that the offendor doth <hi>meritoriously</hi> excommunicate <hi>himself,</hi> the <hi>Pastor</hi> doth it <hi>form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> by declaring that he hath made himself no member by his <hi>offences</hi> and <hi>contumacy</hi> joyned with them. To the second I answer, That I do not place the <hi>formality of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in exclusion from hearing the Word,</hi> but in debarring the person from hearing <hi>tanquam pars eoclesiae,</hi> as a member of the <hi>Church,</hi> and so his hearing may be well joined with that of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and not of <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> To the third I answer, That <hi>exclusion</hi> from the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is not on the accounts mentioned in the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106329:19"/>
but because it is one of the chiefest <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is a visible <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus cleared and asserted the power of <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> in a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> there remains only one <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> more, which is, <hi>Whether this power doth remain formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Church, after its being incorporated into the Common-wealth, or else doth it then escheate wholly into the Civil power?</hi> The <hi>resolution</hi> of which <hi>question</hi> mainly <hi>depends</hi> on another spoken to already; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether this power was only a kind of <hi>Widows estate,</hi> which belonged to it only during its <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from the <hi>Civil power,</hi> or was the <hi>Church</hi> absolutely <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffed</hi> of it as its <hi>perpetual right,</hi> belonging to it in all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> whatsoever it should be in? Now that must appear by the <hi>Tenure</hi> of it, and the <hi>grounds</hi> on which it was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed,</hi> which having been proved already to be <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>universal,</hi> it from thence appears that no <hi>accession</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> can invalidate its former <hi>title.</hi> But then as in case of <hi>marriage,</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>disposal</hi> and well <hi>management</hi> of the <hi>estate</hi> coming by the <hi>wife,</hi> belongs to the <hi>husband</hi>; so after the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>married</hi> into the <hi>Common wealth,</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of supream <hi>management</hi> of this <hi>power</hi> in an <hi>external</hi> way doth <hi>fall</hi> into the <hi>Magistrates</hi> hands. Which may consist in these following things. 1. A <hi>right</hi> of <hi>prescribing Laws</hi> for the due management of <hi>Church-censures.</hi> 2 A <hi>right</hi> of <hi>bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>proceeding</hi> in <hi>censures,</hi> that in a settled <hi>Christian State, matters</hi> of so great <hi>weight</hi> be not left to the <hi>arbitrary pleasure</hi> of any <hi>Church-officers,</hi> nor such <hi>censures</hi> inflicted but upon an evident <hi>conviction</hi> of such <hi>great offences</hi> which tend to the <hi>dishonour</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and that in order to the <hi>amendment</hi> of the offendors life. 3. The <hi>right</hi> of adding <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>civil sanctions</hi> to <hi>Church-censures</hi> and so enforcing the <hi>spiritual weapons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with the more <hi>keen</hi> and <hi>sharp</hi> ones of the Civil state. Thus I assert the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of all <hi>Church-censures in foro humano</hi> to flow from the <hi>Civil power,</hi> and that there is no proper <hi>effect</hi> following any of them as to <hi>Civil rights,</hi> but from the <hi>Magistrates sanction.</hi> 4. To the <hi>Magistrate</hi> belongs the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>appeals</hi> in case of <hi>unjust cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>; not that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> can <hi>repeal</hi> a <hi>just censure</hi> in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106329:19"/>
the <hi>Church,</hi> as to its <hi>spiritual effects</hi>; but he may <hi>suspend</hi> the <hi>temporal effect</hi> of it: in which case it is the duty of <hi>Pastors</hi> to <hi>discharge</hi> their <hi>office</hi> and <hi>acquiesce.</hi> But this <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> in the <hi>supream ordering</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as well as <hi>Civil Causes,</hi> I have fully <hi>asserted</hi> and <hi>cleared</hi> already.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iren.</hi> p. 1. c. 2. sect. 7.</note> From which it follows, That as to any <hi>outward effects</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>excommunication,</hi> the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Supream Magistrate</hi> must be <hi>exempted,</hi> both because the <hi>force</hi> of these <hi>censures</hi> doth <hi>flow</hi> from him in a <hi>Christian State,</hi> and that there otherwise would be a <hi>progress in infinitum,</hi> to know whether the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> were <hi>just</hi> or no. I conclude then, that though the <hi>Magistrate</hi> hath the main <hi>care</hi> of <hi>ordering things</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet (the <hi>Magistrates</hi> power in the <hi>Church</hi> being <hi>cumulative,</hi> and not <hi>privative</hi>) the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>officers</hi> retain the <hi>fundamental right</hi> of <hi>inflicting cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> on <hi>offenders</hi>: Which was the thing to be proved.</p>
