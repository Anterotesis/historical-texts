            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Sheriff.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know it hath been expected by this Company, that I ſhould give ſome particular Account to the World of this Fact for which I dye: It is from God alone from whom I muſt expect a Pardon, and God only knows how far I am concern'd in it; ſo I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with any Publick Declaration of the matter here, but this far I take my ſelf obliged to let the World know, That it hath been Depoſed by Mr. <hi>Willis,</hi> That my Father ſhould deſire me to get my Wife made away; but I do proteſt, ſolemnly, and as ever I hope for Salvation in and through Chriſt's Merits, That my Parents were no ways concerned in it; nay, ſo far were they from knowing of it, that they did not know that I was Married to her, till I was carried before the Juſtice of Peace.</p>
            <p>It hath been alſo urged by ſeveral, That my Father's Severity had cauſed it, but thoſe are altogether falſe Suggeſtions, for my Father hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Kind and very Indulgent Father to me. Another thing is, That my Father had made away, or given his Eſtate from me; but that is not true, for I ſaw his Will, after he had Information given him of my Marriage, and I found that he had given his Eſtate to me, leaving but very ſmall Portions to the reſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheriff, I ſhall not make any Reflections upon any Magiſtrate; I pray God that they may not deſerve any.</p>
            <p>As for the Witneſſes that ſwore againſt me, particularly, as to what Mr. <hi>Holdernes</hi> ſwore, I have ſo much Charity for him, as to believe that he did ſee ſuch a Man walk up and down the Field in the Graſs; and I muſt ſay, That they depoſed nothing, as to that, but what was really true, And I muſt do Juſtice alſo to the Conſtable and my Father, that as I am a dying-man, the Crevat was the ſame that I was taken in, and there was not any Art or Skill uſed, (I dare ſay it upon my Salvation) to take out any Blood that was in it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheriff, I ſhall not Reflect upon the Judges of the Court, though perhaps they were a little hard; and as to any one elſe that was acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Murther, I know of none: But Mr. Sheriff, Let not any one ſeek Vengeance, elſewhere, but let my Blood ſatisfie for it: And let the Queen and the Judges be ſatisfied in what I have ſaid, as I hope they will; and that is all that I have to ſay, Mr. Sheriff, as to this matter, only I deſire the Prayers of all good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And Mr. Sheriff, If any thing be made publick concerning me, I deſire that you would do me Juſtice in it.</p>
            <p>Then he Prayed again for himſelf, and immediately after he was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off.</p>
