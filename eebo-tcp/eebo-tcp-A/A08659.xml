            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

among the principall Orators of
thoſe times. His proſe was no other
than diſſolued verſe: his ſpeech wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
briefe, and powerful in perſwaſion.
Hauing paſt through diuers offices of
Iudicature, and now readie to aſſume
the habit of a Senator: his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and father being dead, impatient
of toyle, and the clamours of litigious
Aſſemblies, hee retired himſelfe from
all publick affaires to affected vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and his former abandoned ſtudies.
Yet ſuch was the mutuall affection
betweene him and <hi>Varro,</hi> that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of Command, &amp; ſerued vnder
<pb facs="tcp:14209:4"/>
him in the wars of <hi>Aſia:</hi> from whence
he returned by <hi>Athens,</hi> where he made
his aboad, vntill hee had attained to
the perfection of that language. Hee
was of a meane ſtature, ſlender of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſpare of diet; and, it not too amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
euery way temperate. He drunk
no wine but what was much alayed
with water: An Abhorrer of vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Luſts, from which it ſhould ſeem
that age was not innocent: neat in
apparell; of a free, affable, and courtly
behauiour; whereby he acquired the
friendſhip of many, ſuch as were
great in learning &amp; nobilitie; among
whom not a few of Conſular dignitie:
and ſo honoured by diuers, that they
wore his picture in rings cut in preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtones. A great Admirer, and as
much admired, of the excellent Poets
of thoſe times, with whom hee was
moſt familiar and intimate. Being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by ſome of them to leaue out
three verſes of thoſe many which hee
had written, hee gaue his conſent, ſo
that of all he might except three only:
<pb facs="tcp:14209:5"/>
whereupon they priuately writ thoſe
which they would haue him aboliſh,
and he on the other ſide thoſe which
he excepted, when both their papers,
being ſhowne, preſented the ſame
verſes, the firſt and ſecond recorded
by <hi>Pedo Albinovanus,</hi> who was one of
the arbiters,

whereby it appeareth that his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wit did not want an anſwerable
iudgement in ſuppreſſing the libertie
of his verſe, had he not affected it. An
ample patrimonie he had in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of <hi>Sulmo;</hi> with a houſe and a
temple in the citie, where now ſtands
the Church of <hi>Sancta Maria de Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba;</hi>
and where now ſtands the Church
of <hi>Sancta Maria de Conſolatione</hi> he had
an other in <hi>Rome,</hi> not farre from the
Capitoll; with pleaſant Hort-yards
betweene the wayes of <hi>Flaminia</hi> and
<hi>Claudia,</hi> wherein hee was accuſtomed
to recreate himſelfe with his Muſes.
Hee had had three wiues: whereof
<pb facs="tcp:14209:5"/>
the firſt being giuen him in his youth,
as neither worthie nor profitable,
ſoone after (according to the cuſtome
of the <hi>Romans</hi>) he diuorced: nor liu'd
he long with the ſecond, although
nobly borne, and of behauiour incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
The chaſtitie and beauty of the
third he often extolleth; whom hee
inſtructed in poetrie, and to his death
entirely affected. Neither was her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
inferior to his; liuing all the
time of his baniſhment like a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
widow; and continuing to the
end exemplarie faithfull. But in this
euery-way happy condition, when his
age required eaſe, and now about to
imploy his beloued vacancie in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niew
and poliſhing of his former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
he was baniſhed, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ined
to <hi>Tomos</hi> (a citie of <hi>Sarmatia</hi>
bordering on the Euxine Sea) by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus
Caeſar,</hi> on the fourth of the Ides
of December, and in the one and fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
yeere of his age, to the generall
griefe of his friends &amp; acquaintance;
who ſailed into <hi>Thrace</hi> in a ſhip of his
<pb facs="tcp:14209:6"/>
owne, and by land performed the reſt
of his voyage. The cauſe of this his ſo
cruell and deplored exile is rather
coniectured than certainely knowne.
Moſt agree that it was for his too
much familiaritie with <hi>Iulia</hi> the
daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> masked vnder
the name of <hi>Corinna.</hi> Others, that hee
had vnfortunately ſeene the inceſt of
<hi>Caeſar:</hi> which may be inſinuated, in,
that he complaines of his error, and
compares himſelf to <hi>Actaeon.</hi> But the
pretended occaſion was for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the Art of Loue, as intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
laſciuious, and corrupting good
manners. A pretence I may cal it, ſince
vnlikely it is that he ſhould baniſh him
in his age for what he writ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man, &amp; after ſo long a conniuance.
Yet <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> either to conceale his
owne crime or his daughters, would
haue it ſo thought: neither would

               </gap> reneale the true cauſe, leſt hee
ſhould further exaſperate his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
After he had long in vaine ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e by the mediation of
<pb facs="tcp:14209:6"/>
               <hi>Germanicus Caeſar,</hi> and others that
were neere vnto the Emperour; or at
leaſt to bee remoued to a more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Clime; his hopes (as he writes)
forſaking the earth with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he
dyed at <hi>Tomos</hi> in the fifth yeere of the
raigne of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> hauing liued ſeuen
yeeres in baniſhment. As <hi>Tibullus</hi> and
hee were borne in one day, ſo he and
<hi>Liuie</hi> dyed on an other; that his birth
and death might bee nobly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
He had ſo wonne the barbarous
<hi>Get's</hi> with his humanitie and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
actions (hauing alſo written a
booke in their language) that they
honoured him in his life with trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
garlands, and celebrated his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
with vniuerſall ſorrow; ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his tombe before the gates of
their citie, hard by a lake which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
his name to this day. His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
was found in the yeere,
MDVIII. with a magnificent couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
preſenting this Epitaph.</p>
