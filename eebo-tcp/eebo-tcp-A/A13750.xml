            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>what beſt were to be done,</l>
               <l>For 'twas a taske of great import,</l>
               <l>to iudge which was his ſonne:</l>
               <l>The brothers likewiſe were at ſtrife,</l>
               <l>which ſhould the liuing haue;</l>
               <l>When as the ancient man was dead,</l>
               <l>and buried in his graue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Iudges muſt decide the cauſe,</l>
               <l>and thus they did decrée,</l>
               <l>The dead mans body vp to take,</l>
               <l>and tye it to a Trée;</l>
               <l>A Bow each brother he muſt haue,</l>
               <l>and eke an arrow take,</l>
               <l>To ſhoot at their dead fathers corps,</l>
               <l>as if he were a ſtake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And he whoſe Arrow néereſt hit</l>
               <l>his heart as he did ſtand,</l>
               <l>They'd iudge him for to be right heire,</l>
               <l>and fit to haue the land:</l>
               <l>On this they all did ſtreight agrée,</l>
               <l>and to the field they went,</l>
               <l>Each had a man his ſhaft to beare,</l>
               <l>and Bow already bent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now (quoth the Iudges) try your skill</l>
               <l>vpon your Father there,</l>
               <l>That we may quickly know who ſhall</l>
               <l>vnto the Land be heire;</l>
               <l>The eldeſt tooke his Bow in hand,</l>
               <l>and ſhaft where as he ſtood,</l>
               <l>Which pierc'd ſo déep the dead mans breſt</l>
               <l>that it did run with blood.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The ſecond brother then muſt ſhoot,</l>
               <l>who ſtraight did take his aime,</l>
               <l>And with his Arrow made a wound,</l>
               <l>that blood came from the ſame:</l>
               <l>The third likewiſe muſt try his skill,</l>
               <l>the matter to decide,</l>
               <l>Whoſe ſhaft did make a wound moſt déep</l>
               <l>into the dead mans ſide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Vnto the fourth and youngeſt then,</l>
               <l>a Bow and ſhaft was brought;</l>
               <l>Who ſaid, Dée thinke that are my heart</l>
               <l>could harbour ſuch a thought,</l>
               <l>To ſhoot at my deare Fathers heart,</l>
               <l>although that he be dead,</l>
               <l>For all the Kingdomes in the world</l>
               <l>that farre and wide are ſpred?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And turning of him round about,</l>
               <l>the teares ran downe amaine,</l>
               <l>He flung his Bow vpon the ground,</l>
               <l>and broke his ſhaft in twaine:</l>
               <l>The Iudges ſéeing his remorſe,</l>
               <l>they then concluded all,</l>
               <l>He was the right, the other thrée,</l>
               <l>they were vnnaturall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ſo he ſtraight poſſeſt the Lands,</l>
               <l>being made the heire of all,</l>
               <l>And heauen by nature in this kind,</l>
               <l>vnto his heart did call;</l>
               <l>His brothers they did enuy him,</l>
               <l>but yet he néed not care,</l>
               <l>And of his wealth in portions large,</l>
               <l>vnto them he did ſhare.</l>
