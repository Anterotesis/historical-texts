            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of that learned knights (by reason of a sequestration for his masters cause) a friend coming to visit him, they fell accidentally into a discourse of the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>galantry</hi> of the <hi>Spanish Nation.</hi>

            <p>That discourse occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an example or two, to be brought out of this <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro:</hi> and, those examples (with Sir <hi>John's</hi> choice language and illustration) were so relisht by his friend (a stranger to the <hi>Spanish tongue)</hi> that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came restles 'till he got a promise from Sir. <hi>John</hi> to translate the whole, which he did in a few

enigmatically, that though he indevour'd to translate it plainly; yet, he thought it was not made comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible enough for common Readers, therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to me, that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make it so by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the margent; which he had begun, but (be it spoke with sorrow) he and those thoughts are now buried in the silent Grave, and my self, with those very many that lov'd him, left to lament that losse.</p>

much out of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of objects, as the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our conceptions. The perfections of the first magnitude are singular, but in valuing of things there ought to be a great reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>He that had the Royall <hi>Gusto</hi> was the wisest of the <hi>Philips</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> he was accustomed to miraculous objects, and was never pleas'd with any thing but what was rare in its kind.</p>
               <p>A Merchant of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> presented him one day with a star of the earth (I mean an orientall dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant) an epitome of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, an astonishment for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54893:26"/>
splendour: Every one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that <hi>Philip</hi> should admire it; but he beheld it rather with a careless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain: Not that he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in discurtesie, but in a kind of gravity, like one that having had his <hi>Gusto</hi> inur'd to Miracles both of Art and Nature, could not be so vulgarly affected as others. What may this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amant be worth to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fancy? (quoth the King) Sir, reply'd the Merchant, the seventy thousand Duckets which I abridged into this rare production of the Sun, need not be an offence to any body; I, but reply'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54893:26"/>
the King, what didst thou think when thou payedst so dear for it? I thought Sir, said the Merchant, there had bin a second <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>

                  </note> in the world. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer so unexpected, prickt him to the quick more neer than the price; whereupon he commanded the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant to be paid for, and the <hi>Jentilesse</hi> of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi>'s answer to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; shewing thereby the superiority of his <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi> both in the price and in the recompence.</p>
               <p>Some are of an opinion that he that exceeds not in the commendation of a thing, dispraiseth it; But I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54893:27"/>
would say, that all excesses of praise are from a defect of capacity; And that he that praises any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond reason, either mocks himself, or those that hear him.</p>
               <p>The Greek <hi>Agesilaus</hi> condemned that man for an ill master of his trade, that would fit the shooe of the Giant <hi>Enceladus,</hi> to the foot of a Pigmy, and in the matter of praises it is the best skill to take a first measure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Europe</hi> was fill'd with the praise and prowess of that great Duke <hi>D'Alva,</hi> and yet though they filled the world with his praises,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54893:27"/>
they took not a right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his <hi>Gusto,</hi> which left him unsatisfied; Some of his friends desiring to know a reason, He told them that for forty years wherein he had bin a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, and having had for his Camp all <hi>Europe,</hi> and for blason all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses of his time, yet it seemed nothing to him, because he had never seen one of those prodigious armies of the Turk before him, the defeat whereof had been a tryumph of dexteritie more than of force; And such an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive power subdu'd, would have enhaunst the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54893:28"/>

               </argument>
               <p>TWo cities gave birth to two He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe's; <hi>Hercules</hi> was born at <hi>Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> at <hi>Rome: Hercules</hi> was applauded by all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and <hi>Cato</hi> was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of <hi>Rome.</hi> All cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries admir'd the one, and the <hi>Romans</hi> shund and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the other.</p>
               <p>The advantage which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54893:38"/>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> had of <hi>Hercules,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he exceeded him in prudence: But <hi>Hercules</hi> went as far beyond him in fame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Catoes</hi> work was more arduous and Honorable, for he engag'd himself to subdue Monsters of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet the Thebans at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts had more of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousnes.</p>
               <p>The difference was in this, that the enterprises of <hi>Hercules</hi> were more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and those of <hi>Cato,</hi> more odious.</p>
               <p>The plausibilitie the of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t carried the fame
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54893:38"/>
of <hi>Alcides</hi> as far as the Confines of the habitable <note place="margin">Hercules</note> world, and had gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it had been more spatious: the severitie of <hi>Cato</hi> shut up his renown within the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet there are some, and not of the least judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that prefer a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult employment before a plausible, and with such, the approbation of a few select persons is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, than applause from the vulgar: plausible em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments are called the miracles of the ignorant.</p>
               <p>Those that comprehend the excellency of an high employment are but few:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54893:39"/>
yet they are persons of Eminencie, and so their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation comes but from a few. The facility of that which is plausible is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by all, and growes common, and so applause is ordinarily more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.</p>
               <p>The approbation of a few Honor'd people, is better than the acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the numerous vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
               <p>Beside it is a peece of dexterity to be alwayes encountred with plausible employments, and a point of good discretion to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn common attention, by the splendor of brave
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54893:39"/>
undertakings the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof appeares to all, and the reputation is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by every mans vote.</p>
               <p>Pluralitie of opinions is alwayes to be prefer'd: In such kind of employments Excellencie is ever palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and although the other (which being of a higher strain) partakes more of supernaturall and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicall, and with a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible evidence please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet I leave the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to every mans o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; I call that a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible employment which is executed in the view and to the satisfaction of all, provided that reputation
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54893:40"/>
be at the bottome, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding those employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are as empty of Honor, as full of Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. A stage player lives rich in applause: but dyes poore in reputation.</p>
               <p>To be eminent, in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, is an undertaking that's set upon the theater, and must consequently be attended with a large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.</p>
               <p>What princes are those that make up the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of fame but warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors? To them is properly due the renown of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. They fill the world with applause, the chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with fame: because the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54893:40"/>
exploits of war have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of splendor in them than those of peace.</p>
               <p>Among judges we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe the strictest to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, because justice without Crueltie, was ever of more acceptance with the vulgar, than remissness of mercy.</p>
               <p>In matter of wit, plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie hath alwayes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.

Such a boldness in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been judged rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but in <hi>Caesar</hi> it was a dextrousness, that had so truly consider'd the favour of his fortune.

               <p>It is a great talent to be fortunate, and in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of most, the fortunate man must wear the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: Some make more account of an ounce of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than of quintalls of

               <p>The wise father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemes the defect of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his daughter with gold, and good success for the most part gilds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the deformities of the spirit.</p>

               <p>It consists in a certain ayriness, in an unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cheerfulness, aswell in words as actions, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses even into discourse. It receivs the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it borrow some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from observation. It was never subject to directions nor to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54893:59"/>
of a superior although it were alwayes govern'd by art; when it steales a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fancy, 'tis call'd an allurement; when 'tis not easily discern'd, 'tis call'd an ayriness. If it be put on by courage 'tis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity: If out of galantry or Gentiless, 'tis a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of carriage, If it be done with facility 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse. All these names have been given it out of a desire and difficultie of expressing it.</p>
               <p>They do it wrong that confound it with facility, for it leaves that far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, and goes as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bravery: and although
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54893:59"/>
all Entregent presuppose freedome, yet it add's to perfection. If actions have any thing of splendor, the obligation is to Entregent, for that sets them to the light.</p>
               <p>Without this the best execution is dead, and the greatest perfection unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Neither yet retains it somuch of the nature of accident, that sometimes it stands not for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall. It serves not only for ornament, but for a prop to the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affaires.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if it be the soul of beauty, It is the spirit of prudence; If it be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54893:60"/>
the breath of gentilesse, it is the life of valor.</p>
               <p>The Entregent gives asmuch Lustre to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in war, as his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and in the person of a King it parallells pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>The freedome of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tregent is of no lesse use in the day of a battell, than dextrousness and valor. It makes a generall first master of himself, and then of all that are under him.</p>
               <p>The brave assurance of that Conqueror of kings, that contender in honor with <hi>Alcides, Don Fernando d'Avalos,</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough magnified:

               <p>The Entregent disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers animosity asmuch in him that sits on horsback, as in him that fits under a cloth of state.

               <p>The Entregent hath no lesse influence upon the politick. And therefore

               <p>Wee see a certain in-born and naturall souveraignty in some men, which seems to spakle in them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others by a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, a power of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which wins it self

               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at sea by certain py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates that were Ilanders, presently became the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of them.

               <p>One man like him does more execution with one stern look, than others with all their industrie. Their reasons have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult vigor, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes more by sympathie,

than by any thing that's visible.</p>
               <p>The proudest mind sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to their domination, without knowing why or how, and the freest judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment renders it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out constraint.</p>
               <p>Such persons among men have as great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as Lyons among creatures, because they have a share in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apll quality which is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>All creatures acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Lyon by instinct of nature, and doe him homage by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention before they have examined his valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54893:63"/>
So to those <hi>Heroes,</hi> other men give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect by way of advance, without staying to take an inventory of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</p>
               <p>This is an Excellency deserving a Crown, and being match'd with a great understanding and height of courage, it can be said to want nothing why it should not form a <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> in politicks.</p>
               <p>This soveraign quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in the person of <hi>Don Hernand Alvarez,</hi> (Duke <hi>d'Alva)</hi> as in a throne: A lord more by privileges of nature than of curtesie: He was great,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54893:63"/>
&amp; born to be greater, for in his ordinary discourse He knew not how to disguise a naturall imperiousness.</p>
               <p>It holds great difference from a measur'd and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd gravity, from an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected tone of voyce, which is a very fift essence of odiousness, and though being naturall, it might be born with, yet it comes very neer to tedious impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>The distruct which it hath of it self rayses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions upon every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. And if once it come but to lose confidence, it falls off to be the skorn of

the world. It was th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise of the great <hi>Cato,</hi> (and suitable to his severity) that a man should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect but be in fear of himself.</p>

               <p>IT is a perfection in one <hi>Heros</hi> to hold sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phye with another. If a plant sympathize with the sun, it grows among others to a Giantlik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> height, and the flower of it is the Crown of the garden.</p>
               <p>Sympathie is one of those prodigious things which nature hath seald up: but th'effects of it are matter of astonishment, and subject of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:54893:65"/>
It consists in a paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and kinred of hearts, as all Antipathy is in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce of wills: Some give it the originall from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence of tempers, others from a supernall alliance in the stars.</p>
               <p>The first aspires as high as doing of miracles, the other produces monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities. They are but the wonders of sympathie those which common ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance calls charms, and vulgar spirits will have them to be enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The most accomplisht perfection suffers scorn from antipathie, and the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54893:65"/>
most deformed fowlnes is thought a perfection with sympathie.</p>
               <p>Even betwixt father and son it pretends a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and exeqcutes every day something of power, trampling upon laws, and defeating the privileges of nature and policy. The antipathy of a father takes away a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and a sympathie gives one.</p>
               <p>There is nothing which the merits of a sympathie cannot obtain, it perswads without eloquence, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes whatsoever it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, by presenting the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54893:66"/>
symptomes of naturall Harmony.</p>
               <p>An eminent sympathie is the Character, it is the starr that inclines to Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icity: although some be of the nature of adamant that maintains antipathy with the diamant, and holds sympathie with Iron: It is a monstruosity in nature to be in love with dross, and to hate things of splendor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th was a Monster among kings. He had an antipathie to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, more by nature than art. He was so wedded to his own principles that he lost himself in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54893:66"/>
dreggs of the Category of Policie.</p>
               <p>Active sympathy, if it have any thing of subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, raises the subject: but the passive more, if it be Heroicall.</p>
               <p>It is more precious than the great stone in the ring of <hi>Giges;</hi> and in power it is stronger than the chains of the <hi>Thebane.</hi>

               <p>It is easy to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in observance of great men, but it is not so easy to be like them in a Correlation. The Heart sighes and speakes alowd many times when it is not answered with an Eccho of correspondency. In the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54893:67"/>
School of Love this is the A. B. C. where the first lesson is of sympathy; let it then be a dexterity of discretion to know and comprehend perfectly the passive sympathie; make use of this naturall Charm, and let Art supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Nature; it is an obstinacy as undiscreet as unprofitable, to pretend to do any thing without this favour of Nature, or to seek to conquer Wills without the munition of sympathy.</p>
               <p>But if it be in a King, it may be called a Queen of all perfections: It exceeds the termes of a Prodigie;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54893:67"/>

               <p>This so vast a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies somtimes in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, if it be not relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the sweet breath of Favour. The Adamant drawes not iron beyond the limits of his attraction: Nor can a sympathy work beyond the spheare of his activity. The principall condition is to be within distance; but take heed of in terposition.</p>

others: and 'tis a deserv'd punishment, that he that so foolishly remembers himself, should be as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly forgotten by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>There is nothing so free from servitude as estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is subject to no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, much lesse to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

               <p>A little esteem of ones self hinders a great deal of applause from others.</p>
               <p>All wise men judge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affected quality rather to be violent than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, rather apparent than

               <p>He that partaking of many perfections, seemes to have none in estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is of a double greatnes, for by a generous disdain he awakens the common attention, and seeming to be blind in his own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, He makes others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Argus</hi>'s eyes upon him.</p>

               <p>ALthough our <hi>Heroe</hi> may be secure from the Ostracism of <hi>Athens,</hi> yet he will be in some danger of the Criticismes of <hi>Spain.</hi> The extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of those may make him an exile at home; but he can be banished but to the precincts of Fame, and to the confines of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p>This Paradox condems him to be peccant for not sinning: It is a criticall primacy of a veniall fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54893:78"/>
into Prudence and Valour, only to entertain Envy, and to feed Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>These Criticks conclude it impossible for any man to escape their censure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perfections; because they are so like the hungry Harpies, which when they fail of finding a prey that's base enough for them, fall upon some better.</p>
               <p>There are intentions compounded of so subtle and Metaphysicall poyson, that they can transform the best qualities, and make the best perfections abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, giving a sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54893:79"/>
to the most justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied pretences.</p>
               <p>So it must pass for a sleight of Policy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to some veniall sinns, that Envy may have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to gnaw on, and the poyson of Emulation may be diverted.</p>
               <p>Let it pass for a politick treacle, for a counterpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Prudence; since being bred out of an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it is attended with Health: It secures the heart by exposing it self to detraction, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the venom to it self.</p>
               <p>Beside we see somtimes a little defect in Nature, adds a perfection in other

               <p>But this perfection seems an idle one, and is rather a curiosity of a man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of himself, than any point of discretion.</p>
               <p>But who can be that Sun without an Ecclips, that Diamant without a cloud or a flaw, that Rose without a prick?</p>
