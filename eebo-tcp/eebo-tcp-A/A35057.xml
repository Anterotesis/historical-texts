            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But it moſt of all pleaſeth me to ſee, how
Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> draweth homeward. For as
the Anabaptiſts by their madneſs kept Maſter
<hi>Calvin</hi> within ſome good compaſs, and as
Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> hath been compelled in ſome ſort,
to retire himſelf from his former eagerneſs: ſo
aſſuredly the phrenetical giddineſs of theſe our
new unbrideled Schiſmaticks, who for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
purity are many degrees beyond all the
<hi>Savoyan</hi> Diſciplinarians, hath wrought a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
(to my underſtanding) upon M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54455:3"/>
For hear him, how for fear of falling into flat <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſm,</hi>
he was fain to plead againſt one (that had
been his Scholar) in the behalf of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Th. Cartw. <hi>to</hi> Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</note> ſo bitterly before by himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned.
<hi>The ordinary aſſemblies</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of thoſe
which profeſs the Goſpel in</hi> England, <hi>are the Churches
of Chriſt:</hi> which he proveth in this ſort; <hi>Thoſe
Aſſemblies which have Chriſt for there head, and
the ſame alſo for their foundation, are Gods Churches:
Such are the aſſemblies of</hi> England, <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.
Again, <hi>They that have performed unto them the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Covenant which the Lord hath made with his
Churches, of pouring his ſpirit upon them, and putting
his word into their mouths, are the Churches of God:
But ſuch are the aſſemblies in England, Therefore, &amp;c.
Hereunto may be added</hi> (ſaith he further) <hi>the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the Churches of Chriſt in</hi> Europe, <hi>all
which give the right hand of Society in the houſe of
God, unto the aſſemblies which are in</hi> England.
Again, to prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
the Church of God, notwithſtanding it want
the pretended Diſcipline; he uſeth this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
that <hi>at it is in mans body, ſo is it in this
<pb facs="tcp:54455:3"/>
matter; there are certain-parts eſſential, and ſuch
as without the which a man cannot ſtand, and ſome
ſerving either to his comelyneſs or to his continuance.</hi>
And of this latter ſort he maketh the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
And laſtly, he write, thus; <hi>To ſay
that the Church of</hi> England <hi>is not the Church of
God, becauſe it hath not received this Diſcipline,
methinks is all one with this, as if a man would ſay,
It is no City, becauſe it hath no wall: or, that it
is no Vineyard, becauſe it hath neither hedge nor
ditch.</hi> Thus far Maſter <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which his manner of ſpeech you find a
very great alteration, from his anoient ſtile.
And as concerning the neceſſity whereof I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
the wind you ſee is turned. There is no
more neceſſity in <hi>England</hi> of the <hi>Geneva</hi> plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
than that every City in this Realm ſhould
be walled about. And beſides, the pretended
Diſcipline is become not to be any longer of
the eſſence of the Church, but as appertaining
to the comelyneſs of it.</p>
            <p>And a little after,</p>
            <p>And this I will add unto it, that if Maſter
<pb facs="tcp:54455:4"/>
               <hi>Cartwright</hi> would but confer with ſome that
haveſ kill in fortification, to know of him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an old thick wall of lime and ſtone, made
many hundred years ſince, or a new ſlight wall
ſlubbered over, and wrought with untempered
mortar ſome few years ago, whether (I ſay)
of theſe two walls are of better defenſe for any
City: I ſhould be in good hope, that he would
in ſhort time, leave the Diſciplinary walls of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> and content himſelf with the ancient
fortifications of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and
the rather, becauſe he ſeeth what a giddy and
itching humour his novelties have bred, in the
unſtayed ſort of many fantaſtical people.</p>
            <p>Now to what <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> hath ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to ſhew that there is no ſuch neceſſity of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as ſome of his
followers now pretend: may be added the Judgment
of a later Writer (concerning thoſe particulars which
are ſo much ſcrupled by them, who under pretenſe of
greater purity will needs caſt out all decency and good
order from the Houſe of God:) in a Book, intituled

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR ſo much as I left you the
choice for the firſt conference,
whether you would have it in
writing, or by ſpeech of mouth;
I attended ſome daies for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of that matter: which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was not returned, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
that you held you ſtill
to the requeſt of your Letters; which was, to receive
ſomething from me by writing.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer therefore; So it is, that your Letters
affected me diverſly: for where your firſt page had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54455:5"/>
raiſed me up unto ſome hope, of re-uniting your ſelf
with the reſt of your company unto us, from whom
you have thought good to ſunder your ſelves; the
ſecond page, which layeth forth the condition of our
peace, did caſt me, and as were, beat me from it
again. Howbeit, the mercy of God upholding me
in ſome good hope of profiting you, or receiving
profit from you, I thought to cut out this time of
my weightieſt and moſt neceſſary buſineſs, wherein
I might give that contentment, which the Lord hath
enabled mine hand unto.</p>
            <p>Unto you, not unwilling to come to us, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
(as it ſeemeth) is ſtopped in divers reſpects:
The ſhort whereof is; <hi>The receiving without publick
repentance, of thoſe which come from the Churches of
England:</hi> where becauſe in the outward profeſſion,
that the Laws of the Land do juſtifie the dumb mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
there appear unto you no lawful aſſemblies
of the Church of Chriſt; your fear is, leaſt in uniting
your ſelves with ſuch, you ſhould be <hi>unequally yoaked,</hi>
and made fellow members of ſome other than of that
whereof <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is the Head.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, if it be ſhewed, that the ordinary
aſſemblies of thoſe that profeſs the Goſpel in <hi>England</hi>
be the <hi>Churches of Chriſt,</hi> it ſeemerh that the way will
be paved and planed for mutual entercourſe between
us.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore it ſeemeth to be performed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Aſſemblies which have Chriſt for their Head,<note place="margin">1. Reaſon.</note>
and the ſame alſo for their Foundation are <hi>Gods
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuch are the Aſſemblies of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>They are Gods Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54455:5"/>
The Aſſumption is evident, in that, by believing
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> we are members of his
body, and thereby are lively ſtones laid upon him
as upon a foundation, and grow into one ſpiritual
houſe with him. Now that they have like precious
faith with us, is convinced, not onely by their own
profeſſion, but by the teſtimony of the Spirit of
God, who by manifold graces poured upon them,
doth bear them witneſs that they be members of the
body of Chriſt, who as the Head hath partaked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them his Holy Spirit, even to an apparent ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of numbers of them.</p>
            <q>
               <p>They which have performed unto them the ſpecial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note>
which the Lord hath made with his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
by pouring his Spirit upon them, and his
word in their mouths, are the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>But ſuch are the Aſſemblies in <hi>England;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, they are the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, it hath been ſaid
before: Whereupon it alſo followeth, that he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
put his <hi>Word</hi> in their mouths, conſidering that
the Spirit of God is not given but by his Word.
And ſeeing that the Lord in mercy hath ſet up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
burning Lamps in thoſe Aſſemblies, whereby
light is conveyed more or leſs into all the parts of
the Land; it ſeemeth that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
ſhould receive injury if it ſhould not be counted
among the <hi>Golden Candleſticks,</hi> which ſerve to keep
out darkneſs and night from the Lords Houſe, until
ſuch time as the day-ſpring, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> ariſe in our
hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54455:6"/>
If you ſay, <hi>All do not believe the Goſpel truly, which
profeſs;</hi> The ſame exception lyeth againſt all other
Churches, how reformed ſoever. If there be fewer
<hi>faithful</hi> in our Churches, than in others; The <hi>truth</hi> of
the Church ſtandeth not in number: for it there
were in every Church <hi>one</hi> truly undiſſemblingly
faithful, all the reſt holding the faith of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>words</hi> onely, yet ſhould all thoſe
Churches be to us the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And if you
ſay, that <hi>all thoſe Aſſemblies,</hi> as it were all the branches
and arms of the Candleſtick, <hi>have not light ſet upon
them</hi> (the greater part of them being damped by a
<hi>dumb miniſtry</hi>) notwithſtanding by the way you
confeſs, that <hi>thoſe Aſſemblies upon whom the Lord hath
ſet up the lamp of a</hi> preaching Miniſtery, <hi>are the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God:</hi> which ſeemeth to caſt down that hill
which ſtandeth in the way againſt our rejoyning,
whereby you cannot afford us the name of <hi>Gods
Churches,</hi> becauſe we have not the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> by him
appointed. Now for that other, whether they have
ſome glaunce of knowledge by that <hi>dumb Miniſtery</hi>
or not, may afterward in another place be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
For the preſent, I anſwer, That even thoſe
Congregations, for ſo much as they both have by
ſome former Miniſtery or means which the Lord hath
uſed towards them, received faith; ſtanding thereby
in our <hi>Saviour Chriſt,</hi> as in the ſhaft of the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
and being members of the ſame body, they
may well receive ſome ſupply of their wants, from
the light that ſhineth in the next branch unto them;
for if every Aſſembly being without a lamp of the
Miniſtery, ſhould by and by be holden to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the ſhaft of the Church-Candleſtick, then
at every vacation of the Miniſtery, and whenſoever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54455:6"/>
by <hi>death</hi> the Lord ſhould put out one of his lights,
it ſhould follow, that that Aſſembly by the fall of
their Miniſter into the grave, ſhould from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
heaven fall into the grave of Hell. But you will
ſay peradventure, that <hi>an Aſſembly that hath a</hi> dumb
Miniſter, <hi>is in worſe caſe than that which bath none at
all:</hi> If that be granted, it followeth not therefore,
that the Aſſembly which yeſterday, being without
a dumb Miniſter, was the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſhould to
day, having ſuch a one ſet over them, be the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>
of <hi>Satan.</hi> And here, methink, when you go
about to make nothing of the <hi>dumb Miniſtery,</hi> you
aſcribe more force unto it than it hath: for you make
him not ſo much a <hi>guide,</hi> as an <hi>Head</hi> of the Church,
as that thoſe which before in all equal judgment
were to be deemed members of Chriſt, by having

I do not therefore yield unto you in that
you ſay, <hi>they are the chief alway in the Synagogue;</hi> our
<hi>Saviour Chriſt,</hi> in whom thoſe companies do believe,
being the chief; with whom through faith they
grow to be one body, rather than with Satan by
<note n="*" place="margin">having.</note> hearing the dumb Miniſter, to be one with him.
Say therefore, that it is a fault in them to hear ſuch
a Miniſter, thruſt upon them; yet that it is an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi>
from God, and an utter falling away from the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> I ſe not with what great appearance of truth
it can be ſpoken. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when divers of the people
clave unto <hi>Coreh, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> forſaking wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
the lawful and ordinary Miniſtery of the <hi>Aaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
did not therefore caſt them forth from the
Lords hoſt: And ſhould the Churches of God, for
hearing a <hi>dumb Miniſter,</hi> which is thruſt upon them,
forthwith be reputed for runagates from the Lord?</p>

Again:</p>

            <p>Therefore, they are the Lords Confederates.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, that <hi>the</hi> Seals <hi>ſet to by the dumb Miniſtery

yet you thereby confeſs, that <hi>thoſe which are

<hi>Sacraments of the Church:</hi> whereby it
falleth out again, that you ſeem to hold, that <hi>the
Churches of</hi> England <hi>are not the true Churches of Chriſt,
becauſe they have not his commanded</hi> Diſcipline.
Hereto may be added all the Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi>
all which give the right hand of Society in the
houſe of God unto the Aſſemblies which are in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Which argument of Churches <hi>Authority,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not ſo ſtrong as it will enforce, yet
ought it to ſtay all ſudden judgment unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
and ſo long to cauſe ſilence, until the Cauſe
being ripely on both ſides debated, the contrary of
it which the Churches ſhould do, through the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
of the truth thereof break forth. And if
it be meet to proceed ſoftly, and as it were with a
leaden foot, unto the Excommunication of one
onely member of the Church of God; there ought
verily to have been great conſultation taken, or
ever the Churches of two whole Iſlands ſhould have
been caſt out: eſpecially, when they be holden in by
Voices, not onely of divers perſons, but of all the
Churches to whom knowledge of their eſtate hath
come. And if there were but one man worthy to
be Excommunicate, yet if the greater part of your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54455:7"/>
Aſſembly would not yield conſent thereunto, I hold
it, that the <hi>order</hi> of the Diſcipliae requireth that
the reſt are to bear the perſon whom they cannot
remove: And therefore, though the Aſſemblies of
<hi>England</hi> had deſerved, through want of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi>
and of a <hi>preaching Ministery,</hi> to be caſt out from the
accompt of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> yet being holden
in by the <hi>Voices</hi> of the Churches themſelves, ought
to have been ſo far born with, as the <hi>communicating</hi>
ſhould not make them guilty of a <hi>falling away from
the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to thoſe two Reaſons whereby you
think you may juſtly hold the Aſſemblies in <hi>England</hi>
for no Churches of God: And firſt of all to the
reaſon of the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> for the want whereof you
gave them all without exception the black ſtone of
<hi>condemnation</hi> from being the Churches of God:
Where it is to be underſtood, that as in a <hi>Man</hi> there
are certain parts eſſential, and ſuch as without which
the man cannot ſtand; and other ſome ſerving to his
comelyneſs, or to his long continuance: So it is in
this matter; there is the foundation, <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
whereupon it is neceſſary that by <hi>faith</hi> the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
be laid, which groweth unto the <hi>Lords</hi> build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without the which it cannot be his <hi>Church;</hi>
which thing being, whatſoever is wanting of that
which is <hi>commanded,</hi> or remaining of that which
is <hi>forbidden,</hi> is not able to put that Aſſembly, which
by <hi>faith</hi> is laid upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from the right and title
of being the <hi>Church of Chriſt:</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> can admit
no ſuch thing, which giveth an utter overthrow and
turning upſide down of the truth. By this title of
the <hi>Faithful,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in his Epiſtles noteth out the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54455:8"/>
Churches of God, it being all one with him to ſay,
<hi>To the Faithful,</hi> or <hi>To the Saints,</hi> as <hi>To the Church</hi>
of ſuch a place. Whatſoever wanteth unto this, or
is more than enough, that wanteth or aboundeth to
the diſgrace or uncomelyneſs, or to the hazard of
continuance, and not to the preſent overthrow of
the Church. Hereupon the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which
neglected for the ſpace of forty years the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> alſo as it
ſeemeth (one onely time excepted) ceaſed not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to have the
Sanctuary among them. And in this reſpect the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Aſſemblies, whereof the greateſt part in High
<hi>Germany</hi> (which, beſide the main of Diſcipline,
which is common to our Churches, are groſlly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the matter of the <hi>Supper</hi>) are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
holden in the Roul of the <hi>Churches of God.</hi>
In this reſpect alſo, certain Aſſemblies of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
which having the uſe of the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them, are not ſuffered to have the uſe
of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> are not therefore (when the
<hi>Lords Churches</hi> are muſtered, and their names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and enrouled up) caſt out as <hi>unfit</hi> to be in any
accompt of the <hi>Lords hoſts.</hi> Without any part of
that <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline</hi> which the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I grant there can be no <hi>Church of Chriſt;</hi> or,
that without ſome part of it, there can be no <hi>faith</hi>
in Jeſus Chriſt: It is a part of the Diſcipline of our
Saviour Chriſt, that there ſhould be certain which
ſhould be choſen out of the reſt to <hi>preach the Goſpel,</hi>
by preaching whereof the <hi>Churches</hi> are gathered
together: Where therefore there is no <hi>Miniſtery</hi>
of the Word, there it is plain, that there are no
<hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>apparent Churches.</hi> It is another piece of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54455:8"/>
the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Lord, that the reſt of the body
of the Church ſhould <hi>obey</hi> thoſe that are ſet over
them in the Lord: whereſoever therefore there is no
<hi>obedience</hi> of the people to the Miniſters, that in the
<hi>Lords</hi> name preach unto them, there can be no <hi>true
Church</hi> of Chriſt. But where theſe two be, although
other points want, yea although there be ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in theſe, that neither the <hi>Miniſters</hi> do in all
points preach as they ought, nor the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in all
points obey unto the wholeſome doctrine of their
Teachers; yet do they (for the reaſon above-ſaid)
retein the <hi>right</hi> of the Churches of God. This is
made plain by a ſimilitude from the <hi>body</hi> of a man,
whereinto we are already entred: For if a man
ſhould have both his hands and his arms cut off, his
eyes put out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet as long as the head ſtandeth,
and other vital parts, he is to be accompted a Man,
although a maimed man: Even ſo it is in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
as long as it holdeth the <hi>head,</hi> how defective
ſoever it is otherwiſe, it hath the due and right of
the <hi>Church of God.</hi> And although a man ſhould
have ſix fingers in one hand, and but three in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and albeit they ſhould ſtand where the mouth
doth; yet all this deformity ſhould not hinder him
from being truely holden to be a Man, although it
ſhould be a great deformity in him. On the other
part, if he had no Head at all, or that there were
no natural conjunction of the parts one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but a whole and through diſplacing of every
part from his proper ſeat; then verily would he be
denyed to have either the proportion of a Man,
or his life. So likewiſe if an Aſſembly ſhould not
hold the Head, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or be nothing
elſs but a confuſed multitude, without part of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54455:9"/>
               <hi>order</hi> which the Son of God hath appointed, the
ſame is juſtly croſſed out of the accompt of <hi>Gods
Church.</hi> Was not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after the return from
<hi>Babylon,</hi> the City of the great King, until ſuch time
as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came and builded the Walls of the
City? To ſay therefore, <hi>it is none of the Church
of God, becauſe it hath not received the Diſcipline,</hi>
metthinks it is all one with this, as if a man ſhould ſay,
<hi>It is no City becauſe it hath no Wall,</hi> or <hi>that it is no
Vineyard becauſe it hath neither ditch nor hedge.</hi> It is
not, I grant, ſo ſightly a City, or Vineyard, nor
yet ſo ſafe againſt the invaſion of their ſeveral ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which lye in wait for them; yet are they truely
both <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Vineyards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remaineth that other point, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe Aſſemblies onely which have a <hi>dumb
Miniſter:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of</hi> dumb Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</note> wherein the part of your concluſion,
<hi>That that Aſſembly where they be, is none of the Church
of God,</hi> is before anſwered. Therein reſteth that
part of your concluſion, whereby you infer, <hi>That
the Sacraments ministred by them are none of Gods
Sacraments,</hi> and therefore <hi>that a man may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any part of them at their hands.</hi> Here firſt I
agree with you, that their Miniſtery is <hi>unlawful,</hi> and
to themſelves, without repentance, a certain matter
of deſtruction; eſpecially in thoſe to whom know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of corruption is come: to the Churches where
they be, preſently hurtful, and in the end without
remedy, deadly: But that they are no <hi>Ministers of
God,</hi> ſo far as to receive the <hi>good</hi> they offer unto us,
that (I ſuppoſe) I may not yield unto: The
ground whereof I take from the former part of my
Anſwer; <hi>That for ſo much as they are allowed by the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54455:9"/>
Churches of God, they ought, until remedy may be
found of ſo great diſorder, to be heard and retained ſo
far as they can give us any thing that is of Chriſt:</hi> And
for this cauſe our Saviour commanded, that the
<hi>Scribes</hi> ſhould be heard,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 2.</note> for that they taught <hi>truely;</hi>
which honour our Saviour would never have given
unto them, unleſs the Church-calling had moved
him thereunto: Neither had it been lawful for the
people otherwiſe to have heard them; for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that their unfitneſs and unlawfulneſs in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
(although another way) was as great as it
is in our <hi>reading Miniſters.</hi> They were altogether
deceived in the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> for neither knew they that
<hi>Jeſus was Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 9. 22.</note> nor yet that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they
looked for,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 42.</note> ſhould be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but held him
for a bare and naked man. It appeareth alſo that
they taught the Juſtification by the <hi>Law of Works,</hi>
not onely in the 18. of <hi>Luke,</hi> but even in the ſame
very place, where our Saviour Chriſt commandeth
this audience: for ſpeaking of the works of the
<hi>moral Law,</hi> which they would not touch with <hi>one
of</hi> their <hi>fingers,</hi> he ſaith, that they <hi>laid them upon the
peoples backs as burthens which cannot be born:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our Saviour (beſide their Phariſaical pride and
lordlyneſs in teaching) ſignifieth that they taught
them to <hi>Juſtification;</hi> ſeeing that if they had onely
taught them as teſtimonies and fruits or <hi>faith,</hi> they
had not been intolerable, bur,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> as our Saviour Chriſt
ſaith, an <hi>eaſie yoke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5.</note> and as S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, not <hi>grievous</hi> nor
<hi>heavy.</hi> Now the <hi>dumb Miniſtery</hi> is not farther off
from the juſtification of a <hi>lawful Miniſtery,</hi> than to
teach <hi>untruely</hi> in the chief grounds, of Religion;
neither is the edifying of the Church reſpected
in making Laws for the Miniſtery, leſs hindred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54455:10"/>
by an <hi>unpreaching Miniſtery.</hi> And according to this
ſaying of our Saviour Chriſt, we may ſee what the
practice of the <hi>Prophets</hi> had been before; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had oftentimes to do with <hi>falſe teachers</hi>
and <hi>Prieſts</hi> that were <hi>dumb dogs</hi> and <hi>not able to bark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 56.</note>
yet (giving the people warning of their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and inſufficiencies, threatning alſo the caſting of
them from their Miniſtery, in that good time when
the Lord ſhall take <hi>pity on his Church</hi>) they are never
found to have forbidden the people to have come
unto their ſacrifices commanded by the Law unto
them. Yea our Saviour Chriſt that lived in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
times of the Church, and when things were moſt
confuſed, and feweſt ſteps of any lawful Calling to
be ſeen, yet commanded he the man whom he purged
from <hi>Leproſie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> to <hi>ſhew</hi> himſelf <hi>to the Prieſts</hi> generally,
without willing him to make choice of a Prieſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inſtructed or affected to the truth than the reſt.
The <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> although he entred by Simony and
reward to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet notwihſtanding we ſee
our Saviour Chriſt bore him reverence for his office
ſake, and (as before his Judge in <hi>Spiritual Cauſes</hi>)
gave an accompt of his doctrine. We have another
example of reverence given to ſuch Rulers, even in
things that were done by them wrongfully. For <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi>
being for a time ſuſpended from coming into
the <hi>Temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 36. 19.</note> being at liberty would not (leaſt, as it
ſeemeth, he ſhould make a tumult) enter the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and therefore (having written that which he
had to ſay) ſent <hi>Baruch to read</hi> his Sermon <hi>in the
Temple.</hi> Moreover, when a Magiſtrate is not able
to do ſome part of his office, as for example, being
able to do the duties which are to be performed in
peace, is inſufficient for Martial affaire, yet no man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54455:10"/>
refuſeth that which he is able to give, becauſe he is
not able to do all that is required: Even ſo, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to our uttermoſt a <hi>ſufficient Miniſtery,</hi> I
would think in the mean ſeaſon, that the <hi>good things</hi>
they are able to give us, may be taken at their hands.
And if any man ſay, <hi>that it is of the ſubſtance of a,</hi>
Church-Miniſter, <hi>to be able to teach;</hi> and therefore
<hi>that he is no Miniſter, that hath not that ability:</hi> It
may be anſwered, <hi>that it is of the ſubſtance of a good
and lawful Miniſter of God, but not ſimply of a Miniſter;
whereunto it is ſufficient to have the Churches calling:</hi>
As it is of the ſubſtance, rather of a lawful Magiſtrate,
to be able to judge between his Subjects, than ſimply
of a Magiſtrate, whom the election of the people,
or of other to whom his choice belongeth, maketh
a Magiſtrate of the Lord, although he be no lawful
nor ſufficient Magiſtrate. As therefore we call him
a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> who for the ignorance of his charge
may be called an <hi>Idol Magiſtrate;</hi> even ſo it ſeemeth
that he may be holden for a Miniſter, which hath
his Churches Calling, although he be not able to
do the principal charge of the <hi>Miniſtery.</hi> Neither
doth the place of the Prophet <hi>Hoſee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4. 6.</note> which ſaith,
<hi>becauſe</hi> they have <hi>refuſed knowledge,</hi> they ſhall <hi>be no
Priests unto</hi> the Lord, ſtand againſt this: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
rather giving a <hi>rule</hi> to follow in the election or
diſpoſition of them, ſhewing how far they may be
uſed.</p>
            <p>Finally, to that which is objected of <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
with their impiety, in any taking any thing at
their hands:</hi> I Anſwer, the ſame might have been
laid to the peoples charge under the <hi>Law;</hi> which is
never done by the Prophets. Secondly, if by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54455:11"/>
with him, we ſhould make him Miniſter,
I grant that a piece of his guilt would ſtick to our
fingers: but when that is not, I ſee not how, by
receiving the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of him, we partake more
of his wickedneſs, than the Son is partaker of his
Fathers murther, becauſe he receiveth of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gift ſome part of his lands or moveables: And
ſo much the leſs there than here, as the Father giveth
his own things, whereas the <hi>dumb Miniſter</hi> doth
onely <hi>diſpenſe</hi> the gifts of the Lord. Wherefore it
may be rather feared, leſt in <hi>refuſing</hi> the Sacraments
offered by him, we put the Lord away from us,
whoſe they be; than in taking of the Sacraments
at his hands, be partakers of <hi>impiety,</hi> which is the
mans, and can take no hold of the Sacraments in
any ſort. For even as I, not able to avoid him,
may communicate with a Miniſter, that is an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,</hi>
without being partaker of his Adultery; ſo
alſo may I communicate with a <hi>dumb Miniſter</hi> and
yet nevertheleſs be free from his <hi>impiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have mine Anſwer, written not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the fear and trembling your ſelves make mention
of; whereby it will not be hard for you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
how both our deſires of being united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be performed: And although I write in
good aſſurance, eſpecially in the former part as
touching <hi>the rightful title of the Churches of Chriſt
to be due to the Aſſemblies of</hi> England; yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
(beſide the common frailties of our whole
race) ſpecial breaches and decaies in my ſelf, I
willingly hearken to any, much more to you (whom
the Lord hath beſtowed good graces upon) ſhewing
better things: for which cauſe if further conference
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54455:11"/>
be needful, I muſt through buſineſs be forced to

            <p>And thus with moſt humble prayers to the Lord

            <div type="part">
               <head>Prop. 1. A Stinted Liturgy is in it
ſelf Lawful</head>
               <head type="sub">This is thus proved: </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 1.</hi> That which is not directly, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially
forbidden by God, remaineth lawful: A ſtinted
Liturgy is not directly, or conſequentially forbidden by
God; therefore it remaineth lawful.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undoubted's becauſe nothing but a
Prohibition can make a thing unlawful. <hi>Sin is a
tranſgreſſion of a Law: where there is no Law, there
is no Trangreſſion:</hi> And yet I have heard very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
men anſwer this, <hi>That it is enough that it is
not commanded, though not forbidden.</hi> Which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deny both Scripture and Civil Principles.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Minor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 361.</note> 
                  <hi>That a ſtinted Liturgy is not
forbidden,</hi> we need no other proof, than that no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition can be produced.</p>
               <p>Argument 6. <hi>If it be lawful for the People to uſe a
ſtinted Form of Words in Publick Prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 364.</note> 
                  <hi>then is it in
it ſelf lawful for the Paſtors: but it is lawful for the
People:</hi> for the Paſtors prayer (which they muſt pray
over with him, and not onely hear it) is a ſtinted
Form to them, even as much as if he had learnt it out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54455:14"/>
of a Book. They are to follow him in his Method
and Words, as if it were a Book-Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument 7.</hi> It is lawful to uſe a Form in Preaching:
therefore a ſtinted Liturgy is lawful.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe Preaching is a part of that Liturgy.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe the reaſon is the ſame for Prayer, as
for that, in the main.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Argument 8. <hi>That which hath been the practice of the
Church in Scripture-times, and down to this day, and is
yet the practice of almoſt all the Churches of Chriſt on
earth, is not like to be unlawful: but ſuch is the uſe of
ſome stinted forms of Publick Service: therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
That it was ſo in the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, and approved by
Chriſt, I have ſhewed. That it hath been of ancient
uſe in the Church ſince Chriſt, and is at this day in uſe
in <hi>Africk, Aſia, Europe,</hi> even among the Reformed
Churches in <hi>France, Holland, Geneva,</hi> &amp;c. is ſo well
known, that I think I need not ſtand to prove it:
yea, thoſe few that ſeem to diſuſe it, do yet uſe it, in
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other parts of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> it ſelf, I never rejected it
becauſe it was a Form,<note place="margin">P. 421.</note> nor thought it ſimply unlawful
becauſe it was ſuch a Form; but have made uſe of it,
and would do again in the like caſe.</p>
