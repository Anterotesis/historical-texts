         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y diſcountenancing our ancient laws under which the Nation hath been ſo long
happy, and purſuing after new forms, and diſputes about them; Government
which was made for our Protection, has been the occaſion of laying us open to all
miſerie; and we that before in reſpect of ſociety had but one common reaſon, have
broken our unitie by that which ſhould have preſerved it. And whileſt every man
purſues his ſingle apprehenſions of good, the real good of the Nation was loſt:
from which confuſion of parties our valiant and wiſe General is now hopefully
withdrawing us, and becauſe the paſſionate diſcourſes of ſome private perſons
ſeeme to obſtruct this good worke he is about, We have thought fit to make this Declaration for our
ſelves, that we are not in the number of thoſe that vaunt our ſelves in the proſpect of our proſperity, nor
that if it were in our power would delight in any revenge upon any man or body of men whom we
think hath contributed moſt to our ſufferings; we are rather of thoſe that will with patience beare the
indignation of God becauſe we have offended him, and will forgive our brethren a little, that of him
we may be forgiven much. We will not be ſo ungratefull to God that by the management of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
hath done ſo much for our delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as preſently to be proſecuting others, which as it would behigh
ingratitude to him, ſo we dare ſay it would be no leſſe to the General, whoſe whole conduct of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſhewes him to be truly of a publick ſpirit that will protect every party as they ſubject themſelves to
the Lawes made for the whole Nation; and the wiſdome of the approaching Parliament will without
doubt be ſuch, that we have all reaſon to hope our ſettlement from them, &amp; to determine our obedience
to them.</p>
