         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> being Convicted and Condemned at the ſame time with the
five Jeſuites late executed, for conſpiring the death of his Sacred Majeſty, the
deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Government eſtabliſhed; His
Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to reprieve his Execution for ſome time, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of his making ſome Ingenuous Confeſſion of what he knew concerning this horrid
Popiſh Plot; but he perſiſting in his Jeſuited obſtinacy, and offering to diſcover ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
things, but ſuch as could no way deſerve the continuing his Majeſties Clemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him.</p>
            <p>Order was given for his Execution on <hi>Monday</hi> morning the <hi>14th.</hi> of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> and
accordingly he was put into the Siedge at <hi>Newgate,</hi> having a black Suit and Periwig on, with
a vaſt multitude of people accompanying him; being come to the place of Execution, the
Executioner having pull'd off his Periwig and put on his Cap, was putting the Rope over his
head, which he taking in his hands zealouſly kiſſed, and then applying himſelf to the Sheriffs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſpeak to them, but in ſo low a voice, that it was audible to very few of the Spectators.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52074:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The ſubſtance of his Speech was, That he did not think he ſhould have had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to to ſpeak in that place, but ſince he had, he did declare that he was not directly nor
indirectly guilty of what he was accuſed of; not that he did accuſe the Judges nor the
Jury, who (he ſaid) were at their Liberty to have believed the witneſſes or not.</p>
            <p>And that whereas he was charged with having Commiſſions ſigned by <hi>Paulus de Oliva,</hi> he
denyed that ever he ſaw any ſuch under his hand. Being asked, whether he did not ſee any
Commiſſions under any other hand, he denyed it, or whether he did not ſee ſome Patents,
he ſaid, he knew not of any; neither to the Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> nor the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of
<hi>Warder,</hi> having never ſeen one of their Faces, as he had declared in a Paper, which Mr.
Sheriff ſaid, he did not think fit to be printed, and that he had already printed a
Paper or ſome body for him, which Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> denied he was concerned in, he ſaid he
was no way concerned in deſigning to raiſe any forces or making any diſturbance in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
any manner of way.</p>
            <p>And being then told that he had but a little while to live, and that he would therefore
do very well to imploy it for the good of his ſoul, ſince it was very well known that thoſe
who were of his Party had Liberty to deny any thing, or to make any kind of Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
when they were once abſolved for the fame.</p>
            <p>He then applyed himſelf to his Devotions, and one of the Spectators ſaying, <hi>The Lord
have mercy on your ſoul,</hi> he turn'd back and ſaid, <hi>I thank you for your charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then proceeded praying God to bleſs this Kingdom and His Majeſty, and that God
would forgive them that deſigned or rejoyced in his death, and that further bloodſhed might
be prevented: and then ſaid, he had no further to ſay in publick, and asking the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
whether the Rope were right or no, he proceeded to his private Devotions, (being
told by the Executioner that if he pleaſed he might have half an hour for doing the ſame,)
and by ſome words which he ſpoke louder than ordinary, it appeared that ſome of his Prayers
were in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and others in <hi>Latine;</hi> having continued ſome time in theſe his Ejaculations
with the Cap over his eyes, he ſaid at laſt, <hi>That they need ſtay no longer for him,</hi> and was
thereupon turned off.</p>
            <p>And the Hang-man having ſtruck him on the breaſt, and pulled him by the Legs to diſpatch
him, he was ſtript, and being quite dead he was cut down, and his bowels were burnt,
and his body quartered according to his Sentence.</p>
            <p>And thus this man ended his life in denying all againſt the cleareſt evidence imaginable,
and thus we may expect that the reſt will do too, if any more ſhould ſuffer, for as that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
told Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> at the Gallows, after they are abſolved, they have liberty to ſay,
or ſwear, or equivocate upon any thing, and by the Tenents of their Church they ought
and muſt dye thus, if it may be inſtrumental for advancing their Religion and Intereſt,
which having been ſo fully and ingenuouſly proved, by the ſeveral animadverſions and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which have been made upon the ſpeeches of the Jeſuited Traytors laſt executed,
need not be any further inſiſted on at this time. And we have this to ſay, That never any
men in any Nation ſuffered upon more full evidence, nor had ever more liberty to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their innocence (if poſſible) in this matter than they.</p>
