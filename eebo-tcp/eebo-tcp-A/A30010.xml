            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE the Clamour of ſome of my Countrymen is ſo very loud againſt my Propoſal, that ſome of them, who dare not put their Honeſty in the Balance with mine, have called my Integrity in queſtion as well as my Judgment; for the Vindication therefore of both, as alſo of the Propoſal it ſelf (which you deſired to ſee) I have ſent you this, which contains my Arguments to prove both the Honeſty and the Neceſſity of it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101184:5"/>
and an Anſwer to every Objection that I have yet heard its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries make; of the ſtrength and force of which, you and all that read them may be Judges.</p>
            <p>And to demonſtrate both, my firſt and chiefeſt Argument ſhall be, only to produce the Propoſal it ſelf, that every indifferent Perſon may take it in pieces and examine it, for it fears the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of none. It here follows,</p>
            <div type="proposal">
               <head>A Propoſal humbly preſented to His Majeſty for the good of his Subjects of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </head>
               <q>
                  <p>After the laſt Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> there followed a Famine, and the Carkaſes of thoſe who died of Famine cauſed a Plague, ſo that many more died by Famine and Plague, than by the War.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing may be feared now, there being little or no Tillage for the next year; and the Common <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who lived moſt upon their Potato-Gardens, beng now in the Army, do conſume ten times more Corn than they did when they lived at home in their Cabins; by which means that great Harveſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> which they had this year, will be eaten up before the next: So that although that Kingdom ſhould be entirely redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the next Summer, yet the want of Bread will make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate; for the late King's Braſs-money having eaten up all the Silver of that Kingdom, there is no Money left to purchaſe Corn abroad, ſo that the People muſt unavoidably die for want of Bread.</p>
                  <p>There is now near <note n="*⁎*" rend="inter">Note, that in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> when this Paper was firſt given, we had <hi>Sligo</hi> and <hi>Jamestown,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Conuaught</hi> to the Walls of <hi>Galway</hi>
                     </note> one half of that Kingdom reduced, and yet the Proteſtants, even of that part, are moſt of them ſtill in <hi>England</hi>; the conſequence of whoſe ſtay <hi>here</hi> muſt be a Famine <hi>there.</hi> For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are almoſt all of them taken up in the Service of the late King, and thoſe who are not, will notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither plow nor ſow where they know not their Landlord; ſo that, while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtay here, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Farmers fly before our Army there, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the more your Majeſties Army advances, the more muſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101184:5"/>
that Kingdom become waſt. But if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are now here, were in that part of the Kingdom which is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who now fly before our Army, would come in and gladly ſettle again on their old Farms, when they have ſomebody to protect them.</p>
                  <p>Your Majeſty has a fair opportunity to oblige the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that ſtay here, to return, by the Addreſs which the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons made to your Majeſty in their behalf for one fourth part of a Years Allowance, which in the whole did amount to Sixty Thouſand Pounds. Now if your Majeſty were graciouſly pleaſed to give them here the Sum of Fifteen Thouſand Pounds, being a Fourth part thereof; and to tranſmit into <hi>Ireland</hi> the the Sum of Forty Five Thouſand Pounds more, to be there paid to ſuch of them as will go over, with obligation on every Perſon who receives any of it, to Sow a certain proportion of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Corn (which may yet be done in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April</hi> next) it will be the only means to prevent a Famine: it would ſend away a multitude of People, whoſe wants make them impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate here, and would in a great meaſure ſupply thoſe wants. And moreover ſuch Numbers returning, would be a terrour to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, and an incouragement to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Labourer and Husbandman to return, who are now fled, and who had rather be at the Plow than the Musket: Whereas now, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who are fed, with Promiſes from the <hi>French,</hi> will believe them, and be thereby encouraged) when they ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to return.</p>
                  <p>Such of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as have their own Eſtates to go to, have no reaſon to expect to be under the ſame conditions with thoſe whoſe Eſtates are yet under the Enemy; and that difference made between them, will be a conſiderable addition, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enable thoſe whoſe Eſtates are yet unconquered, to ſettle for a preſent Subſiſtance, on ſuch little Farms as their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will allow of; whereby they may get a little ſtock of their own, againſt they remove to their own Eſtates: This will likewiſe be a great help to thoſe of the <hi>North,</hi> who have Land to ſet.</p>
                  <p>As this will be a competent Proviſion for the Nobility and Gentry, ſo that which is yet remaining of the Collect-Money, may be for the Poorer ſort; which being paid to them at one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101184:6"/>
entire Sum, would be a help to ſettle them under the Gentry, to become Tenants as they were formerly: and if they Plow but little, yet their being in the Country will be an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for others to go over. If your Majeſty be pleaſed to order that this Collect-Money alſo may be diſtributed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it will then be ſeen who are real objects of Charity, and the Money will be laid out to a good uſe. It is to be fear'd, that all will not go over, who yet complain now that they have not whereon to live.</p>
                  <p>It is of as great conſequence ſpeedily to Plant that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to reduce it; and perhaps Sixty Thouſand Pounds may do that <hi>Now,</hi> which cannot be done the next Year, with Ten times that Sum; and while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtay here, it cannot be ſuppoſed that Strangers will go thither to Plant.</p>
                  <p>If this Money be ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be there given to ſuch as will go for it, then thoſe who will not go over, will be left without excuſe.</p>
                  <p>But if this Money be not now ſent over, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent away to Sow Corn there, a greater Sum than now pays the Army, will not be ſufficient the next Year to keep the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> in that Kingdom with Bread. And the Proſpect is yet more terrible, if we conſider that when ever Corn was dear in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> we always fetch'd it from <hi>France</hi>; but now we muſt go ſeek other Markets, which cannot now be done without vaſt Expence, ſince this general War through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Europe,</hi> will take up ſo much Corn for all the Fleets and Armies.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Firſt, It is humbly Propoſed, that the King would cauſe it to be made known to be his pleaſure, that all the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who now are in <hi>England,</hi> and whoſe uſual abode has been in <hi>Ireland,</hi> do forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that part of that Kingdom which is under his Majeſties Authority, except ſuch whom his Majeſty ſhall particularly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101184:6"/>
order to ſtay here for his Service; and that for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement ſo to do, it is humbly Propos'd,</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That his Majeſty would be graciouſly pleas'd to give to all his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Eſtates have been returned into the Houſe of Commons, and by them have been rated, the Sum of Fifteen Thouſand Pounds. And that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to ſend into <hi>Ireland</hi> the Sum of Forty Five Thouſand Pounds, to be there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to ſuch of them as will go over to that part of the Kingdom which is already conquered, and there Sew Summer Corn: And that the ſaid Forty Five Thouſand Pounds be put into the hands of two Subſtantial Wealthy Gentlemen of that Kingdom, Men of clear Eſtates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Incumbrance or Settlements; of known Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and that are not dealers in Money, who may be Treaſurers of the ſame; they giving ſufficient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſecurity for the payment of the ſaid Forty Five Thouſand Pounds in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in ſuch manner as is hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid down, and that without any Fees or other Charges to be paid by the Perſons who are to receive it: And that every Perſon whoſe ſhare of the ſaid Forty Five Thouſand Pounds ſhall amount to Twenty Pounds or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhall give Bond to the ſaid Treaſurers in the King's name, to the value of what he receives, that for every Ten Pounds that he ſhall receive, he will Sew, if he be upon his own Eſtate, Four Acres of Oats, Barley or Peaſe; upon his giving of which Bonds, he ſhall receive his ſhare of Money from the Treaſurers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> For the encouragement of all ſuch to go over, whoſe Eſtates are yet unconquered; it is propoſed that they ſhall be obliged to Sew but Two Acres of Corn for every Ten Pounds that they ſhall receive, becauſe of the neceſſity that they will lye under of being at ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence upon land which is not their own, and of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſmall Rent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> That the ſaid Treaſurers or one of them, ſhall take care that every Perſon do Sew as much Corn as by Bond he was obliged to do, and that the ſame be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently thrown upon the Ground only to eſcape the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101184:7"/>
of the Bond. And therefore, that at Harveſt-time, the ſaid Treaſurers or one of them, ſhall ride about to ſee the ſame before it be Reap'd; and that the Bonds ſhall be in force againſt all thoſe who have not their ſhare of Corn to Reap, (that is, if the ſame have happened through any neglect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of theirs,) although they did before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the obligation of their Bond by Sewing. By this means his Majeſties Fatherly care of his People will moſt evidently appear, in contriving that his Subjects there ſhall have at leaſt Ten Thouſand Acres of Corn the next Year; whereas without this, poſſibly there will not be a handful in the whole Kingdom, and Thouſands muſt dye for want of Bread.</p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> That every Perſon who will go for <hi>Ireland</hi> on theſe Conditions, ſhall out of his firſt ſhare of Money, buy for himſelf and every Relation and Servant that he carries with him (who are able to bear Arms,) a good Musket, or Caſe of Piſtols for the defence of his Family; without the producing of which Arms in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the making Oath that he himſelf bought the ſame in <hi>England,</hi> he ſhall have no Right to receive any of the ſaid Forty Five Thouſand Pounds in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Collect-Money may be divided, that one third part of it may be kept here for the Relief of Widows and Orphans only, and the other Two Thirds ſent for <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the encouragement of Tenants and Labourers to go over to Plow and Sew for the Nobility and Gentry, or themſelves. And that theſe alſo, when they have entred their Names to the Biſhops and other Commiſſioners of the Collect-Money, that they will go, they ſhall receive if they go from <hi>London</hi> Twenty Shillings apiece; or if from the Sea-ſide, or near it, Ten Shillings apiece to bear their Charges, and a good Musket or Caſe of Piſtols at <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which the Commiſſioners ſhall provide and pay for out of their Stock, and the reſt of the Money they ſhall have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among them at their arrival in <hi>Ireland</hi>; and that all ſuch of them as will not go over, ſhall find no relief here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101184:7"/>We already know by Computation, that there are about Ten Thouſand Perſons that will go over; and by this means his Majeſty will as it were ſend a Recruit to the Army, (though it is not at all hereby intended that they ſhall be put into it,) which will be as ſo many freſh <hi>Innis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing</hi> Men, inſpir'd with Rage for their Loſſes: Men, who when they get into their Country, will not be driven out again. So that our Army need not be weakned by putting Garriſons into any Towns, but may march on entire, and theſe will keep the Towns and Country behind them.</p>

               <p>Here the Anſwerers of this Propoſal will immediately cry out, that this is not the ſame with that which lay before them; I own it differs in ſome amendments, many of which are more of Phraſe than of Matter. But this might have lain before them, (and ſav'd them a great deal of needleſs trouble in exerciſing their Rhetorick upon things which I grant them, and which are not in this preſent Propoſal;) but they poſitively refus'd it, by which you may plainly ſee, that their buſineſs was not by ſtrength of Argument, to run down the Propoſition of <hi>Our going to</hi> Ireland <hi>to Sew Corn</hi>: But to cavil at that poor Paper that lay before them, whoſe Doom ſome of them have declared to be to light a Pipe of Tobacco, though others of them have condemned it to a worſe fate, that muſt be nameleſs; thereby ſhewing their Loyalty and Reſpect to his Majeſty, who after his Peruſal of it Ten Days, gave it to the Lords of his Privy Council to conſider of, before whom it lay near Three Weeks, and who were pleaſed two ſeveral times to Interrogate me, and make their Objections thereon; and they afterwards thought it not unworthy the conſideration of another Aſſembly, whoſe quick-ſightedneſs did, upon the very firſt hearing of it read, doom it as I have before told you. But they hope that this Behaviour of theirs to his Majeſty will be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, when Judges, Attorney and Sollicitor Generals Places come to be diſpoſed of in <hi>Ireland</hi>; or that they have now ſhew'd their Deſert for ſuch Places, in ſo vigorouſly hindring thoſe that would go over and do the King ſuch ſignal Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101184:8"/>My Second Argument ſhall be the Approbation of a great many of the Gentry of our own Country, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe of them who live at preſent at <hi>Leverpool</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is great, and who were not prejudiced by miſ-repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it from <hi>London,</hi> (as the Gentlemen of <hi>Cheſter</hi> were;) their ſenſe of it you ſhall ſee by the Copy of the Letter ſent me from thence, which here follows.</p>

               <p>But you will ſay, here are Gentlemen of good Quality in <hi>London</hi> that are not for it; nay the ſenſe of the Gentry at their Meeting ran generally againſt it. To this I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Third place, that ſome of thoſe who were there, (who were not Fifty in their whole Aſſembly,) did then miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand it, as is moſt evident from the Paper, which ſome of themſelves have ſince that time drawn up and ſubſcribed; wherein they do declare their ſenſe of the ſaid Propoſal, and their readineſs to ſubmit to his Majeſties Pleaſure in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, which Subſcription I have. As for that which they call their Committee, choſen ſhall I ſay, or named Three of a Province to anſwer it; they named themſelves, or which is much to the ſame purpoſe, ſome great Perſons named them all. I ſaw at their Table ſome Gentlemen of <hi>Munſter,</hi> whoſe Eſtates ſingly, are by all their Neighbours own'd to be more than the Eſtates in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the Three
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101184:8"/>
Perſons who now ſtand for that Province in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. And ſince I have ſaid in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I muſt now ſay, that of theſe Twelve Perſons, Seven or Eight are in ſuch good circumſtances here, that I queſtion whether they would return if the whole Kingdom were Reduc'd; ſome of them I am morally ſure would not, having before this Calamity ſold moſt part of their Eſtates there, and even their Stock and Houſhold Goods, and are ſetled in this Kingdom; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretend to ſhare with us in the Benevolence of the Parliament. Others of theſe Twelve, though they ſold not their Eſtates, yet have they fetch'd over Thouſands in Cash: Some of them have declared, that they will not receive their ſhares of the Fifteen Thouſand Pounds. Others of them are called to the Bar, and in practice here; let the World Judge then, whether theſe few Men, whoſe intereſt it is, not to go, ought to anſwer for ſo many Hundreds, I might ſay Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of us who deſire to go. For whatever theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are here, and full of Money may think, I do know ſome Gentlemen who had good Eſtates, and great Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Calamity, whoſe exceſſive wants have even made them Diſtracted; when they have ſought in vain to put their Daughters, Young Gentlewomen well Educated, to Services almoſt of the meaneſt degree, not having Bread to give them at home. What Barbarous Cruelty is it then (to uſe their own words,) to hinder Men from getting Relief, (how dear ſoever they pay for it) who otherwiſe may be forced to ſtarve, or perhaps to put an end to their miſerable days with their own hands.</p>
               <p>Well, but as theſe men will not go themſelves, ſo it is poſſible their Reaſons may be ſuch as will demonſtrate it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable for others to go; therefore</p>
               <p>In the Fourth place, I will impartially lay down all the Objections I have yet heard them make, and anſwer them as I am able; but by theſe Objections, I underſtand only ſuch as will lye againſt this my preſent Propoſal; I ſhall not hold my ſelf oblig'd to anſwer any other.</p>
               <p>But before I take theſe Objections in hand, I muſt give you a very ſhort Hiſtory of the occaſion of them. After that his Majeſty and his Privy Council had fully conſidered,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101184:9"/>
and were well ſatisfied of the great neceſſity and benefit of the Propoſal, they were pleaſed in order, (as is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be ſuppos'd) to be more fully inform'd of any thing that might yet more facilitate the putting it in practice, to give it into the hands of ſome Perſons of our Country, with Directions that they, with Five or Six ſuch Perſons as they ſhould think the moſt able, ſhould go together and conſider of it, that ſo what defects the ſingle thoughts of the Propoſer might have over look'd, might be ſupplied by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m; intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without all doubt, to put the ſame in practice when it ſhould have had what they could have added to it, but not at all to have theſe Gentlemens approbation of it; for ſurely that Honourable Board were as capable to judge of what was neceſſary or practicable, as theſe can pretend to be. Which mighty condeſcenſion theſe Gentlemen were ſo far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a right uſe of, and by thankfully accepting one favour, to qualify themſelves for obtaining another, that preſently a general Summons is ſent abroad for all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry to meet; from which Title no <hi>Iriſh</hi> man being willing to except himſelf, there came along with the Gentlemen of Eſtates and Quality, a parcel of Rabble, Men who had no concern in that Paper, but in that part which related to the Brief; ſuch as Sollicitors, Attorneys Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who being ſet on by ſome deſigning Men, did rail and roar at that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the Propoſer, in ſuch an undecent manner, not to ſay worſe, that had he been a Criminal, the uſage of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly could not be much inferior to his Puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the continual calumnies and threats both of them and others ever ſince, to do him ſome miſchief: All this while never conſidering, that it is not to me, but to his Majeſty to whom they offered this high affront, (from whom whatſover Paper does come, ought to be receiv'd with the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Veneration) who, by giving that Paper into the hands I before mention'd, did never intend to give me up to be torn in pieces by the Rabble, even though the Propoſal had been impracticable. Here then was the aforeſaid Committee nam'd; Two of whom, as I am inform'd, Penn'd their Anſwer, which was ſo ſcurrilous and abuſive, that aſſoon as I enter'd the Room where they were Reading of it to all their Aſſembly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101184:9"/>
the Reader was ſtruck ſilent; but after ſeveral Whiſperings round the Table, at length he began again to Read, where I heard ſo much Scurrility and Reflections, that themſelves were at laſt aſham'd to read any more till I was gone; and the Author, of himſelf, began to extenuate the ſenſe of his words, and to beg my pardon for ſome Names and other Reflecting words in it. But after they had read this Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Anſwer, to animate and inrage the Multitude againſt me, they thought fit to prepare a more Civil one for the Privy Council, but they made a Second, a Third and a Fourth before they could agree, the Contents of which I am a Stranger to; but that Honourable Board was not ſo, to the uſage that the Paper receiv'd which was ſent from them; and therefore at the delivery of their Anſwer, theſe Gentlemen, as I have heard, receiv'd the juſt reward of their temerity, a ſevere Reproof to themſelves. And I fear, that that poor Paper of theirs, notwithſtanding all the Florid Satyr it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, will hardly be able to ſave itſelf from the fate to which they had doom'd mine. And it is now generally ſaid, that ſome of them who have refus'd to go with Money, will now be ordered to go without Money; <hi>viz.</hi> the Northern Gentry. And indeed their ſtaying here is unaccountable, for I have heard it among themſelves, that ſome Gentlemen of that Country, of the beſt Quality, have not loſt out of their Houſes to the value of a Silver Spoon. I envy not their good fortune, though their ſtaying here, notwithſtanding we ſuffer for it, ſeems to argue that they pity not our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
               <p>But ſince thoſe Objections made at their firſt Meeting, and thoſe contained in their firſt Anſwer, may prevail upon ſome of thoſe Perſons who heard them, or to whom they have been communicated, it will therefore behove me to remove them, in order to the undeceiving of thoſe who may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſome matters of Fact.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Obj.</hi> Firſt, they do blacken this Propoſal with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Cruel and Barbarous, to ſend People over into a ruined Country, in the depth of Winter, to be ſtarved both with Cold and Hunger. To this I anſwer, firſt, ſuppoſing all this were true, (which it is not) yet ſtill it were better,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101184:10"/>
that ſome ſhould go over and wreſtle with ſome hardſhips, in order to the future preſerving of themſelves and thoſe that will ſtay here, than that all ſhould ſtay here, and ſo inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly periſh together for Company. It is juſt as if, when there is a ſmall leak in Ship, every one ſhould refuſe going to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the Pump, and ſo ſit ſtill at their eaſe till the Ship fill with water, and they be all ſwallowed up in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I ſay that this is not true; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not ſo ruined but that, by the help of Money, they may be well furniſhed both with Food and Firing. By the prizes which the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> has ſet on all Victuals (as on Beef a penny a Pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) it is evident that there is no want of Food in that Country; beſides the many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Letters, which do abundantly confirm the ſame, and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves do now come in both with Horſes and Cattle, for we give them money for them, whereas the late King's Army either takes them away or buys them with Braſs. But ſuppoſing that we ſhould go there, and that it ſhould ſo happen, that when we are there, we ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed for Proviſions; in ſuch Caſe I ſay, when we are in a Body, and do repreſent, that in Obedience to His Majeſties Commands we went over, and expoſed our ſelves to ſuch hardſhips, there is not the leaſt room for doubt but that we ſhould be taken care of; whereas we may now ſtay here pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in every Corner of the Streets undiſtinguiſhed and unrelieved. Inſtances of this are evident; you ſee the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois</hi> are no ſooner returned to their Country, but even ſo far from them as in <hi>London,</hi> we are raiſing money for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, yet we ſcarce thought on them, while they remained in <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> though their miſery and wants were much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And when within theſe twenty years laſt paſt there was great want of Food in <hi>New-England,</hi> even we in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſent them ſtore; the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> alone, ſent them a Ship of three hundred Tuns, loaden only with Wheat and other Victuals, and, as I have heard, we payed for the very fraight of it alſo.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, neceſſary for life, in this City, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Air and the River-water, that a poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> man can receive within his lips without coſt; one might therefore juſtly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101184:10"/>
wonder that thoſe who have lived all their life upon <hi>Dapes Inempta,</hi> have lived happily with little or no occaſion or uſe of Money, ſhould be ſo difficultly perſuaded to return to the ſame ſort of life again: to have their Bread and Beer-Corn in their Hagard, their Hens and their Geeſe giving them Eggs (which here are pence a piece, and there were twenty, nay, forty for a penny:) their Cows and their Hogs and every thing elſe neceſſary for a comfortable living.</p>
               <p>But though it be our happineſs that all things are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in great plenty in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet by the Time that, by the Bleſſing of God, we might reaſonably compute that Kingdom may be reduced, <hi>viz.</hi> about the latter end of the next Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when this years Corn is ſpent and no harveſt or very little to ſucceed it, then will the Cry of a Famine begin to riſe; ſo that when we ſhould be all going to take Poſſeſſion of our Eſtates, there will not be found a man poſſibly that will go over. For Plague being the conſtant attendant of Famine, it were as reaſonable to expect that Men ſhould go into a Peſt-houſe, as then to go for <hi>Ireland.</hi> But if there were no apprehenſions of the Plague to terrifie us from going over, yet notwithſtanding, no man will then go over, but he that carries Money enough to maintain him and his Family for one year (I might ſay for two, for ſo long it will be before we ſhall have any Wheat in that Kingdom) and of ſuch there will be but very few, perhaps none; for a greater Sum than the Revenue of the Crown, would not keep the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi> in neceſſary Food, Cloathing and Firing. I know there are ſome of us that will not apprehend any ſuch danger, for they ſay that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have ſewed a great deal of Corn in the South this Winter; but theſe men do not think that that Country is like to be the Scene of War the next year, and to lye open to two Armies; and eſpecially that we have a <hi>French</hi> Enemy to deal with, who, if the Country were ten times fuller of Corn, will ſoon (according to his uſual practice) lay it all in Aſhes.</p>
               <p>It is no ſmall ſatisfaction to me, in the Cauſe that I have undertaken, that the Government is of the ſame mind as to the neceſſity and benefit of it. And that they are ſo I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied from this, that true Policy is the ſame in all wiſe States;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101184:11"/>
and by the Letters from <hi>Rome</hi> (that School of Politicks) of the Nineteenth of <hi>November</hi> laſt, we are informed that the Colledge of Cardinals, (whoſe Authority is equivalent to that of our Parliament) upon only the Proſpect of a War the next year in <hi>Italy,</hi> and a ſmall Army of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> now upon the March, have reſolved and declared they will lend money to all Perſons whatſoever that will come and offer themſelves to ſow Corn in their Dominions. And though, by the Laws of that Country, all Farmers are to bring in their Corn, aſſoon as it is threſhed, to the publick Stores at a certain rate; yet for the further encouragement of Men to ſow at this Time, the Government there have declared, that thoſe who will now ſow, ſhall have liberty to export a fourth part of their Corn where they pleaſe. By which you may ſee, how much the Wiſdom of our King and Council, in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly receiving and approving of a Propoſal ſo agreeable to the Sentiments of that wiſe State, is beyond that of a Cabal of our Rabble who ſet up for Iriſh Stateſmen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj.</hi> The Anſwerers of the Propoſal ſay, ſecondly, that there are no Towns to dwell in, and that the Army fills the Country. As for the Army, God and the King increaſe their Number ten-fold; and as for the Towns I ſay, that there are ſeveral good ones, more than we can uſe, that have no Army near them, and that have good Land enough about them; as <hi>Colrain, Belturbet, Eniskilling</hi> and <hi>Londonderry,</hi> which, as I have heard, has not twenty Houſes uninhabitable within the Walls; it once held twenty five thouſand Souls, and now there are ſcarce three thouſand of them; I have heard lately, that ſix hundred are Soldiers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they tell us that there are no Horſes to plow withal, and that we muſt yoke our ſelves. To this I anſwer, that they who ran away in ſuch haſt at the landing of our Army, that they left their Corn ripe in the Field, when they might have reaped it (for we had no Horſe then to hinder them;) it is as likely, that they have left their Plow Garrons behind them, eſpecially conſidering that they could be of no manner of uſe to them, for the greateſt part of them are never backed; (this I know of thoſe parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> where I am concerned (the Counties of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Wicklow</hi>)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101184:11"/>
which are not leſs civilized than the <hi>North.</hi> But, ſay there be not a Plow-Horſe left in the <hi>North,</hi> (though in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt Objection it does appear there are enough brought there) this Money will ſoon fetch them from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and from <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obj.</hi> But, ſay ſome of them, that cannot be; for it was a uſual thing to ſend Horſes out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Scotland.</hi> So it was to ſend black Cattle out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England</hi>; and yet we ſhall find black Cattle enough here to carry back again, to feed us and ſtock our Lands.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they ſay, How can we live there, without Houſhold-goods, Beds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this I ſay, how do they live here? They are now Sojourners and Lodgers, and ſo they may be there in a much cheaper Country. But further, I ſay that within theſe two years paſt there have been many a ſcore Ship-loads of Bedding and other Houſhold-goods that have been brought into <hi>England,</hi> which are now as ready to be carried back again; He that conſults <hi>Briſtow, Northwales, Cheſter, Leverpool</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> will find this to be true.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Obj.</hi> Oh but, ſay ſome, this Propoſal may help us to make a better, <hi>viz.</hi> that though the Country is now too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate to inhabit, and that they that would now go muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly periſh; yet when the Country is ſetled, and a Civil Government eſtabliſhed, and the Courts of Juſtice erected, that there may be Trials of Cauſes, and even Inditements for Treſpaſſes, then if we were ſet aflote, with Money in our Pockets, we would venture to ſettle there again. But even to this ſome cried out, Who'le pay our Debts if we go?</p>
               <p>To anſwer the firſt part of this, I ſay, that if we muſt not go becauſe the Country is deſolate, by the ſame reaſon, more enforced, we muſt not go when the whole Kingdom is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, for then it will be much more deſolate. But further, if it were not a Contradiction to ſuppoſe the Country could be ſetled while all of us ſtay here, yet, even by delaying, we ſhould loſe the Opportunity of ſewing Corn, which is the principal End of this Propoſal. And that we muſt not go, till we have the Power to ruine one another with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditements for Treſpaſſes (which has beggar'd ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,) this I muſt ſay has more of the Lawyer in it than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101184:12"/>
the Chriſtian; and I wiſh that this do not give the People of <hi>England</hi> occaſion to think us litigious and an uncharitable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and conſequently render them ſo to us, which I pray God avert.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they ſay, it is impoſſible to find Perſons that will be Treaſurers under theſe Conditions. I ſay, that is but their Opinion, and the contrary is mine; neither can they prove it to be more than Opinion, till they have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Countrymen at all the great Towns in the Weſt and North of <hi>England,</hi> where they now are in great Numbers. But if, after all, none ſhould be found that would do it, yet I am not to be blamed, who, out of Good-will to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, would have them put to the leaſt Charge imaginable. The good Deſign ought not to be thrown aſide for this; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let there be a penny or two-pence an Acre allowed for his riding about, and then we ſhall have Competitors enough for it. But ſtill I ſay and do inſiſt upon it, that I would have that penny an Acre to be ſaved; for I cannot think but that, among our whole Nation, there will be found at leaſt two publick ſpirited Men, and duly qualified, who would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this labour for the publick good.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Obj.</hi> As to their Objection, that they muſt be bound that their Corn muſt grow, it being more a Cavil than an Objection, deſerves not an Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they ſay, I ſend the Nobles of our Land to plow. I bear as great a reſpect to our Nobles as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers; but I ſay that, even in <hi>England,</hi> many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility who live in the Country keep a Plow a going, though they hold it not themſelves; and I would not preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any more of our Nobility. But I ſuppoſe that few of them are among the Number of thoſe who will have need to go over; and indeed the only reaſon that they are mentioned in this Propoſal is, that their going may give a good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Obj.</hi> Then they ſay, that ſuch a Proclamation is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Precedent. To that I ſay, That in it ſelf is no Argument; there are new Precedents made in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> every Term.</p>
               <p>But further, it is not without Precedent for a State or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101184:12"/>
Kingdom to ſet forth an Edict, for ſuch or ſuch ſort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to depart their Cities or Dominions, when the good of that State, or even of thoſe Perſons, does require it; I could give ſeveral, both Ancient and Modern. But it is much more without a Precedent, that a Nation being fled or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of their Country, ſhould, when the Door is open, ſtand looking at their Country, without returning, even when at the ſame time they are near periſhing with want. Let but the poor <hi>French</hi> Refugees have the ſame Bait, and ſee how few of them will ſtay behind. And I think the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our King is without Precedent, in troubling himſelf to conquer a Country for a People, who will not return and plant in it when it is conquered. They are not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how near Enemies live to one another abroad, that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go live at <hi>Londonderry</hi> or <hi>Eniskilling,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are at <hi>Sligo.</hi> The Country of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> is within fifteen Miles of <hi>Turin,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Court, which yet is a very flouriſhing place and a ſplendid Court. And the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impregnable Fort of <hi>Hunningen,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> have been ſo many years a building, is within Cannon-ſhot of the City of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the moſt renouned of all <hi>Suiſſerland.</hi> But to return to our Objectors,</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Obj.</hi> They ſay I have left my ſelf a hole to creep out at, in excepting thoſe whom His Majeſty ſhall particularly order to ſtay here for his ſervice, and that I am underhand getting ſuch an order. But they are miſtaken, for I want not that hole, I can go out at the Gate, in being excepted among thoſe, whoſe uſual abode has not been in <hi>Ireland</hi>; for I was ſetled here with my Family before the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> went to that Government. But I will do neither, but if His Majeſty ſhall think fit to ſend over money for us to ſubſiſt withal there, I purpoſe God willing to be among the firſt that ſhall go over to ſow Corn, in doing of which, I preſume to ſay, I ſhall do His Majeſty more ſervice than I can pretend to do by ſtaying here.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſay ſome of them, if an Angel from Heaven had given a Propoſal without conſulting us firſt, we would not receive it. This deſerves not much Anſwer, however I ſhall ſay this, ſuppoſing, after all, that the King and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101184:13"/>
Council or the Houſe of Commons ſhould think this a very uſeful Propoſal; judge you then, by all the reſt of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they have raiſed againſt it, what had become of this uſeful Propoſal, if it had been firſt preſented to them. But beſides, who are theſe mighty People to be conſulted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? Forty or Fifty at moſt, who get together upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and who are in this very action juſtly incurring the ſame cenſure, in pretending to anſwer for a whole Nation, without conſulting any one of them at <hi>Briſtol, Chester</hi> or <hi>Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool,</hi> where their Numbers exceed ours here Forty to one, and who do not think their Buſineſs in <hi>England</hi> is to ſtay for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, or to be made Privy-Counſellors; but are pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own Country; and many of them have long ſince declared, that they would return, if they had but their ſhares of the 15000 <hi>l.</hi> nay many of them would go, if but their Fraight were paid for; when Men are ill, they think change of place gives eaſe of Pain. And beſides, even here in <hi>London,</hi> there are Perſons of the beſt Quality of that Kingdom, without conſulting of whom, this ſmall handful of Men think fit to act as the Repreſentatives of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But moreover, others of them have given in Propoſals to the King, without conſulting the reſt of us, and I think my Pretenſions are as good as any mans of them all, perhaps better. I had the Honour to be known to our preſent King in <hi>Holland,</hi> to attend on him in his Expedition for <hi>England,</hi> in which there were not Two Perſons more of <hi>Ireland</hi> that I know of, (except what were in the Kings Pay,) and I have the honour to have acceſs to him here; which ſingular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I have made uſe of, (God is my Witneſs, though I could appeal to others) more for the good of our poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than to my own private advantage. This I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted only for the information of ſome few of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Gentlemen, who know few of their own Countrymen more than what they meet at an Aſſizes, and who have been pleaſed to ſay, that I made theſe Propoſals only to make my ſelf known.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Obj.</hi> As for what is objected touching the Brief-Mony, we will give them leave to wipe out that whole Clauſe, for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101184:13"/>
that Money as I am inform'd, is very near to its end; I wiſh it have been laid out to better purpoſe, and have done as much good as it would have done thus employed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Obj.</hi> But the moſt Popular Objection is ſtill behind, founded upon a Propoſal given in by Sir <hi>St. J. Br—ck,</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Munſter Men to Land in the South; and he has only choſen the Forfeited Lands of the Three beſt Counties in <hi>Ireland</hi> for their pay. And the reaſonableneſs and uſefulneſs of my Propoſal being ſo likely to overthrow his, has made him to miſ-repreſent mine to every body, and to defame it with the Epithet of Diſhoneſt and Knaviſh; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt deſire your Patience, ſince my Reputation is at ſtake, (though I thank God it never was before this time, and I think I ſhall eaſily clear it now) to ſet forth the Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Inſolence as well as the Folly and Impracticableneſs of this latter Propoſal. 1<hi>st.</hi> For the Knavery, this Colonel that would be, has kept Luſty Young Men, that might, and probably would have gone over with our Army, theſe Five Months in pay upon the Brief-Money, which was deſign'd for the Relief of the Diſtreſſed, (this can be prov'd from their own Confeſſions,) ſo that the Poor Widows and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are cheated of this Charity which Luſty Young Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. 2<hi>dly.</hi> Theſe Young Men are cheated too, for as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves ſay, he has promis'd to carry over an Hundred of them as Cadets, in double pay, and that they ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to all the firſt vacancies of Commands in the Army: ſo that here he ſets up for their General too. But 3<hi>dly,</hi> moſt of all will the King be deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that firſt, in Relying on him to raiſe a Regiment of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Refugees: I am ſure it is the opinion of moſt of the conſidering Men of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that it is impoſſible to raiſe 300 Men of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who would carry a Musket on their Shoulder; upon inquiry, it will be found, that there did not go a Thouſand of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, under all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers that went into the Army, and I believe thoſe few that remain, are not now ſo fond of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame capacity; and the reaſon hereof has been plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn by the great Author of a late excellent Treatiſe, call'd <hi>the Characters of the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland. But if this Gentleman may be permitted to make up his Regiment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101184:14"/>
with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, then there are others here of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have a better pretence to it that he; for the Second diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment that the King will meet with, if he have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, will be, that too probably he will do him no ſervice with it. I will not ſay that he will carry in his Regiment to his old Maſter; but this I will ſay, that when his Majeſty came up from the Weſt to <hi>London,</hi> in our March I found this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at <hi>Windſor</hi> then a Juſtice of the Peace (and I have heard ſeveral ſay, he was a Deputy Lieutenant) under the late King, at the time when few honeſt Men in the Kingdom would accept of it. And if what he told the Committee of the Houſe of Commons be true, that he had but fourſcore Pounds a year in <hi>England,</hi> it is then the more likely that he was put in for a Tool, to ſerve ſome Turn in thoſe Times. But however the Gentry of <hi>Ireland</hi> do think that I have acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally hindred their getting the 15000<hi>l.</hi> this Gentleman did deſignedly endeavour it, for he propoſed it in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that this fifteen thouſand Pounds might not be given to us, but applyed to a better uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to the raiſing of his Regiment and mounting them.</p>
               <p>As for his Inſolence it appears, in tacitly providing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Soldiers before the Kings Pleaſure be known. 2<hi>dly.</hi> In making ſuch Demands to have the beſt forfeited Lands in the Kingdom, before they ſhew whether they ſhall deſerve the Pay of other Men. But above all, it appears in getting the Certificate of his Soldiers (that are to be,) that he is a very fit Perſon to be their Colonel, which Certificate has been on foot theſe Five Months; and which is an inſolence to his Majeſty beyond all imagination, to ſet the Feet above the Head, that the Common Soldiers and other his Titular Officers, ſhould make their Colonel, nay their General, as was before ſhewn: As to its being impracticable, I have ſhewn that before under another head.</p>
               <p>And now I will put my ſelf in the Balance with him; you muſt forgive me this little concern that I have ſhewn, for I cannot paſs by without reſentment, the Man that calls me a Knave. My Reputation is the only thing left me in this Calamity, and that no Man ſhall take from me; eſpecially I will vindicate it from the abuſes of a man ſo ſcurrilous, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101184:14"/>
he provokes even Clergy-men to beat him. But ſet us by one another a little; my Propoſal is not to make me any thing, much leſs a Collonel; neither, if the Treaſurers place in it, were worth asking for, (ſince that is the only Office that my Propoſal makes, neither is that yet made, till a man can be found that will accept of it;) yet by my own Propoſal, as I am unable to execute it, ſo I am unqualified for it; for my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is ſetled, and has been ſo theſe Four Generations paſt. I got none of it by perjuring my ſelf or other Men, nor by any other indirect courſe, I thank God; but it has been in my Family ſo long, as that by honeſt Induſtry and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry we have increas'd it, in value, not in quantity, from nine Pence an Acre, to Five and Twenty Shillings an Acre. And that makes my Calamity now the greater; he had no Plantations there to looſe, whatever he may pretend, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I have loſt what no Money, nothing but time can repair. I have never ſeen nor heard of in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations equal to what I have there loſt, both in Woods of (Grafts, and young Timber Trees; of this, your ſelf and many of my Countrey-men can be my Vouchers: For out of my great zeal to fill the Country with Orchards, I gave Fruit Trees to all that ask'd, which made me encreaſe my Nurſerys ſo extravagantly.</p>
               <p>But to return, notwithſtanding that my Propoſal carries men over as Planters, not as Soldiers; yet if any man of us have a mind to go into the Army, my Propoſal will ſet him out very well. After the charge of Sowing his Corn is paid, he will have perhaps ſome ſcores of Pounds in his Purſe to equip himſelf withall: And every man whoſe ſhare is under Twenty Pounds, and who conſequently is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Sow any Corn, has no more to do, but to receive his Money, with which, if he pleaſes, he may immediately mount himſelf for the Army. And I am ſure thoſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Fight through Age or Infirmity, or that have numerous Families, would have reaſon to approve of my Propoſal, which would give them a maintenance without Fighting, and by it the moſt infirm or aged Perſon that is concern'd in the Houſe of Commons Liſt, (who would be otherwiſe uſeleſs,) is made as uſeful to the Publick as the beſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101184:15"/>There are ſome other little Objections which ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be repeated, ſuch as the carrying over of Arms, which are deſign'd but for their own defence, and which if it had not been mention'd, they would then have cry'd out, How can we, an unarm'd People, go over and plant in an Enemies Country? But there are ſome Men among us, that have fill'd their Brains with a Notion that the Parliament will maintain them here till they can ſend them home, and that they ſhall have this 60000 <hi>l.</hi> of courſe, without going over, and will not be perſwaded to the contrary, and conſequently will not hear of ſtirring; the miſerable conſequences of which Opinion, makes my heart ake to think upon.</p>
               <p>If there are any more Objections, they are not anſwered, only becauſe I know them not, for they would not give me admittance among them, when they were drawing their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which is another Mark of their fair dealing; though poſſibly this was done with deſign, that they might Reply to me with more advantage. For ſome of us do make that uſe of the leiſure we have by our Exile, to anſwer every new Pamphlet that does not ſuit with our own Notion: but if any of them do deſign to treat this ſo, they ſhall keep the Field undiſturb'd for me. This Vindication was a debt to my Reputation, but I ſhall never think, for my part, that ſo much is due to an Opinion.</p>
               <p>But after all, I am perſwaded that the greateſt part of theſe Gentlemen are deluded by a few of their Leaders, Money'd Men, and who are in a way of Living here, who have told them that my Propoſal ſends all away, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they go, they ſhall have no ſhare in the Fifteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds; that when they come there, they ſhall have but Ten Pounds a Man: and that for that Ten Pounds, they muſt Sow Two Acres of Oats, and build a Houſe, and that on another Mans Land. Whereas this is all falſe, and on the contrary, every man, whoſe ſhare of the 45000 <hi>l.</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Twenty Pounds, is not obliged ſo much as to Sow Corn or any thing elſe, only to carry over Arms for his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. So that I hope their hard thoughts of this Propoſal will vaniſh, and of me for making it; eſpecially if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Firſt, That it would be far from being a Profit to me,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101184:15"/>
or a ſatisfaction to any thing that carrys the Nature of Man, to ſee a People, my own Nation, Ruin'd and Deſtroy'd, (as ſome to my Knowledge put it into their Heads, that that is my Deſign, who are as much Strangers to my paſt Actions as to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inclinations,) on the contrary it is moſt manifeſt, that the Good of the People in general muſt redound to my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advantage. But to ſatisfie them further, they may ſee before, that I have declared my purpoſe of going along, and to undergo to the utmoſt of my Ability, whatever hardſhips we ſhall meet with. I would deſire them to conſider ſecondly, that if either the King or the Council had thought this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal ſo ridiculous and fooliſh (as theſe men have told them it is,) ſurely they would never have given themſelves the trouble of twice reading it; whereas we ſee on the contrary they thought it worthy their ſerious Conſideration. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That this Propoſal is a force upon no man, nor does any man any wrong that ſtays here; and therefore that it is too like the Dog in the Manger, to hinder other mens going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot or will not go our ſelves. Fourthly, That the price of Corn is already riſen from two Shillings fix-pence to four Shillings a Buſhel, and no Armies yet upon the March nor Fleet fitted out. I wiſh that before the time that our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Corn could have grown, the People of <hi>England</hi> do not think too much of all the Corn we have here eaten (though for our Money) when they ſhall want it themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is not long ſince <hi>Ireland</hi> has in one Year, (but in 84,) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of Victuals alone (as I have ſeen in the account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) to the value of Two Hundred Eighty Three Thouſand Pounds Sterling, of which, not above Twenty Thouſand Pounds was in Fiſh, the reſt was in Butter and Cheeſe, Beef, Mutton, Pork and Bacon; (I ſpeak not here of Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Hides, Wool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) What an aſtoniſhment is it then to think, that in ſo few Years it ſhould be brought to that deſolate condition, as not to be able to Feed the few Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants it carries? The conſideration of this, does demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to me the Service of Forty Five Thouſand Pounds thus laid out, to be ſo great, that one can hardly doubt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having had ſo great proofs of the charitable Diſpoſition of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> but that among them, there may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101184:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſome found, who will advance and lend the Treaſury Money upon this Occaſion, if it be demanded: The gift of which would indeed have been a great Favour to us at Firſt, if we had obtain'd it upon this Propoſal without any words; but to have it offered now, will ſhew a true Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Affection, in giving us what is good for us, againſt our wills; and though we have juſtly forfeited all hopes, yet if thoſe here and at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> will upon better thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their fault, and fairly lay the Saddle on the right Horſe, and juſtly expoſe thoſe Men that have drawn them into this; who as ſome of them were a burden to us in our beſt times, ſo now have they in our greateſt diſtreſs, made us forfeit the favour of his Majeſty by their Practiſes; and with the worthy <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry of <hi>Leverpool</hi> (who are no ſmall number) joyn in an humble Supplication to his Majeſty, that he would notwithſtanding their Folly, even yet diſpoſe of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaid Propoſal, or in any other way that to his Wiſdom ſhall ſeem fit, there is yet room to hope that his Majeſty will be graciouſly inclin'd to let them be partakers of his Favours.</p>
