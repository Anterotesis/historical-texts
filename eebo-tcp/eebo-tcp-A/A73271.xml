            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The length of the Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginneth at Portſmouth in the ſouth part, and endeth at Twede in the Northe, conteinynge CCCxx. myles. This Realm aboue other is moſt fruitful on this ſyde Humbre: for beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it is fuller of mountaines. And although to the beholders of that countrey a far of, it may ſeme plaen, yet it is ful of many hils, &amp; thoſe for the moſt part voyde of trees: the valleys wherof be very delectable, in habited for the moſt part by noble men, who accordynge to ancient and olde order, deſyre not to dwell in Cities, but nere vnto valleyes and riuers in ſeuerall villages: for aduoidyng of veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wynds, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iland naturally is ſtormy.

and then ioynyng together on this ſyde King ſton vpon Hull, a goodly marchant towne, they fall into Humbre: by whiche riuer they may aryue out of Fraunce, Germanie, and Denmarke.

with the coaſt of the mayn ſea: and on the left hand with that arme of the ſea, which (as before is declared) parteth the land, and runneth vp to Chepſtoll, where the countrey is in fourme of a Horne: For at the fyrſt, it is narowe, and then groweth broader, a little beyonde the ſaid towne of ſaint Germayne, Eaſtward it bordreth vpon England: weſt, ſouth, &amp; North, the mayn ſea is round about it: It is a very bareyn ſoyle, yeldynge fruite more through trauaile of the tyllers and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, then through the goodneſſe of the grounde: but there is greate plentie of leade and tynne: in the mynyng and diggyng wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, doth ſpecially conſyſt the liuynge and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of the inhabitantes. In this onely partt of Britayn, euen to this day continueth the nation of the Britains, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng brought out of Gallia occupied and in habited that Iland (if credite may be geuen to them, whiche reporte the firſt inhabitantes of Britayn to come out of the Cities of Armeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.) The argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; profe wherof is, becauſe the Corniſhemen doo ſpeake that language, which the Britains vſe now in France, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Britons doo call Britonantes.</p>
            <p>This thing to be more true, an old ancient Chronicle doth declare, wherin I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not Cornubia, but Cornugallia, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Cornu, a horne, the forme wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

that countrey hath, and of Gallia, oute of which countrey thinhabitants came firſt, the maner of which name is not to be miſlyked. Their tongue is farr diſſonant from engliſh, but is muche lyke to the walſhe tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue many words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune to both tonges: yet this difference there is betweene them, when a Walſhman ſpeaketh, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſheman rather vnderſtandeth many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſpoken by the Walſhman, then the whole tale he telleth. Whereby it is manyfeſte, that thoſe thre people do vnderſtand one an other, in lyke maner as the Southerne Scots doo perceiue and vnderſtand the Northern. But it is a thyng very rare and meruailous, that in one Iland there ſhould be ſuch varietie of ſpeches. Cornewall or Cornugall is in the Dioceſſe of Excetour, whiche was ones wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy to be counted the fourth part of the Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as wel for the contrarietie of language, as for the firſt inhabitants thereof, as is beforeſaid.
