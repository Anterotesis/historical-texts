            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The ſpeech which the King made to the Lordes of the Parlement, on the 5. <hi>of Ianuarie</hi> 1599.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I ſpeake of that, for which I cauſed you to be héere aſſembled, I will tell you a hiſtorie, which euen now I put the Marſhall <hi>De la Chaſtre</hi> in minde of.</p>
            <p>Preſently after S. <hi>Bartholmeus,</hi> foure of vs playing at Dice, ſawe ſome drops of blood appearing on the Table, the which being wiped twice out, they ſtill returned againe. And for the third time, I ſayd I would play no longer, and that it was an Augure againſt them which had ſpilt it: The Lord <hi>Guiſe</hi> being one of the companie.</p>
            <p>This talke ended, his Maieſtie ſaid as followeth.</p>
            <p>YOu ſée me in my cloſet, where I come to ſpeake with you, not in Royall habitements, with my Rapier and Helmet, as my predeceſſors, norlike a Prince who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to ſpeake to forraigne. Embaſſadors: but appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled like a father of a familie, in a doublet, to ſpeake fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarlie to his children. That which I haue to ſay, is to pray you, to verifie the Edict which I haue graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of the Religion. That which I haue doone, is for the good of the peace, which I haue concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and I will now haue it within my Realme. You ought to obay me, although there were no other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but my qualitie, and the obligation of all my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and eſpecially you of my Parlement. Some I haue replaced in their houſes, from which they were baniſhed: and other ſome in the faith which otherwiſe they would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173226:3"/>
not haue had. If the obedience was doone to my predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: as much or more is dew to me, becauſe that I haue reeſtabliſhed the eſtate: God hauing choſen mee, to ſet me in the kingdome which is dewe to me by inheritance and purchaſe. The Lordes of my Parliament ſhould not be in their ſeates without me. I will not vaunt nor boaſt, but thus much I will ſay, that I haue no other example to imitate, but my ſelfe: I know full well, that there hath béene great briberie: and that ſeditious preachings haue béene raiſed vp. But I will ſet good order for thoſe men, and will not referre the ſame to you: It is euen the way which was taken, to make the Barricadoes, and to come by degrées to the murther of the late King. Naye I will looke to all that, I will cut the roote of all thoſe factions, and of all factious Sermons, and will ſhorten all thoſe which ſhall raiſe them. I haue leaped vpon the walles of Citties, I ſhall alſo be able to leape vppon your Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, which are not ſo high. Alleadge not vnto me, the Catholique religion: I loue it better then you: I am more Catholique then you: I am the eldeſt ſonne to the church, which none of you is, nor cannot bee: you deceiue your ſelues greatly, in ſuppoſing your ſelues in the Popes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: I am in it better then you. (If in caſe that I will vndertake it, I will cauſe all you to be declared hereticks for not obeying me. I haue more intelligence at <hi>Rome</hi> then you: you may doe enough, I ſhall know what eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of you ſaye: I know all what is in your houſes: I know all what you doe and ſay: I haue a little Demon, who reuealeth it all vnto me. Thoſe which will not haue my Edict to paſſe, ſéeke warres. I will declare them to morrowe to thoſe of the Religion: but I will not make the warres. You your ſelues ſhall goe thether, with your gownes, and gather againe the proceſſion of the Cappu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins, which ſhall carrie their Muſkets vpon their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: It will bee a goodly ſight to ſée you. If you will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173226:3"/>
not paſſe my Edict, you will make me goe to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: You ſhall be vnkinde, when you ſhall haue engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me this enuie: Witneſſe thoſe of my counſaile which haue found the Edict good and needfull, for the eſtate of my affaires: my Lord the Conſtable, my Lord Chaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, my Lords of <hi>Belliure,</hi> of <hi>Sancy, de Sillery</hi> and <hi>Villeron,</hi> I haue doone it by their aduice, and of the Dukes and Peeres. There was not one of them, that durſt name himſelfe Protector of the Catholique Religion, or that durſt denie to haue giuen me his aduice therein. I am the onely conſeruator of the Religion. I will, well enough diſſipate the commotions which will bee <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owed. They haue complained at <hi>Paris,</hi> that I would make ſome leuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Switzers, or other gathering of troopes. Well, I haue doone it: It ought to bee well thought of, and it ſhould be to a good end, by reaſon of all my forepaſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors. Witneſſe what I haue doone for the reconqueſt of <hi>Amiens:</hi> where I haue employed the moneys of the Edicts, which you would not haue paſſed, had I not gone to the Parliament. Neceſſitie conſtraind me to make this Edict: through the ſame neceſſitie I haue at other times playde the Souldier. It is ſpoken of, and yet I haue not made any ſemblance thereof. I am King now, and ſpeak like a King. I will be obeyed.</p>
            <p>In déed I confeſſe, that the Iuſtice is my right arm. But if now the right arme be infected, the left ought to cut it off. When my regiments doe not ſerue me, I caſheere them. What ſhall you gaine by not verifying the Edict? for aſwell will I paſſe it. The Preachers may preache their fill, and brawle: as the brother to my Lord of <hi>Silery</hi> hath doone, to whome I will ſpeake in this companie. And hauing called the ſaide Lorde of <hi>Sillery,</hi> he ſaid.</p>
            <p>I haue before aduertiſed you of ſome complaints doone againſt your brother, as alſo I had commaunded you to admoniſh him to reſtraine himſelfe, and to bee wiſe.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173226:4"/>
At the firſt, I beléeued that there was no ſuch matter, that he had preached againſt the Edict: becauſe there were no proofes, yet was it true: And at laſt, he got to S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> where my Generall Atturney hath heard him preach ſeditiouſly, againſt the Edict, but it was not taken vp as it ought, they will accuſe him to be mooued by an inconſiderate zeale. But be it of purpoſe or otherwiſe, it is alwaies euill, and this inconſiderate zeale deſerues a puniſhment. This complaint done, his Maieſty returning to the Lords of his Parlament, ſaid: There is not one of you but findes me good, when he néedeth me, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not one amogſt you but néed me once a yeere: And yet notwithſtanding to me which am ſo good, you are bad. If the other Parlements, for hauing reſiſted my will, haue béen cauſes that thoſe of the Religion, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded new thinges: I will not that you alſo bee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of other nouilties, by your refuſall. <hi>Anno.</hi> 94. and 95. when I ſent you a declaration vpon the Edict of <hi>Anno</hi> 77. for the prouiſion of the Officers. I had promiſed not to prouide any of the religion, with the Eſtates of the court of Parlement: Since that, the time hath changed the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: yet neuertheleſſe I will haue good aſſuraunce of thoſe vnto whom I commit charges, that they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues as they ought. Speake not ſo much of the Catholike Religion. All thoſe great Catholike and Eccleſiaſtical cryers, if I giue but to the one, a benefice of 2000. crownes, and to another 4000. pounds of rent, they wil play mum, they will not ſpeake a word more. I iudge of this ſort of all the reſt which ſpeake againſt the Edict. There are fomelewde, which ſéeme to hate ſinne, but it is, for feare of the paines: and the good hate it for the loue of vertue. I remember once I learned two Lattin verſes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Oderunt peccare male formidine pene,</l>
               <l>Oderunt peccare boni virturis Amore.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:173226:4"/>I haue not repeated theſe verſes theſe twenty yéers, but at this preſent, becauſe I know that ſome of you which hate ſinne, do beare the hate for loue of the vertue: and I wiſh puniſhment to thoſe which ſhall hate it for feare of the paine. And afterwards (as doth a ſonne to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) they will thanke me for the puniſhment. I had not thought to haue ſent for you but yeſter night late. Séeing the Edict whereof I tell you, is the Edict of the late King: Alſo it is mine: for it hath this day béen done by me, and I doe yet confirme it. I finde not good to haue one thing in my mind and to write another. And although ſome others haue done ſo, yet will I not doe it. The laſt words which you ſhall haue of me is. That you follow the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Monſieur du meyne:</hi> who, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome deſiring him to make ſome enterprizes againſt my wil: anſwered that he was too much bound vnto me, as alſo all my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, amongſt the which he would alwaies be one, who ſhould expoſe his life to pleaſure me: Becauſe that I haue reeſtabliſhed Fraunce, in diſpight of thoſe which ſought the ruine thereof: Although that in times paſt, he would haue aſſayed all wayes and meanes to ouerthrow the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. If then the head of the league, hath ſpoken ſo: how much more ought you which I haue reeſtabliſhed? Thoſe which alwaies haue béene faithfull vnto me: Thoſe which I haue replaced in their houſes: In fine what ought they to doe? Finally, grant vnto my requeſts: what you will not graunt to threates, yet ſhall you not haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of me: doe what I commaund you, and what I pray you. Yee ſhall not onely doe it for me, but alſo for your ſelues, and to the good of the peace.</p>
