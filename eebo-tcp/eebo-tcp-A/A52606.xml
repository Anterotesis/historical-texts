            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN Anſwer to yours, demanding a brief account of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> called alſo <hi>Socinians;</hi> their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning God (in which only they differ from other Chriſtians, the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> profeſſedly agreeing with them in other points of Faith and Doctrine) and the Defence they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make of their Hereſy. They are called <hi>Socinians,</hi> from <hi>F. Socinus,</hi> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian Noble-Man, and a principal Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Party. They affirm, God is only one Perſon, not three. They
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105752:3"/>
make our Lord Chriſt to be the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Miniſter, Servant, and Creature of God; they confeſs he is alſo the Son of God, becauſe he was begotten on bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> by the Spirit or Power of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. But they deny that he or any other Perſon but the <hi>Father</hi> (the God and Father of the ſaid our Lord Chriſt) is God Almighty and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, is the Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.</p>
                  <p>That the Lord Chriſt was a Man, the Son, Prophet, Meſſenger, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Servant, and Creature of God; not himſelf God, they think is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by theſe (as they call them) Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If our Lord Chriſt were himſelf God, there could be no Perſon greater than he; none that might be called his Head, or his God; none that could in any reſpect command him. But the Holy Scriptures teach, that the <hi>Father</hi> is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Chriſt; is the Head, and the God of Chriſt; and gave Commandment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105752:3"/>
to him, what he ſhould ſay, and what he ſhould do. <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. <hi>My Father is greater than I.</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 3. <hi>The Head of Chriſt, is God.</hi> John 20. 17. <hi>I aſcend to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God.</hi> John 12. 49. <hi>The Father which ſent me, he gave me a Commandment, what I ſhould ſay.</hi> John 14. 31. <hi>As the Father gave me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, ſo do I.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If our Lord Chriſt were indeed God, it could not without Blaſphemy be (abſolutely and without Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) affirmed of him, that he is the Creature, the Poſſeſſion, the Servant, and Subject of God; or that for his Obedience, he was rewarded and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by God. But the inſpired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Holy Scripture do ſay, that the Son our Lord Chriſt is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, the Poſſeſſion of God, the Servant of God; was obedient to God, and for that cauſe by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded and exalted; alſo that when God ſhall have ſubjected all Men to his Son our Lord Chriſt, yet even then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105752:4"/>
ſhall he remain ſubject to God. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>The firſt-born (from the dead,</hi> ver. 18.) <hi>of every Creature.</hi> Heb. 3. 1, 2. <hi>Conſider the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our Profeſſion Jeſus Chriſt, who was faithful to him that appointed him.</hi> In the Greek, and in the Margin of our Bibles, 'tis <hi>faithful to him that made him.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 23. Ye are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's.</hi> Matth. 12. 17, 18. <hi>That it might be fulfilled that was ſpoken by</hi> Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,—<hi>Behold my Servant.</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient,—Wherefore God hath highly exalted him; and given him a Name above every Name.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 28. <hi>When all things ſhall be ſubdued to him, then ſhall the Son alſo be ſubject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that is true God, is not the Miniſter, or Prieſt of any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons; he neither doth nor will (being himſelf Omnipotent and All-ſufficient) mediate or intercede with any whomſoever, for his Servants and People. But 'tis certain that our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105752:4"/>
Lord Chriſt is the Miniſter, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of God and Men; a Prieſt that appeareth in the Preſence of God, and intercedeth with him for Men. <hi>Heb. 8. 6. Now hath he obtained a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Miniſtry.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Jeſus Christ.</hi> Heb. 2. 17. <hi>A merciful and faithful High-Prieſt in things pertaining to God.</hi> Heb. 9. 24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the Holy place made with Hands, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for us.</hi> Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Almighty God doth all things in his own Name, and by his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; He ever doth his own Will, and ſeeketh his own Glory; he declares himſelf to be the prime Object of Faith and Worſhip; and pronounces all Doctrines or Religions to be vain, which proceed not from Him alone. But in our Lord Chriſt all things are contrary, for he declares, that he came
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105752:5"/>
not into the World in his own Name or Authority; not to do his own Will, or ſeek his own Glory, or propound himſelf as the principal Object of our Faith or Worſhip, or to publiſh a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his own. <hi>John 17. 28. I am not come of my ſelf.</hi> John 5. 43. <hi>I am come in my Father's Name.</hi> John 8. 42. <hi>I proceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi> John 5. 30. <hi>I ſeek not my own Will.</hi> John 8. 50. <hi>I ſeek not my own Glory.</hi> John 12. 44. <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> Phil. 2. 11. <hi>That every Tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> John. 7. 16. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. God was always moſt wiſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ignorant of any thing: He need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the concurrence of any other Perſon, to aſſure him that he judgeth right. <hi>He cannot</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 13.) <hi>be tempted.</hi> And as he is infinitely great, ſo he is no leſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105752:5"/>
Good. But the ſacred Writers do not ſpeak of the Lord Chriſt after this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. They ſay our Lord Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in Wiſdom; that he profeſſed himſelf ignorant of ſome things; that he aſcribed the Certainty and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Judgment to the Father's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with him; that he was <hi>tried</hi> by great Temptations, being thereto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Holy Ghoſt; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be called Good, becauſe God only is Good. <hi>Luke 2. 52. Jeſus increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Wiſdom,—and in Favour with God and Men.</hi> Mark 13. 32. <hi>Of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man</hi> (In the Greek tis, <hi>none</hi> knoweth) <hi>no not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</hi> S. <hi>Matthew</hi> (Mat. 24. 36.) adds, <hi>But the Father only.</hi> John 11. 34. <hi>Where have ye laid him? They ſay unto him, Lord, come and ſee.</hi> John 8. 16. <hi>My Judgment is true, for I am not alone; but I and the Father that ſent me.</hi> Matth. 4. 1. <hi>Then was Jeſus led of the Spirit, to be tempted of the Devil.</hi> Luke 18. 19. <hi>Why calleſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105752:6"/>
thou me good? there is none good ſave one, that is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. God giveth what and to whom himſelf pleaſeth; he needs not the Aid of any other; he entreateth not for himſelf or People; he cannot die, and he deriveth his Power from none but himſelf. But 'tis certain that the Lord Chriſt could not himſelf, without the previous Ordination of the Father, confer the prime Dignities of Heaven, or of the Church. He placed his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Father's Preſence and Help. He prayed often and fervently to the Father, both for himſelf and for his Diſciples. He died, and was raiſed from the dead by the Father. After his Reſurrection he received <hi>of another,</hi> that great Power which he now injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Matth. 20. 23. To ſit on my right Hand, and on my left, is not mine to give; but [it ſhall be given] to them, for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi> John 8. 29. <hi>He that ſent me, is with me; and the Father hath not left me alone, for I always do thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105752:6"/>
Luke 22. 42. <hi>Father, if thou be willing, remove this Cup from me.</hi> Heb. 5. 7. <hi>Who in the Days of his Fleſh offered up Prayers and Supplications, with ſtrong Crying and Tears, unto him that was able to ſave him.</hi> John 17. 20. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe in me through their Word.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 19, 20. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mighty working of his Power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead.</hi> Matth. 28. 18. <hi>Jeſus came and ſpake to them, ſaying, All Power is given to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Jeſus Chriſt is in holy Scripture always ſpoken of, as a diſtinct and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Perſon from God; and deſcribed to be the Son of God, and the Image of God: Rom. 16. 27. <hi>To God only wiſe, be Glory through Jeſus Christ.</hi> Luke 18. 19. <hi>Why callest thou me good? there is none good ſave one, that is God.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Jeſus Christ.</hi> John 13. 18. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, is condemned already, becauſe

always ſpeaking thus of God, either he is only <hi>one Perſon;</hi> or the Scriptures are one continued ungrammatical Soloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm and Impropriety, and that in the capital Article of Faith, which no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or good Man can or ever will allow.

God <hi>three</hi> Perſons, they could <hi>never</hi> ſpeak of themſelves, or be ſpoken to, by the ſingular Pronouns, <hi>I, Thou, Thee, Him, Me;</hi> becauſe 'tis contrary not only to Grammar, (which is always to be obſerved, when there is no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to the contrary) but to the Cuſtom of all Nations which underſtand to ſpeak intelligibly and ſenſibly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Had the Son, or Holy Ghoſt, been God, this would not have been omitted in the Apoſtles Creed. This Creed (ſay they) which is of next, if not equal Authority to any part of Holy Scripture, after having declared that God is <hi>the Father Almighty,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Heaven and Earth; ſpeaks not a Word of the Godhead of the Son, or Holy Ghoſt. It deſcribes the Son by all the characters of a Man, and by ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it ſays, he was conceived or begotten by the Holy Ghoſt on Bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> that accordingly he was born of her; that he was crucified, died, and was buried; that he roſe on the third day, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven: all theſe are the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105752:12"/>
Deſcriptions of a Man: for God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived, or be born, or die, no nor aſcend into Heaven, for he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways there. Not content to take no notice that he is God, this Creed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes him very plainly from God, (that is, denies him to be God) by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>He ſits at the right Hand of God.</hi> i. e. He is advanced to be next to God, and is under the immediate and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Protection of God. Concerning the Holy Ghoſt, this Creed ſays no higher thing than it ſays of the Church, I believe <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>in the Holy Catholick Church.</hi> For in the Greek, the ſame Prepoſition <hi>in,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both alike; and ſo alſo is this Creed recited by St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and by St. <hi>Cyprian ad</hi> Numid. and by <hi>Socrates</hi> Hiſt. l. 1. c. 26. If the Compilers of this Creed had believed, that either the Son or Spirit is God; tis unaccountable that they ſhould take no notice of it in a Greed, and ſuch a Creed as was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely drawn up to repreſent all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Articles of Religion. If a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105752:13"/>
(ſay they) were to draw up a Confeſſion of his Faith, he would do it in no other Words, but theſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and on the contrary, no <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian,</hi> after having deſcribed <hi>the Father,</hi> by all the uſual Characters of God, (ſaying, he is <hi>God, Almighty,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Heaven and Earth)</hi> would fail to mention the Divinity of the Son and Holy Spirit; whence we muſt needs infer, that the Apoſtles believed as the <hi>Socinians,</hi> not as the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning God, Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To conclude; Theirs (they ſay) is an accountable and a reaſonable Faith; but that of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> is abſurd, and contrary both to Reaſon and <hi>to it ſelf,</hi> and therefore not only falſe, but <hi>impoſſible.</hi> For you (ſay they) teach, there are three almighty, and moſt wiſe Perſons, and yet but one God; as if every <hi>Almighty and moſt wiſe Perſon</hi> were not a God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently three ſuch Perſons, three Gods. You add yet more abſurdly, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105752:13"/>
there are three Perſons who are <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and each of them true God,</hi> and yet there is but one true God: This is <hi>an Error in counting</hi> or numbring; which when ſtood in, is of all others the moſt brutal and inexcuſable; and not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it, is not to be a Man. But we would not (ſay they) trouble our ſelves at the non-ſenſe of this Doctrine, if it did not impoſe falſe Gods on us; by advancing two to be Gods, who are not ſo: and rob alſo the one true God of the Honour due to him, and of which he is jealous.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, is the Doctrine of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> more commonly by others call'd <hi>Socinians,</hi> concerning Almighty God; and theſe their Arguments; which I have ſo related as not to judg or rail of their Perſons, becauſe however learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reaſonable Men (which is their Character among their worſt Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) may be argued out of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yet few will be ſwagger'd or chode out of them.

of their Hiſtory; from the time that they have been taken notice of in the World.</p>
                  <p>They whom we call <hi>Socinians,</hi> were by the Fathers and firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity called <hi>Nazarens;</hi> by which name St. <hi>Paul</hi> is accuſed before <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 5.

3. <hi>Paulus of Samoſatum,</hi> Biſhop and Patriarch of <hi>Antioch;</hi> a Man not only learned and eloquent, but ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in that Capital City of the <hi>East,</hi> that an Epiſcopal Council there aſſembled, were not of ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with his Citizens, to caſt him out of St. <hi>Peter's Chair. 4.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105752:15"/>
is one, in the Year 194; but with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Succeſs, till that which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Doctrine of the <hi>Arians</hi> grew into general Credit and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Origen,</hi> and other principal Fathers teaching (as the <hi>Arians</hi> afterwards did) that <hi>the Father</hi> is indeed before the Son and Holy Spirit, <hi>in Time, in Dignity, and in Power,</hi> yet that <hi>the Word,</hi> or Son, who in the fulneſs of time took our nature on him, was generated or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome time before the World, and was the Father's Servant and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in making the World; and that the Holy Ghoſt was the Creature of the Son, and ſubſervient to him in making all things: this Doctrine being advanced by <hi>Juſtin, Origen,</hi> and others of note in the Church; and ſeeming <hi>more for the Honour of the Son,</hi> than the plain and ſimple Doctrine of the <hi>Nazarens,</hi> by the Help of Perſecution prevailed againſt theirs, and became the more current Doctrine of the Church, till in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it

was condemned, and another <hi>more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> (and ſo more taking) <hi>than that</hi> (as attributing to the Son, Eternity, and Equality with the Father) did generally obtain, being ſupported by Imperial Authority. But did Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition (ſay the <hi>Socinians)</hi> ſtop here? No, for there ſhortly aroſe another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the Son and Holy Spirit are the ſame God with the Father, not only (as the Nicene Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained this matter) by Unity of Wills, and ſpecifical Identity or ſameneſs of Subſtance, but by numerical or true Identity and ſameneſs of Subſtance and Nature. This laſt has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by ſo many terrible penal Laws, partly obtained of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours by Catholick Biſhops; partly made by Popes in the times of their Omnipotence; that now not only the <hi>Nazaren</hi> Faith, but the <hi>Arian</hi> and the <hi>Nicene</hi> (truly ſo called) are no where openly profeſt in the Territories of Chriſtian Princes and States; except in a few Cities of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105752:16"/>
ſome Churches of the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, in which Countries Liberty of Conſcience makes a part of their Civil Rights and Franchiſes. But in the Turkiſh and other Mahometan and Pagan Dominions, where alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Provinces of Chriſtians have Liberty of Conſcience, the Nazaren and Arian Churches are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.

1. <hi>D. Eraſmus,</hi> the reſtorer of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath given occaſion both to his Friends and Enemies to think him an <hi>Arian.</hi> He ſaith, that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. was the principal Argument of the Fathers againſt the <hi>Arians;</hi> but that to ſay true, it proves nothing againſt them. He notes on <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. that the word <hi>God</hi> being <hi>uſed abſolutely,</hi> doth in the Apoſtolick Writings always ſignifie <hi>the Father.</hi> In his <hi>Scholia</hi> on the third Tome of St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> Epiſtles, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the <hi>Arians</hi> were Hereticks; he adds, farther, that they were ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to our Men in Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. 'Tis believed, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> did not make himſelf a party to that which he eſteemed the ignorant and dull ſide of the Queſtion. In his Epiſtle to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libaldus,</hi> he ſpeaks as openly as the times would permit a wiſe Man to ſpeak, I (ſaith <hi>Eraſmus)</hi> could be of the <hi>Arian</hi> Perſwaſion, if the Church approved it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>H. Grotius</hi> is Socinian all over. This great Man in his younger Years
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105752:17"/>
attacked the Socinians in a principal Article of their Doctrine: But being anſwered by <hi>J. Crellius,</hi> he not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver replied, but thank'd <hi>Crellius</hi> for his Anſwer; and afterwards publiſhing ſome Annotations on the Bible, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the whole according to the mind of the <hi>Socinians.</hi> There is nothing in all his Annotations, which they do not approve and applaud. His Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are a compleat Syſtem of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, not excepting his Notes on <hi>John 1. 1, &amp;c.</hi> which are written ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and interwove with ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Quotations, that he has cover'd himſelf, and his ſenſe of that Portion of Scripture, from ſuch as do not read him carefully.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>D. Petavius,</hi> the moſt Learned of the Jeſuits, has granted that generally the Fathers who lived before the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Council, and whoſe Writings are preſerved, agreed in their Doctrine concerning God with the <hi>Nazarens</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> and concerning the Son our Lord Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105752:17"/>
the <hi>Arians.</hi> For 'tis to be noted that the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> agree in their Doctrine concerning God, that he is only one Perſon, the God and Father of our Lord Chriſt; but they differ concerning the Son and Holy Spirit. The Son, according to the <hi>Arians,</hi> was generated or created ſome time before the World, and in proceſs of time, for great and neceſſary cauſes, became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate in our Nature: The Holy Ghoſt (they ſay) is the Creature of the Son, and ſubſervient to him in the Work of Creation. But the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> deny, that the Son our Lord Chriſt had any Exiſtence before he was born of Bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> being conceived in her by the holy Spirit of God: They ſay, the Spirit is the Power and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, ſaving that Mr. <hi>Bidle,</hi> and thoſe that follow him, take the holy Spirit to be a Perſon, chief of the Heavenly Spirits, prime Miniſter of God and Chriſt, and therefore called <hi>the Spirit</hi> by way of excellence; and the <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit, to diſcriminate him
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105752:18"/>
from Satan, Prince and Chief of the wicked and Apoſtate Spirits. This difference notwithſtanding, becauſe they agree in the principal Article, that there is but <hi>one God,</hi> or but one who is God, both parties <hi>(Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians)</hi> are called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and eſteem of one another as Chriſtians and true Believers, as may be ſeen on the part of the <hi>Arians</hi> in their Hiſtorian <hi>Chr. Sandius;</hi> (Hiſt. Eccl. l. 1. c. de <hi>Paul. Semoſat.)</hi> and for the <hi>Socinians</hi> in the Diſputation of <hi>Alba.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Petavius,</hi> He often affirms, that the Doctrine of the Trinity, and of the Divinity of the Son and Spirit, cannot be proved by Scripture only; and that thoſe who have attempted it, have always been baffled. He adds, there is no way to Unity in the Church about theſe matters, but by contenting our ſelves to ſpeak concerning them, as the Fathers who lived <hi>neareſt to the Apoſtles time</hi> did ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. S. <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> ſo much eſteemed by our Engliſh Divines, ſeems to have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105752:18"/>
been an <hi>Arian.</hi> He ſaith, the Father is ſo firſt, as to be firſt in order <hi>(i. e. time)</hi> in Dignity and in Power. He ſaith, that to make three equal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in God or in the Godhead, is to make three Gods. He denies, that the Lord Chriſt is the Son of God by ſubſtantial Generation, that is, by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from the Father's Subſtance or Eſſence. Speaking of the Creeds that expreſs the Catholick Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Divinity of the Son and Spirit, he ſaith, that Biſhops in general Councils being led by Fury, Faction, and Madneſs, did not ſo much compoſe as huddle up Creeds for the Church: See for theſe things <hi>Epiſc. Inſt. Theol.</hi> l. 4 c. 32, 33, 34.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>C.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Doctrine</hi> has been reduced ſo low by the Perſecutions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Arms of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and other Kings of <hi>France,</hi> for which Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they have been requited by the Roman Pontiff. with the Titles of <hi>Most Chriſtian Kings,</hi> and <hi>Eldest Sons</hi> of the Church.

                  <p>But, Sir, I perceive I have drawn out this account of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

Theſe things caſt a great Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh on the Reformers: It was ſaid, they only condemned Cruelty, when acted on themſelves; but were ready to practiſe it when they had Power.

                  <p>THE Texts and Arguments from them, objected to the Doctrine of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> and <hi>Saoinians</hi> concerning God, are ſo many; that 'tis impoſſible to give a tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what they anſwer to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, <hi>in a Letter;</hi> their Anſwers would indeed require a Volume. Yet becauſe I would not wholly diſappoint your Expectations and Demands, I will <hi>in ſeveral Letters</hi> lay before you ſome part of what they reply to the Texts and Arguments taken from the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105752:22"/>
Old Teſtament; what to thoſe that are found in the Goſpels and Acts; what to thoſe out of the Epiſtles and Revelation.</p>
                  <p>The Texts objected to them out of the Old Teſtament, are of two ſorts. 1. Thoſe which ſingly and alone prove the Trinity, or the Divinity of the Son or Spirit. 2. Thoſe which perhaps would not, if alone conſidered, prove the Orthodox Doctrine; but do it ſufficiently when compared <hi>with,</hi> and interpreted <hi>by</hi> ſome Texts of the New Teſtament. I will propound both theſe in the order of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gen. 1. 26. Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make Man in our Image.</hi> Anſw. (1.) This Text hath been conſidered in the foregoing Letter. (2.) But 'tis to be alſo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved, that ſome Rabbies ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Original Hebrew thus, <hi>Let Man be made in our Image.</hi> Meaning (ſay they) in the Likeneſs of God and Angels: for he ſpeaketh to the Angels who were all preſent: <hi>Job.</hi> 38. 4. 7. Yet God ſpeaketh to them, not as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutants,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105752:22"/>
but as Spectators of his Work. They note, that this Tranſlation agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the ſtile uſed all along in this chapter; <hi>ver. 3. Let there be Light.</hi> ver. 6. <hi>Let there be a Firmament.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Let the Waters bring forth.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Gen. 3. 22. God ſaid, The Man is become as one of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, to know Good and Evil.</hi> Anſw. (1.) It may be (and is by very many learned Men) ſaid, that God ſpeaketh here to the Angels. (2.) But others tranſlate the Hebrew words thus, the Man is become one <hi>of himſelf,</hi> knowing Good and Evil. And thus alſo 'tis expreſſed in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> Tranſlation by <hi>Onkelos.</hi>

Note that God is ſaid <hi>to go down,</hi> becauſe his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er accompanied his Angels, who were either Miniſters, or Spectators of his miraculous Work.</p>

Whereas ſo exceptionable a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as that of the Trinity, and its Dependances, ought to be proved by clear Texts and demonſtrative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; on the contrary, theſe Texts are ſo far from being clear and evident Proofs, that a Man muſt have a more than ordinary Wit and Capacity to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how moſt of them are at all to the purpoſe, and why or to what end they are alledged by the <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though in the Heat of Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Anger, Men catch up any Weapon againſt their Adverſaries; yet out of theſe Heats the more learned and judicious <hi>Trinitarians</hi> confeſs, that the Trinity and the Divinity of Chriſt and of the Holy Spirit, are not indeed taught in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, but are a Revelation made to us in the New. So ſaith <hi>Tertullian, Adv. Prax. c. 3. Cyprian, Serm.</hi> 6. St. <hi>Jerom, Adv. Lucif. Thcodoret l. 2. ad Graec. R. Tuitienſis de Divin. Offic. l. 11. c. 14. Fr. L. Brugenſis</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 1. 49.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105752:35"/>
and on <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Card. Bellarmine de Chriſt. l. 2. c.</hi> 6. and more plainly <hi>de Purg. l. 1. c. 11. Calovius Anticrel. S. 420. Alf. Salmero Proſ. in Evang. 11. q.</hi> 3. And infinite more, both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Reformed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If ſo many had not confeſſed it, yet the thing is evident in it ſelf. For if the Trinity were indeed taught in the Old Teſtament, how came the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church in all Ages to be ſo wholly ignorant of it, that (as all confeſs) they had not the leaſt Suſpicion, that God is more than one Perſon? And if in this they had erred, 'tis not to be doubted our Saviour would have repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Hereſy, and carefully ſet them right, as he did <hi>in the matter of the Reſurrection.</hi> But doth our Lord any where charge them with Hereſy, for believing that God is only one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Socinians</hi> confeſs, that to Perſons who never read any thing of this great Queſtion, ſome of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Texts, <hi>both of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105752:35"/>
Old and New Teſtament</hi> may ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harſh and ſtrained. But this (they ſay) is only becauſe ſuch Perſons have been <hi>always accuſtomed</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the alledged Texts in a contrary ſenſe, that is, in the ſenſe of the Church: but if they will <hi>often read and conſider</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſenſe of them, they will ſoon diſcern that 'tis not only a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe, but the true and only ſenſe of which theſe Texts are capable, if we would reconcile them to the reſt of Scripture, and (particularly) to the many and clear Texts and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cited and hinted in the firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <head>A Third Letter, <hi>Concerning the</hi> Unitarians, <hi>called</hi> Socinians.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN this I give you the Texts of <hi>the Evangeliſts and Acts</hi> objected to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine concerning God our Lord Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit: and the Anſwers of the <hi>Socinians</hi> to the Arguments ariſing from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Matth. 1. 23. <hi>They ſhall call his Name</hi> Immanuel, <hi>which being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is, God with us. Anſw.</hi> See on <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Matth. 2. 2. <hi>Where is he that is born King of the</hi> Jews, <hi>for we—are come to worſhip him. Anſw.</hi> Neither
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105752:38"/>
the Hebrew, Greek, nor Latin Word for <hi>worſhip</hi> him, import any more than <hi>a civil</hi> Worſhip and Honour. And it was the manner over all the Eaſt, and particularly among the Jews, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to Kings, 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 18. 1 Kings 1. 16, 23, 31. 2 Sam.</hi> 9. 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Mat. 9. 6. <hi>The Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins. Anſw.</hi> This is plainly ſpoken of Chriſt as he was a Man. God gave this Authority to the Lord Chriſt, becauſe he gave to him alſo to know what was in Mens Hearts; namely, whether their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and outward Profeſſions were ſincere and laſting. <hi>John 2. 24, 25. Rev.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Mat. 11. 27. <hi>All things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to me of my Father, and no Man knoweth the Son but the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) If Chriſt were himſelf that <hi>one true God,</hi> it could not be ſaid here that <hi>another Perſon</hi> gave all things into his Hands. (2.) The moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Interpreters do underſtand <hi>all things</hi> here, to be all things requiſite for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105752:38"/>
procuring and effecting the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation of Men, or all things neceſſary to the executing the Office of the Meſſias. Whereas our Lord adds, <hi>None knoweth the Son but the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Maldonate</hi> and <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> make the ſenſe to be, None but God knows <hi>what the Son's Office is,</hi> or what he is to do and ſuffer in order to the Salvation of Men; as on the other ſide, none but the Son knows <hi>the Father's Mind,</hi> concerning the way and means by which Mankind is to be redeemed and ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Mat. 12. 31. <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven. Anſw.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and generally all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Interpreters, by Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt or Spirit, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Mens aſcribing (with the Scribes and Phariſees in this Chapter) the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Works done apparently by the Spirit or Power of God, unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, or the Power of the Devil. So that the Holy Ghoſt or Spirit is not in this Text a Perſon or a God, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Power of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:105752:39"/>
(6.) Mat. 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Matth. 28. 20. <hi>I am with you always, even to the end of the World. Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is in the midſt of, and is with his People; not by an immediate Preſence, as God is, but by his moſt powerful Aid and Help, which he affordeth partly by his continual and ſuccesful Mediation with God for them all in general, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. partly by the Angels who are under his Directions, and by him engaged in the Defence of the Faithful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) Matth. 26. 63. <hi>Tell us whether thou be the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> Like to which Text are <hi>Matth. 14. 33. Mat. 16. 16. John 1. 49. Anſw.</hi> It being manifeſt that Princes are called Sons of God by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. As alſo that <hi>Pſal. 2. 7. (Thou art my Son)</hi> is literally meant of <hi>David.</hi> Hence it was that the <hi>Jews</hi> both then and now call the Meſſias <hi>the Son of God:</hi> not becauſe (as ſome imagine) they think he is God, or is generated
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105752:39"/>
of the Divine Subſtance; but becauſe they expect he ſhall be a very great Prince, an univerſal Monarch, and therefore the Son of God in a more perfect and higher ſenſe than <hi>David,</hi> or other Princes are.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) Mat. 28. 19. <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Anſw.</hi> (1.) To be baptized in the Name of a Perſon or Perſons, is a Rite by which one deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelf to the Inſtitution, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Obedience of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons: ſo that to be baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is to profeſs to be led and guided by them; or (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes this matter) 'tis to declare we will admit of no other thing as a part of our Religion, but what proceeds from theſe, that is, nothing but what is <hi>commanded</hi> by God or the Father, and has been <hi>delivered</hi> by his Son the Lord Chriſt, and <hi>confirmed</hi> externally by the Miracles, and internally with the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Teſtimony of the Spirit, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105752:40"/>
is, of the Power and Inſpiration of God. (2.) 'Tis in vain, not to ſay ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended, that a Perſon or thing is God, becauſe we are baptized <hi>unto</hi> it, or <hi>in the Name of</hi> it. For then <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> alſo would be Gods, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 1, 2. Our Fathers were—all baptized unto</hi> Moſes. <hi>Acts 19. 3. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what then were ye baptized? and they ſaid, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto</hi> John's <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> that is, (ſaith the Generality of Interpreters) <hi>unto John</hi> and the Doctrine by him deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor can it be doubted that to be <hi>baptized unto</hi> a Perſon or Perſons, and to be <hi>baptized in the Name of</hi> ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons, is the ſame thing. For (1.) 'Tis acknowledged by all that underſtand the Hebrew and Syriac Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms. (2.) 'Tis manifeſt by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome Texts of Scripture. For what in ſome of them is called <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing unto,</hi> is in others called <hi>baptizing in the Name of. Rom. 6. 3. As many of you as have been baptized into Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (or <hi>unto</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; for 'tis the ſame Prepoſition in the Greek that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105752:40"/>
is uſed of <hi>Moſes, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. and of <hi>John Baptiſt, Acts 19. 3.) have been baptized into</hi> (or <hi>unto) his Death. Gal. 3. 27. As many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt</hi> (in the Greek, <hi>unto</hi> Chriſt) <hi>have put on Chriſt.</hi> Acts 2. 38. <hi>Be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Acts 8. 16. <hi>They were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Who does not now ſee, that to be baptized <hi>unto,</hi> and <hi>in the Name of</hi> Chriſt, or any other Perſon or thing, are uſed as equivalent terms? And accordingly the Fathers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Tertullian,</hi> often ſay baptized <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Nothing therefore can be inferred from this Text, for the Godhead of the Son or Spirit; becauſe as now Chriſtians are baptized unto them, ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> were baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples unto <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">(9.) Luke 1. 16, 17, 76. <hi>Many of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall he</hi> (John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt) <hi>turn to the Lord their God; and he ſhall go before him in the Spirit and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105752:41"/>
Power of</hi> Elias.—<hi>Thou Child ſhalt be called the Prophet of the Higheſt, for thou ſhalt go before the Face of the Lord to prepare his way. Anſw.</hi> See on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 3.</p>
                  <p n="10">(10.) Luke 17. 5. <hi>The Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, Increaſe our Faith. Anſw:</hi> By thy Prayers to God, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heard for us.</p>
                  <p n="11">(11.) Luke 24. 47. <hi>That Repentance and Remiſſion of Sin ſhould be preached in his</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>Name. Anſw.</hi> The ſenſe is, Chriſt commanded the Diſciples to require Men to repent, and on their ſo doing to aſſure them in his Name (or from him) that God would forgive them.</p>
                  <p n="12">(12.) John 1. 1. &amp;c. <hi>In the Beginning was the Word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Expoſition of this Chapter is abſurd, and contradictory: 'tis this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Beginning:</hi> i. e. from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Anſw.</hi> From all Eternity is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the Beginning, or <hi>without</hi> Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; not in the Beginning. <hi>In the Beginning</hi> muſt refer to ſome time and thing, it muſt be in the Beginning of the World, or of the Goſpel, or of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105752:41"/>
Word; and in which ever of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is taken, <hi>the Word</hi> cannot be from all Eternity, by Virtue or Force (I mean) of this Expreſſion, <hi>Was the Word.</hi> i. e. was God the Son. <hi>Anſw.</hi> But where in Scripture is <hi>the Word</hi> called <hi>God the Son?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> i. e. The Son was with the Father. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems then that <hi>God</hi> in this clauſe is <hi>the Father.</hi> But was not the Son alſo with the Holy Ghoſt, and is not he too (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Trinitarians)</hi> God, or a God? If he is, why doth St. <hi>John</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay <hi>the Son was with the Father;</hi> and how comes the Father to engroſs here the Title of <hi>God</hi> to the Excluſion of the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Word was God.</hi> What ſhall we do here? was <hi>the Word</hi> the Father? for ſo they interpreted <hi>God</hi> in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe. No, <hi>God</hi> in this clauſe, hath <hi>a new meaning,</hi> 'tis <hi>God the Son.</hi> But in the whole Scripture there are not theſe words, <hi>God the Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſame was in the Beginning with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105752:42"/>
God.</hi> How comes this to be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated? for <hi>John</hi> had ſaid once before, that the Word was with God. They care not, 'tis ſaid, and that's enough. The Truth is, according to their ſenſe of this Context, no account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this Repetition, and they muſt allow it to be a meer Tautology. But let us (ſay the <hi>Socinians)</hi> hear <hi>Grotius</hi> interpreting this ſublime Proem of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 1. <hi>In the Beginning,</hi> (i. e. when God created the Heavens and the Earth. For theſe Words are taken from <hi>Gen. 1. 1.) was the Word.</hi> The Hebrews call that <hi>Power and Wiſdom</hi> of God, by which he made the World, and does all other his extraordinary Works, <hi>his Word.</hi> Pſal. 33. 6. <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made.</hi> Heb. 11. 2. <hi>The Worlds were made by the Word of God.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 5. <hi>By the Word of God the Heavens were of old.</hi> They borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Expreſſion from <hi>Moſes,</hi> who in deſcribing the Creation, ſaith that <hi>God ſaid, Let there be Light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105752:42"/>
                     <hi>God ſaid, Let there be a Firmament,</hi> Gen. 1. 6. and ſo through the whole Chapter. Undoubtedly <hi>Moſes</hi> is not to be underſtood of a Word orally ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for God is a Spirit; but his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, God put forth his <hi>Power and Wiſdom,</hi> and thereby created Light and the Firmament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As eaſily as Men can ſpeak theſe Words, <hi>Let there be Light, Let there be a Firmament.</hi> Thus we ſee why the Divine Wiſdom and Power was called <hi>the Word</hi> by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and ſo many Writers of the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> i. e. It was not yet in the World, or not yet made Fleſh, <hi>(ver.</hi> 10. and 14.) but with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Word was God;</hi> i. e. The Word (or Divine Wiſdom and Power) is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from God; but being his Wiſdom and Power, is God. 'Tis the common Maxim of Divines, that the Attributes and Properties of God are God. Which is in ſome ſenſe true. We may alſo here note, that thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105752:43"/>
(whether Angels or Men) to whom the <hi>Divine Word</hi> hath been in an extraordinary Degree communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have alſo had the Names <hi>Jehovah</hi> and God given to them. The Angel who deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> by <hi>a miraculous Tempest</hi> from Heaven is called <hi>Jehovah;</hi> ſo is he that promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to cauſe <hi>Sarah</hi> to conceive a Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 13. On the ſame account God ſays to <hi>Moſes, Exod 7. 1. See I have made thee a God to</hi> Pharaoh. <hi>Ver. 2. The ſame was in the Beginning with God.</hi> This is here again repeated by the Evangeliſt, to teach us that <hi>the Word</hi> is ſo God, that it is not all that God is; there being other Properties and Attributes of God, that are communicable as well as the <hi>Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 3. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> The Engliſh-Geneva Tranſlation ſaith here, All things were made by <hi>It.</hi> But it matters not, for <hi>the Word</hi> begins here to be ſpoken of as a Perſon, by the ſame <hi>Figure of Speech</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Wiſdom <hi>hath builded</hi> her Houſe, and <hi>hewn out</hi> her ſeven Pillars, <hi>Prov.</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105752:43"/>
9. 1. And that <hi>David</hi> calls God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments <hi>Counſellours,</hi> Pſal. 119. 24.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 4. <hi>In him:</hi> i. e. In him when he was in the World and was made Fleſh; <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. and 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Was Life. i. e.</hi> By the Word, when made Fleſh or <hi>Man,</hi> the way and manner of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Life (eternal Life) was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The way is the Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>John</hi> 12. 50.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Life was the Light of Men; i. e.</hi> The Life-giving Doctrine by him taught was that Light, to and by which Men may and ought to direct their Steps in order to eternal Bleſſedneſs. <hi>John</hi> 12. 50. So here the Doctrine of Chriſt, the Goſpel, is called Light, as before it was called Life.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 8. <hi>He</hi> (John) <hi>was not that Light; i. e. John</hi> neither was, nor was the bringer of the Light of the Goſpel: though he bare Witneſs to both. 'Tis uſual in familiar Speech to call the Bringer of a thing, by the name of the thing he brings: and for this reaſon our Saviour is called Life, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105752:44"/>

                  <p>Ver. 10. <hi>He was in the World.</hi> Here the Evangeliſt returns to ſpeak of <hi>the Word.</hi> The ſenſe is, in Proceſs of time the Word became incarnate, that is, <hi>Abode on the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo converſed in the World among Men. God communicated his Word, (that is, a vaſt Effuſion of his Divine Power and Wiſdom) to his Son the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The World was made by him; i. e.</hi> The World and all Men were made by this Word, which (afterwards) abode on Jeſus Chriſt: and which <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> him performed Works not much leſs wonderful than was the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the World knew him not.</hi> Knew not that the Word abiding on Jeſus, was that very Divine Word which made both the World and all Men.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 11. <hi>He came unto his own; i. e.</hi> To thoſe whom he had made, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>He</hi> is to be underſtood of the Word. The Word came in the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>His own received him not; i. e.</hi> did not own him for what he indeed was, the Divine Word. 'Tis again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to brand the Ingratitude and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Age.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Them that believe on his Name.</hi> On his Name, is an Hebrew Phraſe, as much as to ſay, <hi>on him; i. e.</hi> Them that believed on the Word, made Fleſh: or them that received and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for what he indeed was, even the Divine Word.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 14. <hi>And the Word was made Fleſh;</hi> Or, <hi>For</hi> the Word was made Fleſh: <hi>i. e.</hi> did abide on and inhabit an humane Perſon, the Perſon of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and ſo was (in Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) made Fleſh or <hi>Man:</hi> for Fleſh is the uſual Scripture Phraſe for Man, <hi>Gen. 6. 12.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And we beheld his Glory; i. e.</hi> The Glory of the Man, on whom <hi>the Word</hi> did abide and inhabit in him. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his Glory in his many Miracles, <hi>John</hi> 2. 11. Alſo in his Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                     <hi>The Glory as of the only begotten of the Father; i. e.</hi> A Glory worthy of the only-begotten of the Father. Chriſt is called the only-begotten on ſeveral accounts, this eſpecially, that he only was begotten by the Divine Power on a Woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.</p>

                  <p>Briefly, <hi>The Word</hi> (according to <hi>Grotius)</hi> is not an eternal Son of God, but is here the Power and Wiſdom of God; which Word abiding without

                  <p>This notion of <hi>the Word</hi> will lead a Man through all the Difficulties of this Chapter, with far more eaſe than any other hitherto offered.

we are ſaid to know, ſee, hear, deſpiſe God, in knowing, ſeeing, hearing, or deſpiſing Chriſt, or his Miniſters; the meaning only is, that Chriſt and his true Miniſters being the Ambaſſadours and Meſſengers of God, and revealing to us his Nature and Will, they are ſo far forth to be eſteemed one with God; and in ſeeing and hearing them, we ſee and hear him as much as the inviſible God can be ſeen or heard, in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life.</p>

Scripture, but in all Writers. God's Commandments are called <hi>Counſellours,</hi> Pſal. 119. 24. Underſtanding is ſaid <hi>to lift up her Voice,</hi> Prov. 8. 1.

Is it not evident that Actions proper to Perſons are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to them, as well as to the Holy Spirit, or Power and Inſpiration of God, by the Figure called Proſopopeia? Briefly, We ought to conceive thus of this matter, a great Effuſion of God's Inſpiration and Power being to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Diſciples, that it might be a continual Director and Guide when the Lord Chriſt was no more perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them: therefore this Guide is by the aforeſaid Figure ſpoken of in ſuch terms as if it were ſome Doctor, Teacher, and Advocate. Hence it is ſaid to reprove the World, to guide
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105752:51"/>
into all Truth, to intercede for us (namely becauſe it ſuggeſteth Prayer and Affection in Prayer) alſo not to ſpeak of himſelf, but to ſpeak what he ſhall hear from God; to receive of Chriſt's, that is, receive of God the Remainder of Chriſt's Doctrine, and teach it to the Apoſtles. For 'tis to be noted that our Lord left ſome things to be taught by this Inſpiration of God; becauſe the Diſciples were not capable to hear and believe them, till they had ſeen the great Miracles of our Lords Reſurrection and Afcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>John 16. 12. I have yet many things to ſay to you, but ye cannot bear them now; Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he ſhall guide you into all Truth.</hi> The Spirit that guided the Apoſtles into all Truth, was it not the meer Inſpiration of God?</p>
                  <p>It is for the ſame Reaſon, and by the ſame Figure, that this Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God in the Apoſtles, is ſaid <hi>to bear Witneſs,</hi> John 15. 26. to ſearch Myſteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. 11. to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

                  <p>Finally, It appeared in the Form of a Dove on Chriſt, and of Cloven Tongues on the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth. 3. 16. Acts</hi> 2. 3, 4. Becauſe God conveyed this Divine Energy to the Lord Chriſt, and to the Apoſtles, in theſe outward Symbols, which were fit Emblems of the Quality of the Gifts then beſtowed. The Dove ſignified the mild and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirit of Chriſt; and that the Power then conveyed to him ſhould not be for the Damage or Hurt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: The Tongues denoted, that the Apoſtles did then and there receive the Gift or Faculty of ſpeaking with many Tongues. But what ſenſe can the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> make of theſe things? they ſay the Spirit is a Perſon and God: did God receive and aſſume the Shape of a Dove, that is, of a Brute?

                  <p n="30">(30.) John 17. 5. <hi>Glorify me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory I had with thee, before the World was. Anſw.</hi> (1.) St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and many other learned and Orthodox Interpreters, not only grant,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105752:53"/>
but contend that the meaning here is, Let me now <hi>actually</hi> receive that Glory with thy ſelf, which I had with thee <hi>in thy Decree and Deſign</hi> before the World was. This Interpretation is confirmed by this, that the Sufferings of Chriſt were to precede his <hi>actual</hi> Glory, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 11. Searching what, and what manner of time the Spirit—did ſignify, when it teſtified before-hand the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow.</hi> (2.) As 'tis here ſaid, <hi>The Glory that I had with thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was:</hi> ſo 'tis ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>We have a Building of God, an Houſe not made with Hands.</hi> Where <hi>we have</hi> is, we have it in God's Decree and Intention, or it is prepared for us; 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Grace was given us in Christ before the World was.</hi> Where again <hi>was given to us</hi> is, was given in God's Decree and Intention.

(31.) John 17. 10. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine. Anſw.</hi> It appears by the foregoing verſe, and by what follows, that Chriſt ſpeaks of ſuch as were or ſhould be his Diſciples. His meaning is, all that are my Diſciples, are of thy giving to me, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main thine; and all that are true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Lovers of God, readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mine, that is, Diſciples to me.</p>
                  <p n="32">(32.) John 17. 24. <hi>For thou lovedst me from the Foundation of the World. Anſw.</hi> None can deny, that God loved all the Elect from the Foundation of the World.

                  <p n="33">(33.) John 20. 28. Thomas <hi>anſwered, and ſaid unto him my Lord, and my God:</hi> Or, O my Lord, and O my God! For 'tis an Attic Vocative. <hi>Anſw. 1. Neſtorius, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was of Opinion that theſe Words were not deſigned to Chriſt, but to God.

him (i. e.</hi> to Chriſt) <hi>O my Lord, and O my God.</hi> Yet the Exclamation might be addreſſed to God as it's Object, tho it was alſo <hi>an</hi> Anſwer to our Saviour, or <hi>in</hi> Anſwer to our Saviour, and to what he had ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 27. Or if the Words were addreſſed to our Saviour alſo, it may be admitted as true what others ſay here: Namely, (2.) When <hi>Thomas</hi> had felt the Prints of the Spear and Nails in our Saviour's Side and Hands, and was thereby fully ſatisfied that he was indeed riſen again, he breaks forth into this Exclamation; the firſt part of which he directed to Chriſt, the other to God. <hi>O my Lord!</hi> are Words of Congratulation to our Saviour; <hi>And O my God!</hi> Words of Admiration and Praiſe to God.</p>
                  <p n="34">(34.) Acts 5. 3, 4. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine Heart, to lie to the Holy Ghoſt?—Thou haſt not lied unto Men, but unto God.

haſt thou lied to the Holy Ghost: i. e.</hi> to us Apoſtles who have (thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) the Holy Spirit or Inſpiration of God in us. <hi>Thou hast not lied unto Men, but unto God; i. e.</hi> thou haſt not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lied to Men only or chiefly, but to God, who is in us by his Spirit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. This Interpretation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by 1 <hi>Theſſ. 4. 8. He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man, but God, who hath alſo given unto us his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</hi> Here 'tis manifeſt, that thoſe who deſpiſed the Apoſtles, are ſaid to deſpiſe God, becauſe God was in them by his Spirit: What hinders then, but that for the ſame reaſon, thoſe that lied to the Apoſtles, ſhould be ſaid and underſtood to lie to God?</p>

                  <p n="36">(36.) Acts 9. 14, 21. <hi>To bind all that call upon thy Name.</hi> (The Words are ſpoken to the Lord Chriſt, as is made undeniable by <hi>ver. 17.)—Is not this he, that deſtroyed them which called on this Nome</hi> (Chriſt's Name) <hi>in</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem? <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) The <hi>Socinians</hi> generally not only grant, but earneſtly contend, that Chriſt is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and prayed to: becauſe God hath (they ſay) by his <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105752:55"/>
Power given to the Lord Chriſt, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of knowing all things, and an Ability to relieve all our Wants. The Polonian <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> were ſo zealous in this matter, that they excommunicated and depoſed from their Miniſtry, ſuch of their own Party as denied that Chriſt might be prayed to, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip't with Divine Worſhip. This had bad Effects, therefore the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> were more moderate, they admitted to the Miniſters and Profeſſors-Places, thoſe that rejected the Invocation and Adoration of Chriſt; but obliged them under their Hands, not to ſpeak againſt worſhipping or praying to the Lord Chriſt in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Lectures. (2.) Thoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> that reject the Invocation of Chriſt, ſay, 1. That the moſt learned of the Ancients were of their Opinion. It appears by St. <hi>Auſtin (T. 6. L. 1. de Haereſ. Num.</hi> 43.) and by <hi>Photias (Cod.</hi> 117.) that <hi>Origen</hi> denied that the Son was to be adored or prayed to. He is, ſaith <hi>Origin,</hi> not the Author, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105752:56"/>
of the good things beſtowed on us. 2. Our Lord Chriſt, when he was conſulted about the Object and matter of Prayers, directed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to God; <hi>Luke 11. 1, 2. When ye pray, ſay, Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> 3. It ſeems clear enough, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the Diſciples to pray to himſelf; ordering them at the ſame time to pray to God in his Name, or <hi>for his Sake:</hi> John 16. 23. <hi>In that Day (i. e.</hi> after I am riſen, have ſeen you again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcended into Heaven have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you the Comforter, whoſe Conſolations none can take from you. So all Interpretters of note) <hi>ye ſhall ask me nothing;—whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> 4. To make Chriſt himſelf the Object of Prayer, is to deſtroy his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Office. For if he doth hear our Prayers, and can and doth (by a Power conſtantly reſident in him) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Wants; to what purpoſe is he our Mediator with God. They that make it a Duty to pray to Chriſt, will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105752:56"/>
find it hard to give a good account of thoſe Words, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>is able to ſave unto the uttermost, all that come unto God by him, (i. e.</hi> that pray to God in his Name, or <hi>for his ſake) ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> What can be more evident, than that here Chriſt's ſaving us from the Evils we either fear or labour under, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed not to his own inherent Power, but to his Interceſſion with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. It is farther to be obſerved, that theſe Gentlemen ſay, that Chriſt's Mediation and Interceſſion for us, is not to be underſtood of a verbal or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Mediation, proceeding from a particular Knowledg of our Wants and Prayers, but <hi>he mediates by his Merits;</hi> that is, by the perfect Obedience and moſt acceptable Services, that he has performed to God.</p>
                  <p>As to the objected Texts, <hi>To bind all that call upon thy Name.</hi> And again, Is not this he that deſtroyed <hi>them that called on this Name</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> They anſwer, that the Original Greek may
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105752:57"/>
be tranſlated ſeveral ways. 1. Thus, to bind all <hi>that are called by</hi> thy Name. And, Is not this he, that deſtroyed them <hi>who are called by this Name</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> that is, All that from <hi>Christ</hi> are called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And this ſeems to be the genuine ſenſe of theſe Texts. 2. Thus, To bind all <hi>that name thy Name.</hi> And, Is not this he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them <hi>who name this Name</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> that is, that profeſs the Name of Chriſt, that ſpeak of Chriſt as their Maſter and Teacher. Agreably to this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 9. Let all that name the Name of Chriſt, depart from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> 3. Thus, as 'tis in our Engliſh Bibles, to bind all that <hi>call upon thy Name.</hi> And, Is not this he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them <hi>that called on this Name</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> For though the firſt Chriſtians did not pray to the Lord Chriſt, yet they called upon his Name in Prayer, they uſed his Name in their Prayers to God, praying for all things in his Name; which is <hi>a calling upon his Name</hi> in the moſt proper and gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105752:57"/>
ſenſe of theſe Words; and is indeed the only ſenſe of which they are capable, when they are uſed of a Man, as Chriſt was. So they.</p>
                  <p n="37">(37.) Acts 15. 28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us. Anſw.</hi> that is, to God's Inſpiration in us, and therefore to us alſo: See on <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="38">(38.) Acts 20. 28. <hi>Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood. Anſw.</hi> (1.) It appears by the <hi>Syriac,</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and the moſt ancient Greek Bibles, that the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Text is, Feed the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood. (2.) Admitting the reading in the vulgar Editions of the Greek, yet ſome great Maſters of that Tongue have rendred the Greek Words thus, Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with <hi>his own Son's Blood.</hi> (3.) Admitting the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation in our Engliſh Bibles, ſome learned Men (particularly <hi>Eraſmus)</hi> have noted, that the Blood of Chriſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105752:58"/>
is here called the Blood of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was <hi>the Blood which God gave</hi> for the Redemption of the World. So <hi>John 1. 36.

                  <p n="1">(1.) Rom. 1. 3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, which was made of the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh.</hi> Rom. 9. 5. <hi>Of whom, as concerning the Fleſh, Chriſt came; who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, Amen. Anſw.</hi> (1.) It is very probable, by the <hi>Syriae</hi> and by ſome Paſſages in <hi>Ignatius</hi> and other Fathers, that the word <hi>God</hi> was not originally in this Text, for they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105752:60"/>
read it thus, Of whom as concerning the Fleſh Chriſt came, <hi>who</hi> is bleſſed <hi>above</hi> all for ever. 2. But admitting the reading in the vulgar Editions of the Greek, the Greek Words (as <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> obſerve) ſhould have been thus tranſlated, Of whom, as concerning the Fleſh, Chriſt came; <hi>God who is over all be bleſſed for ever.</hi> For the Words are a Thankſgiving for Chriſt, and for his Exaltation. The Addition of the word <hi>Amen,</hi> proper in Prayers and Thankſgivings, doth much countenance this Tranſlation. 3. Theſe Words, <hi>according to the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>as concerning the Fleſh,</hi> never ſignify (as <hi>Trinitarians</hi> would here interpret them) <hi>according to his humane Nature,</hi> as if Chriſt had alſo a Divine Nature: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. My Kinſmen <hi>according to the Fleſh.</hi> Rom. 4. 1. <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Father <hi>as pertaining to the Fleſh.</hi> Col. 3. 22. <hi>Servants obey in all things your Maſters according to the Fleſh.</hi> Had now <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Paul's</hi> Kinſmen, or have Maſters a Divine Nature, becauſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105752:60"/>
theſe Words, <hi>according to the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>as pertaining to the Fleſh,</hi> are uſed of them? The Truth is, theſe Phraſes are only as much as to ſay <hi>according to the Body;</hi> and are to ſignify that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is the Father of the <hi>Jews,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Bodies, as God is the Father of their Souls or Spirits: and that the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>Paul</hi>'s Kinſmen according to the Body, but not of Kin to him in Reſpect of Likeneſs in Faith or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: alſo that Maſters are Maſters over our Bodies, not of our Minds or Spirits. Therefore in the other Texts alſo, where Chriſt is ſaid to be of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, according to the Fleſh;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can only be, that as to his Body or outward Man, he deſcended of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and of the Stock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Soul or Spirit being from God.</p>

that is, they ſignify and prefigure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years of plenty.

Whereas we are bid at <hi>ver.</hi> 9. not to tempt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 'tis to be noted that the ancient and true reading of this Text is, Let us not tempt <hi>God. S.

Anſw.</hi> The plain meaning is, God and his Spirit; that is, God by his Spirit and Inſpiration, worketh that great Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Gifts, (Prophecy, Tongues, Healing) which were in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of thoſe times: and that though there are different Adminiſtrations (that is, Orders of Men) in the Church, yet they are all under one Lord or Head, even Chriſt.</p>

Anſw.</hi> The ſenſe is, Such was the Favour and Love of Chriſt to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that in his own Perſon he ſet us an Example of Mortification and Self-denial, in his living a poor ſort of Life;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105752:63"/>
though 'tis certain he could have lived in the greateſt Splendor, Dignity, and Plenty.

So the ſenſe is, that what my Lord Chriſt can do and procure for me with God, may abide on me, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power and Strength either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105752:63"/>
or bear this Affliction. But note that the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for the moſt part of them, do grant that <hi>the Word</hi> or Power of God abiding on Chriſt, doth qualify him both to hear our Prayers, and to ſuccour us in all Diſtreſſes.</p>

Creature, not abſolutely, as if he was in being before all other Creatures; but the meaning is, he is <hi>the firſt-born from the dead</hi> of all God's Creatures.

Anſw.</hi> This was a very negligent Tranſlation, ſay the <hi>Socinians.</hi> For whether you interpret <hi>him that is true</hi> to be God, or to be Chriſt, no ſenſe can be made of the Words. The latter part of the Text ought to have been thus rendred, <hi>We are in him that is true (i. e.</hi> in God) <hi>by his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true God; i. e.</hi> He whoſe Son Chriſt is, and in whom we are, he and no other is the true God. So that this Text plainly denies that Chriſt is the true God.

                  <p n="2">2. They ſay farther, that none of the objected and above-cited Texts, are by <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves thought to be true and demonſtrative Proofs either of the Trinity, or of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Son or Spirit. Every one of theſe Texts, but <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, &amp;c.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105752:81"/>
is given up to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent and unconcluding Proof, by ſome or other of the moſt learned and allowed Criticks and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>the Proteſtant Party.</hi> As to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctors (ſo called) <hi>Chr. Sandius</hi> hath made a great Collection of Teſtimonies out of them, to this Effect, that neither the Trinity, nor the Divinity of the Lord Chriſt, or of the Holy Spirit, can be proved by the Scripture; but by Tradition only. Some of them confeſs that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rather favour the Socinian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and that the Trinity is not only above, but contrary to Reaſon; finally that if the Authority of the Church did not oblige them to be Catholicks, they ſhould chooſe to be <hi>Socinians.</hi> See for theſe things: <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Hiſt. Eccl. l. 1. c. de Ario</hi> and <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallus, in Script. Trin. Revel.</hi> An Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Author of the Romiſh Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has theſe Words <hi>(in Fiat. Lux. p.</hi> 379, 380.) I may truly ſay, <hi>Christ is the Pope's God.</hi> For if the Pope had
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105752:82"/>
not been, or had not been ſo <hi>vigilant and reſolute</hi> a Paſtor as he is; (he means <hi>ſuch a Perſecutor)</hi> Chriſt whom the Pope both worſhips himſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to the World to worſhip <hi>as the very true God, that made all things,</hi> Chriſt I ſay had not been taken for any ſuch Perſon, as this day we believe him to be.</p>
                  <p>Whereas beſides the above-cited Texts, the Orthodox object, that if Chriſt were not God as well as Man, he could not ſatisfy the Juſtice of God for our Sins, or be a full and ſufficient Atonement for them: The <hi>Socinians</hi> anſwer, (1.) That the Lord Chriſt is a Propitiation and Atonement for Sin, is a Demonſtration that he is not God, for God doth not give or make, but receive the Satisfaction for our Sins. (2.) They wonder that the Son of God, though he is a Man only, ſhould not be judged a ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Propitiation for Sin, (through the gracious Acceptance of God) when 'tis ſo known and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105752:82"/>
that the Oblation and Sacrifice of <hi>Beaſts</hi> under the Moſaic Law, and from <hi>Adam</hi> till thoſe times, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a full Atonement and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction <hi>in order to Forgiveneſs;</hi> Lev. 6. 6. <hi>He ſhall bring his Treſpaſs-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Ram without Blemiſh;—and the Priest ſhall make Atonement for him before the Lord, for any thing of all that he hath done in treſpaſſing.</hi> See the whole Context.</p>
                  <p>Finally, whereas the Orthodox do decline many of the Socinian Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the Diſtinction of two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (a Divine and humane Nature) in Chriſt: For Example, when the <hi>Socinians</hi> object, <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than I:</hi> or, <hi>John 5. 30. I can do nothing of my ſelf.</hi> We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that theſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt only according to his humane Nature; but that he hath alſo a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, by which he is equal to the Father, and can do all things of himſelf. To this they reply, (1.) That the Diſtinction of two Natures (a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105752:83"/>
Divine and Humane) in Chriſt, is clearly overthrown by the <hi>8th, 9th, 10th</hi> and <hi>11th</hi> Arguments mentioned in the the firſt Letter. 2. If a thing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways true of Chriſt, may be denied of him, becauſe 'tis only in one of theſe (pretended) Natures, and not in the other; if our Saviour ſaith he can do nothing of himſelf, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can do nothing of himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humane Nature, and can do all things of himſelf according to his (pretended) Divine Nature; then 'tis lawful and allowable to ſay, Chriſt is no Man, was never born of the Virgin, was not crucified, dead, or buried, did not riſe again from the dead, aſcended not into Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that according to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, he never was born of the Virgin, never was crucified, dead, or buried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now who does not ſee, that to ſpeak thus, were to deny the whole New Teſtament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſtianity? Have not we (ſay the <hi>Socinians)</hi> reaſon to reject and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105752:83"/>
abhor a Diſtinction, that if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodes our Doctrine, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations for it, does as effectually fight againſt the moſt evident and acknowledg'd Points of the Chriſtian Faith? Nay the Diſtinction and Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons founded on it, do at leaſt as much hurt to the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> as to the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi> For if the Diſtinction of two Natures be true; and the Anſwers founded on it allowable; then no Fault can be found with a <hi>Socinian,</hi> when he ſhall ſay, Chriſt is not true God, was not generated of the Eſſence of the Father, was not from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for all this may be ſaid of him <hi>according</hi> (to uſe their own Words) <hi>his humane Nature;</hi> for according to that, he is not true God, was not generated of the Fathers Eſſence, was not from Eternity. Do not <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> abſolutely diſallow, as falſe and Heretical, theſe Forms of Speech, though defended by the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two Natures? why then do they expect, that their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105752:84"/>
in this Controverſy, ſhould admit their Anſwers which are founded on the ſame, and no other Defence?</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, is the Sum of what theſe Gentlemen ſay on this great Queſtion; a Brief of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Anſwers, by which they would ſupport their Doctrine, that God is but one Perſon; and that (as ſome of them add) our Lord Chriſt nor the Holy Spirit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, <hi>nor ever are called Gods or God</hi> in Holy Scripture, as alſo that neither Creation (whether New or Old) nor any of the Attributes of God are aſcribed to our Bleſſed Saviour. For a Concluſion, give me leave to adviſe you in the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi>

                  <p>HAving had the Favour of peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe Letters, I cannot but greatly eſteem the Learning and Judgment of the Author; who has brought ſo large a Controverſy (and that has been debated with the utmoſt Induſtry, Learning, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty for many hundred Years, even from ſoon after the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) into ſo ſmall a Compaſs, that one may ſoon ſee the Allegations from Scripture on both ſides, with the moſt material Diſtinctions and Anſwers. Wherein it ſeems obvious to me, what
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105752:85"/>
is ſaid in one of the Paragraphs of the firſt Letter, that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is an accountable and reaſonable Faith, grounded on clear and evident Scripture-Arguments, ſo far as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Propoſition can reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be: Whereas the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrine is founded upon obſcure or miſtaken Texts; and defended by ſuch unreaſonable Diſtinctions, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted by any Man of a free Judgment, being either contradictory in themſelves, or utterly unintelligible. However I can do no leſs than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and expect every judicious Man's Aſſent to it; 1. That the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> is no neceſſary or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrine of Chriſtianity. 2. That 'tis unjuſt and unchriſtian, to lay the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> or <hi>Socinians</hi> under any Penalties or Forfeitures, upon the account of their Doctrine. 3. That <hi>Trinitarians</hi> ought to own the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for Chriſtian Brethren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves towards them as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:105752:85"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſaid the Doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> is no neceſſary or fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Doctrine of Chriſtianity. For to ſay, it is, doth, 1. Reflect upon the Goodneſs of God, and his Love to Mankind: as making that fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and neceſſary to Salvation, the Truth whereof muſt be confeſſed to be ſo very obſcure and uncertain, that where the Prejudices of Education, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Men, and Fear of Penalties do not prevail, the vulgar (who are ten to one of Mankind) either do not believe it at all, or confeſs it as Parrots ſpeak Words without Underſtanding. 2. To make the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fundamental, is to joyn Hands with Papiſts in contradiction to Proteſtant Doctrine; owning with them that the Scriptures are obſcure and unſufficient even in Fundamentals: and ſo bringing in a neceſſity of admitting and believing unſcriptural Traditions. Of this the Papiſts are ſo ſenſible, that it is the chief of thoſe Arguments with which they attack Proteſtants; and which they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105752:86"/>
urge in their former and latter Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: wherein they not only ſeem to have, but have in reality great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; as will (I am perſwaded) appear to thoſe that impartially conſider it. It will not be here impertinent to tell you a ſtory that hapned in the preſent Reign. A certain great Lord was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in his Faith by a Jeſuit or other Seminary, who began with him thus; <hi>My Lord, I know you believe the Creed of</hi> Athanaſius: to which the Lord (wiſely perceiving what he would build upon that Conceſſion) anſwer'd, <hi>Who told you ſo?</hi> which quick Anſwer by Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did ſo ſurprize and diſappoint the Seminary, that he had no more to ſay. It ſeems his intended Arguments leaned on that Pillar alone, to wit, the Belief of the Creed commonly called the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian.</hi> 3. The <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrine reflects Weakneſs and Unſufficiency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Chriſtian Church and Faith of the firſt Ages; which (as our Author has noted) knew or profeſſed no other but the Apoſtles Creed, which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105752:86"/>
doth fully agree with the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> but by no means with the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrine of fundamental Faith. 4. They that urge the Doctrine of the Trinity <hi>as fundamental,</hi> do clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impugn the ſixth Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ſaith, <q>Holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation: So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any Man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of the Faith.</q> Such alſo was the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> that eminent Defender of Proteſtantiſm, <hi>ch. 6. n.</hi> 56. where he ſaith, <q>By the Religion of Proteſtants, I underſtand—that wherein they all agree.<hi>—THE BIBLE, THE BIBLE,</hi> I ſay, <hi>THE BIBLE</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Religion of Proteſtants. Whatever elſe they believe beſides it, and the <hi>plain irrefragable and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> Conſequences of it, well may they hold it as a matter of Opinion; but not as a matter of Faith or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105752:87"/>
neither can they with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to their own Grounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it themſelves; nor require the Belief of it from others, without moſt high and moſt ſciſmatical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſaid, it follows from the foregoing Diſcourſes, that it is unjuſt and unchriſtian, to lay the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> or <hi>Socinians</hi> under any Penal Laws or other Hardſhips, on the account of their Conſcience and Doctrine. For we may ſee here, that an honeſt and ſincere Man may in the Purſuit of his own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and in adhering to Proteſtant Principles of the Clearneſs and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Scripture in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as alſo in reverence of the ancient Faith held forth in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Creed, and of the Church of the firſt Ages, he may (I ſay) with clear Satisfaction in his own Conſcience, disbelieve the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrine. But how can Chriſtians with Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Conſciences puniſh ſuch a Man? As for the publick Peace, there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105752:87"/>
is not only nothing in the Nature of their Doctrine that inclines them to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableneſs; but they have alſo always been extremely candid to thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them, from a Principle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (I think) to them and the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants only, that <hi>Conſcience ought to be free in matters of Faith:</hi> This is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple with the <hi>Socinians</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants; other Families of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans take it up as an expedient, when they have need of it. Briefly, If the <hi>Socinians</hi> appear to be as careful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to know the Truth, as <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> if they are in their Stations as learned as they, and as innocent and virtuous Men in their Converſations; how can any Chriſtian judg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, without incurring our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Judgment and Condemnation? He that believes the whole Bible hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily; and indeavours ſincerely to know the Mind of God and Chriſt therein, and to purge himſelf from thoſe carnal Affections and worldly Intereſts that hinder Men from ſeeing and obeying
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105752:88"/>
the Truth; and (perhaps) as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, ſuffers the Loſs of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and Goods, Kinsfolk, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nay, undergoes Penury and other Hardſhips in foreign Countries, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do at this Day; how can any who pretend to give Obedience to the Law of common Reaſon, of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and of Chriſt himſelf in his Sermon on the Mount, to wit, of doing to others as we would they ſhould do to us, how I ſay can ſuch think a <hi>Socinian</hi> ſo qualified as we have but now deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him, doth deſerve Puniſhment for his Faith? And how can any Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſgreſſing Chriſt's Law of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, judge ſuch a one to be guilty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Appearance of Guilt, more than may be eaſily ſeen in himſelf? Is it not the common Principle of all Proteſtants, to believe the Holy Scriptures are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to all Religion, and clear in all Neceſſaries of Faith and Manners, and that every Man is obliged by our Lord Chriſt, to believe and practiſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Knowledg, Light and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105752:88"/>
Underſtanding of the Scriptures? He that does ſo, is not only a Chriſtian, but a Proteſtant, that is, a reformed Chriſtian. <hi>I am fully aſſured</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and conſequently thoſe learned Perſons, the Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Regius Profeſſor, and others who licenſed and approved his Book) <hi>that God does not, and therefore Men ought not, require more of any Man than this, to believe the Scripture to be God's Word, to endeavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it,</hi> ch. 6. n. 56. The ſame Author ſays <hi>(ch. 5. n. 96.) I have learnt from the ancient Fathers, that nothing is more againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than to force Religion: and of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>that the Weapons of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Warfare are not carnal.</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Salvian</hi> of <hi>Marſeils</hi> (who wrote about the Year of our Lord 460) ſaith thus concerning one ſort of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> viz. <hi>Arians, They are Hereticks, but not knowingly:—They do ſo much judg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Catholicks, that they defame us with the Name of Hereticks:—They err,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105752:89"/>
but with a good Mind; not of Hatred, but of the Love of God.—How they ſhall be puniſh'd in the Day of Judgment for this Error of a falſe Opinion, none can know but the Judg. De Gubern. Dei. l.</hi> 5. where may be read more to the ſame purpoſe. Though this Author, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Vogue of Thoſe times, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>Arians</hi> Hereticks; yet that which he ſays farther of them, ſhows they were not ſo: for the Character he gives of them, ſhews them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Chriſtians; and Lovers of God. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt the <hi>Manichees</hi> (a ſort of People that held there were two Gods, one good, the other evil) ſaith thus, <hi>Let them be fierce against you, who know not how laborious a thing it is to find out the Truth; and how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly we eſcape Errors: Let them be fierce against you, who know not how rare and hard a thing it is to overcome carnal Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations by the Serenity of a pious Mind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Contr. Ep. Fauſti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I added, that the <hi>Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ought to own the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> for
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105752:89"/>
Chriſtian Brethren, and to behave themſelves towards them as ſuch. For Proteſtants do agree, that all neceſſary and fundamental matters of Faith are clear and plain in Scripture; but other matters not ſo evident, but that good Chriſtians may err concerning them, as we ſee they did even in the times of the Apoſtles: now this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> appearing to be no fundamental Doctrine, it does by no means unchriſtian thoſe that hold the contrary, nor excuſe the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> from thoſe Offices, which are due to them as Chriſtians. And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not only willing to make Confeſſion of Faith in all the forms of Words contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in the Words alſo of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed; as alſo becauſe they are not liable to any charge of Idolatry, or Superſtition in their Worſhip; or of Uncharitableneſs in condemning thoſe of contrary Minds, as the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of <hi>Rome</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:105752:90"/>
Therefore I cannot but wonder at ſome learned Men, that are ſo far car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with an overweaning Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own Judgment, that they will not allow thoſe the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who do not believe, beſides the Bible, and the Creed of the Apoſtles, alſo the Nicene and Athanaſian Creeds. Nay, ſome account the Trinitarian Doctrines to be ſo neceſſary to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that <hi>though thoſe who deny them be otherways very pious and uſeful Men, yet going againſt the ſenſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, they err, not for want of Inſtruction, but from a certain Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Pride of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and are guilty of ſuch unpardonable Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty as admits of no Excuſe.</hi> If what is hinted in theſe Letters, concerning the Catholick Church of the Apoſtles times and firſt Ages, be true; then that Author builds his Condemnation upon a falſe and rotten Foundation, and the Building falling, impreſſes, Raſhneſs, and Uncharitableneſs upon
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105752:90"/>
himſelf; I mean as to this particular Caſe, for otherways I readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Worth and Learning of the Author.</p>
                  <p>Neither can I ſufficiently admire, that another learned Man, and a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer for his Conſcience, ſhould in a <hi>Pacifick Diſcourſe</hi> treat the <hi>Socinians</hi> in the ſame contumelious manner, not allowing them worthy of the Name of Chriſtians, becauſe <hi>they go about</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to overthrow the whole frame of the Chriſtian Doctrine, by arrogant Preſumptions of falſe Reaſonings and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical Arguments.</hi> Yea, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly objected againſt them, that they exalt their Reaſonings above plain and expreſs Revelation in Scripture. Which Crimination ſeems to me, to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away by the four Letters, in which it appears, by the many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding Texts, falſe Tranſlations, unintelligible Reaſonings and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, cited and urged on the Behalf of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrine; and on the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105752:91"/>
other hand, by the numerous clear Texts, allowed Tranſlations, Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Diſtinctions, common to Mankind, produced by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians;</hi> that theſe laſt may reaſonably retort this great Objection, on their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> who in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand expreſs Texts of Scripture do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt their Reaſonings to maintain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe than the plain Words require. For one Inſtance, how many expreſs Texts aſcribe Parts and Members, Affections and Paſſions, Shape and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Place and Circumſcription to God? all which (as the Author of theſe Letters notes) are otherways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by learned Men, becauſe they judg theſe things in reaſon unſuitable to God. But what Principle more clear both in Reaſon and Scripture than this, that there is but one God, or that God is one? All Chriſtians, and all <hi>Jews,</hi> and all <hi>Mahometans</hi> (who are ſaid to be more in Number than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) beſides the wiſe Heathens, do

acknowledg it: and all theſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the term <hi>God,</hi> a neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent Perſon. Upon theſe clear Grounds the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> deny that there are three ſuch, as contrary to that Unity; and introducing into the Godhead two unneceſſary or ſuperfluous Perſons. For if one be ſufficient, and he cannot be God if he be not ſufficient, then the two more are ſupernumerary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, and conſequently not God. For my own part I was bred up in the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Faith, and took the Truth of it for granted; but when theſe Scriptures and Reaſons came into my View, (and I had got over the Fear of examining, what ſome Men who name themſelves the Church, call Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals) I conld not avoid the Force of them: though it grieves me that I cannot continue in conſent with my old Friends, as well in this as other parts of Chriſtian Doctrine. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as in Philoſophy, Truth ſhould be more dear to us than <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:105752:92"/>
ſo in Theology, <hi>the Teſtimony of plain Scripture agreeing with evident Reaſon, ſhould prevail with thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures Divine, more than obſcure Texts diſſonant to the clear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind.</hi> And it may well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay any ones Fear of examining and judging concerning (pretended) Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, when he ſhall conſider that even the Church of <hi>England</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her Articles ſays, that <hi>as the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, Alexandria, <hi>and</hi> Antioch <hi>have errred, ſo alſo the Church of</hi> Rome (which contends that ſhe is the Catholick Church) <hi>hath erred, not only in her living and manner of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but alſo in matter of Faith.</hi> So alſo <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (with his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) ſays, <hi>I ſee plainly and with mine own Eyes, that there are Popes against Popes, Councils against Councils; ſome Fathers against others, the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against themſelves; a conſent of Fathers of one Age, against a conſent of Fathers of another Age.—There
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105752:92"/>
is no ſufficient Certainty but in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, for any conſidering Man to build upon.</hi> As to the boaſt of their Numbers, 'tis well known there was a time when the Chriſtian World was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> that is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian;</hi> ſo that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia</hi> in which 560 Biſhops were preſent (the greateſt Convention of Biſhops that ever was) decreed for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Faith. Was number in thoſe times an Argument of Truth? If not, how can it be ſo now?</p>
                  <p>The Author of theſe Letters has well obſerved beſides, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> in theſe days, is widely different from the Doctrine decreed in the firſt Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> from whence I infer, that their Boaſt of Antiquity is as vain as the other of Number. I will only add to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that though the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and the modern <hi>Trinitarians</hi> may agree in terms, yet thoſe times and theſe have different ſenſes of the ſame Words and Phraſes.</p>
