            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO ALL <hi>True Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE unparallel'd Charity of this Kingdom to the Diſtreſſed Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who in ſuch numbers during their late heavy Perſecution, fled hither as to their <hi>Aſylum,</hi> has made ſo ſenſible impreſſions upon all grateful Men amongſt them, that even the providing for their own future ſafety, ſeems not more their preſent aim and deſire, than making all poſſible returns to thoſe who when they were hungry fed them, naked cloathed, and baniſhed their own Country, received them with open Arms. But when both theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that of Gratitude, as well as a laſting Settlement, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven as that what provides for the one, will be ſome Manifeſtation of the other, 'twere unpardonable, if the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould let ſlip ſuch an opportunity. The Expence of reducing that Kingdom has not been ſo inconſiderable, but that every Man in <hi>England</hi> has felt his ſhare of the weight, but the Fatal Conſequences of that Rebellion few People conſider, for in truth the whole Charge of the Two laſt years War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what more it may coſt <hi>England,</hi> is purely due hereto. Had that Kingdom ſubmitted to Their Majeſties Government when publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was given them, of their Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King had long ſince been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have ſued for Peace on ſuch Terms as Their Majeſties, and their Allies would have granted him; but ſuch was the neceſſity of Reducing that Kingdom as ſoon as it was poſſible (leaſt, as 'tis plain, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, it ſhould entirely fall into the <hi>French</hi> King's Hands) that Their Majeſties were obliged to employ thoſe Forces there, who in one Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, or two at moſt, would then have effected what already has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the work of five: The Conſumption of the Treaſure of <hi>England</hi> hereby has been prodigious, but not to be named in Compariſon with the Lives of ſo many Brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, whoſe Widows and Orphans, as well as their Country, owe this Irrepairable Loſs to <hi>Ireland.</hi> And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56985:3"/>
now that Kingdom is reduced, the greateſt Care muſt always be taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſecure themſelves at home, by preventing its falling into Forreign Hands, and of all Nations in the World, <hi>France</hi> the moſt dangerous; they in leſs than an Age have ſo encreaſed their Power at Sea, that they now vye their Fleet with our Royal Navy; and in Trade have ſo grown upon us, that 'tis certain had they the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Harbours, our Trade muſt be abſolutely in their Power, and ſuch, and only ſo much would fall to our ſhare, as they ſhould think fit to allow us. This was the greateſt Conſideration that mov'd the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſo freely and largely to Tax this Nation, for Reducing the Rebels of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though at the ſame time the great Benefit that would accrue to <hi>England</hi> by the Forfeitures in <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſufficiently inculcated. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in all former Ages has taught us, that upon the leaſt Troubles, or even appearance thereof in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have laid hold of every opportunity of encreaſing them, and ſhaking off the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Yoak; Is then this Nation ſo entirely ſecure at this time? And ſo wholly free from all apprehenſions of any Diſtractions or Troubles that may hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us, that it is not worth their utmoſt care ſo to ſettle the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as that it may not be in the power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to let in an Enemy at our Back-door; inſtances there are beyond number of their willingneſs at all times to Ruin <hi>England,</hi> and can this Age anſwer it to Poſterity, if they let ſlip the preſent opportunity put into their Hands, whereby they may for ever put it out of the power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> again to Rebel.</p>
            <p>In order to which (after that Kingdom was Reduced) the Houſe of Commons taking the ſame into their Conſideration, as well as the great Expence <hi>England</hi> had been put to for Reducing <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thinking it moſt equitable that what had coſt them ſo much, ſhould as far as 'twould go be applyed to the uſe of the War, did moſt humbly addreſs His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty herein, who was graciouſly pleaſed on <hi>Monday</hi> the Fifth of <hi>January</hi> Ninety, to tell them, <hi>That no Grants of the Forfeited Eſtates in</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Ireland <hi>ſhould be made till there ſhould be another opportunity of ſetling that matter in Parliament in ſuch manner as ſhould be thought moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> having now been Reduced above two years, 'twas thought a very near eſtimate of the Value of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forfeitures might be made, and in order to leſſen the Charge of <hi>England</hi> as much as might be, 'twas mov'd by a Worthy Member of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, That the Value of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forfeitures might be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; purſuant to which Motion the Propoſer gave an account thereof at the Bar of the Houſe, and afterwards he and ſeveral Gentlemen of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> delivered the following Propoſals to a Committee of the Houſe of Commons appointed to receive <hi>Propoſals concerning the Forfeitures in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and likewiſe for ſecuring the Proteſtant Intereſt there.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56985:3"/>
having reported theſe Propoſals, the Houſe upon Debate of the Matter came to this following Reſolution, on <hi>Friday</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1693. <hi>That a Bill be brought in to Veſt the Forfeited Eſtates in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>in Their Majeſties, to be applied to the uſe of the War.</hi> Purſuant to which Reſolution a Bill was brought into the Houſe, has been Read a Second time, and ordered to be committed to a Committee of the whole Houſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> being Alarm'd hereat, have privately handed about a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet by way of Anſwer to the Propoſals; whether it be ſo or not is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to every unprejudiced Reader, and that he may have the whole Matter fairly before him, the Propoſals, the Anſwer, and Reply are here preſented to him: If it appear that the Calculation is reaſonable, and that the Anſwer either avoids the moſt material Parts, or Refutes no part of the Propoſal, he cannot ſure but think that a Million of Money ſav'd at this time to this Nation, is a piece of Service that deſerves Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, which is all that the Propoſer, or thoſe concerned with him, aim at, or deſire; but if to this is added undeniable proof, that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod alone can in humane probability prevent future Rebellions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thereby ſave both the Treaſure and Blood of <hi>England;</hi> ſure no Man can take Exception to it, but either ſuch as are to loſe their Eſtates, or thoſe who may and do entertain hopes of having great ones given them. Now whether doing what in Gratitude is due to the People of <hi>England,</hi> as well as a Juſtice to them, and the future Security of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> can by any Honeſt or Good Men be omitted on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, cannot admit of a Diſpute.</p>

Perſons, looked upon as doubtful, whether forfeited or not, and ſo were never ſet out; a further Enquiry into the Title of thoſe Lands, before they were diſpoſed of, being intended, for which Reaſon thoſe Lands never came under the Cogniſance of the Commiſſioners of the Court of Claims, nor were they claimed by any.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lands have, moſt of them, ſince the Court of Claims, been paſs'd in Patent to thoſe that diſcover'd them, both before, and in the Court of Grace, without diſtinction of <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> the Perſon in poſſeſſion, and making the Diſcovery, being to have preference. What Proportion hereof fell to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and what to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> cannot be aſcertained; but admitting that no more thereof, than a Hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſix thouſand one hundred ninety one Acres, which is leſs than a fourth part, fell to the Papiſts ſhare, it will make, being added to what they were reſtored to by the Court of Claims, Two Millions and a half of profitable Acres, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure.</p>
            <p>This Eſtimate is according to the generally received Opinion of thoſe who very well underſtand that Kingdom half a Million of Acres leſs than what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were poſſeſſed of, at the time of their preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Acceſſion to the Crown.</p>
            <p>But to keep greatly within compaſs, ſuppoſing them to be poſſeſſed of no more than Two Millions and a half of Acres, it is to be conſidered, what part hereof by the late Rebellion is forfeited, and what not, and what part of the Forfeitures are remitted bv the Articles of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Limerick.</hi>

            <p>It is notorious, that not an <hi>Iriſh-</hi>man, who was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> during the late Rebellion, and capable of being guilty thereof, either by being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Arms, or by aiding, abetting, and aſſiſting the Rebels, is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: ſo that the only Perſons preſumed to be ſo, are either ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>England</hi> during the whole time, of which there are not above three or four known, or Infants, of ſuch an Age as could not capacitate them to bear Arms, or abet and aſſiſt the Rebels: In both which Caſes 'tis to be noted, That the Heirs, or next in Remainder, may have been, and probably were in Rebellion.</p>
            <p>What ſhall be leſſened of the Forfeitures, in both the foregoing Caſes, will be abundantly ſupplied by the Purchaſes made by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lawyers, Phyſitians, Merchants, and other Papiſts, ſince the Court of Claims, many of them having purchaſed very conſiderable Eſtates on the New Intereſt; the whole Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation being a thriving People, during the two laſt Reigns.</p>
            <p>That then which leſſens the Forfeitures from being at leaſt Two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and a half of Acres, is the Articles.</p>
            <p>For the making a reaſonable Eſtimate how much will be reſtored by the Articles, it is to be conſidered, who of Right are entitled to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56985:5"/>
By the firſt Article of <hi>Limerick</hi> all Inhabitants and Reſidents of <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> are included; but how far thoſe words will extend, deſerve mature conſideration: ſeeming according to the common acceptation, to deſign no others than ſuch as had for ſome time before been Houſekeepers, and paid Scot and Lot there, and not Inmates and Perſons come into the Town, and ſent for thither juſt before the Signing of the Articles, on purpoſe to claim the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>All Officers and Soldiers in Garriſons, are likewiſe Capitulated for, who ſhould ſubmit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where 'tis to be conſidered, what ſhall be deemed a Garriſon, upon which very conſiderable Eſtates depend.</p>
            <p>There are a Third ſort, which claim the benefit of the Articles, by Virtue of the Additional Article, ſaid to be agreed to, but omitted in the perfected Articles; and theſe are computed to be at leaſt one half of thoſe who claim the benefit of the Articles. How far this Additional Article shall take place, is humbly ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>On the whole: 'Tis humbly propoſed, That the Saving for the <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and <hi>Galloway</hi> Articles, may be in negative Terms, and not any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive confirming Words; foraſmuch as it is hoped, the Injuſtice of that Additional Article may be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the Additional Article be admitted, it will then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what will be reſtored by the Articles.</p>
            <p>Of this a certain determinate Calculation cannot be made, all thoſe who pretend to the Benefit of the Articles, not having made their Claim, and of thoſe who have Claimed, and are adjudged by the Lords Juſtices and Council to have the Benefit of the ſaid Articles; many are ſuppoſed not to be Rightfully Entitled thereto. Others not to have appeared to be ſo to them, altho' adjudged; an inſtance whereof is plain in the Caſe of Sir <hi>James Cotter,</hi> who Claiming the Benefit of the <hi>Limerick</hi> Articles, was oppoſed by Mr. Serjeant <hi>Osborn</hi> on Their Majeſties behalf, on this Suggeſtion, That ſuppoſing him within the Benefit of the Articles, he had Forfeited his Right thereto; and inſiſted upon having this Matter heard at the Council-board both on account of the Preſident, which might be of ill Conſequence in other Caſes, and likewiſe for that a very Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Eſtate depended hereon. But in this he was over-ruled, the Examination referred to Sir <hi>Richard Cox,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carleton,</hi> on whoſe Report Sir <hi>James Cotter,</hi> was adjudged within the <hi>Limerick</hi> Articles, and reſtored to his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>All Perſons who had taken Protection, are excepted out of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, notwithſtanding which, ſeveral claim the benefit of the Articles, whoſe Wives, Children, or Friends, had deſired Protections for them, and accordingly had ſuch Protections. Notwithſtanding which, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception out of the Article has been evaded, by the Protection not being delivered into the hand of the very Perſon himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56985:5"/>
Thoſe who were on the place, and made the ſtrictest Obſervation, conclude, that not above Two Fifths of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have any juſt pretence to the benefit of the Articles of <hi>Galloway</hi> or <hi>Limerick,</hi> even the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Article being admitted. But to put this beyond exception, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Three Fifths, (which is yet unconceivable) to be entitled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, there will then remain a Million of Acres forfeited; which are worth (a good Title being made to the Purchaſer by Act of Parliament) a Million of Money Sterling.</p>
            <p>In order to the Selling of which, 'tis humbly propoſed, That the Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland</hi> may have Fee-Farms granted them of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Eſtates, at greater or leſſer Rents, according to the reſpective Value of the Lands by them taken; which Rents ſo ſecured, will be very well worth Ten Years Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>As to the Value, whoever conſiders that one Acre with another is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but at Two Shillings, and that the greateſt part of the Forfeitures happen to be in <hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Munſter</hi> Land; in the former of which, by reaſon of its goodneſs and nearneſs to <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſets at the beſt Rate of any part of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and the latter, by reaſon of its Scituation for Trade, has the beſt and quickeſt Markets in that Kingdom, cannot but allow the Rent moderately ſet. But when to this 'tis added, That the Number of Acres calculated, are what are returned-by the Survey, when in Truth each parcel of Land contains conſiderably more than what 'tis ſurveyed at, beſides all the Land return'd as unprofitable thrown in, all the Country Towns, Villages, good Houſes, Fiſheries, Wares, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Mills, Fairs, Markets, and all the Timber, and other Woods not being reckoned, muſt be allowed, that it cannot exceed Twenty-pence <hi>per</hi> Acre, probably not Eighteen-pence.</p>
            <p>There ſeems to be but one material Objection againſt this Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Forfeitures, being worth a Million, which is the Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſhall appear to be in theſe forfeited Eſtates: To which 'tis to be anſwered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Incumbrances are pretended to be very much greater than they are, where they are real.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Incumbrances are pretended, where there is not the leaſt pretence, being old Debts trumpt up, which have been long ſince ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; or are ſuch as would not have affected the Forfeiting Perſon, or his Eſtate: And it cannot be preſumed reaſonable, that ſuch ſhould affect the Eſtate when forfeited; but many ſuch are let ſlip in the Crowd, thro' favour or negligence.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All real Incumbrances will be ſupplied, and more, by the Incumbrances the forfeiting <hi>Iriſh</hi> have on <hi>Engliſh-</hi>Mens Eſtates, if well examined into.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That theſe Forfeited Eſtates have never yielded near the Sum propoſed, To which 'tis anſwered:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56985:6"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the forfeited Eſtates have been ſet but from Year to Year, on which Terms no Tenant would take (in the Condition the Kingdom now is) at one quarter part of the Value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Grants, and ſo many Cuſtodiums are made, that the Commiſſioners of the Revenue cannot know the Value of the Forfeitures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Orders are iſſued by the Commiſſioners of the Revenue, to ſeveral Fee-Tenants, ſetting forth, That foraſmuch as the Proprietors have been Indicted, but not Outlawed, nor have been yet Tried, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Tenants to pay their reſpective Rents to the old Proprietors, by which means the ſaid Rents are ſtruck out of Charge in their Books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Several Perſons of conſiderable Eſtates, have procured the Repriſal of their Outlawries, tho' within no Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The greateſt skill imaginable has been uſed for concealing the real Value of the Forfeitures; a moſt notorious Inſtance whereof appears in the Earl of <hi>Clancarty</hi>'s Eſtate, which was always accounted worth, at leaſt, Six thouſand Pounds a Year, and was returned by an Inqueſt, who were to enquire into the Value of it, (in order, as is preſum'd, to the making a Grant thereof) but at Nineſcore Pounds a Year, this is Matter of Fact, and can be prov'd.</p>
            <p>Tho' it ſeems plain, that if the forfeited Eſtates of <hi>Ireland</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, be ſetled by Act of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> ſo as that a ſure Title may be made to the Purchaſer, and that a juſt and fair Adjudication be made upon the Articles, a Million of Money may be rais'd thereby. Yet there is this further Addition to be made to what before has been propos'd, which 'tis hoped may anſwer any Objection that can be made as to the Value.</p>
            <p>The Forfeitures in Cities and Towns-Corporate, are very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but cannot be reduced to certainty, there being no Rule to make a Calculation by.</p>
            <p>The forfeited Tythes and Impropriations are likewiſe conſiderable.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, the ſequeſtred Tythes and Impropriations were ſet for Sixty thouſand Pounds a Year. Of the Eſtates then ſequeſtred, Two Thirds were decreed to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and One Third to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> of which Third, Two Fifths are ſuppoſed forfeited: from whence 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that Two Fifths of their Proportions of the Tythes and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, are likewiſe forfeited; which at the Rate they were formerly ſet at, comes to Eight thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Forfeſtures of the Perſonal Eſtates, were great, tho' very little has been hitherto accounted for. The Houſe of Commons, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeemed of Opinion, That if the Embezelments thereof were ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into, a ſufficient Fund would ariſe thereout, for Diſcharging the Arrears due to the Army. The Tract of Time, and Miſmanagement of that Affair hitherto, has, no doubt, put a great deal beyond being retrieved; but yet 'tis humbly propoſed, That ſome part might be ſtill
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56985:6"/>
recovered, if faithfully and diligently enquired into. All which put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, 'tis humbly hoped, may be judged a very ſufficient Fund for raiſing a Million of Money.</p>
            <p>Fifty two Rebellions which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have been guilty of, may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evince, that nothing can reconcile the implacable hatred of them to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and that the only way of ſecuring that Kingdom to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> is the putting it out of the Power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> again to Rebel: Gentle means having hitherto always proved ineffectual, and the Favour they received after being conquered in one Rebellion, always laid a Foundation for the next.</p>
            <p>The Rebellion that broke out the Twenty third of <hi>October,</hi> 1641, was carried on with that Malice and Privacy, as not to be diſcovered 'till the very Day before their Barbarity was to have been put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this at a time, when the Papiſts enjoyed the greateſt Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Favours from the Government. They enjoy'd the Free Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, in as Publick a Manner as the Proteſtants did: They had their Titular Archbiſhops and Biſhops: Their Regular and Secular Clergy, and publick Nunneries: That had likewiſe an equal ſhare with the Proteſtants, in the Civil Power, by being Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs of Counties and, without Diſcrimination, Members of a Parliament then in being. All which Advantages were by them thought too little, to tye their Fidelity to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Rebellion, beſides the many Thouſand <hi>Britiſh</hi> Proteſtants Lives loſt, coſt Ten Millions ſeven hundred ſeventy eight thouſand thirty one Pounds Sterling, over-and-above the Loſs ſuſtained by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, computed in the whole, at Twenty two Millions. And tho' in the late Rebellion, the Proteſtants were not maſſacred; yet 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known, that their Deliverance is no way due to the Temper of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts being altered; but to the Hopes the late King <hi>James</hi> had of returning into <hi>England:</hi> which muſt have been wholly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by ſnewing the People of <hi>England</hi> what they might expect, had the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> been maſſacred.</p>
            <p>This, tho' ſo great a Conſideration, with much difficulty, prevail'd on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papists: nor had it done ſo, but that it was back'd by the repeated Promiſes of the late King <hi>James,</hi> That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould have very great Eſtates granted them in <hi>England,</hi> which would be forfeited to him. So that it ſeems reaſonable to conclude, that nothing leſs than the putting it entirely out of the power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, can prevent future Rebellions, and obviate the Danger of the loſs of that Kingdom to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to which, 'tis humbly propos'd, That the Selling all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Eſtates of that Kingdom, not remitted by the Articles of <hi>Galloway</hi> or <hi>Limerick,</hi> to Proteſtants, will ſo ſtrengthen the Proteſtant, and weaken the Popiſh Intereſt of that Kingdom, that future Rebellions,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56985:7"/>
will, with much more eaſe be thereby prevented, than otherwiſe they can.</p>
            <p>By the intermiſſion of Parliaments in that Kingdom, for Twenty ſeven Years, the Proteſtants were in imminent danger, of loſing both their Religion and Liberties; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts (by whoſe Intereſt, during the Two laſt Reigns, the Calling of Parliaments was always prevented, tho' earneſtly preſt for by the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> received ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages as has greatly ſtrengthned their Intereſt in that Kingdom; and they are become much more formidable than formerly they were, or otherwiſe could have been taken, for preventing the Growth of Popery, and the growing Power of the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>The Parliament call'd the laſt Year in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſat ſo little time, as not to be able to conſider of thoſe many Laws that were neceſſary to be Enacted for the Good of the Kingdom, after ſo long an Interval of of Parliaments; but agreed, That ſeveral Bills Enacted in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, were fit to be paſt into Laws in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which will at large appear by the annexed Votes of the Houſe of Commons; beſides which Acts, ſeveral others were deſigned, ſome of which follow.</p>
            <p>By Experience 'twas found in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, that Pecuniary Muicts on Papiſts, for not going to Church, had brought the greateſt part of that Nation to be Proteſtants; and tho' upon the Reſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, moſt of them turned to Maſs again: had that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod been proſecuted, their Children having been bred Proteſtants, would probably have continued ſo at this day, and thereby the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion have been prevented: to obtain which Happineſs to future Ages, 'twas reſolv'd to have addreſs'd the Lord Lieutenant, That a Bill might be drawn, for putting the Laws in force againſt Papiſts in due Execution, with ſuch further Clauſes as might be neceſſary for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing ſo good a work.</p>
            <p>The many Popiſh Schools in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſending their Children to the Univerſities in <hi>France,</hi> was, and is at this day, one great reaſon of the inveterate Malice of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Proteſtants, Prejudice of Education having greatly added to the Innate Hatred of their <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which in proceſs of time might have been very much leſſened by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Methods, in encouraging Proteſtant Schools, forbidding all Popiſh ones, by preventing their being ſent into <hi>France,</hi> and giving ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſuch as ſhould breed their Children Proteſtants: for effecting which, a Bill was deſigned, with a Clauſe againſt ſuch as ſhould marry Papiſts, incapacitating them for all Offices of Publick Truſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when <hi>Ireland</hi> was firſt planting, although then of the ſame Religion with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> thought it neceſſary for their Safety, to make a Pale within, which no <hi>Iriſh-</hi>man might inhabit under great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56985:7"/>
Penalties. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being now much more numerous than at that time, and of a different Religion from the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and having ſuffer'd ſo ſeverely by the two late Rebellions, it was thought worth the moſt ſerious Conſideration, in what places <hi>Britiſh</hi> Pales might be made, eſpecially on the Sea-Coaſt, whereby the Danger of any Invaſion from abroad might be prevented, as well as of future Rebellions at home, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being Embodied, and thereby much better ſecur'd than they are now by the Garriſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other things, being duly conſider'd by a Parliament, 'twas hoped ſuch effectual Courſe might be taken. as ſhould ſecure that Kingdom from future Rebellions, and likewiſe ſettle the diſtracted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which now it lies.</p>
            <p>Wherefore 'tis humbly propos'd, That a Parliament call'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for paſſing ſuch Laws as ſhall be judg'd neceſſary for the Security thereof, for redreſſing paſt and preſent Grievances, and preventing the like for the future, will probably prove the moſt effectual way for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing that Kingdom: For the accompliſhing which, no Methods can be ſo proper, as what ſhall be adviſed by the Collective Body of the whole Nation.</p>
            <closer>All which Matters aforeſaid, are, with the greateſt Deference, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmitted.</closer>

               <p n="1">1. THE Forfeitures of <hi>Ireland</hi> being now propos'd as a Security to raiſe a Million of Money on towards the Charge of the War, 'twill be neceſſary to enquire more near into the Value of the ſaid Forfeitures, rather than depend altogether upon a Notional Calculation made by the Propoſer, (who contents himſelf in framing his Project with Numbers of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Acres without any regard to the nature of a Forfeiture, or the Laws eſtabliſh'd) for that a diſappointment in a matter of this kind may prove of Ill Conſequence to the Publick; which he and his Party don't ſo much ſeem to conſider, as their own particular Gain, and the Deſtruction of Innocents, Widows, and Orphans, who have ſuffer'd but too much already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Propoſer brings the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> under Two Heads, that is to ſay, <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh;</hi> the Poſſeſſions of the latter he would have entirely Forfeited, and brings every Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick of that Kingdom under that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thence wou'd he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate them to be different from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Temper, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, nay, that they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prejudice and hatred to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56985:8"/>
them. Thus by falſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Suggeſtions wou'd he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a deſign to ſtrip, and ruin a Body of <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a different perſwaſion from himſelf; for that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated Men of <hi>Ireland</hi> (to a very few) are deſcended of Ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, who at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their Blood firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd that Kingdom, brought it under the Subjection of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued it ſo ever ſince. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> who plant in <hi>America</hi> may with as much reaſon be call'd <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and for that alone have their Fortunes and Eſtates ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is therefore hop'd that the Wiſe, and Juſt Senate, the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> will conſider their Countreymen (tho' in a diſtinct Kingdom) under their preſent unfortunate Circumſtances, without any prepoſſeſſions of prejudice, and take their Caſe juſtly as 'tis.</p>
               <p n="4">4. King <hi>James</hi> having gone for <hi>Ireland</hi> on the Late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome of the Catholicks there were concern'd in his Army, and ſome not; of thoſe concern'd in the Army ſome ſubmitted to the preſent Government on Articles, others choſe to follow him; theſe are intituled to no favour from that Power to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd

to ſubmit, and of conſequence their Eſtates juſtly to be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But as to the Article-Men publick Faith ought to ſtand good, beſides, he was their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known Maſter, and to whom, as their King, they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Faith, and Sworn Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Then let any impartial Man make the caſe his own, and ſeriouſly examine if at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his Conſcience he wou'd refuſe performing the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Subject to his Soveraign when requir'd to it? Muſt it not then neceſſarily follow that they acted but the part of Subjects, or at leaſt, the Propoſer muſt maintain that the tyes of Faith and Allegiance are of no force, and may be broke with their preſent Majeſties in caſe of a Forreign Invaſion, which is a Doctrine no good Subject will allow of.</p>
               <p>Theſe People have now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on a ſolemn Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are become Subjects, is it not therefore reaſonable they ſhould have the benefit of the ſame, and be receiv'd into the protection of the Laws, when as by the implacable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Propoſers Party, one third of thoſe compriz'd in the ſaid Capitulation are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy their Eſtates, and Fortunes, as 'twas ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

But 'tis moſt certain that neither he, nor one of his Adherents, had any ſhare in quelling theſe he mentions: 'Twas by thoſe, and their Anceſtors (whom he calls Forfeiting <hi>Iriſh)</hi> they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, who fought for every Foot of Land they got there, and gain'd it Inch by Inch until they ſubdued the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and preſerv'd it ſince for the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and if in return of ſo much Fidelity they muſt now be deſtroy'd to make room for, or to gratifie theſe their Perſecutors, 'twill be hereafter but a ſlender Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for juſt and faithful Services.</p>
               <p n="22">22.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56985:14"/>
even with the Propoſer's Friends, who had a little before taken moſt part of their Bread from them, by which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that 'tis the injur'd Man that forgets and remits the wrong, but never he that gives it: For who cou'd be better us'd than thoſe of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who ſtaid in <hi>Ireland</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe late Troubles; did they pay extraordinary Taxes, or any thing more than the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks? Nay, by all People in Employment they were rather favour'd than otherwiſe? What might have been done by the Mobb, or Rapparees, was not in the power of Man to help; yet all this Humanity and Juſtice would he attribute to the hopes King <hi>James</hi>'s Officers had of getting Eſtates in <hi>England;</hi> but the Gentleman is apt to miſtake, and did not conſider, that every Body well knows the People of <hi>England</hi> don't Forfeit their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates on ſuch eaſie terms; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he allows in Fact that they were well us'd, and we are oblig'd to him for this one Truth.</p>

23. If then all thoſe black Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and falſe Reaſonings don't prevail, he offers for a concluding, and ſtabbing ſtroke, That to make Forfeitures of theſe Eſtates by accriminating the Innocent, oppreſſing the Widow, and ſtriping the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, is a ſure Baſis to Build on, and an infallible Mean whereby to preſerve the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by which he ſhews himſelf ſo little a Divine, that he is not commonly Moral, to imagine that any Religion ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it ſelf by a practice ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it teaches.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Then he deſires that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary, and Penal Laws may be put into their hands, but it ſhou'd ſeem by their practice, that they need neither, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo violently even againſt the Eſtabliſh'd Laws, and regard ſo little Humanity, and the Laws of God; for that the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince the Reduction of it by the Army, have under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Rapparees, kill'd ſeveral Labouring-men, even at the Plough; becauſe they wanted opportunities during all the War to draw their Swords.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Another Expedient he thinks likewiſe Reaſonable, which is, That a Pale may be made for Proteſtants; and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks be removed from the Sea-ſide in all Parts. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> of which is, That where a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56985:16"/>
Catholick ſhall happen to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his own Inheritance, and the ſame prove to be good Land, it ſhall then be in the Power of any of them to tranſplant him to the top of a Mountain, and to ſeize on his Right, as being within their Verge. In ſhort, 'tis to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred they do not ſue for a Power and Liberty to impale them then too at will and pleaſure; for that they are in a Circumſtance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as bad, expoſed daily to the Inſults of their Neighbours, who at diſcretion may take from them the ſmall Remnant they have left of any kind, and as being Out-law'd, have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the ſame.</p>
               <p>What ſtate of Man can be more Miſerable than this, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour more of Bondage? A thing in <hi>England</hi> ſo much deteſted. It is therefore hoped that theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will make impreſſions on every true <hi>Engliſh-man</hi>'s heart, and that they will conſider thoſe of their own Nation, ſo as to prevent their being thus injured by a ſort of Men, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fiſh'd in troubled Waters, and know not what 'tis to get, but by Rapin and Oppreſſion.</p>

26. It is to be preſumed that theſe Catholicks for being of that Perſuaſion are not to loſe their Birth-rights. Wherefore it may reaſonably be asked, why a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant living in <hi>Ireland</hi> under King <hi>James,</hi> or actually ſerving him either in a Military or Civil Employment, ſhould be free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of the Laws, and ſafe in his Property; when at the ſame time his <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Neighbour, in equal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with him, ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forfeit all, and be proſcribed? This ſingle Inſtance ſhews the Proceedings of theſe Men of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be plainly Partial and Unjuſt.</p>
               <p>All this conſidered, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflected on, it may with Reaſon be hoped, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That their Majeſties, and all thoſe concerned in the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will no longer ſuffer, that Men ſhall thus be diveſted of their Properties, againſt the Laws of God and Man: That ſome certain Rules or Meaſures of Juſtice be put to them like other Subjects, and that all their Outlawries (a Yoak much more intolerable than Chains and Fetters) be reverſed, they having done nothing to Forfeit the Protection of the Government ſince their Submiſſion to it.</p>
               <p n="27">27. In Conſideration of which, and to be delivered out of the Power of their bitter and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Perſecutors, the ſuppoſed Forfeiting Perſons moſt Humbly, and Willingly offer to Subſcribe to any Tax that ſhall be thought fit, or reaſonable to be given out of their Eſtates towards the Charge of the War, which in all probability will prove more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual

               <p>But this Rebellion of Forty One was you ſay only a Conſpiracy of Sir <hi>Philime O Neal,</hi> and his Accomplices, I'll allow it, but his Accomplices were entirely the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation; were not Men, Women and Children, Murdered in every part of the Kingdom at once, and with that Cruelty as would make any Man of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion tremble to think on?

Here indeed 'tis plain the Eſtate committed the Treaſon, and not the Man. That any were refuſed to be tryed, who peremptorily demanded it, I believe in Fact is not true; your own words (or otherwiſe terrified) explains the matter; for ſome as Guilty as any in that Kingdom, had the Confidence (relying on the Mercy of the Government) to move for a Tryal, in order to be thereby put into the condition of the moſt Innocent; theſe Men might, and probably were told, that if they preſt for a Tryal, they muſt expect to undergo the Judgment of the Law, which no doubt ſufficiently terrified them, which you expreſs after ſuch a manner, as that People who underſtand not the matter, may be induced to believe that unreaſonable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable menaees were uſed to People that were innocent.—</p>

But you are too large in taking in both the laſt Reigns; during that of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the upper hand, and then indeed they liv'd amicably, but ſoon after King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown you began to ſhew your ſelves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of retalliating the kindneſſes ſhew'd you in the foregoing Reigns. Plots were ſworn againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Twenty or Thirty of the principal Gentlemen of a County accuſed, and ſeveral of them try'd for High-Treaſon, the moſt vigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution imaginable; and all poſſible care taken for going through ſtitch with it, but when <hi>Teague</hi> came to give Evidence, they ſo thwarted and contradicted each other, that thoſe who had the leaſt Grain of Modeſty bluſhed at it, a hundred times more Paper than is allow'd for this would not contain the ſevere uſage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> received in that little time.</p>
               <p>Your next ſentence puts me beyond all patience, the good uſage the Proteſtants who ſtayed in <hi>Ireland</hi> had: did you not bluſh at writing this?

What madneſs poſſeſſed the People if this were true to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſo many Lives in open Boats in the midſt of Winter? Others to lye Night and Day in Caves and Rocks by the Sea-ſide, watching opportunities of getting off, and generally without a Penny of Money, or Rag of Cloaths, more than what they had on their Backs? Did you ever keep Faith with any that fell into your. Hands? (Our Army only excepted, which you did for fear;) Were not Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons broke with Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell</hi> and his Party; he and they Try'd, and lay Condemned, (contrary to Faith given) till you durſt no longer hold them?

longer upon a thing as notoriouſly falſe as God is true. However before we part I'll repeat a Paragraph of a Sermon Preached by the Learned and Excellent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> before the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, <hi>Oct. 23. 1692. We who were in this Kingdom in the Years 89 and 90.</hi> had indeed a ſentence of death in our ſelves; <hi>for we knew our ſelves in the Hands of Bloody Enemies, Enemies by Nation, Manners, Religion, and Intereſt, Enemies Inſolent, and (ſome few excepted) Barbarous, and Brutiſh, Enemies who never kept Faith, nor can be preſumed ever will, we were naked even as to defenſive Weapons, deprived of all manner of Refuge or Security; yea, many of us oftentimes of the very Neceſſaries of Life: We were moſt cauſleſly either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Impriſonment or Reſtraints, and not ſeldom drawn out, and ſet forth as Men appointed for immediate Death: Our ſurrounding Guards (not long before our Servants) ſtanding ready with their Arms and calling for the Word, the Word; and ſometimes the Commander in Chief Damning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that upon the firſt ſight of the Enemy, he would Sacrifice our Heretick Souls to the Devil: Thus ſtood it with many of us, who are thought to have fared beſt: Others, and thoſe not a few, under a formal Sentence of Death, Gallows, and Executioners prepared and appearing.</hi> It were worſe with thoſe forlorn numbers driven before the Walls of <hi>Derry,</hi> of whom God alone knows how many periſhed; theſe things are ſo manifeſt, that to uſe the words of our Town-Clark in the Acts, <hi>They cannot be ſpoken againſt; it admits not contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Now pray what think you? Might not Men be better uſed than this?</p>
               <p>In the next Sentence you omit ſaying any thing to one part of what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer aſcribes the ſafety of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lives to, <hi>viz.</hi> The hopes the late King had of returning into <hi>England,</hi> which was the true cauſe that the Proteſtants were not all maſſacred; and this you cannot but know very well who were ſo near the Fountain-head, and had the drawing of moſt of the Reſolutions, and Orders.</p>
               <p>You very eaſily convince me that the People of <hi>England</hi> would never have parted with their Eſtates to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and I dare ſay the Propoſer never thought they would, nor does he ſay any thing like it; but is that an Argument why that might not paſs upon <hi>Iriſh-men?</hi> If you pleaſe to enquire in the places where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiments quartered juſt before the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, you may be furniſht with Stories enough of like Nature; where every day over their Cups, they had Cantoned out the whole Country, and divided the Noblemen, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Seats among them.</p>
               <p>But the Paſſion which your laſt Sentence raiſed, this has lay'd, for I now begin to pity you, do you not Argue admirably well? However, ſay you, the Propoſer allows in Fact that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who ſtayed in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the late Times were well uſed.</p>
               <p>In this your Party ſhew their Temper with more truth and plainneſs than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion; for though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> no doubt think that ſparing <hi>Engliſh-mens</hi> Lives (although they Rob them of all they have) is good Uſage, yet you will never be able to perſwade this Kingdom that 'tis ſo; and I dare undertake for the Propoſer and his Party they never looked on it as ſuch.</p>

                  <hi>23.</hi> So many black Rebellions are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Arguments that carry Force in them, and therefore may prevail; look back to the laſt Paragraph, and tell me who is the falſe Reaſoner; but you are very often guilty of a worſe fault than falſe Reaſoning, which perhaps you cannot help, and that is moſt falſely Repreſenting; for, as you have been told before, the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Widdow and Orphans are by expreſs words in the Propoſal to be ſafe: But your hopes it, that many may read your Sheet, who never ſaw the Propoſals, they not being Publick: This is leading the Blind out of their way, which I think has leſs Divinity and Morality in it, than the Propoſer's Propoſition, That the only effectual Methods for ſecuring the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Intereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are the putting it out of the power of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> again to Rebel.</p>

                  <hi>24.</hi> Will you not repeat one Sentence truly? Where does tho Propoſer ſo much as mention Sanguinary Laws, ſo far is he from deſiring them? But <hi>Pecuniary</hi> and <hi>Sanguinary</hi> ſound alike, ſo you might miſtake. Your Allegation of the Militia's Murdering Labouring-men being Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, for that you muſt imply, if your Argument have any force, is as falſe, as that they had not Opportunity during all the War to draw their Swords; a great many of your Country-men to their Coſt know the contrary, and might have given them more Opportunities of drawing their Swords, had thoſe who Commanded your Regular Troops durſt have met them, which they always avoided as the Plague.</p>

                  <hi>England?</hi> Does not the Propoſer tell you, that when firſt your Anceſtors ſotled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they thought it neceſſary for their Safety to make a Pale, and how comes this unreaſonable now? You cannot fancy we believe you <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> ſtill, or that our Throats are ſafer when in your power, than if the Old <hi>Iriſh</hi> were our Maſters. Pray let us conſult the <hi>London, Briſtol,</hi> and other Merchants upon the Point whoſe Ships are not ſafe, though Eight or Ten Leagues within Land, if a <hi>French</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer be upon the Coaſt, to whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> may give Notice, and whom they have ſo often brought in, and will as oft as they have Opportunity; beſides that they give conſtant Intelligence to the <hi>French</hi> Privateers, and ſupply them with all manner of Neceſſaries, is notorious: Theſe Inconveniences making Pales would obviate, were there no danger at any time hereafter of a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion; and indeed you are hard put to it for a Reaſon againſt theſe Pales, when you talk of turning the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to the Mountains, and taking their good Land: Here your Candor fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, for you cannot but know, that the Sea-Coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> is the moſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and pooreſt Land of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Inland Countries the richeſt and beſt; but ſomething muſt be ſaid, whether true or falſe, to the purpoſe or not.</p>
               <p>You have again ſlid over a moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing mentioned by the Propoſer, a Law againſt ſending your Children to the Seminaries in <hi>France;</hi> a thing ſo Fatal, as that this late Rebellion is in great meaſure the Effect of it: 'Tis from thence for Thirty Years paſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have received Encouragement, and the Prieſts there bred have entirely devoted their whole Body to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, who in all former Times admired and courted the <hi>Spaniard</hi> as their Patron. Let no body think that ſo many <hi>Iriſh</hi> Scholars are maintained at the <hi>French</hi> King's Charge out of a Principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without other Ends; the Oath which they all take at their Admiſſion, of promoting the <hi>French</hi> King's Intereſt at all times, and in all places, might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably convince any Man how dangerous a thing this is.</p>

The Knot is eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed; ſome of the Proteſtants who had not Opportunity of getting out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were for the ſafety of their Lives forced to act in ſome things till they could get off, which moſt of them did as ſoon as 'twas poſſible; if any continued, no doubt the difference in Religion ought not to ſave the Traytor, and 'tis plain 'tis not deſigned it ſhould; for by the Bill now depending no Proteſtant is ſaved who was in Arms after ſuch day as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall think fit to name; which I take to be a full and ſatisfactory Anſwer to your Query, on which you lay ſo much ſtreſs.</p>
