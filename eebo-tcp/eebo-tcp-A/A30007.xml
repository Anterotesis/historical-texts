            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
From the Right Honourable the
Earl of Mulgrave,
TO
Doctor TILLOTSON Dean of Canterbury.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOthing in this World is, or ought to be ſo dear to
any Man, as his Reputation; and conſequently
the Defence of it is the greateſt Obligation that
one Man can lay on another: There are alſo ſome
Circumſtances, that render this Obligation yet more Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Valuable; as when 'tis Confer'd Generouſly, without
any Self-Intereſt, or the leaſt Deſire or Invitation from the
Perſon ſo Defended. All this happens to be my Caſe at this
time; and therefore I hope you will not be ſurpriz'd to find
I am not the moſt Ungrateful, and Inſenſible Man living;
which certainly I ſhould be, if I did not acknowledge all
your Induſtrious Concern for me, about the Buſineſs of the
Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, which now makes ſo much Noiſe
in the World. You have, as I am told, ſo Cordially pleaded
my Cauſe, that 'tis almoſt become your own; and therefore,
as unwilling as I am to ſpeak of my ſelf, eſpecially in a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which I cannot wholly Excuſe; yet I think my ſelf now
a little Obliged to ſhew my Part in this matter; though Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
enough, yet is not altogether Unworthy of ſo Juſt,
and ſo Conſiderable an Advocate.</p>
            <p>The leſs a Man ſays of himſelf, the better; and 'tis ſo well
known already, how I was kept out of all the Secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
that I need not juſtifie my ſelf, or trouble you as to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65300:2"/>
thoſe Matters; only I Appeal to the Unqueſtionable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, if I did not zealouſly and
conſtantly take all Occaſions to oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt;
becauſe I knew it directly Oppoſite both to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's
Good, which are indeed things Inſeperable, and ought
to be ſo accounted, as a Fundamental Maxim in all Councils
of Princes.</p>
            <p>This, I hope, will prepare the way a little for what I
have to ſay concerning my being one of the Eccleſiaſtical
Commiſſioners; of which Error I am now as ſenſible, as I
was at firſt ignorant, being ſo unhappily converſant in the
midſt of a perpetual Court-flattery, as never to have heard
the leaſt word of any Illegality in that Commiſſion, before I
was unfortunately engaged in it.</p>
            <p>For, thô my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had very prudently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to be of it, yet it was talked at Court, it proceeded
only from his Unwillingneſs to act at that time, and not from
any Illegality he ſuſpected in the Commiſſion; having Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf from it the moſt reſpectful way, by the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he lay under. Being thus ignorant of the Laws, and in
ſuch a Station at Court, I need not deſire a Man of your
Judgment and Candor, to conſider the hardneſs of my Caſe,
when I was commanded to ſerve in a Commiſſion with a Lord
Chancellor, a Lord Chief Juſtice, and two Biſhops, who
had all of them already acted ſome time there, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt Diffidence of their Power, or any Heſitation in
the Execution of it. And perhaps a Man of more Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than I can pretend to, might have been eaſily perſwaded
to act in ſuch a Conjunction, and to think he might do it
ſafely, both in Law and Conſcience. But I need not ſay
much to ſhew my deſire to have avoided, if poſſible, a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
Employment, that had not the leaſt temptation of
Honour or Profit to Recommend it; and which therefore I
continued in upon no account in the World, but to Serve
both King and Clergy with the little Ability I had, in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
thoſe Councils, which I thought might grow higher, if
I left my Place to be fill'd by any of thoſe who waited for it
greedily, in order to their ill Deſigns.</p>
            <p>And I may expect the more Credit in this, when 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
that the Two Important Affairs which paſſed in that
Eccleſiaſtical Court, being the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Suſpenſion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65300:2"/>
and the Incapacitating the Members of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge;
the firſt was done ſome Months before I was a Commiſſioner,
and I oppoſed the laſt, both in Voting and Speaking, and with
all the Intereſt I was able to make uſe of, which indeed was
but little after that Oppoſition; in which being Out-voted,
I ſeldome Came, and never Acted in that Court after, except
to Reſtore the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> thô ſent for continually, by
reaſon of my Lodging ſo near it.</p>
            <p>And ſince I have been forced to mention my Good-will
at leaſt, if not my Service, to ſuch Learned Men of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
who I thought deſerv'd it, it may be allow'd me to give
this one Inſtance more of it; that althô in Preferring Men
to all other Places of the Houſhold, I ever us'd to ask Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
firſt, and accordingly was often Refus'd, for the ſake
of <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> and others, who were Recommended by
Perſons more in Favour than my ſelf; yet I was ſo careful of
keeping that Conſiderable part of the Family unmix'd with
Mean or Unworthy Chaplains, whom others I fear'd wou'd
have impos'd on His Majeſty, that I conſtantly fill'd up thoſe
Vacancies without giving him the leaſt Notice or Trouble about
it, and Supply'd them with the ableſt approv'd Divines, I
could poſſibly find, moſt commonly Recommended to me by
the Biſhops who were not of the Court: Which I conceiv'd
the moſt proper courſe, in a Matter concerning Clergymen,
with a King of a different Perſwaſion from theirs, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his real Service, believing it had been better for Him,
as well as the Kingdom, if the Greater Eccleſiaſtical Dignities
had been diſpos'd of by others with as much Caution.</p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have endeavour'd to confirm you in your
Favourable Opinion of me, which muſt be acknowledg'd by
every-body an Approbation of ſuch weight, that as I hope it
may be an Example of Authority to many, ſo 'tis ſufficient of
itſelf to Ballance the Cenſoriouſneſs of others. I am,</p>
