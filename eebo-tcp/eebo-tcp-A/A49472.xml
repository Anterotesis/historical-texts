            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Couutrey hath been the seat of Warre for<note place="margin">24.

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96207:8"/>The most famous battel that hath been fought in<note place="margin">Newport Battel.</note> this Countrey was that of <hi>Neiwport;</hi> great were the Armies as well that of the States, as that of the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> and almost for number equal, the advantages of winde, or Sun, or ground little or none; the <hi>States</hi> had a sad <hi>morning,</hi> and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Duke a fatal <hi>evening,</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cut off twelve hundred stout and hardy <hi>Scots</hi> at a narrow passage, (a great losse for the quality of the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or <hi>number</hi> at that pinch of time, for they were (with the <hi>English</hi>) the <hi>flower</hi> of the <hi>States Army,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> followed their game so furiously, that <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> left the field, all the <hi>Dutch</hi> ran a shipboard, that valiant and wise Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> was shot in the morning, which wound rendred him unable for Command that day, but he committed it to his brother a prosperous, and religious Leader; who managed it so, that when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had gained so much ground that they possessed the Cannon, and cryed out <hi>Sancta Maria, Victoria, victoria,</hi> and all was given for lost, yet the <hi>English</hi> Regiments (who only <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>wonne</hi> the field) did so poure their bullets amongst the enemies, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently regain'd the Ordnance, and charg'd them presently with small shot, and discharg'd them so successfully, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were forc'd to leave the field in disorder; that night, and their heels was their shelter.

            <p>And now at present this County of <hi>Flanders</hi> is the Seat of Warre, wherein <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are tugging against <hi>Spain,</hi> and hitherto have performed admirable service, as the taking of <hi>Bourburgh</hi> and <hi>Mardike,</hi> the surrender of <hi>Dunkerk</hi> into our hands, that Town so infamous for Piracies; the great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow given to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> striving to relieve it, with a great number of field Officers and others, made prisoners, the speedy gaining of <hi>VVinnoxberg, Vuern, Dixmude,</hi> Towns that have all of them titles added to their names; as <hi>Dunkerk</hi> for trade, <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxbergh</hi> for a gallant Market, <hi>Vuern</hi> for pleasure, and <hi>Dixmude</hi> for excellent butter.</p>
