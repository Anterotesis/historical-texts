            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY Purpoſe in the following Treatiſe is not to
ſatisfy all the Queſtions which may be put, as,
What if any one ſhould preach in the Pulpit (<hi>in
terminis</hi>) that Jeſus is not the Chriſt, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Reſurrection of the Dead, or any other Article of
our Faith, which all who call themſelves Chriſtians do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg?
or affront the Miniſter at the Communion, and
pull the Cloth and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils off the Table? ſuch things by
the place and manner of doing them, may be reduced to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Impiety, and puniſhed as Crimes againſt natural Light.
But my Buſineſs is to aſſert a juſt Liberty in ſuch controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial
things of Religion, as they who have forſaken the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do differ in, and have, as they ſuppoſe,
ſome able and learned, ſober and Godly Men of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion,
ſuppoſing that in the mean time they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
peaceably, and live without any Civil Injury: for
my own part I am ſo ſar from thinking that any of theſe
Sects ought to be puniſhed, that I believe they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
each with other, notwithſtanding any Opinion in
Religion which they hold, (if that be all) had they but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
enough to bear with, and forbear one the other: for he
who believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God, 1
<hi>John</hi> 5. 1. and is built upon the Rock, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16, 18.
<pb facs="tcp:57859:3"/>
Although I will not deny but I ſhould prefer a purer Church
before a leſs pure, and perhaps one that is not of my own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
before one that is, for other cauſes; but I cannot
communicate with any Church, which will require me to
ſubſcribe to, or by my Practice and Geſture, to juſtify any
the leaſt thing which I judg to be unlawful, or elſe I ſhall
not communicate; for Example, The Baptiſm of Infants
is not ſo material a thing either way, as that Men ſhould
break Communion upon it; for there is for it neither Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
nor Precedent: On the other ſide it is not forbidden,
but if he who thinks it unlawful to baptize his Infant,
ſhall not communicate except he doth, he cannot lawfully
communicate; and the Schiſm is on their part, who will
force it as a neceſſary Condition of Communion, for they
cauſe Diviſions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. I think there are in our
Church others who deſerve Toleration leſs than any Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whom I know, as notorious Prophaners of the Lords
Day, Haunters of Ale-houſes at unſeaſonable times of the
Night, or when according to their Conſciences, they ſhould
be at Church: and other debauched Perſons whom we hear
daily in the Streets curſing and ſwearing, bidding God to
damn themſelves and others. Now that they are groſly
miſtaken, who tolerate ſuch Perſons as theſe that offend
againſt their own Conſciences, and yet ſeverely puniſh
Diſſenters in matters of mere Religion, will be ſufficiently
proved in the following Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>I bene diſtinguit, bene docet;</hi> it will therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to premiſe a word or two for diſtinction's
ſake.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> We need not trouble our ſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
Conſcience logically, but taking that word
groſly, and as it is vulgarly underſtood, we mean by Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
any Man's Perſwaſion of what he is to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
which may be of two ſorts;</p>
            <p>1. Either firſt, of ſuch things as may be known by the
common Light of Nature: Or,</p>
            <p>2. Such things as are known only by Divine Revelation. And
theſe are of two ſorts:</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> Such as concern the revealed Will of God under the
Old Teſtament, which is called the Law: Or,</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The Revealed Will of God under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is called the Goſpel. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Liberty we mean an Immunity from Puniſhment,
and that is either,</p>
            <p>1. Divine, <hi>viz.</hi> the juſt Judgments of God.</p>
            <p>2. Humane, and thoſe are twofolde;</p>
            <p>(1.) Civil and Temporal Puniſhments, by loſs of Life, Limb,
or Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) Eccleſiaſtical, by the Admonitions and ſpiritual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Church. Theſe things being premiſed, the Truth
concerning Liberty of Conſcience will be cleared by the proof
of the following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>I. Firſt then, if the Conſcience be erroneous by any great
Fault againſt the common Light of Nature, we cannot aſſert
any Freedom to it: For God will puniſh it, and the King will
puniſh it, and ſo ſhould the Church too by her ſpiritual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57859:4"/>
and the greater the Error is as to the clearneſs of the
Light, againſt which it is committed, or as to the Miſchief and
Malignity of it, the more puniſhable it is; for elſe we ſhould
introduce a Liberty for profeſſed Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Adultery, Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Catilines</hi> and <hi>Ravilliacks,</hi> &amp;c.
for Puniſhments in ſuch caſes may be proper and more likely to
amend the Delinquent, and ſave the Community from ſuch
Miſchiefs as ſuch Errors tend to bring upon it. Yet do not good
Magiſtrates write all their Laws in Blood, but decree Capital
Puniſhments only againſt Capital Offenders, and eſpecially for
ſuch Offences as are againſt the ſecond Table, which Magiſtrates
are better able to judg of, and ſtrike at the Root and Being of
Civil Societies, as Murther, Paricide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mentioned groſs
Errors in the Propoſition, for as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Summes,</hi>
All Faults againſt natural Light belong not to the Cognizance
of the Civil Magiſtrate, who is a publick Perſon, but are to be
corrected by Oeconomicks and Ethicks; ſo for the moſt part the
Faults of Children are to be corrected by their Parents.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſome groſs Errors may be excepted as they may be
circumſtantiated or over-ruled by Education and Religion,
therefore the Chriſtians did not perſecute the Heathens as the
Heathens perſecuted them, although the Idolatries of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
were contrary to common Light, nor do the Proteſtants
perſecute the Papiſts as the Papiſts perſecute the Proteſtants,
though ſome of the Errors of the Papiſts, as Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are groſly againſt the common Light of Reaſon and Senſe
it ſelf; but more tolerable as Errors meerly, than paying <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>-pence
to the Pope is in Civil Government.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Prop.</hi> Such Jews as lived in the Times of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were not to have the Liberty of their Conſciences as to
humane Puniſhments, though a great part of that Law conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only of the revealed Will of God; for God's Will was
likewiſe revealed that they ſhould be puniſhed. Now theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
unto which the Jews were bound, were moſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the outward Man, and very clearly revealed: Beſides,
the Jews had their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> their Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
whom God according to his Promiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up from time to time for their Direction, whom the People
were bound to hear under penalty of Exciſion; neither were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57859:4"/>
the Strangers that dwelt in the Land, and were but Proſelytes
of the Gate, to be tolerated in Blaſphemy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 16. in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 4, 5. in Sabbath-breaking, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 15. ſo
<hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35. it was revealed that he who gathered Sticks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sabbath-day ſhould be put to death; though for other
things God did not bind the Gentiles to the like Obedience to
the Law with the natural Jews: Neither did the Jews require it
of them, nor do they now; from whence it appears that is a
great Paralogiſm to argue from what was done by Kings and
Princes under the Old Teſtament, to the like under the New,
as if a Man ſhould now argue from <hi>Elijah</hi>'s ſlaying <hi>Baal's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 20. or from that in <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt
not live, for thou ſpeakest Lies in the Name of the Lord,</hi> as ſome
have argued from <hi>Aſa</hi>'s Covenant to put Men to Death,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13. what a hideous deal of Miſchief might an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Zealot be perſwaded to do from ill managing the Old
Teſtament; as I have heard ſome in the Pulpit to argue from
thence for the obſervation of the Lord's Day, as would prove
the <hi>Saturday Sabbath,</hi> and not lawful now under the Goſpel to
kindle a Fire upon Saturday.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, that the Equity of that Law obligeth ſtill,
giving to Kings and Princes power to reform the Houſe of God.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Be it ſo; but what that Equity is muſt not be taken
as every Man ſhall imagine of his own Head, but from the Law
of Nature, and from the poſitive Law of Chriſt: <hi>Placeus</hi> ſays
that thoſe Kings were all typical; and it is probable that in the
ſpiritual ſenſe, not Kings, but prevalent Parties in the Chriſtian
Church are to be underſtood, ſo <hi>Hierom ad Paulinum, Haeretico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
bella adverſus Eccleſiam declarantur.</hi> A Magiſtrate may do
much for the propagation of the Chriſtian Religion againſt ſuch
Errors as are meerly againſt the Goſpel, by protection of the
Orthodox, by his Munificence, Encouragement, Direction,
Example, and againſt moral Errors and Impieties by due coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion;
for where theſe are carefully look'd to, no fear but the
Goſpel will thrive well: but that the Magiſtrate is to puniſh Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Hereſies meerly concerning the Faith of Chriſt, where
there is not ſufficient mixture of moral Impiety, proved by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Witneſſes, that this I ſay is any part of the moral Equity
of that Law, I deny, <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57859:5"/>
III. My third Concluſion is this, Errors and Hereſies againſt
the Faith of Chriſt, only and meerly as ſuch, are not to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with civil Puniſhments by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. I
ſhall prove this Propoſition by theſe Arguments following.</p>
            <p>I. Firſt I reaſon <hi>ab Authoritate divinâ negativè,</hi> which no Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
can reaſonably deny in this caſe. I reaſon therefore thus,
Our Saviour Chriſt hath neither by himſelf, nor by his Apoſtles,
commanded any ſuch thing; therefore no ſuch thing ought to
be done. To meddle with the Eſtates, Liberties, Limbs or
Lives of Men is no indifferent thing, but a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and therefore our Saviour Chriſt, who was the great
Law-giver of the Chriſtian Church, and was faithful to him
that appointed him, who ſpared not to threaten and denounce
the Judgments of God, and knew very well that the Chriſtians
would one day gain the Imperial Crown; I ſay, he would not
only have commanded all Chriſtian Kings and Princes in a thing
ſo important, (as <hi>Mahomet</hi> bids his Diſciples to fight for the
Faith, with promiſe of great Reward) but have given them
plain and particular Rules to guide them, that they ſhould not
draw the Ruin and Blood of Men upon them where 'tis ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to miſtake and exceed. Our Saviour foreſaw the grand
and general Apoſtacy of the Chriſtians from the Purity of the
Faith, and was therefore very unlikely to put ſuch Knives into
the hands of Apoſtates, or Men imperfectly reform'd: We ſee
what Work they have made for their abominable Hereſies,
thinking to do God Service in burning Men alive; which is
enough to ſatisfy any Man of a true Chriſtian Spirit of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm
of the Opinion which I oppoſe, ſince all Errours
are not equal, neither ought the Puniſhment: What Rule hath
our Saviour left, or can any Man imagine by which to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Puniſhments which are of many ſorts and degrees; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Pope, as if he would ſupply what Chriſt left defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
makes his own Definitions and Decrees, the Rule whereby
to judg of Hereſy; and his own arbitrary Will, the Standard of
its Puniſhment; being in that directly Antichriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> contrary
to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now if Chriſt hath not commanded, they are ſurely too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious
that will offer violence to any Man for his ſake, and may
expect their Reward from him that ſet them on work, <hi>non amo
nimiùm diligentes.</hi>

But to proſecute this Argument further, it is clear that there
is nothing to be alledged from the Current of the Goſpel, ſo
that the Adverſary is conſtrained to glean up a Scrap or two;
I think there was hardly ever any thing alledged from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
own Words, except ſome few have trifled from thoſe
Words, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Compel them to come in;</hi> which are part of
a Parable, and according to the ſcope of it to be underſtood of
importunate preaching; for ſurely the Apoſtles were not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Temporal Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the word is in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which is beſt underſtood of urgent Invitation, and moſt
proper to bring ſuch as are there ſpoken of to his Supper. <hi>Paul</hi>
uſeth the ſame word of Perſwaſion and Example, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14.
<hi>Why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</hi> So likewiſe
little is to be alledged from the Apoſtle's words, but from ſome
general Expreſſions, and by conſequence, as thus, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
That though the Apoſtles could not puniſh ſo, as being
no Magiſtrates, yet <hi>Peter</hi> denounced God's Judgments againſt
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> Acts 5.</p>
            <p>1. I anſwer, firſt, That is without the ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
for that was in a criminal Cauſe, of Lying, Diſſembling,
Purloining, Sacriledg, Vow-breaking; and I will not deny but
Hereticks may be puniſhed for the like Faults, when they can
be proved againſt them, as they uſe to be againſt other Men:
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> might be Orthodox enough as to any point
of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>2. What <hi>Peter</hi> did by extraordinary Inſpiration and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Infliction upon ſome particular Perſons, is no Rule for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpired
Men to go by in ordinary caſes Magiſtrates being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
young Men and Women, and of ſmall Learning in the
Scriptures, and which is worſe, often wicked Men and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
themſelves by ill Education, Intereſt and Practice.</p>
            <p>This may anſwer to that which was ſaid of them who were
delivered over to Satan, and that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Judaizers,
<hi>I would they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> Gal. 5. 1, 2. <hi>viz.</hi> as
Dr. <hi>Duport</hi> expounded at <hi>St. Maries</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> that God
would cut them off, which yet may be meant of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And the Apoſtle who was no Magiſtrate,
and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. ſuffered Perfecution, was very unlikely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the Galatian Magiſtrates to perſecute. 'Tis alſo certain
that thoſe Judaizers were Men full of moral Impiety, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57859:6"/>
The ſame Anſwer may ſerve for them who were blamed, <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 20. for ſuffering <hi>Jezabel</hi> the falſe Propheteſs to ſeduce; but
to what? <hi>viz.</hi> to Fornication and Idolatry. Moreover, what
Toleration is here blamed, is eaſily proved by this, that the
Chriſtians were then no Magiſtrates, but were by ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to have ſtopped the Mouths, and convinced Gain-ſayers
by the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; and
if the ſeven Churches be prophetical, as hath of late been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well proved, we know who they were that had the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sword, and how well they managed it in the Thyatirian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval;
they were certainly damnable Hereticks, and ſuch as
deſerved to be puniſhed for their innumerable Crimes, if they
had had their due.</p>
            <p>As an <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Argument, let it be conſidered, that the
Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians being accounted Hereticks by
the generality of Men, were very unlikely to have put ſuch a
Sword into the hands of their Enemies, as to teach them that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
were to be puniſhed by the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>And our Saviour Chriſt laying the Foundation of his Church
in his own Blood, and the Blood of his Apoſtles and Diſciples,
was very unlikely to preſcribe a way for the ſhedding the Blood
of his Enemies by a judicial Trial in humane Courts, for that
wherein their Conſciences were thorowly ſatisfied as true and
good, and therefore muſt needs think themſelves honeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and the Chriſtians unjuſt and inhumane, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their preaching up of Meekneſs, and the Example of
the moſt meek and merciful Jeſus, who endured ſuch Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Sinners againſt himſelf; what had that been but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the Glory of Chriſtian Martyrdom, as when our Saviour
biddeth <hi>Peter</hi> to put up his Sword, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 52. he giveth
this reaſon, <hi>For they that take the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword;</hi>
intimating nothing of real worth and excellency in the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Chriſtians by the Sword, if themſelves ſhould take the
Sword as a matter but of <hi>quid pro quo.</hi> He wanted not more
effectual Souldiers to have made uſe of againſt his Perſecutors,
<hi>viz.</hi> whole Legions of Angels.</p>
            <p>II. I argue from Divine Authority affirmatively, Our Saviour
doth condemn Perſecution in meer Cauſes of Religion in that
Parable of the Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and ſo <hi>Chryſoſtom, Auſtin,</hi>
and others both ancient and modern have expounded the place.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57859:6"/>
The Reapers are to be Angels, not Men; thoſe Words, <hi>Let
them grow together,</hi> cannot forbid Excommunication, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Let them grow together,</hi> muſt forbid temporal Exciſion;
and if that ſhould be taken only to ſignify eventually, that
there would be Tares to the End of the World, yet there is a
good Argument in the Caution, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Lest while ye gather
the Tares, ye root up the Wheat alſo;</hi> for though Men may think
that they can diſtinguiſh clearly enough betwixt. Tares and
Wheat in ſome caſes of Hereſy, yet as wiſe Men as they have
found themſelves deceived, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. And let Men give way
to judicial Proceedings in this kind, and the Ignorance and
Raſhneſs of Men will pluck up ten Orthodox Profeſſors for one
Heretick, I am ſure they have hither to pluck'd up many more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now in Civil Cauſes there is not the like danger, wherein the
Criminals own Conſciences accuſe them for the moſt part, and
they cannot deny the juſtneſs of the Law, but deny their own
particular Fact; which made St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſay to <hi>Demetrian,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul
of <hi>Africa, Torqueri enim debui ſi negarem—nunc autem
cum ſponte confitear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>quid tormenta admoves confitenti?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Conſider alſo how our Saviour rebuked his Diſciples when
they called for Fire from Heaven upon the Samaritans who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him not when his Face was as though he would go to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalme,</hi>
Luke 9. 55. <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of;</hi>
i. e. how unſuitable theſe killing Spirits or Diſpoſitions of yours
are to the Times of the Goſpel, or that the Times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
require you to be of other Diſpoſitions; ſee Dr. <hi>Hammond
in loc.</hi> It is manifeſt that our Saviour oppoſeth not fault to fault,
as if the <hi>Samaritans</hi> fault was leſs deſerving Puniſhment; nor
doth it appear that he oppoſeth the private Paſſions of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as Deſire of Revenge, or the like, to the publick Spirit
of <hi>Elias,</hi> but he oppoſeth the Severity of legal Times to the
eminent and extraordinary Grace of the Times of the Goſpel,
as appears by the words following, <hi>ver.</hi> 56. <hi>For the Son of Man
is not come to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them;</hi> as if he had
ſaid, Ye muſt not be ſo prodigal of Mens Lives, now the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the World is come to lay down his own Life for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of other Mens.</p>
            <p>3. Some alſo argue from thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 4. <hi>For the Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal;</hi> where tho
the word <hi>carnal</hi> doth ſignify weak, as the word Fleſh is often

uſed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>gnify Weakneſs, yet the words do imply that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Weapons are ſpiritual and of another ſort diſtinct from
thoſe which worldly Souldiers uſe.</p>
            <p>III. My next Argument is drawn <hi>à Regulâ Fidei,</hi> from the
Rule of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures; it is not proper to ſay that
the Scripture is <hi>Judex Controverſiarum,</hi> the Judg of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
but it is <hi>Norma Fidei,</hi> the Rule of Faith; this I take here
for granted. Now this Rule is too hard to be underſtood to be
introduced into humane Courts for civil coaction by temporal
Puniſhments; for unto the right determination of many Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
in Religion the Scriptures muſt be well tranſlated, various
Copies muſt be conſulted, Figures of Speech muſt be known,
and the Idiom or Properiety of Language with many obſolete Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
the Analogy of Religion, the Context and Coherence
of Words, comparing Scripture with Scripture, are to be
minded, beſides many Prejudices from diverſity of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Authority, Education and Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered;
all which make it ſo eaſy for a Man to be miſtaken, as
to exempt his Error from the cognizance and animad verſion of
humane Courts by civil coercion; they who are the great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
when they pleaſe, and it ſerves their turns, can make
large declamations of the Obſcurity of Scripture, even to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than Blaſphemy and Atheiſm, ſaying it is but a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Rule, a Noſe of Wax, and yet ſee not what a horrible fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and deteſtable Impiety it is to quote Scripture to an fro, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Man ſhall be burnt? as many poor, honeſt, innocent Men,
yea even Women, were in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, after the Doctors
had diſputed of <hi>Hoc est corpus meum:</hi> and whether <hi>Hoc</hi> was an
<hi>individuum vagum</hi> or no? If theſe things had been only ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
they might have been born, but tending to ſo much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
and Murder, they were intolerable.</p>
            <p>Here it's like ſome will ſay, That although ſome things are
dark and hard to be underſtood, yet other things are plain and
eaſy, namely Fundamentals.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Many things may be evident enough to make Men
obnoxious to God's Judgment, which is always according to
Truth, and yet not make Men liable to Mens Judgment, who
ſometimes are very apt to ſwim with the Stream of the Times,
and call every little thing Hereſy, and who cannot as yet agree
what is fundamental, and how many Fundamentals there be.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57859:7"/>
Some ſay that in the Chriſtian Religion there is only this one,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus is the Chriſt, and ſuch other things are only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
without which this Article cannot be retained; but
what they are is hard to ſay.</p>
            <p>Neither can we tell how far God will forbear Mens Miſtakes
about things which in themſelves are damning: ſo was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
if retained as neceſſary, even to the Jews; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. <hi>If ye be circumciſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for I teſtify again to every
one that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to the whole Law;</hi> yet
was this Error tolerated a great while, and ſome judicious Men
think that <hi>Paul</hi> never intended this Sentence to be ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive,
as to anathematize univerſally all, even weak Jews, who
might miſtake out of Tenderneſs and Infirmity. Add to this,
That many underſtanding and charitable Men have thought and
do think, that negative unbelief even of that capital Article,
doth not certainly exclude all the Heathens from Salvation, tho
('tis true) they are therefore out of the way, <hi>viz.</hi> the Road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the authorized way of Salvation, to ſay nothing that (<hi>Acts</hi>
19.) there were ſome called Diſciples, who did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was any holy Spirit or no; which take it in what
ſenſe you will, was requiſite to Chriſtian Baptiſm; and we do
ſee as much difficulty, and there hath been as much Controverſy
in Articles thought fundamental, as in others remoter from
the Foundation; and 'tis certain by 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. that ſome Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are hard to be underſtood, which yet are of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that Mens Salvation are concerned in the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of them.</p>
            <p>IV. My fourth Argument ſhall be taken <hi>à naturâ Fidei,</hi> from
the Nature of Faith, and the things which are revealed, which
are ſpiritual and ſupernatural; Faith is in an eminent manner
the Gift of God; and the natural Man receiveth not ſpiritual
things, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned, and ſo far tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mens ordinary Reaſon, that they cannot be the matter of
humane Courts: for example, take the great Article of the
Reſurrection of Chriſt: Our Saviour's own Apoſtles, who had
converſed with him, and ſeen all his Miracles, and although
he had told them before of his Reſurrection, yet were very
ſlow to believe them who had ſeen him after he was riſen; and
<hi>Thomas</hi> would not believe except he might ſee, therefore theſe
things cannot be the matter of the Magiſtrates Courts: for who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57859:8"/>
will ſay that a Man is to be puniſhed for denying that which is
ſo very hard to be believed by by a meer animal Man, and much
leſs ought a Man to be puniſhed for believing it may be, but part
of a great ſpiritual Truth; I inſtance in this Article, becauſe
it being one of the principal Articles of our Religion, my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
holds <hi>à fortiori,</hi> in matters of leſſer Conſequence, the
Truth and Virtue whereof for the moſt part depend upon this
Article and the belief thereof; which it ſelf depended in great
part upon the Teſtimony of faithful Men, and ſtill muſt be
ſuppoſed harder in that reſpect for them who never ſaw nor
ſpake with the Apoſtles themſelves, who did ſo teſtify, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they who have not ſeen, and
have believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper can ſignify nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Reſurrection of Chriſt be ſuppoſed true and certain,
and if a Man be ſuppoſed to deny the Reſurrection of Chriſt,
he may be ſuppoſed to deny the uſe of Baptiſm and the Lord's
Supper, as wholly ſignifying nothing; and of no uſe or benefit
to him; and much leſs are Men to inflict temporal Puniſhment
upon him, if he misbelieve only as to ſome circumſtances of
them: Shall misbelief of Chriſt's Preſence in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
be puniſhed, and unbelief of Chriſt's Preſence in Heaven
not puniſhable? As one ſaid wittily, that the Italians would
burn a Man for not believing Chriſt's real and Bodily Preſence
in the Sacrament, whenas themſelves did not believe him to be
in Heaven. It is much which <hi>Evagrius</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. That
<hi>Syneſius</hi> was deſired by the Chriſtians to accept of the Prieſtly
Function, although he did not admit the Article of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
nor would be brought to believe the ſame out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
hopes for the future, that he would diſcern the Truth
after a while. Much more are Men to be ſuffered to enjoy their
Lives and Liberties, how indiſpoſed ſoever they may ſeem to
believe out of charitable hopes; when as they may be very
skilful to till the Ground, or exerciſe ſome mechanical Trade,
and ſo be very uſeful to the Commonwealth, and fit to live in
it. Education indeed tends much to make the Truth eaſy to be
believed; but it will do as much for an Error, and ſo far as a
Man believes meerly for that cauſe, his Faith muſt needs be of
little avail, however I will not deny but that with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
as divulging before ſuch Perſons, in ſuch time, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57859:8"/>
ſuch place, with ſuch Impudence and Effrontery, may turn a
Man's Fault into a Crime, and make it reducible to an Error
againſt natural Light; poſſibly a Man may be juſtly puniſhed
for preaching the Truth, as ſuppoſe to rail againſt Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
in a Sermon before the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or call <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
a damnable Impoſtor to the <hi>Grand Signiour</hi>'s face.</p>
            <p>Though the Jews are not within the deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
yet I think this Argument proves that they are to have
their Liberty if they live peaceably, without impudently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>As an additional Supplement to this Argument, let me add
theſe two things.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, That <hi>Faith is the Subſtance of Things hoped for, the
Evidence of Things not ſeen;</hi> and God would have our Faith to
contain in it theſe difficulties, without which it would loſe its
real worth and value, the Object whereof would not be as now
it is, a Touch-ſtone and Trial of true Grace and Godlineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God who ſearcheth the Heart and Reins, and whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is according to Truth, and to whom it is therefore fit the
Judgment of Matters of Faith ſhould be remitted.</p>
            <p>2. The other is, That no Man hath been thought fit to be
puniſhed, for not performing the ſupernatural and perfect Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Chriſt in the moſt perfect way of Charity, in giving
and forgiving, which yet is more neceſſary to Salvation than
Faith is; and therefore why ſhould any Man be puniſhed for
not believing, or believing amiſs, concerning the ſupernatural
Doctrines of Chriſt. As for that which ſome ſay of forcing
the external not internal Acts of Faith, I ſhall ſpeak to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
            <p>V. My fifth Argument is drawn <hi>ab axiomate;</hi> viz. from that
received Axiom, <hi>Dominium non fundatur in Gratiâ,</hi> that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is not founded in Grace; which I know to be chie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly
underſtood of Soveraignty: But there is a gradual Parity of
the Reaſon upon which that Axiom is founded, which may be
reciprocally applied to Subjects: for Pagans though they canno<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
be lawful Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of Chriſt, nor Heirs of
the Kingdom of Heaven, yet they may be lawful Kings, and
lawful Subjects, lawful Husbands, lawful Maſters, and lawful
Poſſeſſors of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates. Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
doth not allow Servants to deny Obedience to their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57859:9"/>
Maſters according to the Fleſh, except they may be made free;
nor Maſters to turn away their Servants contrary to their
Covenants; nor ought Chriſtian Magiſtrates to deny Protection
to whom it is due, though they be not Chriſtians, and perhaps
was due before either of them was Chriſtian. What might a
good moral Heathen ſay, if your Chriſtianity ſtirreth you up
either to tyrannize or to rebel ſor cauſes of mere Religion:
<q>
                  <l>Malo Venuſinam quam te Cornelia Mater;</l>
                  <l>—Si cum magnis Virtutibus affers,</l>
                  <l>Grande Supercilium.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed Errors in Religion may have ſuch intolerable Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mixt with them, as may excuſe if not free both the one and
the other, but I ſpeak of merely Religious Errors.</p>
            <p>It is true wicked Men want the Bleſſing of God to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what they poſſeſs; they have not a ſanctified uſe of things,
but they have a lawful Title, and 'tis as much Theft to ſteal
from them as the beſt Godly Men in the World. And therefore
Hereſy can be no ſufficient ground to diſpoſſeſs any Man of
what he hath, for that can only denominate a Man not Godly or
Gracious, or to be no excellent Perſon; but Men are not to be
puniſhed by the Civil Sword, becauſe they are not excellent
Perſons. It is generally thought that Soveraign Authority,
be it as abſolute as it will, is founded at leaſt in implicite
pact or truſt, which was neceſſary in all Nations before Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
came into the World, and when it did, it was not in the
Chriſtian Power to betruſt that, nor is it likely that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
would truſt their temporal Rights with the contingent
Opinions of their Governours, and therefore that bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
Opinion muſt needs it ſelf be an Hereſy with moral
Impiety mixt with it, and intolerable, as being at Inlet to Thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Tyranny on the one Hand, and Rebellion on the
other.</p>
            <p>And we ſee by Experience that the principal Hyperaſpiſts
and Defenders of the bloody Tenent, I mean the Papiſts, do
not ſtick to rebel againſt, to depoſe and murther Heretical
Princes merely for Religion, as they are encouraged to do by
the Decrees of their Popes and Councils, by which whether
Kings or Subjects they are bound the one to perſecute, the other
to rebel in caſe of Hereſy, though no Civil Injury be offered,
whatſoever Oaths they may have taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57859:9"/>
Here it may be objected, that what Perſecutors do now is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no humane Authority can juſtly make ſuch Acts of
Sequeſtration or Confiſcation, or impoſe Fines, much leſs ſuch
unreaſonable Fines, as they are wont to do for things merely
Religious; what is that elſe but to eſtabliſh Iniquity by a Law?
then they ſay they do not force Men to embrace the Faith, but
puniſh Relapſers. I anſwer, that Men are forced into Opinions
by Law and Fear of Puniſhment, or are ſurprized by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Cuſtom before they are able or fit to judg, or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the plauſible reaſons of abler Men, without hearing
what other Men could ſay to the contrary. And then if any
Man was to be free from Puniſhment before he turned, he ought
to be as free to return, except ſome ſufficient cauſe in Nature
or Reaſon could be ſhown to diſſolve his Right in the one caſe
more than in the other; to relapſe indeed for any by, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ends, is a great Sin in the ſight of God, and fit for him to
judg of, whoſe Judgment is according to Truth. There are
a great many things both in Doctrine and Diſcipline for which
ſome are very zealous, but the greateſt part do ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
or apply their minds to underſtand, that they may turn
and return ten times over, for what they know, and yet the
Zealots will engage them to be of their ſides; as for the great
Perſecutors their talk of Relapſe is but a Pretence, for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
all of all ſorts.</p>
            <p>Again it may be objected, that now the Miniſters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Preferments may be endangered by Heretical Doctrine,
which Preferments are ſettled by Law.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that that Settlement cannot be good ſo far as it
abridgeth any Man, or deprives him of that Right which is
veſted in him by the Law of Nature, which is for the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to have his Freedom in matters of Religion, as well as the
Rector of the Pariſh, who turns a juſt Reward into Oppreſſion
and Bribery, when he uſeth it to another Mans Wrong, what
ever Declamations or Defamations ſuch Men may make for
their own ends. I anſwer further, that the Miniſters ſpiritual
Title is founded in Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> for a certain ſpiritual uſe,
which when the Office proves needleſs or vain, the Title falls of
it ſelf, becauſe the Foundation is ſunk away from it. Now
though in the preſent Objection we ſuppoſe the Office well
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57859:10"/>
founded and terminated in a good uſe, yet in thoſe Offices
which are not eſſential to Civil Government, in order to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Weal of the Publique, but founded in Grace for ſpiritual
ends, the Uſefulneſs whereof is beſt judged by ſuch as are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
the Right is likewiſe beſt judged by them alſo, and to be
reputed but as doubtful and diſputable as to others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
it cannot be an Offence ſo great, and of the ſame
Nature to deny that Right, to oppoſe it or undermine it as it is
to oppoſe Civil Natural Right, which is all the World over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable,
eſpecially when that Religious Right is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely
endangered, and not actually oppoſed by Sedition or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Endeavours without the Command of the Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
paying all Dues in the mean time according to Law.
If a Petition was preferred to the Parliament that our Prelates
who in this Latitude of Dioceſs are indeed Arch-Biſhops,
might be made without any new Ordination, by Patent or
Commiſſion only; and before they enter upon their Offices, be
bound to declare that they do not hold their Juriſdiction in that
Latitude to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> viz. as diſtinct from Presbyters or
ſuch parochial Biſhops as watch over the Souls of the People;
and that the Means of the Church might be brought into a
common ſtock, and more equally diſtributed, as they in their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſhall think fit: the Petitioner in the mean time paying their
Duties till ſuch Determination of the Soveraign Authority. I ſee
not how they could be juſtly blamed for ſuch a Petition.</p>
            <p>VI. My ſixth Argument ſhall be drawn <hi>ab abſurdo,</hi> from the
abſurd Conſequences which follow that deteſtable Opinion of
forcing Mens Conſciences, to ſay nothing that the National
Churches are yet very imperfectly reformed, and therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unlikely to manage the Sword well, ſome of them puniſhing
one thing and ſome another, and ſome of them in the ſame
Church in divers times puniſhing diverſly, as ſeveral parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
get into Authority.</p>
            <p>The Sword will cut only the Honeſt and Conſciencious who
dare not diſſemble; the reſt for the moſt part will temporize
and run home again, when they ſee their Opportunity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
themſelves upon them who were ſo rough with them, and
ſhamed them ſo much; and this temporizing and turning,
merely for lucres ſake and to ſave themſelves, makes Religion
very ridiculous, and weakens the Repute and Authority of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57859:10"/>
Profeſſors, as but Atheiſts and Men of no real Religion; as
truly the Atheiſts have the Advantage of all Men in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
for to be ſure their Conſciences are not ſo ſcrupulous,
but they can ſubſcribe to every thing, they can diſſemble and
comply for their own ends with all Times and Parties, yea and
under the Diſguiſe of Religion help to make all true Religion
odious, by perſecuting Men as Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, not
becauſe they have no Religion, but becauſe they have (as they
think) too much, and are religious in good earneſt, and then
theſe Men applaud themſelves, and think they have got a great
Argument for their Atheiſm, when they ſee other Men make
Religion but a Daunce after the Pipe of the Times.</p>
            <p>Then to force Men to the Service of God makes often but
Hyprocites, whoſe preſence there ſhould be voluntary, or
elſe it is neither acceptable to God, who requires the Heart;
nor to good Men, who muſt needs deſire the greateſt Unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Freedom of Conſent that may be, in their joynt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to the Throne of Grace, which in worldly things is
otherwiſe; for if a Man doth not pay his Debts with a good
Will, it matters not, ſo the Creditor be paid, he is ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Again, except the Perſecutions be more ſevere than good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
can endure to execute, and the Sectaries but few, they
either make Sects or make the Sectaries obſtinate, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
might come to the publique Aſſemblies, were they not
exaſperated by the Violence of them, who would bring them
thither and their Rigioties, when they come there. Now how
ſhould they worſhip God together, who are Perſecutors one of
another, who bite and devour each other, and for that Reaſon
can hardly think one another to be Chriſtians, as indeed a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
will have much ado to defend himſelf to be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
as great a Zealot as he may take himſelf to be for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion. Likewiſe Perſecution gives way to the Rabble to
deride and inſult over Men much better than themſelves, and to
other Men to get ſome part of a baſe Livelihood by informing,
or to vent their private Malice and Revenge upon old Grudges,
and the Heats and Inflammations of Diſputation, that ſo they
may have their Wills over them whom they could not overcome
in Controverſy alſo to the Cruelty of covetous Men, who are
too timerous of loſing their own Preferments, or lurch a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
other Mens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57859:11"/>
Then it often makes Magiſtrates but the Miniſters Executioners,
and that in things which they neither underſtand, nor have
reaſon to underſtand from their Age, Sex, manner of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
meanneſs of Parts, Paſſion, Employment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which
they who ſtudy all their Lives (and as far as we know without
prejudice) cannot agree about, and in things which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
have no reaſon to truſt other Men, as they may in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and Civil Cauſes. In what a horrid manner was Q. <hi>Mary</hi>
abuſed by the Prieſts? And I have read in the Life of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the 6<hi>th,</hi> that when Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> urged him to ſign
the Warrant for the burning <hi>Joan Butcher</hi> an Arian, the King
vehemently refuſed, but at laſt yielded through much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſaying it was <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s doing, and he ſhould anſwer for it,
which the Hiſtorian ſaith brought him under Cenſure, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterward burnt himſelf for an Heretick. If they make
themſelves ſuſpicious who chooſe to ſell their Wares in a dark
Shop, what do they do who ſell them by the Light of ſuch Fires?
The Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> excuſe the Proteſtants
from much of this barbarous Cruelty, confeſſing a little to be
too much. To this Head I may reduce an Argument <hi>ab incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo;</hi>
as that it makes the Magiſtrates to make themſelves par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Factions of their Subjects, and many times run
needleſs Hazards from the ill humours of their People; and
makes the ſeveral Parties to bandie againſt one another, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Government; which will make work enough for the
wiſeſt Man in the World, to know how to govern ſuch unruly
People, who are always ſtriving to get the Civil Sword into
their Hands, not for common Defence, but to oppreſs their
Antagoniſts, often quarrelling about Queſtions, in themſelves
perhaps not very material to Religion, which have been long
diſputed, and may be diſputed <hi>ſine fine,</hi> as the Controverſies
about Free-Will, Election and Reprobation have been. Nor is
it for the Magiſtrates Intereſt, that Men who might live uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in the Common-Wealth ſhould be kept in Jails for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary
notions in Religion, which are uncertain, or manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falſe, ſuppoſing Men to be Churches, or pure Churches,
which are not ſo: like making Shoes for all Men by one Laſt,
and the ſame Prayers to ſerve for Men of contrary Tempers,
and in contrary Circumſtances, as we have lately experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57859:11"/>
It deſtroys trading, when Men cannot go freely about their
buſineſs, and lay out their Stocks with ſecurity; nor dare
Neighbours freely lend Monies to others, for fear they ſhould
be beggared by Religious Fines.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It could not reaſonably be expected that Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from ſuch a huge maſs of Errors and Confuſion ſhould be
perfected <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel;</hi> but though all Reformers cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in their Judgments about ſome weighty things in Doctrine
and Diſcipline, yet except they make account all to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the common Enemy, it is moſt certainly the Intereſt of
all who have departed from the Roman Pontific, to join all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as one Man, (ſo far ſhould they be from perſecuting one
the other) and ſay, <hi>I am as thou art, my Horſes as thy Horſes,</hi>
&amp;c. Which I ſay, not to propagate the true Faith by Force,
but by ſuch honeſt and lawful means as God hath wonderfully
put into their Hands, to defend themſelves againſt their bloody
and implacable Adverſaries, who have lately appeared in their
Colours, and gone about to deſtroy all the Northern Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
with a Vengeance, as it is phraſed by a late learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of a Treatiſe concerning Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws,
who hath diſplayed the Cruelty of their Decrees and Canons,
and clearly proved that there is no truſting to their Words,
Promiſes or Oaths.</p>
            <p>VII. My Seventh and laſt Argument ſhall be taken <hi>ab Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
Eccleſiae affirmativè,</hi> from the Authority of Chriſtians both
ancient and modern; the Antient Chriſtians generally denied
the Perſecution of Hereticks, for at leaſt well nigh the firſt
400 years: for which there are well-known Teſtimonies cited
out of <hi>Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> &amp;c. that Faith is to be perſwaded,
not forced. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is very expreſs <hi>contra Creſconium Gra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Man knew better than he, and ſtrongly proves that the Papiſts
are neither the Catholick Church, nor good Men, for he ſaith,
<hi>Nullis bonis hoc placet, &amp; in Catholicâ;</hi> but it is no wonder for
Apoſtates to alledg the whole Primitive Church as for them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57859:12"/>
when it is all againſt them. This place is quoted by Biſhop
<hi>Jewel, Apol. c. 32. Div. 1. p.</hi> 431. who cites alſo <hi>Chryſoſtom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.

            <p>His Words are— <q>And God forbid we that deſire to reduce
Diſſenters—ſhould ever think of damning, killing, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
any that diſſent in this or any other particular.—And
I think it but Duty to pray againſt that treacherous Proſperity,
which ſhould be able to infuſe any greater Degree of Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Roughneſs into the Minds of Men, whether Sons or
Fathers of the Church, than what I here avow to be ſtrict Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in every Chriſtian.</q> Dr. <hi>Taylour,</hi> ſince Biſhop of Down and
<hi>Conner,</hi> wrote a whole Book <hi>de Libertate Prophetandi;</hi> the like

Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> who rode with King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt
in Diſguiſe, in his Treatiſe of Monarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dedicated to the
King, aſſerts <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> boldly, and perhaps too
boldly; but that it was Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> who carried his Life in his
Hand, and at laſt loſt it in the King's Cauſe.</p>
            <p>See what Dr. <hi>More</hi> in his Appendix to his Antidote againſt
Idolatry, ſaith—<hi>p.</hi> 55. of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu's</hi> offering ſtrange
Fire before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 1. where he compares it with

Oblation of Divine Worſhip to God thereby, do turn the
living God of the Chriſtians (who is Love it ſelf) into the
fouleſt Idols of the Heathens, who uſed to be worſhipped with
the bloody ſacrificing of Men.</p>
            <p>This holds good in Proportion againſt Religious Robbery,
by Fines, or Confiſcation of Goods. Mr. <hi>Day</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 21. ſaith,
that to take away Mens Livelihood is there called Murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To name no more, Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> hath written very
learnedly and ſolidly in Defence of Liberty of Conſcience, in
his Preface to the Hiſtory of the perſecuting Emperours.</p>
            <p>Now from what hath been ſaid, appears the Vanity of thoſe
Men who are content to give a private Liberty, but no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to)

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57859:13"/>
bound to do ſo from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. and not to live like
Atheiſts.</p>
            <p>Others will give Men Liberty, if they will hold their Tongues,
and diſtinguiſh betwixt the outward Exerciſe or Profeſſion of
Faith, and the internal Acts of Faith, which they ſay are not
to be forced; thank them for nothing, did the primitive
Church only tolerate the Thoughts of Hereticks; and who can
think any ſober Man ſhould diſpute of Mens private Thoughts,
which as ſuch no Man can know, or if they be declared and
puniſhed, yet cannot a Man certainly ſay that they are forced,
<hi>viz.</hi> that his Thoughts are altered, for that may be diſſembled,
but all Men have hitherto ſuppoſed that Mens Conſciences are
capable of being forced, that is puniſhed, taking the inward
and outward Acts together as they ought in this Queſtion:
ſome I ſee would give ſuch a Liberty as Antichriſt never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
            <p>Now it may be fit to anſwer the principal Arguments,
which are produced by the Adverſaries:</p>
            <p>1. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. where Magiſtrates are ſaid to be a Terror
to evil-Doers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that Text only authorizeth the Magiſtrate to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
civil Injuries and moral Evils. He may puniſh Treaſon,
Rebellion, Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Hereſies are Works of the Fleſh,
and againſt the Light of Nature, ſuch as the Apoſtle mentions,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. and what they are may be known by their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
there enumerated; that the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of
Errors in the Faith, is plain, becauſe the Magiſtrates were then
Heathens, and he ſeems to ſpeak of the preſent Powers, when
he ſaith (<hi>The Powers that be,</hi> &amp;c.) though 'tis true he ſpeaks of
them rather according to what they ought to be, than accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what they were, as may appear by thoſe Words, <hi>He is
the Miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> which ſome in alledging
this Scripture do little conſider; Doth the Apoſtle make <hi>Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
and <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Commodus,</hi> with the whole Tribe of Uſurpers
Judges of the Faith of Chriſtians? and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> could
appeal to <hi>Caeſar</hi> only, whether there was any Immorality
or Crime in him deſerving Death, as the Jews caluminated.</p>
            <p>2. It is objected, that the King is bound to ſerve God, not
only as a Man, but as a King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57859:13"/>
I anſwer, It is true, and that may be done without Violation
of Conſcience in matters of Faith: He may puniſh Immoralities,
Impieties, and ſuch as ſin againſt their Profeſſion and Conſcience;
He may ſerve God by Protection of his Church, by his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
Munificence, praiſing and encouraging good Chriſtians,
without bribing Men by extravagant Rewards, and Wages,
which bear no Proportion to the Work, by good Perſwaſions
and Advice, by his Wiſdom in calling Councils, and preſiding in
them; and by defending even honeſt and well-meaning Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
from ſuch cruel Men, as put honeſt Men into Bear-Skins,
and then ſet the Dogs on them, and care not what cenſure
they paſs upon Diſſenters: ſo laviſh are they in calling every
little thing Hereſy, Blaſphemous and Damnable; of which
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> complains as too rife in his time, in his Comment on
<hi>Matthew;</hi> but theſe Men learnt that Language of Antichriſt
the old Anathematizer.</p>
            <p>Some urge the Power of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi>
15. 13. <hi>That whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael,
<hi>ſhould be put to Death.</hi> But this is already anſwered in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ.
2<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Some ſay, if Liberty of Conſcience be granted, there will
be Confuſion.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, This is a Selfiſh Objection, for I dare ſay the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector
would not uſe it, if he ſtood in need of Liberty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Unity and Uniformity are good things, but we muſt
come honeſtly by them.</p>
            <p>I am for Unity, but as Bp. <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid, Unity in Verity, and
not in Popery. There is Unity enough amonſt Mahumetans in
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Muſcovie,</hi> and yet in Reality there is the greateſt
Babylonical Confuſion, (that is) mixture of Truth and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
which is the Mother of the greateſt Diſſenſion; for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the Force ſhall be taken off, (as is fit) there muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
be the greateſt Differences; when Men ſhall uſe their
own Judgments from proper Arguments, and not as now one
Judg for them all, right or wrong at Adventures: then it will
appear that he who pretends himſelf moſt infallible, and other
Men to be Hereticks, is moſt deceived and the greateſt D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>4. Some ſay, If Liberty of Conſcience be granted, that then
there can be no National Church.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Was there then no National Church for the
firſt three hundred Years before the Emperor received the
Faith?</p>
            <p>It is true, there can be none with Coercion to it, nor ſhould
there be any ſuch.</p>
            <p>What National Church can there be where the major part of
the Nation are Infidels or Papiſts? What Parochial Church,
where the major part of the Pariſh are ſuch?</p>
            <p>What National Churches can there be, where the Soveraign
Authorities are Infidel or Popiſh? muſt they appoint the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?
They are (ſure) like to be good ones!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> would ſet up no ſuch National Church, but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Arians, Novatians,</hi> and others to have their Churches and
Biſhops. And Mr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith there were Biſhops in <hi>Poland,</hi> but
no Man forced by the Civil Sword, and Biſhops could uphold,
when the Emperours were againſt them: but now we think as
good no Biſhop, if all that live within ſuch a part of the
Country be not forced to be ſubject to him, as being in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>That Church may be ſaid to be National, when the moſt are
of it, and eſpecially when the Soveraign Authority doth
countenance it, doth eſtabliſh and encourage it by favourable
Laws and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>The beſt way to make a National Church, was by ſuch heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Principles as theſe.</p>
            <p>For Magiſtrates to command as little as may be, and People
to obey as much as they can; beſides the Teſt againſt Popery,
to require as little to be ſubſcibed to as is poſſible, and that in
the words of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>To let the Pariſhes where the Fault is committed to examine
and cenſure groſs and notoriouſly ſcandalous Offendors;
and order the needful Rites and Ceremonies of their own
Church, without chargeable Travelling, tedious Suits, crafty
Pleadings, Quirks of Law, and Pettefoggeries, Fees and
Charges, Extortion and Barretry in forreign Courts, who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57859:14"/>
indeed have nothing to do in ſuch matters
not eaſily to impoſe a Paſtor upon a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
without their Conſent;<note place="margin">The Antients thought it fit the Crime ſhould be judged where it was commited.</note> nor a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Biſhop upon his Clergy without
their Conſent.</p>
            <p>And he with the chief of them to ordain Miniſters, and ſee
that they who receive the Magiſtrates Maintenance, do the
Work accordingly. I am ſo far from being againſt Biſhops,
that where there is one, I would there were many more.</p>
            <p>5. Others ſay, Why do they then deny the Papiſts Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>(1.) Becauſe the Papiſts are groſs Idolaters againſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Light.</p>
            <p>(2.) Becauſe the Papiſts will give no Liberty. And if
they do promiſe it and ſwear it, by virtue of the Decrees
of Popes and Councils, they muſt not perform it longer
than the Pope pleaſeth, if they will be true to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>(3.) Becauſe the Papiſts introduce a Foreign Power, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Pope with his Locuſts, to burthen the Land, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munge
the People, and cheat them of their Money; and
therefore no more tolerable than Regraters or Foreſtallers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4.) Becauſe the Papiſts, where they get full Power, are
unmeaſurably cruel. Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> againſt <hi>Militeir</hi> ſaith,
that they have equalled, if not exceeded, the Heathens in
Cruelty, and now of late they have outdone themſelves, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
their Dragooning in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the like in
other places. Otherwiſe,</p>
            <p>The Papiſts are not to be puniſhed as Hereticks: Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and our Kings do expreſly deny, that they puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
them meerly for their Religion: Indeed our Laws
were very cruel againſt them, but never executed in any
very high degree; and as to any great Violence or Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
I wiſh they were ſo moderated as to be fit to be
executed, and with conſideration of all mollifying Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and not one Man to ſuffer for the Offence of
another.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57859:15"/>
IV. My fourth and laſt Concluſion is this, An erroneous
and heretical Conſcience is not free in things meerly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
from the Judgments of God, nor from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Church by Admonition and Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in Cauſes purely Eccleſiaſtical, where there is any
groſs ſcandal or danger by the Leaven of Infection; for theſe
two were the chief Cauſes of Excommunication in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, and that chiefly in caſe of moral Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which now are or ſhould be carefully look'd to by
the Chriſtian Magiſtrate; and therefore we have now ſo
much the leſs need of Excommunication, our Neighbours
who may be offended, being alſo Chriſtians as well as we;
as likewiſe neither have we ſo great need of Deacons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coneſſes,
now our Sick and Poor are provided for by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Magiſtrates; however it is ſtill of very good uſe, if
it be managed by the Church where the Crime is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and who are beſt able to judg, and not by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
nor buoying Men up to Obſtinacy for every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thing, for Fees and Groat-matters. Now though Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
be concerned only in groſs things, yet the
Conſcience is bound to Obedience, not only to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Chriſt, but even to the laudable Rites and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of that particular Church, where a Man liveth or
converſeth, or to the Churches as aſſociated for Order and
Concord-ſake, without Infringement on the Rights of
particular Congregations or Churches, or to the Cuſtoms
of the Church, whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h are uſeful, at leaſt not—hurtful, as
is undeniably proved from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe of Womens
vailing their Faces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and by his Diſcourſe of
ſpeaking with Tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and truly if a Man
doth not profeſs himſelf unſatisfied as to the Lawfulneſs of
ſuch Cuſtoms or Ceremonies, which are pretended to be but
for the Decency of the Adminiſtration of the Service of God,
I for my part take it to be a Peeviſhneſs and Croſſneſs not
to obſerve them; and to be over-ſcrupulous, is but to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,
on the one hand, as ſome under Pretence of
Obedience to Authority in indifferent things, have been too
rigorous, offending as groſly againſt <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57859:15"/>
by Latin Prayers do againſt 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. theſe following
Rules I think would do well to be obſerved concerning indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things.</p>
            <p>1. That we entertain them but as alterable things, in which
Authority may uſe their Liberty to change or aboliſh them,
as the Peace and Edification of the Churches ſhall require,
without fear of offending the Papiſts in making uſe of our
Liberty, which tends rather to do them and ſome carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
good; for they are in manifeſt Slavery to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms;
or however may do our own People good, <hi>viz.</hi> that
they may never come to be enſlaved ſo bad as Papiſts are. <hi>Vide
Theſes Arminii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They be not oppreſſive by their Multitude, as <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
complained of them in his time.</p>
            <p>3. That they be not dubious, nor ſubject to breed Scruples
in Mens Minds, and Factions amongſt them.</p>
            <p>4. Not ſavouring of Superſtition; thus the Primitive Church
was troubled with Judaizers and Gentilizers, according to the
ſeveral Schools out of which the Chriſtians came.</p>
            <p>5. Not wholly needleſs, but ſuch as have ſome convenience.
For indifferent may be conſidered two ways:</p>
            <p>(1.) Abſolutely, as oppoſite to convenient; as to ſay it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
that is, it hath nothing good nor bad in it at all,
ſuch things ſcarce fall under deliberation; and ſurely no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Governours will command any ſuch things in Religion,
though in Civil Things poſſibly they may, as Captains, meerly
to try their Souldiers Obedience.</p>
            <p>(2.) Comparatively, it is indifferent, that is, it is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by any Law of God commanding or forbidding it; and it
may be another thing might ſerve the turn as well, yet there is
ſome convenience in it without doubt; Governours may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in ſuch things; and all People which are concerned and
ſatisfied of their Lawfulneſs, are bound to obey, or elſe all
Government would be vain; yet are ſuch Commands even of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57859:16"/>
Magiſtrates as far as they are concerned (except there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſome Circumſtances which may ſuperadd a civil or moral
conſideration) but directive and paternal, as were thoſe of
the Chriſtian Biſhops and Councils under the Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
the Civil Magiſtrate by becoming a Chriſtian <hi>ipſo facto,</hi>
acquires a Right as the Head of all Political Authority, in the
National Churches, concerning matters of Prudence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
being <hi>Parens Patriae,</hi> and <hi>Pater-Familias;</hi> and may in that
regard be called the Biſhop of his Kingdoms, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
was called the Univerſal Biſhop of the Empire; and as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſay, that every Maſter of a Family is a Biſhop in his
own Houſe. But in ſuch caſes there is no neceſſity to think that
ſuch kind of Magiſtrates Commands muſt always be back'd
with Civil Puniſhments, or elſe Authority is deſpiſed: for God
himſelf, as many Authors do ſay from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 38. doth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
us to do better, when he is yet pleaſed if we do well, and
doth not puniſh us for the breach of all things which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us.</p>
            <p>6. They ſhould be ſuch as agree with the Analogy of the
Chriſtian Religion, with the plainneſs and ſimplicity of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
not ſuch as are fitter for Theatrical Shows and Pomp, to feed
the carnal Eyes and Ears of the People, more than for the
decent adminiſtration of the Service of a crucified Saviour.</p>
            <p>7. We muſt have a care not to content our ſelves with a
meer formal and cuſtomary way of ſerving God in a road of
outward and bodily Obſervations, ſo to flamm off our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
rather than to ſtudy real Godlineſs, Mortification,
true Faith, Love and Charity toward God and Man, above
which if any Man advanceth Rites and Ceremonies, let him
boaſt what he will of his Obedience, he turneth lawful
things into Phariſaiſm: Waſhing of Hands was no unlawful
thing of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>8. I conceive that they are not to be made Conditions
of Communion, ſo as Men may by their Contumacy be
buoy'd up to Excommunication; for that is to declare a
Man to be no Chriſtian, but as an Heathen, which is too
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57859:16"/>
cenſorious to, ſay of one, who for ought you know may
be really unſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of things propounded,
(which are indeed indifferent) or elſe he would willingly
obſerve them; indeed if they be very perſpicuouſly indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
'tis a ſhrewd ſuſpicion of a factious Mind; but
Proof, and not Suſpicion, muſt be the ground of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus have I <hi>pro modulo,</hi> through God's Goodneſs, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſuch Queſtions as do appertain to Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
