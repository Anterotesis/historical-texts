            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE DESIGN OF Part of the BOOK OF Ecclesiastes: OR, The <hi>Unreasonableness</hi> of Mens restless Contentions for the present Enjoyments, REPRESENTED IN AN ENGLISH POEM.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LONDON</hi>: Printed for <hi>Iames Knapton,</hi> at the <hi>Crown</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard. 1691.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE following Poem is not the effect of any extraordinary <hi>skill,</hi> which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to in Poetry; but was first begun merely as the <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>diversion</hi> of a few hours, that I was not capable of spending better. For tho (as you will imagine) I had never made Poetry my business, nor ever intended to try whether I had any <hi>Genius</hi> that way; yet I had <hi>in course</hi> (as others do) read some of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, had <hi>now and then</hi> admired the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the chief of our own Country-men too, had learned <hi>in some measure</hi> how to form Idea's of things in my mind, and got some <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>more general</hi> conceptions of the nature of Poesy; which was enough for my purpose, who propounded but to fill up some odd unserviceable vacancies in my time, and by being imployed about a proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to deceive them more insensibly.</p>
            <p>But I was not long permitted thus quietly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain my self, the same causes, that disabled me for <hi>better</hi> things, increasing upon me and disabling me for <hi>this too.</hi> So, in short, the few indigested materials, which I had collected among my own thoughts in order to a Poem, were thrown by and forgotten. In this state of neglect they lay for some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106350:3"/>
years; till lately, tumbling over some other trifles, I found them in the heap, and could not let them pass, <hi>inconsiderable</hi> as they were, without reflecting upon those circumstances, which put me upon this Essay. At last, being once ingaged in meditation and led by it from one thing to another, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to go on with what I had begun, and <hi>after my manner</hi> to finish it. This I have done, and (which is more) for some reason or other (forgive me, Reader,) have made it <hi>publick</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And here tho I do not discover the reason that hath induced me to publish it; yet if any one shall ever give himself the trouble to guess at it, I will direct his conjecture a little, by telling him, what are <hi>not</hi> the reasons. In the first place, it is not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</hi> For as it is addressed to no great Name, which I might possibly hope to oblige by it; so neither is it calculated to gratifie any particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that I know of. Nor, again, is it <hi>Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For, if that had prevailed in me, I should either have accomplished my self better for such a work; or have attempted something, that I was already better, tho never so <hi>little</hi> better, prepared for; or rather, I should have remained altogether silent, by which Fools are often taken to be wise, and I perhaps might have gained the reputation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self. Nor, in the third place, was it the <hi>importunity of Friends.</hi> For upon supposition that I have any, and that I have shewed it them, it might be demanded, what made me publish it so far as that; and then, if they did give me a complement, it would be but a rude return, for their civility to make them sharers in my faults.</p>
            <p>But to come at length to the thing it self, that is published, I hope it will be found what the Tit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

matters] does declare, viz. <hi>The representation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of part of the Book of Ecclesiastes, or the Unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Men's restless contentions for the present enjoyments, in an English Poem.</hi> And in order to this give me leave to explain this Inscription of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is the representation of <hi>Solomon's design.</hi> A <hi>Translation</hi> turns the Words and Idioms of one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage into those of another. A <hi>Paraphrase</hi> exhibits the thoughts and meaning of an Author, either in the same or any other Language, by making just such additions to the Text, or alterations in it, as are necessary to that end. But <hi>this Poem,</hi> tho it follows the method of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, insists upon his Topicks, and speaks too in his Person, yet does not <hi>precisely</hi> confine it self either to his words or thoughts; but taking the main proposition, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or the like, included in any verse or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, makes bold to represent it after its own manner, frequently inserts what seems convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to introduce or illustrate or prove it, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the other side omits things of less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It represents the design but <hi>of part</hi> of the book of Ecclesiastes. This book I take to be a collection of thoughts concerning Happiness, in which the Penman shews sometimes by what it is attainable, and sometimes by what it is not. In the negative part of it he taxes nothing more than <hi>the eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and immoderate labours of Mankind, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake only for the sake of secular advantages.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having just mentioned the general vanity of the World, he immediately infers the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of this humane Drudgery for the things of it, and of expecting Happiness from them. But lest this unreasonableness should not be evident enough from a bare single assertion of vanity in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106350:4"/>
sublunary things, he enumerates some particular Vanities and Evils, that affect these worldly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; proving, that men get by them, either nothing, or but that which is transient and unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. This he does, as occasion serves, through the <hi>whole</hi> Treatise, but the <hi>principal</hi> place, where he insists longest upon it, and in the most uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted series, is from the beginning to chap. 4. v. 7. and this is <hi>that part,</hi> which I have endeavoured to give the drift and intention of. Indeed he hath not quite left the subject in the following Paragraph, but because he there applies himself to a particular sort of men, that have no Son nor Brother, and because I had occasion too to touch upon the like case before, therefore I have followed him no further.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It represents <hi>Solomon</hi>'s design <hi>in an English Poem.</hi> Here having given it a name according to those notions I have of Poetry, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to let you know, what they are. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imperfect or false they are, they may still discover what I intended by this appellation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>History</hi> I suppose is addressed to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Apprehension: and its Excellencies are, the truth of the Relations; a natural and clear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of things, shewing their mutual connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dependencies; and an apt and lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that leaves sufficient Images of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reader's mind. <hi>Oratory</hi> directs it self not only to the Understanding, but also to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or some Passion apt to lead the Person, in whom it is raised, into assent: and its Vertues are therefore, close and conclusive Arguments; a powerful application to the Love or Hatred, Fear or Hope, Compassion or Severity of the Auditory; a method unforced, and easie to be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

               <hi>language,</hi> that is strong or taking; and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod agreeable to the matter, and falling gratefully upon the ear. But now <hi>Poetry</hi> penetrates through all these to the Admiration also; not only <hi>informs,</hi> or <hi>perswades,</hi> but exceedingly and above all <hi>delights</hi> us too; entertains our Fancy, and curdles our Blood. Here then every thing is more exalted; if the argument be Historical, it is not told direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with contrivance and unexpected surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes (—<hi>Per ambages, deorúm<expan>

               </gap> of manners, and circumstances of things are delineated more fully and visibly; figures are more frequent and bold; and the words are so placed, as not only to sound well, but Musically. This I take to be the <hi>general</hi> notion of Poetry, by which it is differenced from the other ways of writing or speaking. But, after all, it must be noted, that when this general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Poetry is applied to <hi>particular</hi> Poems, it rises or falls, is more or less conspicuous according to their several natures, which to be sure are not all of the same elevation.</p>
            <p>The principal kinds of Poems are, either those that tend <hi>to the advancement of Vertue:</hi> as, <hi>the Epic Poem,</hi> which sets before us the atchievements of those, that have been famous and Heroic, as patterns for others in their circumstances: <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106350:5"/>
which teaches us not to over-value or rely upon temporal advantages, by the falls of those who have had the most of them; to be tender-hearted, by using to pity their misfortunes; to be couragious, by looking at their patience; and to be humble, by observing what the greatest of men may come to: <hi>Ode,</hi> that excites our devotion, by singing the attributes of the Deity; or a laudable emulation, by celebrating the praises of some Worthy: <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> which commends to us the innocence of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life: and <hi>Elegy,</hi> that continues a pious remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the deceased Friends of our Country, of Learning, or our selves: Or those, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that tend <hi>to depress and discredit Vice:</hi> as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> which presents to view the faults of common Conversation: and <hi>Satyr,</hi> which by its arguments exposes, not so much men, as their unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and enormities.</p>
            <p>This <hi>last</hi> is that, which we are now concerned in. I might therefore take this opportunity to tell a long story about that ancient Poem among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which they called <gap reason="foreign">

To this may be added, that the Primitive Satyr of the <hi>Romans</hi> was joined with Music and Dancing, and a great deal of gesticulation; and therefore when it had given occasion to <hi>Livius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi> to introduce elaborate Plays,<note place="margin">

            <p>What this <hi>nature</hi> is, it is now time to enquire.

But, if I may be admitted to deliver my own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion freely, I think neither of them are right. For the first, tho it may be of use in Satyr, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued through the whole work is <hi>Buffoonish,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs rather to the <hi>Exodium</hi> of an <hi>Atellan Fable,</hi> or at best to <hi>Old Comedy.</hi> And the other, tho it hath a place too in Satyr, yet constantly and rigidly prosecuted is the property of an <hi>Iambic</hi> or <hi>Invective</hi> Poem.

They are but <hi>modes</hi> of it, and to be used as occasion requires, sometimes the one, and sometimes the other. For the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, having variety of matters to treat of, cannot accommodate one sort of Satyr to them all, but must make the complexion of it differing according to the quality of his subject. But to give my thoughts, such as they are, concerning the nature of Satyr, and dispatch what I have to say upon it at once;
<list>
                  <item>1. As to the <hi>matter</hi> of Satyr, I suppose it should consist of <hi>Arguments</hi> against something, that is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or unreasonable. I know <hi>Lucilius</hi> brought in an evil allay to that perfection, which he first gave this latter Satyr, by levelling it at <hi>Persons</hi> rather
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106350:7"/>
than <hi>Things</hi>; but in this he must therefore be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed sparingly and with more caution than either he himself, or perhaps <hi>Horace, Persius,</hi> or <hi>Iuvenal</hi> have used. For a Poet in justice (and, I think, he that pretends to discourage Vice, should not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self give an example of so great a one as Injustice) hath no more power over a Man's <hi>Name,</hi> than over his <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Estate.</hi> Besides, since Persons are made the subject of Satyr only as vicious or unreasonable, if the fault can be abstracted from the Person, and that destroyed without hurting this, as it will be more <hi>artificial,</hi> so will it be more <hi>effectual.</hi> For these reasons <hi>Varro</hi> and other considerable men, <hi>by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extreme,</hi> totally disclaimed these Personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of <hi>Lucilius.</hi> For to be impartial, it must be confessed, there are cases, when particular Men may be mentioned; as, when a Man's wickedness is so open and understood, that such liberty begets no new in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amy to him; or so very enormous, that he is become as it were an Outlaw to Vertue and Society, and every Man's prey. For in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances the Poet questionless is permitted the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent use of a common privilege. Therefore I do not say, <hi>Lucilius</hi> is absolutely not to be imitated in this; but, that he is not to be imitated <hi>commonly,</hi> or <hi>without caution and tenderness.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. As to the <hi>manner</hi> of delivering these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, sometimes they ought to be framed by way of <hi>slight and derision</hi>; as, when the thing satyrized hath something in its nature or circumstances so ridiculous, that it <hi>admits</hi> not serious treatment; or so mean and base, that it <hi>deserves</hi> it not.<note place="margin">

                  <item>3. Some crimes ought not to be medled with, but <hi>seriously</hi>; as, when they are so great, of so deep a dye, of such large extent, or dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; that it would be trifling and levity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ridicule them, or correct them in that way, which is fitted rather for peccadillo's and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is folly to pick particular instances of this kind out of <hi>Horace</hi>; since he abounds with them every where. For his thoughts are generally rational, and yet modified with a sort of newness and delicacy almost proper to himself. And in this it is [not rallery and merriment] that he excels <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and all the World beside.</item>
                  <item>6. The arguments must be <hi>intelligible</hi>; else the end of Satyr is defeated. To this purpose they should all look the same way, and be directed to the proof of some one thing, without that intermixture and confusion of subjects, which so much displeases <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Horace</hi>'s third Satyr of the first Book,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Poet. l.</hi> 6, <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> and does indeed not so much benefit or delight the Reader, as lose and perplex him. They should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be free from such needless ostentation of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as renders them obscure, and is commonly said to be <hi>Persius</hi>'s fault.</item>
                  <item>7. In reproving some Vices a special care must be taken not to expose them <hi>too nakedly</hi> or <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly:</hi> I mean such, as either natural Modesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains those, that have not extinguished it, from talking of; or such, as are either altogether, or in any part, to many unknown. Without this care the Satyrist may set his Readers a pattern of such wickedness, as otherwise they had not thought of; or at least familiarize obscenity and roguery to them, and so dispose them for that, which he writes against. Against this rule <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> in many places have sinned beyond all pardon.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, As to the <hi>character</hi> and <hi>style</hi> of Satyr, it is <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>free</hi> above all other; sometimes it is so great, that nothing can be more; sometimes again as low; and sometimes equable and middle to these; it takes allusions, figures, language and the like;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106350:10"/>
sometimes from things of the highest nature o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> esteem; and sometimes from those of the vilest; it accommodates it self to the matter and design in hand, when they require it; and when they do not, to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Poet, or his present dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. From this freedom of style it proceeds, that majesty prevails in <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> and easiness in <hi>Horace</hi>; and yet notwithstanding this that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath some mean strokes, and the other some that are magnifick; as might easily be shewed by particular examples, if there was any occasion.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this vast liberty of style, which may be used in Satyr without the imputation of a crime, I take it to be <hi>a greater degree of excellence</hi> to make it as agreeable to the general notion of Poetry, as the sense and design will permit.</p>
            <p>To apply all this to our purpose; I call the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines a Poem, not only because I intended them to be something <hi>above downright Prose,</hi> but more particularly because I designe them for <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, containing arguments against Men's slavish toils in pursuit merely of the things of this World.</hi> Tho in this it may be I have not <hi>exactly</hi> observed my own rules; because I was confined in the main not only to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s topicks, but also to a serious way of representing them, lest I should be said to play with Scripture.</p>
            <p>But, after all, whether I have hit the right Idea of Poetry, and particularly of Satyr; or whether these Papers do at all answer that Idea, I am not <hi>very sollicitous.</hi> For supposing, that my account is not a true one, or not tolerably copied, and so by consequence that, which I have called a Poem, no such thing; the Criticks in Poetry may then indeed blame me for misapplying and profaning a word, but the thing it self, what other denomination so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106350:10"/>
it must bear, will by this means be out of their jurisdiction, which is no contemptible amends.</p>
            <p>However before it be degraded for this, or suffer upon any other account, permit me to pre-occupy some of those Objections, which upon the whole I fancy are most likely to be made against it; as, 1. That I have altered the nature of some words by making them <hi>proper,</hi> when they are really <hi>appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> and <hi>common.</hi> Thus when <hi>Solomon</hi> says, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from his window a young Man void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov. ch.</hi> 7.</note> how he met the strange Woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have turned the word, which in the Original signifies <hi>young Man,</hi> into a Proper Name, and so call him <hi>Naar.</hi> Of this sort too is <hi>Mocher, Iccar,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That some things do not consist with the truth of <hi>Chronology</hi>; as, where the name <hi>Parush</hi> is made in allusion to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were later than all the Prophets; and where I use <hi>Teveth</hi> for the name of a month, which was not known among the Iews till the Babylonish Captivity. 3. That other things do not agree with the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi>; as Statues mentioned among <hi>Solomon</hi>'s curiosities; and elsewhere imprisonment for debt; which seem neither of them to be used by that People. 4. That I have alluded to events, which I own <hi>not then come to pass</hi>; as the slaying <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prophets, and destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> 5. That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny descriptions of things are <hi>tedious,</hi> especially one or two of War; and that these, beside their dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned length, imply too much <hi>horrour</hi> and <hi>dislike</hi> of it. 6. That I have mis-represented <hi>the sense</hi> of the Text in many places, or at least am singular. Lastly, That the <hi>verse,</hi> but especially the <hi>Rhimes,</hi> are weak, if not blundered.</p>
            <p>My answer to the <hi>first</hi> of these is, That I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable in taking this liberty, because the feigning of Names is common among Poets; because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106350:11"/>
the generality of Names in their first originals were but appellative; but chiefly because having not History enough before <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days to furnish me with instances for my purpose, I was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forced upon this shift.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>second,</hi> That, as to <hi>Parush,</hi> tho there was no Sect of <hi>Pharisees</hi> formed in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, yet in all places and ages, there have been canting <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi> Knaves, who in compliance with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, must keep themselves distinguished and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] from others;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clav. Script. p.</hi> 27.</note> and <hi>Hott inger</hi> tells us out of two good Authors, <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>L'Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reur,</hi> that some have been called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who were not of the Sect of the <hi>Pharisees</hi>: wherefore I take the Name not from the Sect, but from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon signification of that word. As to <hi>Teveth,</hi> that it might be known among the <hi>Iews</hi> before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, tho there was no occasion for the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it before that time: that probably it was known, because they had names for other months, as <hi>Abib, Zif, Ethanim, Bul,</hi> &amp;c. and it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to have names for some,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ex.</hi> 13. 4. 1 <hi>K.</hi> 6. 1. 8. 2. 6. 38.</note> and not for all: that however, granting it to be a <hi>Chaldee</hi> word, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> are but different dialects of the same Language, between which there hath always been a familiar communication: that the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Iews</hi> do not only frequently draw <hi>Chaldee</hi> words into their <hi>Rabbinical</hi> writings, but <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106350:11"/>To the <hi>third,</hi> That, as to Statues,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>fourth,</hi> That <hi>Solomon</hi> being a Prophet, and the things mentioned in the Objection great enough to be worthy the notice of a Prophetic Spirit, it can be no extraordinary fault to make him hint them to the World beforehand.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>fifth,</hi> That, as to the general part of the charge, perhaps the whole Poem may be too long, unless it were better. But as to that particular of War, I thought it was necessary in consideration of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s character, to make him represent it as his great aversion; nay, so great, that when he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to meet with the subject any where, he should scarce be able to contain himself: for his Name, his Wealth, his Enjoyments, his Studies, his Wisdom, all speak him a more than ordinary friend to Peace.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>sixth,</hi> That if I am now and then driven upon a singular interpretation to make the Text coherent, it is no great wonder; since it seems to be almost an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, containing (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> says) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore of a very difficult connection;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </note> and since most Interpreters are singular upon this book. However, to shew how <hi>unwilling</hi> I am to be thought guilty of pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sense of the holy Writings, I have annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Paraphrase and a few Notes, which together, by the Paratheses added to the Text in the former,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106350:12"/>
and by the accounts of more material or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted words in the latter, may serve to shew, that my way of understanding this part of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> which is the ground of the subsequent Poem, is neither very inconsistent nor unreasonable.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>last,</hi> That I take not any Rhimes, much less my own, to be worth either defending or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing. For as I confess my self aukward at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, so am I ignorant of their excellence, when they are made: and as they gave me more trouble, than all the rest, so have they done me that other mischief of cramping my Thoughts, and in great measure spoiling the Verse; tho, as it luckily falls out, a naughty Verse is a less fault in Satyr than in any thing else. Had I been hardy enough like some others (which too late I wish) to have broken a barbarous custom, and freed my self from the <hi>troublesome and modern bondage of Rhiming</hi> (as <hi>Milton</hi> calls it) the Business,<note place="margin">

               </note> which now immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows, had been something better than it is.</p>
            <p>I reckon up these as the most <hi>obvious,</hi> not as the <hi>only</hi> Objections, that can be made; for I doubt not, but either <hi>affection</hi> to the World, which is here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of Vanity, or <hi>disaffection</hi> to him, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the accusation, will soon find out more. But since it cannot be expected, that I should divine or speak particularly to them; in general, Reader, I beg your pardon, if I have obtruded any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you offensive to your taste and better Iudgment. This I hope <hi>the rather</hi> to obtain, because as I was never troublesome to the World by my Poetry <hi>before,</hi> so in probability <hi>never</hi> shall be <hi>again.</hi>

               <p n="9">9. So I was <hi>great,</hi> and increased more than all that were before me in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ([for beside other advantages, which I had above them, I had this] also, [that] my Knowledge <hi rend="sup">20</hi> assisted me):</p>

[At last I had some pleasure indeed to see all my projects effected:] for my heart rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in [the finishing of] all my labour, [as is usual for men to do in the most useless, insipid things]: but this [alas] was my <hi>portion</hi> [the poor reward] of all my labour.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Then [I began to consider further, and] I looked on all the Works, that my hands had wrought; and on all the labour, that I had labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do: and behold all was Vanity and vexation of Spirit [bringing <hi>cares</hi> upon me, and exposing me to <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>danger</hi>]; and there was no [true] profit under the Sun [in these <hi>superfluous</hi> in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. And [moreover when] I turned my self to behold <hi>Wisdom</hi> [and useful Knowledge], and [to compare it with the] Madness and Folly [of the World] (for [who can do this better than I? Or] what can the man do that cometh after the King? [Nothing, but] that which hath been already done):</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then I saw [quickly] that Wisdom excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Darkness.</p>
               <p n="14">14. [For] the Wise man's eyes are in his head, [he sees before him into the distant future State, and accordingly propounds such ends, as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his happiness in it;] but the Fool [and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106350:68"/>
only he] walketh in darkness, [and as it were gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out his way lays hold of these things, that are next him. This is the true difference between them; for as to other things, and particularly their death, their circumstances are much the same;] and I my self perceived, that one event happeneth to them all.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And [therefore with good reason] I [put this Question to my self, and] said in my heart, As it happeneth to the Fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more <hi>wise?</hi> [It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be upon the score of these present objects of Sense, which the Fool is capable of enjoying as long as I. So that] then I [concluded and] said [again] in my heart, That this [violent pursuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wealth and Pleasure] is even Vanity, [and either the effect of Foolishness, or an abuse of Knowledge, which is given for greater purposes].</p>
               <p n="16">16. [If it be said, that these great Works, which I have made, and that Grandeur I have brought my self to, will immortalize my Name in History, and make me famous for Wisdom and Contrivance, and by that sufficiently recompence me for all my pains and care; upon examination I fear it will be found otherwise.] For there is no remembrance of the <hi>Wise</hi> [propagated] <hi rend="sup">21</hi> to [fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture] unknown ages more than of the <hi>Fool</hi>; seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall be forgotten; [either for <hi>want,</hi> or by the <hi>death,</hi> or through the <hi>unfaithfulness</hi> of History:] and [there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now] how dieth the wise man? as the Fool: [he hath no pre-eminence over him in this neither.]</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore I [even] hated life, because the work that is wrought under the Sun, is grievous unto me: for all is Vanity and vexation of Spirit.</p>

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106350:68"/>18. Yea, [for a greater reason still] I hated all my labour, which I had taken under the Sun; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I should leave it unto the man, that shall be after me.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And who knoweth, whether he shall be a <hi>wise</hi> man or a <hi>fool</hi>? [A fool most probably; since the number of such exceeds the contrary. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in a succession of Heirs it must pass through the hands of many. Therefore whether my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and the Fool's, as to the forementioned instances of <hi>present Sense</hi> and <hi>future Name</hi> be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or no;] yet shall he [succeed me and] have rule over all my labour, wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed my self wise [in respect of things] under the Sun, This is also [a] Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, [which affects these products of worldly labours].</p>
               <p n="20">20. Therefore I went about to cause my heart to dispair of all the labour, which I took under the Sun.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For there is a man, whose labour is [done] with understanding, and knowledge, and <hi rend="sup">22</hi> success; yet to a man, that hath not laboured therein, shall he leave it for his portion. This [I say] also is vanity and a great evil [indeed].</p>
               <p n="22">22. [But it is the greater, because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ballance all these evils and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.] For what hath Man of all his [excessive] labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured [for a fancied Felicity] under the Sun?</p>
               <p n="23">23. [Instead of acquiring any great matters, he <hi>loseth</hi> that good, which he might enjoy here:] for all his days are sorrows, and his business grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is even [<hi>a double</hi>] vanity.</p>
               <p n="24">
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106350:69"/>24. <hi rend="sup">23</hi> Is it not [more] convenient for a man, that he should [<hi>moderately</hi>] eat and drink, and that he should make his Soul enjoy [some] good, [so much as is <hi>truly</hi> so,] in his [<hi>regular</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi>] labour? [But] this also I [considered, and] saw, that it was from the hand of God.</p>
               <p n="25">25. For who can eat, or who can hasten here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi rend="sup">24</hi> without him?</p>
               <p n="26">26. For [it is] he giveth to a man that is good in his sight, [true] wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travel, to gather, and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. [In short] this [whole experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment] is also [(for I must repeat it)] Vanity and vexation of Spirit.</p>

So [leaving this argument] I returned and considered [another, being the <hi>seventh</hi> against men's indefatigable moiling for the things of this World, taken from] all [those other] <hi>Oppressions</hi> that are done under the Sun, and [proceed not only from perverted justice in the place of judgment, but from the pride, covetousness, ill-nature, or revenge of those in general, that have power, subtilty, or wealth enough to circumvent and crush their Neighbours. This is a grievous evil indeed, oft bereaves men of all their <hi>dearly</hi> earned gains, and at last leaves them in a forlorn condition, as I my self with a great deal of horrour observed. For] behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no [t so much as a] Comforter: and [the reason was,] on the side of their Oppressors there was power, and [therefore] they had no [one durst be their] Comforter.</p>

                  </gap> generally signifies words of reproof,</hi> that is, of the nature of a Satyr. But whether this be true or no; the <hi>matter</hi> of this book, and especially of that part which I am concerned in, will admit the Epithet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho both the <hi>Seventy</hi> and our <hi>English</hi> Version take <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or, <hi>of the Preacher</hi>; yet I do not believe this to be a true account of the word. <hi>First,</hi> because <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does not signify, <hi>to preach,</hi> but, <hi>to assemble a Congregation together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a thing I suppose not practised, in the Title of a book to express the Author, not by his name, but by some <hi>attribute</hi> or <hi>property</hi>; unless it be in a buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonish way, or when an Author desires to be concealed. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if ever in other cases it is or may be used, yet certainly the attribute or quality substituted into the room of the Author's proper
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106350:73"/>
name ought to be the most <hi>eminent</hi> one belonging to him, and so <hi>peculiar</hi> to him too, as in this case to distinguish him at least from the other Writers of the Bible. But if this rule be observed, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> can by no means be here called <hi>the Preacher.</hi> For in the History of him he is celebrated for his wealth, his knowledge, his Proverbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but scarce for his Preaching. Or however, granting that he may in some sense be called <hi>a Preacher,</hi> this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish him from many of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who preached more properly and frequently, than he did; it being the very business they were sent for, to admonish the people, either of their duty, or the punishments due to their disobedience. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if it be a Common word, it must be a Participle, and agree with some Substantive. This they say is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or some such thing understood: and so the sentence filled up runs thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now what a monstrous arbitrary <hi>Ellipsis</hi> is this? No common <hi>mode</hi> of speaking, no <hi>scope</hi> of an Author, no <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of the sentence determine these to be the words suppressed, any more than many others, that might be inserted.

But to this I answer, that more liberty may be taken in the <hi>body</hi> of a History, where the series of the Story will assist the Reader, than in the <hi>Title</hi> of a book, which is connected to nothing, and ought to be the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thing imaginable.

               </gap> that this was <hi>A. ben Ezra</hi>'s opinion. And the truth is, this mode of expressing <hi>a Wife</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> by a Feminine Verb without putting down either of those words themselves, is neither <hi>unusual</hi> nor <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. Numb.</hi> 26. 59. it is said, <hi>And the name of Amram's Wife was Iochebed, the Daughter of Levi, whom she bare</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>to Levi in Egypt,</hi> i. e. whom <hi>Levi's Wife, Iochebed's Mother</hi> bare. For who else should bear her; tho nothing be said of <hi>Levi's Wife</hi> or <hi>Iochebed's Mother</hi> before? And 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 6. <hi>And he also was a very goodly man: and she bare</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] <hi>him after Absalom,</hi> i. e. his <hi>Mother,</hi> one of <hi>David's Wives</hi> bare him. So here, <hi>And she made King David long to go forth unto Absalom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> she who might
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106350:74"/>
be supposed to have the most interest in <hi>David</hi> and concern for <hi>Absalom,</hi> as being <hi>Wife</hi> to the one and <hi>Mother</hi> to the other. 2. If the Verb be taken <hi>intran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively</hi> according to the opinion of some (tho by the way the <hi>Masorethical</hi> Note on this place does not at all confirm it, as is pretended. For it only says, <hi>that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is found but twice, and in different significations:</hi> and I think <hi>to cease,</hi> as it denotes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 19. <hi>and to make to long,</hi> are significations different enough. But granting that the Verb be taken intransitively) then there is an <hi>Enallage</hi> of the Gender indeed, but nothing understood; and so the words will be construed thus, <hi>And King David</hi> [not, <hi>the Soul of King David</hi>] <hi>longed to go forth to Absalom,</hi> &amp;c. The reason of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be to denote the effeminate tenderness of <hi>David</hi>'s heart, that was quickly moved: just as on the contrary the Masculine Verb joined to a Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of the Feminine Gender in that <hi>Iudg.</hi> 21.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may imply an immodesty or boldness in the Daughters of <hi>Shiloh</hi> above their Sex, who durst come out to dance so publickly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that <hi>Esth.</hi> 1. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may signify, that respect and submission to a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the most heroical Vertue in Womankind: and in that 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 26. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may denote the Manhood used in War. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this reason hold or no, it is most certain that this kind of <hi>Enallage</hi> is common: as is plain parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from this book of <hi>Ecclessiastes,</hi> ch. 7. v. 8. ch. 8. v. 11. ch. 10. v. 15. ch. 12. v. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in short, <hi>Vatablus</hi>'s quotations not at all invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating what I have said, I take <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106350:74"/>
this opinion too, <hi>viz.</hi> that ch. 7. v. 27. of this book it is joined with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Verb of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Gender. But to this I reply, 1. That this is but a <hi>single</hi> instance: for in all other places it hath a Masculine Syntax. Now should an opinion be built upon this one place, or on all the rest? 2. We have seen above, that the <hi>Enallage</hi> of the Gender of a Verb is no very strange thing. 3. It is most probable, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>misplaced,</hi> and that it should be not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For tho Proper Names do not so generally admit of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; yet sometimes they do: as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I must add here, that tho <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not well translated, <hi>the Preacher</hi>; yet I have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> as the name of this book, because it is best known by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I here suppose this Title to be prefixed not by <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, but by <hi>Ezra</hi> and his Assistants, who not only collected the History of the <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Churches, and methodized the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> and other Holy Writings of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but also gave the books, which constitute that Canon of Scripture, their several <hi>Titles.</hi> So that it is as much, as if it it had been said, <hi>These are Words, which we Ezra and the rest of the Great Synagogue have found to be Koheleth's the Son of David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore have put them into the Holy Canon.</hi> For this reason, it coming from anothers and not from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s own hand, I have represented it to his praise and advantage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These words, <hi>King in Ierusalem,</hi> in strictness perhaps ought to be referred to <hi>Koheleth</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi>; yet they may too be allowed to relate to the next preceding word, <hi>i. e. David,</hi> for these reasons.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106350:75"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> because <hi>David</hi> was the first that entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and made it the Seat of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and therefore seems most <hi>properly</hi> to claim this Title. <hi>Secondly,</hi> because <hi>Solomon</hi> was born to <hi>David</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when he was King in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this may be added to distinguish him from those Sons, that were born to <hi>David,</hi> when he was only King in <hi>Hebron. Thiraly,</hi> because whatever is to be said of <hi>Solomon</hi> as <hi>King in Ierusalem</hi> may be more pertinently brought in at v. 12. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and therefore since <hi>David</hi>'s memory may be a <hi>little</hi> more emphatically celebrated here without wrong to his Son, it can be no great fault to do it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows presently after, to agree with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in those two or three other places, where it occurs, signifies <hi>weary</hi> or <hi>tired out:</hi> but here by a Metonymy it must signify that quality, which is the effect of weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, i. e. <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unable</hi> to do those things for us, which men expect from them, defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and not capable of satisfying us, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> explains it.

that signification is <hi>no where</hi> to be found. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> neither in this place is it <hi>true.</hi> For all things are not full of labour: there are such things as idleness, and luxury, and pleasure, which tho men may labour to obtain, yet are not called <hi>labour</hi> themselves; tho the means in the way to them may be full of labour, yet they are not said to be so.

For this is our chief fence and remedy against the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this World: this both teaches us how to obtain the felicities of that to come, and makes us more capable recipients of them: and this is that, which <hi>Solomon</hi> himself else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where so highly magnifies, which he bids us <hi>incline our ear to, apply our heart to, cry after,

lift up our voice for, seek as silver,</hi> and <hi>search for as hid treasure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he speaks plainly of <hi>all things done under the Sun</hi>; that he had sought and searched into them; and that he had found them all to be Vanity. I take this Section therefore to be a <hi>general</hi> Testimony of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s concerning Worldly acquests, which he premises here to a more <hi>particular</hi> one that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next Chapter, and in which he is so universal and earnest, that he is <hi>ready</hi> indeed to fall upon <hi>Knowledge</hi> it self, telling us, that <hi>even it</hi> can <hi>hardly</hi> be excepted, but has a <hi>tincture</hi> of Vanity too, since it is often not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to evil and Worldly ends, but even the best of it attended with <hi>some</hi> trouble and disappointments: but I cannot think he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make <hi>Knowledge</hi> the <hi>direct</hi> object of any part of his Satyr.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> this word points out to us the future State, without relating to any thing; as, in that of</hi> Iob, <hi>Naked shall I return thither</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

it is only that which is <hi>bad</hi> (see Note 7.)
