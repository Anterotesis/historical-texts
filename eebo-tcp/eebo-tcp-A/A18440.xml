            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by clipping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, adding vnto them or diminishing from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And though Luther in his time brought not onely 8. but 8. score interpretations, and your not learned <hi>Claudius de Zanctes,</hi> not 84. but 800. and 4. what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this to diminish the authoritie of the Scripture; This is your reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Luther in his time noted, 8. sundrie interpretations vpon these wordes, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which yet is malitiously gathered of you, and <hi>Claudius Za<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctes</hi> 84. who is an impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Frier, &amp; therfore a liar, and althese alledge the Scriptures: therefore there is no fit trial by the scriptures.</p>
            <p>We leane not so to men, that we in their names, receiue whatsoeuer commeth from them: that is common with papistes, that if any thing be thrust vpon you in the name of any who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you like of: by &amp; by, you admit it, how corrupt soeuer it be. And though Luther had his faultes, yet wee may truely say, that he was a man enlightned by Gods spirit, &amp; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time wherin he wrote, being but newly crawled out of the du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil of your corruptions, in that notable fortitude and zeale, wherin he set himselfe against Antichrist, he may in some sort be wel compared to Elias.<note place="margin">This also he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. where looke for further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare.</note> And in regard that he taught the trueth in the most principall matters of faith and religion, we pardon whatsoeuer he hath vttered against our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (as I haue said before) which you set forth in the 13. &amp; 14. sections, &amp; this shalbe al the answere, I wil vouchsafe to bestowe vppon you at this time for this matter.</p>
            <p>But your conclusion of the premisses is too grosse in the 15. section, where you disfauour the controuersie betwixt vs, concerning our prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to scripture: for we prouoke to God, &amp; you to men. Wee leane not vpon any interpretation, that is priuate, but to that which is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; we refuse not the testimony of men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not against God.</p>
            <p>Further we <hi>shift no scriptures.</hi> For that concerning vowes, it is playne, that the prophet vnderstandeth that place of the worship of God. For as<note place="margin">Vowes.</note> they receiued benefites vnder the lawe, so they vowed according to the holie purposes of their hearts, such sacrifices as were enioyned by the law of God; &amp; what makes this for the maintenaunce of rash vowes in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshippe,<note place="margin">Psal. 76,</note> deuised by sinful men, who neither haue the gifte, nor power to keepe that, which they rashly promise vnto God?

But I know where to haue you. For in times paste, you had some shame, but now you haue gotten harlots forheads.</p>
            <p>That also of S. Iames <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning iustification, not by a dead faith, hath bin made plaine lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g agoe, &amp; not only that, but also that whiche you<note place="margin">The place of Iames concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> bring out of the 2 to the Rom. &amp; againe out of 1. Cor. 7. &amp; Mat. 19. where as you had touched them often. But you make no conscience to blot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per againe &amp; againe, with one &amp; the same thing. You are like vnto flies, who though they iolte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues neuer so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against the glasse, yet they seeke stil a way to get out. We hold according to the doctrine of Iames, that he that shalbe iustified both before God &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, must haue a true &amp; a liuely faith, which we discerne by good workes as by fruits, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dead faith, which hath no fruits of sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; yet we affirme still with M. Fulk, that those works that do proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fullest &amp; truest faith that is, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not iustifie vs in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues before God: &amp; therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Abraham is said to be iustified by works, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he offred vp his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Isaack, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaning is plain, that he was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a iustified ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by that worke, &amp; that was before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not before God, otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as faith being liuely, layeth hold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that righteousnes of Christ, which as the apostle saith, is <hi>neither in vs nor</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>of vs. Him that knew no sin, he made sin for vs, that we might be made the righteousnes of God in him, not in our selues.</hi> Such a faith as is true, &amp; thus layde hold of, the righteousnes of Christ, is said to saue vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it apprehendeth Christ, and all his riches: but such a faith as Iames speaketh of, a deade faith, because it layeth no hold of Christe, cannot saue vs. So Saint Iames speaketh by a certaine <hi>Catachresis</hi> or abusion, setting downe woorkes for an effectuall fayth by woorkes: and faith, for a vayne faith; not that the beginning of Iustification.
<pb facs="tcp:8162:20"/>
should be of faith, and the perfecting of it of our owne workes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. For this were to make God to beginne, and man to ende: when it is plaine, that both to wil, and to performe are onely of God, but because he is in this worke of our iustification, both the beginner and ender, to whom is due the whole glorie. As for your doctrine, it is ful of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, robbing GOD of his glorie, when you attribute the beginning to God, and the finishing to your selues. The other place, <hi>The doers of the lawe shalbee iustified:</hi> shalbe afforded you; when you fulfil the law, you shalbe iustified by it, and then you neede not Christ. Your places of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, and marriage are answeared before. Neither Virginitie, nor mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in themselues can merite any thing before God; before men, they may be preferred one before another, as in some times, and cases, it maye be better for a man, if he haue the gift, to be vnmarried: In other some to be married.</p>
            <p>For Fathers also it hath beene saide before. We reuerence them, and<note place="margin">Fathers.</note> thanke God for these giftes of God in them, that may bring vs any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite or knowledge for the vnderstanding of the worde, but we bring not the spirite of God to be tried by the spirites of men, but all mens spirites to be examined and tried by the spirite of God. Where therefore they faile, it is no reason, that we should fayle with them. The woorde of God must preuayle, that hath confirmed, that amongest his Apostles, there shoulde be no superioritie, <hi>That Peter had no more prerogatiue then the rest,</hi> that that which was saide to one, was sayde to al. And though you would burst for anger, yet M. Fulke shall not be bound to euery thing aduouched by the Fathers, whereof you can bring no sounde proofe or grounde out of the Scriptures.

If you had wonne the cause then you might charge vs with pride, and take the name of humilitie. But if you bee so good a Phisition to knowe the disease of an heretike, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you coulde not finde your owne sicknesse to the death: heretikes in deede, and therefore pride such a disease in you, as meane Phisitions may see and handle, knowen to all that knowe but little, seene to them, that are halfe blind, and apparant to the whole worlde without measure.

For Augustine helde rightly, that actual sinne is voluntary, that is, is done with the will willingly, according as man is corrupted, not onely out wardly but in wardly: euen in those most principall faculties, that do consist in the minde of man. But hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>wil heere of conclude, as these Iesuites doe, that there is no siane committed, but where there is a will and consent ioyned thereunto, they conclude against the word of God. For there are many sinnes of omission, committed through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for which also the lawe of God hath prouided: Yea manie<note place="margin">Num. 15.</note> times we offende, when we thinke we doe wel, and we haue our secrete<note place="margin">Gen. 21.</note> sinnes. Before we haue strength or any wil to wil, there is in vs that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and corruption that sets vs in our selues, guilty and condemned before God, so that from the wombe, we carrie in vs that wooluish nature that prepares vs to the spoyle, although we neuer yet worried anie sheepe. The Scorpion hath his sting within him, though alwaies he strike not, and a serpent though he may be handled whilest the colde hath benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, yet when he is warmed, he can hisse out his venom; and this is verified of vs, though alwayes the vices that are in vs appeare not, till we haue grouth and strength to bring them foorth.

Oxeford, when M. Hanmer was a ladde, it may bee aunsweared that M. Hanmer within a little was as olde as hee; and though hee came to place of countenance, yet hee had more then euer hee deserued: and what if he had had the greatest that might bee? when hee came once to bee a Traytour, enemie to GOD and to his countrey, all those things were iustely loste. As for Maister Hanmers perswasion, that he should haue lefte his vowes to bee performed by others, and haue ioyned with the ministers of Christ, abandoning that Frierlike life, and haue tasted howe sweete the Lorde was, it was a more friendlye and faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, then hee had grace to hearken vnto. If hee had harkened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, hee neyther had died so shamefull a death, nor beene suche an offence to the Churche of GOD.

The order beeing kept according to <hi>Campions</hi> disordered occasion, no bitter inuectiues beeing vsed, but where they were wel bestowed against poperie, treason and rebellion, without odious and vniust accusation, light suspition, or insufficient collection, the issues answering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, and both agreeing with their desperate and wicked practises v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall in their popish profession and godlesse religion. And nowe Syr <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> with a great vaine in his forehead, hee must sit as a Censurer vpon all mens doings, and discerne betweene wise and foolish: hee must iudge euery man and be iudged of none, as if he were in the Popes chaire alreadie, when howesoeuer hee knoweth not himselfe, all men knowe him sufficiently, to bee such a one as the Papistes themselues may be ashamed to auowe for a common honest man.

            <p>Further hee raueth against master <hi>Charke,</hi> for labouring to discredite those bottomelesse Locustes the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and here hee snatcheth at him for accusing the papistes propertie, which is to discredite the men for the doctrines sake, hee woulde haue saide the doctrine for the mens sake, &amp; for that hee confesseth that hee laboured to bring them into discredite, and acknowlegeth those speeches in all hatred of popish practises vttered, hee collecteth that <hi>hatred was the cause against their persons.</hi> As though many of their owne side haue not detested, that newe deuised or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who yet neuer hated the men, and as though a man might not vtter sharpe speeches in detestation of false doctrine, and yet his charitie bee saued towardes their persons: But <hi>heere no learned or common honest man, and much lesse a pretended Preacher of Gods worde,</hi> can <hi>iustifie such vnciuile and outragious tearmes against his brother.</hi> Alacke good man and why so, what waste of suche speech can there bee against such scome and reuedge of Antichriste?

            <p>And as for master Fulke, they that knowe him better then you knowe him, to haue no ruffianlike spirit, although when he is prouoked by your vnlearned and doltish dealing, hee hath that courage, that becommeth a professour and Preacher of the Gospell, to giue you fit names, and to prouoke you again, according to your dealing. And albeit these speeches seuered from circumstances, that went before and after, and from the occasions, that made him to set such wordes downe, seeme odious: Yet they that are wise can consider, that they are much mitigated, when they are considered, as I haue saide. And surely I am perswaded there is no man, that carieth flesh vpon his backe, and liueth as a man amongst men, that can bee so patient, especially with papistes Gods sworne enemies, whose religion as it is grosse, and altogether built vpon superstition and folly, so when they will confirme it, by grosse abusing the scriptures, by palpable ignorance, and wresting the holy scriptures of malice, whiche they peruert to their owne destruction, as they doe in most of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, (though <hi>Gregorie Martin</hi> vniustly chargeth vs with it): then must needes fall out of our pennes and mouthes some such names as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree best vnto them, whether wee will or no, when wee thinke least of them. I write not this, to the ende to defende euery worde that is vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by vs. Wee are men, and because the Lorde buildeth by vs, and mainteineth his worke, it is our speciall comforte, that wee builde vpon the foundation. That which is ours, wee desire not, that it shoulde stande like stuble, it shall perishe but wee shall bee saued. If I should to requite him, gather all that dung and filth together of raylinge and scurrilitie which is in their bookes, I should euen choke the worlde, and infect the uery ayre with their filthe. As the cause is, so are their wordes: and therefore the comparison that hee maketh betwixt D. <hi>Fulk,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:8162:47"/>
               <hi>Allen, Stapleton,</hi> and <hi>Martiall:</hi> is very vnequall, and whatsoeuer such lewde lossels and spende thriftes as <hi>Parsons</hi> is, with the rest of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish crewe, thinke of suche cubbes, yet wee knowe howe to esteeme of them: wee by the grace of God can discerne of them, and what credite soeuer they haue with the worlde, with men that are blinded and partial, that are wont to praise them in those thinges that are most vnworthie of praise, and haue their <hi>Parsons</hi> in admiration, wonder at their giftes, and extoll them aboue the Moone, as if they were dropped out of heauen yet wee knowe that this is a plaine argument of their corruption, and of their shame wherein they so much glory. Neyther is it of any credite with vs, though like Mules thty rub one another, and dub one anothers sayinges: though they haue some good giftes: seeing they are abused by them, and their illusions made the stronger to deceiue others. And in deede the Gentiles of whom this Parson <hi>Parsons</hi> prateth, had a greater measure then euer they had, but all were nothing without Christe.</p>
            <p>As for that hee calleth vs <hi>good fellowes,</hi> wee desire no fellowship with suche: and as for calling M. <hi>Fulke Minister</hi> in derision, whome also from the Censure of one of his owne haire, <hi>hee calleth the poste horse of the Protestants:</hi> agreeing to that popish rayling spirite, whereby he is lead, shall receiue no other answere but this, that M. <hi>Fulke</hi> may reioice to bee so reuiled for the defence of Gods glorious truth. This deserueth no shame, but prayse amongest all Gods people, if in the zeale of God, he bee carried with a swift course, to answere their peeuish and pelting wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: neither doth he it as poste alone. For God be thanked hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and you shall find that there are a great number his inferiours both in yeeres and in the labour of the Gospel, and after him in Christe, that yet may bee your masters, and can answere you well enough. Hee doth it not therefore of penurie, as a man beeing left alone and woulde carry the burden himselfe, but of a readie and forwarde minde to serue the Lorde and his Churche. And if hee alone and so swiftly doe it, belike, if all the Lordes armie shoulde come vpon you, and with prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and furniture, where then woulde bee your glorie? I knowe your prowde Philistinians heart, and the contempt wherewith you reproche the glory of the Israel of God, but bee assured this reaching to God, hee will bee auenged of it. The name of <hi>Minister</hi> beeing the name of his office, hee thinketh no reproche to beare it: but the name of a Popish Prieste, instituted by Anticriste, that hath no ground in the worde of God, but hath written in the forehead of it the
<pb facs="tcp:8162:48"/>
name of shame &amp; blasphemie: this name, if they were not past blushing might make them ashamed. As for <hi>Martiall</hi> the laste of the three, the argument was so grosse, and the defence so blockishe that hee tooke in hande, as might not only prouoke M. <hi>Fulk</hi> to call him by those names, but they might blushe (that I may vse their owne woordes) of suche worshipfull writers. The other contumelie of attributing this to the pot, is iustly returned vpon his owne head. For their Doctors are commonlie fitter for the pot, then for the pulpit, and for an ale benche, or a stage, then for the Church of God: with whome when rayling is done, they are mumme, and the tragidie is ended.</p>
            <p>Now hauing done (as hee saith) with the schollers, he letteth driue also at the Masters, and heere <hi>Caluine</hi> is set in the first ranke: and yet hee might knowe, that how soeuer wee esteeme of <hi>Caluine,</hi> as of an excellent and notable personage, yet wee haue but one master: neyther dyd hee in regarde of those excellent giftes God had bestowed vppon him, euer challenge any such prerogatiue or authoritie: That is only common to popery, and what are his sharpe wordes? forsooth his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie tearme, against the Papistes is knaues. Surely as fitte a name for them in the highest signification as can bee, and specially if a fitte Epitheton bee ioyned to it: and yet who knoweth not, that hath anye skylll either in the Latine, Englishe, Frenche, or Scottishe tongues, that it carryeth no suche odious contumelie with it? If malice had not blinded this mans hearte, hee woulde haue looked vpon his godly and great labours, set foorth with so notable profite of the whole Church of God: he would haue looked vpon his zeale for the glory and maintenance of the truth of God against such enemies and resisters as himselfe and the Papistes are. And what? Bishops forsooth are his Superiours. Still this <hi>Parsons</hi> will bee a beggar, as though M. <hi>Caluine</hi> shoulde confesse that the Pope and his Cardinalles are the Churche, and suche as hee hath proudly aduaunced and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, were his Superiours, which for his heart he cannot proue, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the law of God or man.</p>

But if any thing were so amisse then, they shoulde not muche maruell at it, seeing those that were reformers then, were suche as were but newelie called from Poperie, and therfore could not but smell of that corruption.

I name not their nominalles and realles, nor other light matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Franciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and betwixte those that were of sundrie orders, amongest whom there was, and are manie bitter emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contentions, raylings and strifes, not onelie about apparrell, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meates, obseruing of dayes, diuersitie of orders, but also about the waightiest matters, not one teaching like another, nor the same thinges, but quite contrary. Though therefore Luther in ouer great heat wryteth against the Tygurine Church, and they reproue him againe for it sharpely as he deserued: yet wherefore was this? It was not about any such matter, as could shake them off the foundation of faith: neither doth this burden M. Charke with any shamelesse lie, in defence of Luther. For Luther might bee verye well called by him an holye and Diuine manne,

and by M.

And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you speake affirmatiuely and simplie, that they called him an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heretike,</hi> it is not true: they gaue him warning, hee hauing vniustly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them a damnable sect, that he should take heede least he declared him selfe an Archheritike. And whereas you <hi>farther conclude, that Luther had Diuelles,</hi> which M.

It is therefore no dissimulation in them to blind the people, to giue him that praise that was due to him. For howsoeuer he failed as a man in some pointes of lesse moment, which was no maruel, darknes hauing then couered the face of the earth, &amp; the church of God being grieuously ecclipsed, &amp; he being in a Friers cowle, to the end, it might humble him and those that woulde depend to much vpon his person, to make them rest vppon that infallible rule of the trueth of God; yet in trueth hee was both an holie and Diuine man, of blessed and holie memorie, whose praise we neither can nor wil enuie; endued with most rare and excellent giftes from God, of an excellent vnderstanding, being enlightened of God<note place="margin">

his time liued in out places, laboured and were vigilant in studying the holie Scriptures, not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any professed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ministery, but such as indeuoured to be made fit for the ministery of the gospel by som things that were in those singuler and extraordinarie men? must these therefore be drawen in Rule, and by and by make a newe ministerie and order? so we shoulde not haue so manie notable men, so many names, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but indeed so many orders to hang vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them as vpon their patrons. And in deede this hath alwayes beene the patcherie of Poperie, not to looke to Christianitie, and to follow those things which are to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of vs, but to looke to men, and to beare their profession and order fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, so that among them in trueth Christ was vtterly lost and forgotten, and this they receiued from the Gentiles: as they did most of their things besides. Neither is M.

               </gap>, abandoned their possessions, &amp; prouided as holy &amp; streight rules as euer <hi>Francis Dominicke, or Layolas</hi> coulde haue done. Againe, that which you cite <hi>of Adam for marriage, of Abell for Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes, of Caine for husbandmen &amp;c.</hi> They are not proper. For though these things bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them, yet they were not the beginners, al these were the ordinaunce of God, and forth with after them, they were imitated &amp; followed of men, as giftes of necessity fit for the preseruation and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of men.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Iohn Baptist, M. Charke</hi> collecteth right, and grypeth you to the hearte, and that without any wilfull mistaking of the question. And if it be now a thing indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; not of necssity, I cannot see why you shold vrge with such toughnes, those abhominable orders, as if there were no saluation without them. Neither was Iohn his austeritie &amp; order of life, volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary, but necessary inioined by god, &amp; he sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified to it, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the womb of his mother.

The profession of Christe ouerthroweth no vocation that hath a foundation from the worde of God, seeing therefore that a man in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as wel as out of marriage may bee, and is the Lordes, seeing in the

               </gap>, that God neuer laide vpon them? If God lay anye such thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily vpon any, he giueth them strength, &amp; specially annoynteth them to such a worke: so he did to Iohn Baptist, who if he bee a monke of the new Testament, &amp; a patterne of your Monkes, I am sure your Monkes are as like him as flies and Elephants.</p>
            <p>Whether an heretike or a Sectarie bee all one, let Maister Charke and him trie. But for Maister Charkes argument which yet this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of al things frameth after his owne fashion, he doth nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>at it. For as there is a true difference betwixt a Sectary and a sect, the one being spoken of one, and the other of many, so euery Sectarie is not an Heretike, because he is a Sectarie that hath deuided himselfe by some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler opinion from the common profession of the church: but not an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, vnlesse stubbornely he stand in it, and mainteine it. The like is to be saide of Schisme, which sometimes is taken in the good part: &amp; so they cal vs Sectaries from their Romish church, &amp; Schismatiks, because by the grace of God we are departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Babylon, &amp; from their errors. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Augustine concerning the schisme amongest the Corinthians, fitteth the papists right. For they hold one mans baptisme to be better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, and one mans profession to be holier then another. They deuide the seamelesse coate of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>Christ: &amp; therefore your examples from the Archb of Cantebury, and the rest, are not only fond and malitious, but knauish and slanderous.</p>
            <p>For that whiche hee saieth of the Pharisies, hee aunsweareth him selfe, for though they were Heretikes indeede, compared as Maister Fulke noteth with the Apostles, yet they are not saide to bee sectaries deuyded from the church in respect of the Iewes. For they were the chiefe, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the chaires, as like the papists, as if they had beene spit out of their mouthes.</p>
            <p>That also is foolishe, which he bringeth in against Maister Charks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a secte, when hee saieth <hi>they are a companie that differ in matter or forme of profession,</hi> bringing in Bishoppes, Ministers, Iudges, Lawyers, as if they were Sectaries: when as hee purposely lefte out the chiefe difference, to wit, that they differed in matter of religion. For wee holde not that euery one ought to goe alike: there are and may bee ciuil differences amongst men of sundry vocations, which yet noteth no sects, &amp; thogh papists haue distinguished their greasy ones fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, &amp; to put

But if hee had reasoned truely: wee differ from others, and one from another, in forme of apparrell, in diuersitie of rules, in matter of religion, disagreeing in great points of our owne religion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it were truth: but in deed from Gods word, <hi>ergo</hi> wee are sectaries.</p>
            <p>Whereas hee trifleth in deede childishlye and ridiculously against <hi>M.

vp all and shall stande: <hi>that the Iesuites</hi> (whatsoeuer they prate of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising and whipping themselues) <hi>yet they are no fooles: who haue not bodyes of yron but sensible as ours are:</hi> and therefore will lay on soft e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for hurting them selues.</p>
            <p>Your answere to the last reason, hath no reason nor truth in it: for neither is their order grounded vpon the holy scriptures, nor vpon the practise of any auncient fathers, no more then these superiors whom you name, are superiours of the Church, or haue any ordenance from God: therefore the <hi>Iesuites</hi> order is a sect, separated from Christe, &amp; hath no part of that communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Iesuits</hi> vowed or no, after the example of those here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks that whipped themselues, I leaue to M. <hi>Chark</hi> further to discusse, but I take it, howsoeuer you denie it, that in such hard works they would be loth to adde that, vnlesse they were bound by the vowe of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And herein you cannot denie but they whip themselues as those he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes did, thinking to attaine thereby a greater perfection then others. But <hi>you laugh at</hi> M. <hi>Charke,</hi> and I say you may laugh at your own follie, and your laughter is madnesse: for there were heretikes longe before these were bredd in your boweles that whipped themselues, long before prating <hi>Prateolus</hi> or <hi>Alphonsus</hi> were borne, and you learned to whippe your selues long before, euen of them. Baals Priestes not onely whipped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues but launced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. For the name of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> you stumble at your owne straw, graunting that which is in controuersie, &amp; yet wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as though some wrong were offered you.

Neither can that bee alike, that Christians must doe the like too, if they wil be called christians. For the name <hi>Christian</hi> is a name common to all that are baptised into the common name of Christe, and no name of any sect or order, as is your proude name of Iesuites: For so your order shold haue been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That concession of M.

But if it be a vertue to haue beene a Frier, mee thinkes you shoulde not twyte men with it so repochfully, no more then you should charge Paule to haue been a Pharisey: and if it be a wicked order (as it is) it is no shame to haue left it, &amp; rather to haue chosen in the feare of God to be coupled with an honest wife, then with a lewde strumpet, and thus much in defence of him whom you call my L. of Hereford.</p>

            <p>The fift doctrine, in the like case, is also answered as the fourth, and differeth not from it, being a case wherein <hi>Luther,</hi> one man, teinted with their corruptions, thought that there ought to be a diuorse: but M.

For as true virgines liue to God, and in the time of persecution, haue lesse incombrances to hinder them from the seruice of God, wherein they are saide to liue the life as it were of Angels, so those that are married, that yet serue God, and by his grace are strengthened to goe thorowe all incombrances, beeing instrumentes of an holy seede to God, they bring him a double glory, not onely liuing to his glory, whiche is the principall ende of their creation, whilest they are made his faithfull seruants, but also hauing children, teach them the same faith and obedience.

For there are manye other fitte witnesses, that he nourisheth within his brest, many other monstrous errours. And now when he openly resisted our fayth, by a deceitfull counterfeiting of consente, hee went about to get letters from you, vnder colour whereof, hee might the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filier abuse the rude and simple.
