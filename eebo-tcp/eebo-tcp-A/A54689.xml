            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:104653:3"/>
for the King, or served into his House in kind or money, or by allowances for them, were when they were paid or served, a great burden to the people, and none or very little profit to the King, by that time that the cozening of so many Officers and Servants in his Household, and their appetites of spoyl and rapine by their selling the Kings meat as well cooked and dressed as undressed, and of his bread, beer, and all manner of household provisions to the Inhabitants &amp; Housekeepers in the parts adjacent were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, and other their purloyning and trimly varnished over pilfrings and disorders, which an unpaid Army, and the most unruly Camps of Souldiers or military men are not often guilty of; and the tricks and artifices of the Pourveyors and Managers of the houshold provisions which in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time made a <hi>Kentish</hi> Yeoman plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly demand of her, being in her Progresse, when she was pleased to talk a little with him, and he perceived she was the Queen, <hi>If it were she that did eat up all his Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> which upon her second thoughts and examination, and proof made of the knavery of one of her Pourveyors, procured him shortly after a legal and wel-deserved hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

That such short and now far too little Wages and Salaries to be given to the

Kings Servants in their several honourable and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Stations, would be unworthy for them to receive, and dishonorable for the King to give.</p>
            <p>And that the no inconsiderable summe of money which was yearly and usually saved by the venditions of the over-plus of the Pourveyance or Compositions for them, and imployed in the buying of Linnen and Utensils for the service of the House; the now yearly allowances for Diet to eight principall great Officers and to seaven of the next principall Officers, and what his Majesty payeth yearly to others for Board-wages, and what is enhanced and laid upon him by unreasonable rates and prices, now that his Officers are constrained to buy with ready money, and to pay a barbarous Interest and Brocage to provide it, compared with what he now spends in his private allowances for his own and the Queens Diet, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther few yet allowed Tables, will make a most certain and lamentable demonstration, that the King and his Honor were gainers by the Pourveyance os Compositions for them, and very great loosers by the taking of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And that he did meet with a very <hi>ill Bargain</hi> by the Exchange of his Pourveyance or Compositions for them, for a supposed recompence of <hi>Fifty thousand pounds per annum</hi> intended him out of the Moiety of the Excise of Ale, Beer, Perry, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if the abuses committed by the Servants and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the King within the house were so great, or any thing at all, as is pretended (for as to the Pourveyors, and those that act without dores, the Law hath sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided) they may certainly be rectified and brought under a reformation, without the abolishing or totall taking away of the right use of them, or that which cannot be spared, or by any means be abandoned, but may be dealt with, as we

do by our Wines, Victuals, or Apparel, which as necessaries of life are in their right use to be kept and reteyned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any misusage of them.</p>
            <p>Or if the Pourveyance or Compositions for them were so much diverted from the use intended by them, yet that will not be any reason for the quitting of them without a due exchange or recompence, for that if they were all of them, (as is meerly fained or fanci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It being no Paradox, but certain enough that those seeming, but not reall grievances to the People, by the Kings Prae-emption and Pourveyance, or Compositions for them, have no other source or originall, then the rise and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance of the Markets, and all Victualls and Provisions, by which all the selling and richer part of the People are ten to one more gainers by the Kings Pourveyance or Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them then they can be loosers, and are better able

            <p>For that the totall of the clear yearly profit of the moyety of the Excise, allowed unto the King for the Exchange of his Tenures in <hi>Capite,</hi> and by Knights service, and the Pourveyance or Compositions for them, doth not amount unto (the charges of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection deducted) above <hi>One hundred</hi> and <hi>twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is likely to be lesse by reason of an universall poverty of those which should pay it, making a large accompt of many desperate Arrears, and of the Farmers in many places letting it three or four times over to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under them, and so very much racking and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of the people; (if but half of what is complained of be true) as many private Families do to avoid the gripes of the Excise-men, and the knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Common Brewers, set up Brewhouses for their own occasions.</p>
            <p>And will be too little for the exchange or purchase only of such a principall flower and support of the Crown, and an eminent part of the Royall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the Tenures <hi>in Capite</hi> and Knight-service are, which in yearly revenue yielded him above <hi>One hundred thousand</hi> pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
