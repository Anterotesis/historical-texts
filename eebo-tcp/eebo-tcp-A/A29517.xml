            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>CErtainly if the enjoyment of
Truth be the beginning of our
happiness in this Life, as it is
the perfection of it in the Life to come,
there can be no greater Charity, than
to reduce the Wanderers into the way,
and to undeceive a multitude, which is
always greedy of its own ruin, and fond
of every thing that carries in it any show
or appearance of goodness. For I sadly
observe, that the common people are
exposed to the deceipts of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions:
They are the <hi>Issachars</hi> of the
world; They bear the burthens of all
sorts of people, and few of them have
the Prerogative or the Abilities of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam's</hi>
Beast to reply; <hi>Am not I thine
Ass?</hi> Even in the concerns of Religion,
where we expect, not only the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb facs="tcp:41381:4"/>
but most infallible Truths, are
strange Deceptions and Pious Frauds;
and besides the little talking Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
which fill our ears with the noise
of Sermons, there are greater heads,
and more advanced understandings, who
make it there business to abuse us. The
Lawyers are grown delusive, even to a
Proverb, of which the narrowness of
some men's, and the entangled condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others Estates, is too great an
Evidence. Physicians have their Arts
also, not only of gaining our Coin, but
even of deceiving us into Death it self,
from hard and unintelligible names,
pretending as strange effects. Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
cheat our unwary and too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
beliefs into a conceit of things, of
which they even doubt themselves; and
impose upon us a belief, that arbitrary
events and accidental proceedings of
things below, have necessary causes
above; and the weakness of common
judgments (which are ever more greedy
of things to come, than inquisitive of
<pb facs="tcp:41381:4"/>
things past, or carefull of those present) are
ready to swallow the Predictions of the
most ignorant men, which considering
the independency of their Causes, and
uncertainty of their Events, are only
in the foreknowledge of him, to whom
all things are as present.</p>
            <p>Hence proceed those swarms of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-Tellers,
Geomancers, Diviners,
Interpreters of Dreams,</hi> who possess
the Common people with apprehensions,
that they know all their Fate, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Days, the Casualties of
their Life; and even their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and thoughts of their
hearts: by this means Cheating the
poor innocent Souls into the grossest
Superstition imaginable.</p>
            <p>The consideration of these things
was the great motive, that stirr'd me
up to these undertakings, in which I
design nothing but the good of my poor
illeterate Country-men, whom I dayly
see imposed upon by such Deluders;
<pb facs="tcp:41381:5"/>
who being generally persons of broken
Fortunes, have no other way to defend
themselves from the miseries of poverty;
and therefore are forced to fall upon the
honest plainness of the common people,
and by unnecessary and unlawful Arts,
patch up the breaches of their Fortune.
And herein I hope I shall not in the
least disoblige any wise or good men, of
what Profession soever.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That most men are naturally inclin'd

sort.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Owl, an Hare,
and an Old-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
was Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Emblem of
Superstition; and
truly if we shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
search into
the Causes of this Error, we shall find
that Ignorance, and Dotage, vain
hopes, and foolish fears, groundless
expectations, and casual events have
been the Springs from whence this
folly proceeds, which is the Mother
of all these Omens and Prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is an Ancient observation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41381:6"/>
                     <hi>Primus in orbe Deos timor fecit,</hi> that
fear Deified the first gods, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt there is much truth in the
Assertion.</p>
                  <p>For though the Idea of one true
God, and first Principle of all things,
was at first Imprinted upon the Soul
of man; yet the fears of after Ages
Canonized the multitude of false gods.
It was a Storm, and an Eclips, that
Consecrated <hi>Romulus;</hi> and <hi>Iove</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had not been Master of heaven,
or worshipped upon earth, had not
the terrors of his Thunders advanced
the conceit of his Divinity amongst
the ignorant, and fearful multitude.
Hence <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> observes in <hi>Noct.
Att. l. 5. c.</hi> 12. That he was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worshipped as a <hi>Iuvans Pater,</hi> a
friend and helper of Mankind, but as
a <hi>Vejovis</hi> and hurtful Deity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his image was placed in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
near the Capitol-with darts in his
hand, to signifie his hurtful power;
and therefore for this reason, <hi>Virgil</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41381:6"/>
in his <hi>Georgics</hi> is thought to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
these unlucky gods.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria,

Apollo.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Upon the like grounds the rest of
the Stars, and Planets came to be
reckoned amongst the gods. For the
ignorance of vulgar apprehensions,
conceiting that it lay in their own
powers to disperse what influences
they themselves pleased, were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fearful to offend these new Deities,
which themselves had created; but also
took great care to win and please, lest
they should send forth such Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Emissions of their fury, as might
be to the prejudice of Mankind, or at
least the ruin of those who neglected
their worship. Hence also has it
come to pass, that the Devil himself
has had his Votaries, and hath still
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41381:7"/>
his devoutest worshippers; and the
cause of this has not only been envy,
or desire of Revenge, which prompts
men sometimes to the most wicked
and unlawful practises; but even
cowardly and melancholly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
And this is evident, first, in
that the most ignorant and Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sould
people are most often seduced
by evil Spirits, or by the weakness
of their own imaginations, to practise
unlawful or unnecessary, and fruitless
Arts. And secondly, in that all Witches
and Necromancers in their Spells, and
most solemn Invocation of Devils,
have this, or the like Form. <hi>viz.
Whereas thy Servant</hi> N. <hi>is unworthy
to crave the help or assistance of Good
Angels, give leave to the Daemons,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>to come to my Aid.</hi> And yet these
sort of abused people have as many
Followers as the greatest Divines,
while the ignorant multitude in all
Misfortunes, Crosses and Afflictions,
forthwith make their Applications to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41381:7"/>
them as the most ready help.</p>
                  <p>If the man be sick, where shall he
have his Physick, but from one that
fetches it from behind the Curtain?
If he lie under any Misfortune, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
betakes himself to some Fortune-teller
or Conjurer. If the Cattel be
sick, the White-Witch is presently
sent for to bless it.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore make it my business
to undeceive the people, and to shew
them that it is altogether unlawful to
have recourse to such men, who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
unlawful Arts; that in all Trials,
Crosses, and Afflictions whatever,
God alone is to be sought after, who
suffers us sometimes to fall into grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
troubles, that we may the more
devoutly call upon him.</p>

                  <p>THe want of due consideration

of doubting either the Existence, or

Holy Scriptures, we shall find that
Afflictions come not but by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
or permission of God, who
governs and disposeth all things as
seemeth best to his Godly wisdom, and
so as that the events of all things may
contribute most to his own glory, and
suit best with the happiness of his
Saints. We are assured in <hi>Iob,</hi> that
Afflictions come not out of the dust.
<hi>Iob.</hi> 5. 6. The evil (of punishment)
is from the Lord. <hi>Amos.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>☞ So the Lord smote all the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
of man and beast in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi>
21. 29. So did he <hi>Iehoram</hi> the son of
<hi>Iehosophat</hi> with an incurable disease,
till his bowels fell out. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 18,
19. And so it was the hand of God, that
turned the Pride of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
into madness and brutishness. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.
31. And it was the Angel of God that
smote <hi>Herod,</hi> causing worms to eat
him to death. <hi>Acts.</hi> 12. 23. And all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41381:9"/>
the Magicians and Sorcerers in the
world, nay, nor all the power of Hell
could never have relieved these. It was
only in the power of him that sent these
punishments, to have removed them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, God sometimes
sends out the evil Spirits, as the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners
of his Justice, as he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Egyptians. Psal.</hi> 78. 49.
and so did he send an evil Spirit upon
<hi>Saul</hi> to vex him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 15. But
when he does send out these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his displeasure, they have
their Commissions and Orders, beyond
which they cannot go. The Devils
could not enter so much as into the
Swine of the filthy <hi>Gadarenes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leave of Christ. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 31.
The Witches and Sorcerers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their limits. It is not all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that they can pretend to hurt.
<hi>Lipsius</hi> well observes <hi>Physiolog. Stoicor.

Notes that they can do nothing (<hi>in

give money to their Clients, alter
Judges Decrees, or Councils of Kings:
these <hi>Minuti Genij</hi> cannot do it. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores
Genij hoc sibi asservarunt,</hi> the
higher powers reserve these things to
themselves. Now and then peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there may be more famous and
powerful Magicians, such were <hi>Simon
Magus, Apollonius Tyaneus, Pasetes,
Iamblicus, Odo de Stellis,</hi> that for a
time can build Castles in the air, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Armies, and perform very strange
Feats; but all these end in nothing,
but the power of God protects those
that fear him from their Malevolence,
and destroys all these Phantasms,
bringing their wicked works and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41381:10"/>
the Authors of them to inevitable ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
So it fared with that great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Christian Faith <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
who when he had been several
times bafled by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> at last, to
give further demonstration of his great
power, ascended the Capitol, giving
out to the people, that he would fly
up to Heaven from whence he came,
and accordingly began his flight; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> besought God,
that he would not suffer the world to
be deluded by his Sorceries; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the wicked wretch fell down, and
in his fall put an end at once to his
delusions and his life. So soon can
God bring to destruction all those that
work wickedness. Wherefore he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be sought after, in all our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
and Afflictions; for he alone
can remove them, and will do it, when
he sees it most for his glory, and the
everlasting welfare of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>☞ It is the greatest folly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
upon every Affliction, to run
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41381:11"/>
forthwith to the Devil, or any of his
Instruments: for it is not his will that
we should be cured of any of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies.
He rather glories in deceiving
us, and bringing us into all kind of
misery, both temporal and eternal.
Besides he can neither do us good nor
harm, but by Godspermission, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all good men have ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that whatever befel them, was
the hand of God, yea, even when they
have known, that the most Devilish
instruments have been imployed
against them. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> concludes, <hi>The
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away. Iob.</hi> 1. 21. Histerrors he called the
terrors of the Lord <hi>C.</hi> 6. 4. And he said
also, that God scared him with dreams,
and terrified him with visions. <hi>C.</hi> 7. 14.
He therefore, from whom all things
have their being, their life, and their
motion is to be Supplicated, either to
remove our Cross, or so Sanctifie it
to us, as that it may turn to our health
and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41381:11"/>
Passionate people will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to wait the Lords leasure, and so
grow impatient and furious under the
Chastisements of the Lord, and are
brought to destruction. So fared it
with <hi>Iehoram</hi> the son of <hi>Iesabel,</hi> who
though he knew the Lords hand was
upon him, and his people; yet was he
so impatient to endure the misery, and
so Hellishly enraged, that he Swore
to take away the life of the Prophet
<hi>Eli. 2K.</hi> 6. 31, 33. But the end of this man
was a short life, a troublesom Reign, &amp;
a violent death, for he was trod to death
by the people in the gate, as the Prophet
had foretold. 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 7. 17. But it fell out
much otherwise with the patience of
<hi>Iob,</hi> who never murmured at any of
Gods dispensations towards him, but
contented himself with all occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and humbly submitted to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Chastisements. Him therefore
did God deliver from all his troubles,
and doubled his Blessings and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon, and made his end glorious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41381:12"/>
and happy. The same Method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
is observable in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
who when the messenger of <hi>Satan</hi> was
sent to Buffet him, betook himself to
Prayer, and had deliverance.</p>
                  <p>I shall proceed no further in Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to shew that God alone has the
power to help us in all our needs, and
likewise such a Dominion over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
both good and bad, that without
his permission and assistance they can
do nothing. I only shall mention that
remarkable passage of <hi>Balaam,</hi> whom
<hi>Balac</hi> did imagine to have been endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such a power, as that he could
Bless, or Curse whosoever he pleased.
But the Prophet assures him, that
though he would give him his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Silver and Gold, he could not
go beyond the Word of the Lord, to
do more or less. <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let no man think it lies in the
power of Inchanters, Witches, or any
of their Associates or Assistants, the
Divels, to cure those whom the Lord
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41381:12"/>
hath smitten, or to hurt any person,
whom the Lord is pleased to Bless.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing (as we have
formerly hinted) more usual
with the Common people, than to
ascribe to Witchcraft, all Disasters,

seeming strange to vulgar sense. I shall
therefore in this Chapter give a brief

continued in this posture for some space
together, as if Frozen, generally stark
and stiff, in all parts without Sense or

the Countrey people forth with cry out

wel known in every Village, which
comes by the biteing of a Mad-dog.
The reason of the name is, because
the persons thus affected cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the sight of water, or any liquor,
supposing still they see a Mad-dog in
it. The part affected is the Brain; the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41381:14"/>

Mad-dog, which is so hot and dry,
that it consumes all the moisture in the

of some that died so Mad; and
being Cut up, had no water, scarce
any blood left in them. To such as
are affected with it, the fear of water
begins at fourteen days after they are
bitten, to some again not till Forty or
Sixty days. Some say not only bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but touching or smelling a Dog
infected, may cause this disorder; and
then if any one chance to fall into such
a condition, and the cause not known,
straight-way half of the Parish is
suspected of Witchery.</p>
                  <p>☞ What would the people imagine
of <hi>Lycanthropie,</hi> when they are so
strangely startled at these Diseases?
For in this, as some Physicians tell us,
men run howling about Graves and
Fields in the night, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
but that they are Wolves, or
such like beasts. <hi>Forrestus</hi> in his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servat.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41381:14"/>
de morbis cerebri. lib. 10. cap.</hi>
15. tells of some persons thus distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to one of which himself was an
eye-witness at <hi>Alcmaer</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> a
poor Husbandman that still hunted
about Graves, and kept in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
of a pale, black, fearful and
ugly look. Such belike were the
Daughters of King <hi>Praetus,</hi> who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
themselves to be Kine. And <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> was only trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with this kind of Madness; and
not really Metamorphosed into an Ox:
For the soul of man could not possibly
dwell in so unsutable an habitation as
the body of an Ox; but the proud
King might be seized with so deep a
<hi>Lycanthropie,</hi> as to fancy himself to be
so.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, we often see men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
of very sad and violent Diseases,
as <hi>Convulsions,</hi> Madnesses, and such
like, and some will bite their Tongues
and Flesh, some make fearful Outcries,
and most hideous Shriekings, some
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41381:15"/>
toss themselves violently from one
place to another, some Froth, Gnash
with their Teeth, and draw their faces
into strange and Ghastly Figures. All
which though proceeding from natural
causes; yet the vulgar is ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is something more in the
Case. And that which doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them in this Creed, is either the
want of able Physicians, or their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
to employ them; for they are
seldom so Charitable as to make any
more <hi>Recipe's,</hi> than they receive Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
And so the poor people are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to go to some sorry Emperick, who
'tis certain, will do them no good, and
upon that disappointment, to some
Cunning man, who will do them less.
Nay, it has sometimes happen'd, that
honest persons have been apprehended,
Arraigned, and Condemned, through
the advices of such men; for in these
Cases, it is observable, that a small
matter will beget suspicion, and upon
this multitudes of Proofs shall be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41381:15"/>
muster'd up, and so by a ready Climax,
the poor people are hurried up to the
Gallows it self. Such are the miseries
on the one hand, and the delusions on
the other hand, of the Superstitious,
and ignorant Multitude.</p>

                  <p>THough we do not deny, but
shall hereafter prove that there
are Witches, and Necromancers, and
such persons as make wicked Contracts
with the Devil, to the ruin of their
own souls, and the prejudice of others;

often does much evil of himself (by
Gods permission) without any Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
with any of his forementioned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41381:16"/>
Instruments. For being possessed with
an irreconcilable malice against the
welfare of Mankind, he goes about
continually seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
laying hold upon all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and advantages, whereby he
may tempt or ensnare us, or disturb
our peace, or endanger our Salvation.
Thus in the begining did he enter into
the Serpent, while there was yet no
Witch to employ him. So when God
gave him leave, he entred into the
<hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and stirred
them up to rob <hi>Iob</hi> of his Cattel. He
burnt his sheep also with Fire, blew
down his house upon his Children, and
killed them, and at last most cruelly
tormented the body of <hi>Iob,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
him with Visions and Dreams,
and this without any the least suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Witchery. To these examples
we may add those, whom the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
mention to have been possest in
the days of our Saviour; and the
Herd of Swine which by Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41381:16"/>
were driven head-long into
the Sea by a Legion of Devils. He
does not always need to be set at work
by his Imps and Associates. If God
permit him to afflict us, either for our
sins, or for the tryal of our Faith, or
Patience, or any other vertues; he is
soon ready to execute his Office, and
to proceed to the utmost of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
It is our happiness that he hath

nature kept within its bounds, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
our condition were miserable,
even beyond relief: he would not
stand to tempt some, or more fully to

in him.</p>
                  <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> The manifold evils, which
continually result from wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as</p>
                  <p>1<hi>st.</hi> It draws mends minds from
the true fear of God, making them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41381:18"/>
to stand in awe of the most wicked
and wretched creatures in the world,
the Devil and a Witch, than which
nothing can be a greater dishonour to
the Creator, or more prejudicial to
their own Souls.</p>
                  <p>2. It bringeth honest and innocent
people into suspicion and Infamy, and
the hatred of all the Neighbourhood:
for thus if the Horse be sick, or the Cow
dead, or the Plum-tree do not blossom
kindly, some harmless old woman is
suspected, all her words, postures and
actions are most criticaly observed, and
the most malicious reflections made
of them, that the envy of man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
So the poor creature comes
to be hated and abused, and revil'd by
all that know her, and that infamy
shall never be wiped off her and her
generation, even by her most Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
or innocent deportment of her
whole life. Hence the poor woman
is made miserable all her life, and
her family Scandalous to succeeding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41381:19"/>
Ages, through the unreasonable fears
and jealousies of foolish and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
people. But this is not all; for
it does sometimes happen, that the
suspected (though Innocent) is hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before Authority, and her life not
seldom endangered, sometimes taken
away.</p>
                  <p>The last Argument is from this
consideration, That the Scriptures ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ascribe our pains, vexations, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of body or of mind, losses of
our Goods, or any other Cross what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to Witches; but to the hand
of God, or to men openly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
Robbing, Spoiling, or Killing.
Where it may be demanded why, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is such mention of Witches,
and Sorcery, and the like, unlawful Arts
in the Scriptures, they do not Ascribe
any harms to them, as men do in these
days: and the reason is, for that the
Word of God doth never Assign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to be set on work by him,
which have not power in themselves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41381:19"/>
to do what he employeth them about,
whether it be Angel, Devil, or any
other Creature; and to teach us that
they are but <hi>Satans</hi> slaves, and that
it is not they, that do any, but that
whatever is done, is the work of the
Devil.</p>

1<hi>st.</hi> And first from the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and veracious Authority of the
Word of God, in its forbidding such
Diabolical practices, as in the first
place. <hi>Deut. 18. 10, 11, 12. There
shall not be found among you any one,</hi>
that maketh his Son or his Daughter to
pass through the Fire, or that useth
Divination, or an Observer of times, or
an Inchanter, or a Witch,</p>
                  <p>Or a Charmer, or a Consulter with
Familiar Spirits, or a Wizard, or a
Necromancer.</p>
                  <p>For all that do these things are an
abomination to the Lord: and because
of these abominations, the Lord thy
God doth drive them out <hi>before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which words, it not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that there were those that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped
Idols, that gave themselves to
Diabolical Arts; but also that for these
Abominations the Lord cast them
out of the Land, and introduced his
own people the <hi>Israelites,</hi> strictly
charging them, that they abstain from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41381:20"/>
such unlawful practices. For the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi>
caused their Children to pass
through the fire, not (as some have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed)
to kill them, or burn them: but
only to pay a kind of Adoration to
that Element. For (as <hi>Heurnius</hi> saith)
<hi>Ignem in Vr, Chaldaeorum urbe, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hami
Patriâ adorandum ponit, gravi

And yet this unhappy Custom

<hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Brasilians</hi> do the same,
as <hi>Iohannes Lerius</hi> in <hi>Nav. Bras.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

by a Council held at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
and proved by <hi>Theodoret</hi> to have
been derived from this Custom; is yet
retained and practised amongst those
of the <hi>Romish-Church.</hi> But to leave ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
and return to our intended
Business.</p>
                  <p>We find in the History of the Bible, the
names and practices of certain Witches
and Sorcerers, as particularly we have
the names of those two so famous or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infamous Sorcerers of <hi>Egypt. 2
Tim. 3. 8. Dan.</hi> 2. 2. We read that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
had Dreamed certain
Dreams, at which he was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
and very desirous to know the
Interpretation of them; he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to call the Magicians and
the Astrologers, and the Sorcerers, and
the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> for to shew the King
his Dreams. So we have also accounts
of other Witches, as <hi>Balaam,</hi> of <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
and her Witchcrafts. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 22.
of <hi>Manasses,</hi> who to the rest of his
wickedness, caused his Children to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41381:21"/>
pass through the fire in the Valley of
the Son of <hi>Hinnom:</hi> Also he observed
times, and used Inchantments, and
used Witchcraft, and dealt with a
Familiar Spirit, and Wizards. So have
we Relations of the Sorcery of <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> both in Holy Writ, and other
Authors of good Credit, as <hi>Act. 8. 9.
Eusebius</hi> his <hi>Eccles. Hist.</hi> which
Historian tells us how he came to
<hi>Rome</hi> in the days of <hi>Nero,</hi> and how
strangely he Bewitched the people
from the true Belief by his Magical
Inchantments, till undertaking to flie
in the Air, God was pleas'd, at the
Prayers of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to throw him
down, in which fall he lost both his
Life, and Reputation.</p>
                  <p>To these Proofs we may add, the
Practices of several Witches mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Word of God, as <hi>Exod. 7.
Isaiah. 47. 9. Ezeck.</hi> 21. 21. and
this we read of those that went to
them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7. For so goes the
story of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he <hi>said to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41381:22"/>
Seek me a woman that hath a
Familiar Spirit, that I may go to her,
and enquire of her. And his servants
said to him, Behold, there is a woman
which hath a Familiar Spirit at</hi> Endor.
<hi>And</hi> Saul <hi>disguised himself, and put on
other raiment, and he went, and two men
with him, and they came to the woman by
night.</hi> So also did <hi>Balack</hi> send to <hi>Balaam</hi>
to Curse his enemies. All these things
were done, contrary to the practice
of good <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who, as the Sacred
Records report, put away the workers
with Familiar Spirits, and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 23. 24. These are
such evident Proofs, that it is to me
a wonder that any one, who believes
the Scriptures, can offer to deny the
existence of Witches, though there
were no Demonstrations in these our
days, to evidence this so palpable a
Truth.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the ground of Witchcraft, and of
all the Practices thereof.</head>
                  <p>ALthough some persons, who have
not altogether denied that there
is a certain kind of <hi>Magick,</hi> will not
yet be perswaded, that there is any
Contract with the Devil; we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove that there are
Leagues and Covenants made betwixt
wicked persons and the Devil.</p>
                  <p>1. The word <hi>Chabor,</hi> which is an
Inchanter, signifies one joyned to
another in League and Society; now
we cannot suppose this League to be
with any other than the Prince of
Darkness, who Cooperates with these
his Vassals, in their black and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Actions.</p>
                  <p>2. From the Confessions of some of
these miserable Creatures, may be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41381:23"/>
confirmed what we here go about to
Demonstrate. One <hi>Cyprian</hi> (whether
the Ancient Father, or some other I
am not certain) avouches it from his
own experience, who was himself
once ensnared in an actual and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
Obligation with this black Angel;
but afterward through Gods mercy,
was unloosed from thsoe destructive
Ties. So that as his Experience in the
practice of Magick, rendred him a
sufficient Witness, his Conversion to
Christian Principles should engage
us to Credit what he says, to be
unfeigned.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, the privy marks and
brands of the Beast, found in several
parts of Witches bodies do confirm it;
as also the very Copies of the Bonds,
wherein Witches have confirmed their
League and Familiarity with their
Lord and Master, of such an one
speaketh Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> where the Bond
was thrown amongst an Assembly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together in Prayer and Fasting,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41381:23"/>
for the Deliverance of a Young-Man
thus engaged to <hi>Satan.</hi> But it may be
objected, that such Leagues and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
are not needful, forasmuch as
the renouncing of God, and giving
ones self over to work uncleanness
with greediness, is an implicit Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Devil; and that therefore
no such express Ceremonies are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
for the Holy Scriptures say,
<hi>That his Servant a man is whose work
he doeth, whether of unrighteousness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Death, or of Righteousness unto
Salvation.</hi> To this I answer, that
the Devil, who has ever since his
Fall from his glorious Dignity into
the Regions and power of Darkness,
and Confusion, made it his business
to bring Mankind into the same State
of Damnation; and in that he could
not violate the most Sacred Deity in
his own nature, he has gone about to
deface his Image engraven in the Soul
of man; does delight to imitate God,
yet so as thereby to oppose him: so
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41381:24"/>
that as God makes a Covenant
with his, so will the Devil with his;
as God hath his Seal of Covenant, so
will the Devil have his mark; as God
confirmeth his by Blood, so will the
Devil have blood to ratifie the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which he and his do make.
Hence the Learned have observed,
that in the times of ignorance, when
the Devil had Dominion in the world,
and through Gods permission led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
mens minds in the dark mazes,
and <hi>Maeanders</hi> of Superstition and
Idolatry; those Devil-Idols in their
names, had some resemblance to the
Divine attributes; and also most of the
Rites and Ceremonies used in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
of those <hi>Pagan</hi> gods, were
in some measure (though not obvious
to each capacity) conformable to the
Divine Institutions injoyned to his
people the <hi>Iews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second reason of such Contracts
may be, thereby to aggravate the sins
of Witches, and thereby to engage
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41381:24"/>
them deeplier to do him Service. For
having led them on beyond hopes of
mercy (though that, as the rest of his
principles, be but a Fallacy) they will be
apt to wallow in all manner of Beastial
and Sensual delights, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
plunge themselves into a
desperate confusion; which conceit
is increased and confirmed in them,
when they remember how they have
renounced God, and given themselves
to the Devil; who by this means holds
them fast, and animates them to rush
on, as a Horse into the Battel, to their
utter ruin and destruction.</p>
                  <p>And though it is sadly apparent to
all those, not wholly given over to a
reprobate sense, that this malicious
enemy of our Souls, goes about seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all opportunities to hurt us; yet
so sadly are these poor Creatures stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified,
that they do, <hi>Festinanti Equo
calcaria adhibere,</hi> lay an obligation
upon him that is ready at any time to
attend them. Hence is it that they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41381:25"/>
need not much soliciting to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
forasmuch as they think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to secure themselves of his Service,
and have him always ready to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their commands. This is that
which disposes them to the reception
of such agreements, giving them (as
they fondly conceit) Superiority over
that mighty Spirit that rules in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
though on the Devils part it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
no further, than to a short com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with their humours in order to
his detaining them from works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and a retrospection into their
own wicked and wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>Now although upon consideration
of the infinite loss accruing to men
from such actions, it may seem strange,
nay almost incredible, that they should
be wheedled into such pernicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies;
yet if we have respect
to the lamentable propension of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, to that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the heavenly Injunctions; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41381:25"/>
to the sinful follies proceeding from
such propension, it may be sufficient
Demonstration to enforce us believe
this assertion; that there are such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as (besides that indirect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
Homage which is paid ever
since the loss of integrity) do tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in <hi>Spontaneous</hi> Indentures to the
grand Master of Confusion.</p>
                  <p>No wonder then if the Devil catch
those that greedily come unto his bait,
since his Wiles and Devices are oft
too powerful over the most Righteous
and holy; does he not many times
lie at lurch, and ensnare those who
make it their business to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and if he dares come
into the most Sacred places of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Piety, to molest, no wonder
if he Domineers amongst such Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
and impiety as is usually found
in these Covenanters, who are such as
are involved and swallowed up in
Earthly thoughts and Meditations,
having lost the Sense and Knowledge
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41381:26"/>
of Divine Mysteries; being given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of God unto <hi>Satans</hi> Temptation.
How can they then resist? Man is
weak; <hi>Satan</hi> is strong and subtle, of
great experience in serching out and
prying into the several humours and
inclinations of men, and by his great
skill enabled to make his approaches
to 'em in such a manner, as is most
agreeable to their humours.</p>
                  <p>He can insinuate himself into their
very thoughts, filling them with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and high Imaginations; making
them grow excessively Proud, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and Ambitious, desirous of
vain knowledge; tickling them with
Pride of having Spirits at their beck,
to tell them strange and curious things;
acquaint them with the nature of
Diseases; and work miraculous and
unusual Feats, not practicable by
others; as also to supply them with
what is satisfactory and pleasant to
their unruly exorbitant Passions.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing especially, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41381:26"/>
has caused many to give themselves
over to the Devil; that is, the desire
of revenge. Many Examples may be
had in Authors of this kind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I thought it needless to trouble
my self about setting them down.</p>
                  <p>No wonder then if such disorderly,
violent, inconsiderate persons, so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of attaining their ends, so wholly
estranged from all goodness (as these
who are the subject of our Discourse
usually are) should seek for means to
the Devil, to enjoy their inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
as regarding more the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their present will, then respecting
their future state after death.</p>
                  <p>All these things duly considered,
it is not strange to think, that a man
or woman may be so seduced as to
revolt from God, and make a Solemn
Covenant with his, and their utter
and profest enemy.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That besides the forementioned open

pressure of Guilt with the former. I
mean such as not being in actual
League with <hi>Satan,</hi> perform such
acts of Witchery, as do in a covert
manner imply a League, and Homage
due to their Black Master.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41381:27"/>
These are such as we usually call
White Witches; a sort of Sots who
being Gull'd, and having their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
Debauch'd by Superstition,
do evil that good may come of it,
that is, use Charms, Spells and Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
(all which are of no force
without the Cooperation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)
to remove Distempers, and do
certain Feats in some measure useful
to Mankind, yet of pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to themselves.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected, that 'tis not
probable the Devil will attend those
his immediate Servants without some
security, that they shall continue his.
To this I answer, that they being
something queasie, and not able alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to relish the open Blasphemy,
and Impiety the others run into; he
is contented to deal with them after
another manner, and so lets them think
themselves loose, whereby he holds
them the closer to him. He lets them
make a shew of Religion, go to Church,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41381:28"/>
hear the Word, and otherwise imploy
themselves about seeming good things.
And 'tis indeed a main Policy in the
Mystery of iniquity, to appear in
feigned Colours.</p>
                  <p>For if a man or woman delight to
use Superstitious Forms of words, and
think there is a secret power, and
force in Herbs, Minerals, or the like;
and in using them, desireth in heart
to have the thing effected; the Devil
(who is ready to seize his prey upon
any occasion) to comply with them,
seconds their Designs with success:
and so there is a secret Compact, for
they have desired, and he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and wrought the Business
too.</p>
                  <p>Therefore those that do such things
are in a kind of League with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
though ignorantly they think
otherwise; and as those which in
Christs name Cast out Devils, though
they openly followed not Christ, yet
finding success in their attempts, were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41381:28"/>
not against Christ, nor likely could
speak ill of his power, by reason of
their Secret and implicit Faith, and
Covenant with Christ: so these kind
of persons finding their practices suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful,
are not against <hi>Satan,</hi> nor can
lightly speak ill of his working pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
because of the secret and implicit
League they have with him; more
especially, because of the profit, they
find insuing to them thereby. And so
he rests satisfied with this thought of
them, that they will be surely his,
because they are not against him; as
also he lets them please themselves
with hopes of Gods mercy. For that
in thus doing, they suppose they sin
not, nor are in danger of the Devil,
nor under Gods wrath, as are the
others, who are profest and direct Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of the Black Saint that rules in
the Children of Disobedience.</p>

Efficacy it has, <hi>in attractu similium
per similia, &amp; convenientium per
convenientia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Attraction, or mutual Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Superior with inferior things,
the <hi>Graecians</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we
have Englished Sympathy. So the
Earth (to explain it) agrees with the
Water in that they are both alike cold;
the Water with the Air in moisture;
the Air with the Fire in heat; the
Fire with the Heavens in purity of
substance. Nor is the Fire joyned with
the Water but by the Air; nor the
Air with Earth, but by the Water:
Stones and Mettals have <hi>quid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune</hi>
with Herbs and Plants, these
with Animals, Animals with the
Heavens, the Heavens with Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
these with the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and with God himself, by
whose Image or similitude all things
are made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:41381:30"/>
The Universe is the Image of God,
Man the extract or Epitome of the
Universe, sensitive Creatures of Man,
vegetatives of sensitives. Again,
Plants agree with Brutes in vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Brutes with Man in that they
are both sensitive; Man with Angels
in Intellectuals; Angels participate
of Immortality. Divinity infuses it
self into the mind, the Mind is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Intellect, the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to the Will, the Will to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
this to Common sense, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense to the Senses in particular,
and the Senses to the things sensible;
and such is the Coherency of Nature,
that every Superior power Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
it self to the inferior, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Series of Mediums; and every
inferior being participates of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
by being linckt to the middle
Beings. So that, as things being dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into so wonderful Order, into a
capacity and possibility of effecting
many things so remote, and unusual
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41381:30"/>
to what commonly happens, should
Teach us to be cautious how we ascribe
whatever is something strange, to
Witches and Magical operations; So
it may confirm us, that what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
concerning the Practices of these
wicked people, is nothing but what
is credible enough to be brought to
pass, considering the great power of
these Spirits, and the promptitude of
Nature to strange effects.</p>
                  <p>For 'tis the Opinion of <hi>Cornelius
Agrippa,</hi> that Spirits are easily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to obey the Dictates of Witches
and Wizards, when they make use of
Charms and Incantations. To which
alludes <hi>Virgil,</hi> where he says,
<q>Carmina vel Coelo possunt deducere
Lunam.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>No marvel then if the Devil insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
and twist his power into the
operations of Nature, when he is
sought unto, who is ready enough to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41381:31"/>
dance attendance, though not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                  <p>Magicians affirm, that with certain
ingredients, having a Sympathy with
Supernatural things, rightly disposed
<hi>debitis circumstantijs, partim Physicè,
partim Astronomicè,</hi> Devils may be
drawn to have Commerce with men.
Which is also the opinion of <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
Proclus</hi> and <hi>Synesius,</hi> and of the
whole Platonick School. And <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius
Trismegistus</hi> tells, that an Image
made up of some certain things pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
Consecrated to such a Spirit
(they have names for them too) has
been actuated by some Daemon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
most actions of the Animal life,
as to Walk, Eat, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
affirms the same <hi>in libro octavo
de Civitate Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A stone which is found in the eye
of an <hi>Hyaena,</hi> holden under the Tongue
confers the faculty of Divination. The
stone called <hi>Selenites</hi> does the same.
The stone <hi>Synochitis</hi> will hold a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41381:31"/>
raised up, so that he cannot depart
till Licence from the Magician. <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
the Historian tells of a young
Dragon, that was restored to Life
by a certain Herb applyed to him by
the Old one; and that the said Herb
wrought the like Cure upon one <hi>Tillo.</hi>
And <hi>Iuba</hi> tells likewise of another
man in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that was restored to
Life by the Efficacy of Herbs. It is
to be observed, that it is not my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to ascribe every thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<hi>praeter vulgaria,</hi> to the working
of the Devil and his Ministers, since
Nature is so prevalent as to shew Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles:
but to inculcate to my Reader,
that since Nature is so strong of it
self, the Votaries of <hi>Satan</hi> may play
such Feats, as makes them both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and feared; being aided by
him, who has for many Thousand
years made Remarks, and Collected
the Experiments of this so Self-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Nature.</p>
                  <p>Hence have Witches power to hurt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41381:32"/>
not only in outward Goods, or in our
Bodies; but they can work alterations
in the Mind too, by Spells, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and Fumigations; stir up to
Love, Hatred, Mirth, Sorrow, vex
to Madness it self. Many instances
might be brought to confirm what I
say, but I think it needless to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Examples: I shall therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour to speak something of
the manner how the Devil, at the
Instigation of Witches, enters into
the Bodies of men or women, and
of the Symptoms usually attending
the Possest.</p>
                  <p>First then for the manner. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is wont before he enter into a
man, to appear to him in some Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Deformed Shape, uttering some
strange and uncouth Noises, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he Discomposes the mind of the
man to whom he appears, and disturbs
his reason, working a Confusion and
Disorder in his Intellectuals; and after
having so done, enters into the Soul,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41381:32"/>
now made a <hi>Chaos</hi> fit for the Reception
of him who is the grand Author of
Irregularity. This he most what
does in the Night, or in Dark, Shady
places, frightful by reason of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
solitariness.</p>
                  <p>He enters into the Possest thorough
the Nose, or Mouth, or Ears, like a
thin subtle Wind, or a Mouse, or
some such little Animal; sometimes
in their sleep, producing in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
terrible Dreams, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
those Devilish Phansies in
them, when the Vitals are Disentang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from the Bonds of sleep, sometimes
his Entrance is accompanied with a
Chilness, and stupifying Cold through
the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>The effects which unclean Spirits
produce in these <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> are noted
unto us by Holy Writ; which are as
follows,</p>
                  <p>They sometimes make them Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and Disobedient, backward to
all that is good, and very desirous of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41381:33"/>
doing Mischief to them, whom the
Devil stirs them up to hate; as appears
by <hi>Saul</hi> in the First Book of <hi>Kings.
Chap.</hi> 18. who continued obstinate in
persecuting innocent <hi>David,</hi> all the
days of his life.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they make them Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
as in <hi>Matthew</hi> 17. he did his
son, who came and prostrated himself
to our Blessed Saviour, saying, <hi>Lord
have mercy on my Son, for he is Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are made Dumb, as appears
from the 8<hi>th. Chap.</hi> of St. <hi>Matthews
Gospel,</hi> where 'tis mentioned how one
spoke to our Saviour, saying, <hi>Master,
I have brought my Son unto thee, who
is possest with a Dumb Spirit;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from St. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 11. others
they deprive of Sight, as <hi>Mat. Chap.</hi>
12. others are Torn and Tortured in
their Bodies, and Pine away; are
brought into Fury, so as to fall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
upon any they can come to:
some are struck with Infirmities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41381:33"/>
by any Natural means, and
of this sort was that Woman, held
with a Spirit of Infirmity Eighteen
years, healed by the Great Physician
of our Souls, <hi>Christ Iesus. Luke
Chap.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Thus may be observed, both from
Sacred and Profane Authors, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and lamentable Mischiefs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon poor Man by the Devil,
both in entring into and possessing
their Bodies, as these before alledged;
and in the external Assaults made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Temporal goods, of which
the History of <hi>Iob</hi> is a sufficient Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:
as also by his mediate practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
performed by his Vassals the
Votaries afore-mentioned; whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he more frequently imploys
to execute his fierce Wrath upon Men.
What power these have to do Mischief,
<hi>Isidore</hi> tells us <hi>in lib. 8. Etymologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum.

                  <p>THat wicked Spirits have power
to vex and disturb men, we
have proved before by divers Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
as also Cursorily shown the
manner and most notable effects of
such Practices: I now intend to say
something of the Symptoms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may be known whether the
distresses wherewith a person is
Afflicted, ought or can be ascribed to
Natural Causes, or proceed from the
Supernatural Operations of the Devil,
and his Ministers.</p>
                  <p>These Supernatural Operations are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41381:34"/>
reducible to two Heads; either to
the immediate working of <hi>Satan,</hi> or
to the mediate of Witches.</p>
                  <p>For the first, as it is unusually, so
is it the more discernable when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
the Parties thus effected being
Tormented with such Paroxysms, and
violent motions in their Bodies, as
cannot but give us to understand,
what is the Lord of that Misrule, of
those stupendous Gambols. As to the
Second; Those Perturbations and
Mischiefs occasioned by Witchcraft,
are not so pernicious, as being more
twisted and assimulated to natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Hence many Diseases and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
which do owe their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
really, and truly to the Impiety
and Revengeful Dispositions of
Witches, are mistaken to be nothing
but the Disorder of the Natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Body, or the Casualties
of Fortune, or rather Crosses designed
to befall, by foreseeing Fate.</p>
                  <p>But to go on with our intended
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41381:35"/>
Discourse; when Learned Physicians
can find no probable reason or Natural
Cause of such Grief, Pangs, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Vexations as the Patient does
endure, it may lawfully be Concluded
that the Devils Finger is there. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Bewitched have sometimes a
great swelling and heaving in the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thence passing to the Throat, ready
to stop their Breath; set their Teeth
together, shake sometimes the Leg,
sometimes the Arm, sometimes their
Head; will hold their Arms or Legs
so stiff, that they cannot be bowed.</p>
                  <p>As also when no Rules of Art or
Experience can do good, but that the
Disease grows worse thereby.</p>
                  <p>When the Distressed Vomit up
Crooked Pins, Iron, Coales, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
Nails, Needles, Wax, lumps
of Hair, Knives, and such like, which

                  <p>THough some have made use of
that common Distinction of
good Witches and bad, to encourage
themselves, and make some pretences
for their recourse to those unlawful
means, yet therein they do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves; forasmuch as all
sorts of Witchcraft and Divination
are forbidden by the Holy Scriptures.
It is expresly forbidden, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 31.
and in <hi>Saul</hi> we have an Example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
who added to his sin of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
that of enquiring at one
that had a Familiar Spirit; yet the
profit he received was (but what is
gotten by such as forsake the only true
God, and run after lies?) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his own and his sons De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41381:36"/>
Learned men of all sorts, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemn this running to Wizards,
as St. <hi>Augustine in libro 10 de Civit.
Dei;</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> in his <hi>Daemon, lib.</hi>

nay <hi>Hippocrates</hi> an Heathen; some
Schoolmen hold it to be an Apostasie,
as <hi>Aquinas, Bonaventure, Albertus,</hi>
and the Edicts of Emperours, and all
Learned Divines in our days hold it
unlawfull; the Dead by Writing, and
the Living <hi>Vivâ voce</hi> in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it at all consistent with reason,
to assert the Lawfulness of enquiring
of Witches, or using of Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
For God who by his Eternal
Wisdom created the World at first,
does still by his power preserve the
works of his Creation, and provides
for every man, according to that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein he sees it convenient to
set him; he has given him such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunites,
as to make himself happy

Has taught him to limit his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

him the Race wherein he is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Course; and so ordered, that
the Restraints are void of all unsweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that a man is never more a
Captive, than when he lets himself
loose to Carnal Delights. So that
a man in using the said Practices, does
<hi>ipso facto</hi> declare himself a Rebel

this ever put in practice, but by such

                  <p>The Arguments brought for the

in our days by its
being mixt with so
many Superstitious
Fopperies, is become
suspicious and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Ridiculous,
was at the first a thing of great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and worthy of the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
may be concluded from
the acceptance it found with the most
Famous men in the very Infancy of
the World; we may ascertain our
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41381:40"/>
selves, that it was in use before
the Deluge, from <hi>Genesis</hi> 18, where
'tis said that <hi>Noah</hi> enterd the Ark on
the seventeenth day of the second
Month, and came out again (the
Waters being gone from the face of
the Earth) upon the 27<hi>th.</hi> day of
the second Month, in the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
That it is of great Antiquity
cannot be denied, but who was the
first Author of it is uncertain: yet
its Credible that it begun at <hi>Adam,</hi>
and was continued by his son <hi>Seth,</hi>
and Communicated to Posterity; in
reference to which Opinion, is the
Story of <hi>Seth's</hi> Pillars; which Pillars
were made (by reason of what they
had heard from <hi>Adam, (viz.)</hi> that
the World should be Twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
once by Water, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by Fire) to preserve the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to them that were to replenish the
Earth after the Deluge. One of which
Pillars was remaining in <hi>Iosephus</hi> his
time, as himself Testifies, <hi>in lib. Antiq.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41381:40"/>
cap.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.
But whether this of the
Pillars be Fabulous or no, it matters
not; it is probable enough that it
was found by the Ancients before
the Floud, whose Lives usually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to some Hundreds of years,
a thing very requisite to the perfection
of Astrology; nor was it (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in its purity) a Study unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
those Noble Spirits. In fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of this Opinion may be alledged
that of <hi>Iosephus</hi> in <hi>cap. 7. lib.</hi> 1. that
<hi>Enoch</hi> left a Treatise of Astrology, or
(Astrology being taken after the
Modern distinction) of Astronomy;
which Treatise is yet extant in the
Kingdom of the Queen of <hi>Sheba. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
quotes it in the 4<hi>th.</hi> and 15<hi>th.</hi>
Books <hi>de Idololatriâ,</hi> and in the Book
<hi>De habitu muliebri. cap.</hi> 3. where he
proves by many Arguments, that those
Books are not spurious; and answers
the Objections that may be brought
against it. Now although the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41381:41"/>
of so Learned a man as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
may stop the Mouths of all such
as out of Sceptical humour may doubt
the verity of what has been said; yet
considering the great propension of
some in our days, to overthrow what
ever sound Doctrine has been Taught
by the Seniors, aswell in Knowledge
as in years, I shall endeavour to prove
the Antiquity of this most Noble Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by force of reason.</p>
                     <p>1. 'Tis not to be doubted that <hi>Adam,</hi>
both by reason of his Converse with
Angels, and his great insight into the
Intellectual world; as also by his
great knowledge of this visible world,
which render'd him capable of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
things, and giving a name
sutable to the Nature of each thing;
could understand the Nature of the
Heavens, and those splendid Bodies
there placed. So that if the Beauties
of those Caelestial Bodies were Created
to be subservient and significant to
the Microcosm, it is most certain, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41381:41"/>
the first Father of Mankind, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it.</p>
                     <p>2. The Wise and ever-True God,
who has made every thing good, and
made nothing that was not to be of
some use to man, did certainly never
design that Glorious and Resplendent
part of the World, to be for a Gazing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock
only, and not have operation or
influence in the Universe; but to be
a general Moderator, and Govenor
of the most material Actions of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bodies; as he has reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the disposing of that pure substance
Mans Soul. And such was his love
to Mankind, that he would Teach a
way whereby they might recover part
of that Knowledge was lost in the
first Mans Fall and Disobedience. And
so that they might not be altogether
involved in Darkness, and obscurity of
what was to come, he Taught them
to Read in that Great Volume, the
Chief Contingencies of their Life.</p>
                     <p>That what I say is probable, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41381:42"/>
not an Idle Whimsey of some Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
Brain, is Manifest from the
common Opinion of Learned Men
among the <hi>Iews, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi>
and others, who call the Heavens a
Sacred Book, wherein by those Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Letters (the Stars) may be read the
Events of things below. The Learned
<hi>Origen,</hi> upon this place of <hi>Genesis,
Et erunt in signa,</hi> Affirms, that the
Stars were placed in this Order in
the Heavens for no other end, but to
shew, by their diverse Aspects and
Figures, whatever is to happen while
the World indures, aswell in general
as in particular; yet not so, as that
they were the Causes of all these
things: never any such thing came
into the Thoughts, much less into
the Writings of this Learned Man.
For as the Prophecies that are Written
in Books, are not the Causes of those
Events, which they foretel shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
but only the Signs; so may the
Heavens be (says he) very justly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41381:42"/>
called a Book, wherein God hath
Written, <hi>all that is, hath been, and
hereafter shall be.</hi> And for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
Cites a Passage out of a Book
called, <hi>Narratio Ioseph,</hi> wherein the
Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> giving his Blessing
to all his Children, upon his Death-bed,
says, <hi>Legi in Tabulis Coeli, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>

whence the same <hi>Origen</hi> concludes

reason that the Stars are disposed and
Ordered there in the Form of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.

                     <p>After the Deluge, and the scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
abroad of the Nations through
the whole Earth, the Study of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
was likewise Dilated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                     <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> too were Skill'd in

observed the Course of the Sun, and
Taught the reason of the Eclypses,
as <hi>Eudemus</hi> says in his Astrological
History. <hi>Anaximander Milesius</hi> was
the Scholar of <hi>Thales;</hi> he Taught
that the Earth was the Center of the
World, and that it was Round, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Tropicks, and Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and Taught to know the hours
by the shadow of a <hi>Gnomon.</hi> Scholar
to <hi>Anaximander</hi> was <hi>Anaximenes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesius,</hi>
who found that the Moon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
her Light, and that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Earth betwixt her and
the Sun, was the Cause of her several
<hi>Phases.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Anaximines,</hi> was <hi>Anaxagoras
Clazomenius,</hi> who Taught that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41381:48"/>
Moon had in it Hills, and Valleys
like the Earth, and that it was Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
that the Milky-way was made
by the Reflection of the Sun-beams;
that Comets are a Mass of Sparkles,
proceeding from the Stars by reason
of their Swift Motion, Collected into
one Body; that the Sun was a Round,
Fiery-Ball, Bigger than all <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi>
that the Heavens consisted of
Stones, which yet do not Fall, by reason
of that extraordinary Circumgyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the second year of the
Seventy Eight Olympiad he foretold,
that one of those Stones should Fall
from Heaven, which (they say) came
to pass by the River <hi>Aegos</hi> in <hi>Thrace;</hi>
how much he was addicted to the
Study of Astrology, may be gathered
from this; One asking wherefore he
was Born, he Answer'd, to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the Sun, and Moon, and the
Heavens; to another, Rebuking him
for neglecting his Temporal Affairs,
and asking him if he did not care for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41381:49"/>
his Country, he said, Yes I do, (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Finger towards Heaven)
that is my Country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is accounted Chief of
the <hi>Italian</hi> Sect, and Taught in <hi>Italy</hi>
at the same time as <hi>Anaximenes</hi> did
at <hi>Miletum:</hi> he is said to have first
observed the Obliquity of the Eclyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
he Taught that the Earth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
about the Sun, betwixt <hi>Mars</hi> and
<hi>Venus.</hi> After him was <hi>Democritus</hi>
the <hi>Abderite,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentinus.</hi>
About the first year of the

<hi>Meton,</hi> the Son of <hi>Panthias,</hi> who
Corrected the <hi>Calendar,</hi> and found out
the <hi>Circulum decennovennalem,</hi> which

Ten years to the Computation of
<hi>Harpalus,</hi> who made Tables for
Eight years only. This period of
Nineteen years was approved of by
<hi>Euctemon</hi> and <hi>Philippus,</hi> as best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the Differences in the Sun
and Moons Revolutions. <hi>Eudoxus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Aeschines</hi> a <hi>Cnydian,</hi> a

opposed the Period found by

                     <p>The Multitude of Commentators
upon <hi>Aratus,</hi> will not permit me to
leave him out of the Roll; he Wrote

About the time of <hi>Ptolomaeus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphus,
Conon</hi> Flourished, who
Collected the Eclypses of the Sun

gave Notice of the Star called <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices</hi>

                     <p>About Ten years after him, that
is, about the Hundred and Fortieth
Olympiad, <hi>Aristarchus Samius</hi> was
Famous for his skill; he followed the
Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras, Philolaus,</hi> and
those who held the Motion of the

Correspondence with the Natural.</p>
                     <p>The Study of the Stars being now
grown to a considerable height, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Admirers in all the succeeding
Ages, who imployed their Parts and
Indeavours in these Speculations; and
by their Industry and good Fortune,
dayly added to the perfection of this
Art: It were easie for me to give you
their Names in Order, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to the world, to these very
times: but that not being so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I shall only speak something of
the Progress it had, after the Decay
of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, and then
proceed to my intended Discourse
against the Defamers, and Blots to
this Noble Science, the Judicial
Astrologers.</p>
                     <p>I begin with <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> otherwise
call'd <hi>Flaccus Albinus;</hi> not that he
was the first, who deserved to be taken
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41381:51"/>
Notice of, but for Brevity; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would Swell my Volume to too
large a Bulk to name them all. He was
Born in <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Yorkshire-Man,</hi> and
was made Deacon in the days of <hi>Offa</hi>
King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and was by
him, for his great Learning, but
especially for his skill in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Studies, sent over to <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great, and was by him Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
received, and staid with him in
<hi>France.</hi> He got a Grant for an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Taught the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Sciences there. He Read Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and shew'd
him the use of an <hi>Ephemeris:</hi> 'twas
he gave the <hi>German</hi> Names to the
Winds, by which our seamen at this
day call them.</p>
                     <p>This Kings being delighted so much
with Astronomy, brought him into
a good Esteem with the then King of
<hi>Persia,</hi> who was addicted the same
way, and sent him a Dial for the
Planets, which was no less pleasant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41381:51"/>
for the Favour, than useful for the
Ingenuity of it.</p>
                     <p>Not long after lived <hi>Maimon</hi> King
of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who caused <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
System to be brought in again,
after it had been a long time neglected.
And Contemporary with him, was
the Famous <hi>Albumassar</hi> the <hi>Arabian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year One Thousand Four
Hundred and Eighty, flourished <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius
Ficinus,</hi> at first a great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of Judicial Astrology; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Reading that Excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of <hi>Picus Mirandula's,</hi> concerning
that Subject, he Recanted, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the Fopperies thereof by the
reasons of so Learned a Man. He
was a Great man in all Learning,
but an especial Admirer of <hi>Plato's</hi>
Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>In the year One Thousand Five

Mathematician to <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of

From the year of Christ One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and Five Hundred, Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Studies grew so Universal, and
well known in the Christian World,
that it is impossible to Rank them
in their Order, the Multiplicity of
Students bringing Confusion into the
History. I shall only therefore speak
of the most Renowned. And first,
with <hi>Ioannes Wernerus</hi> a <hi>German,</hi>
who was a most exact Observer of
the Starry Motions; he Wrote two
Books of the Motion of the Eighth
Sphere.</p>
                     <p>Contemporary with him was <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Blanchinus,</hi> and about sixteen
years after was <hi>Ioannes Staeflerus;</hi>
he Taught the way to make an <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe,</hi>
and Wrote Commentaries upon
<hi>Proclus</hi> his Sphere; he was sometimes
Master to <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
that Learned man with such
a Love to Mathematicks, as endured
to his very Death. After him was
<hi>Henricus Baersius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Cario,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:41381:52"/>
both very Eminent men, of which
the first Wrote a Book of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and use of the Quadrant, the
other of Practical Astrology, and
<hi>Ephimeredes</hi> for many years.</p>
                     <p>In the year One Thousand Five
Hundred Thirty Six, <hi>Nicolaus Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
became Eminent, one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
many Opinions that had for a
long time been Buried in obscurity;
of whom <hi>Ismael Bulialdus</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena's</hi>
to Phylosophical Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
gives this Character, <hi>Nicolaus
Copernicus vir absolutae subtilitatis,
non solum observator fuit, sed etiam
Hypotheseos Pythagoricae antiquae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staurator.

                     </p>
                     <p>After him was <hi>Petrus Apianus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas

called <hi>Sterck,</hi> who lived at the same
time with <hi>Erasmus Roterodamus;</hi> and
was first moved to apply himself to
study, by Conversing with <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
and more particularly (as himself
Confesses) by Reading that little
Treatise <hi>De ratione studij.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year of Christ One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Five Hundred and Sixty, Lived
<hi>Gerardus Mercator,</hi> a man well Read
in Astrology.</p>
                     <p>Many others there are, whom it is
needless to insert, not that they were
less deserving than others, but because
these I have mentioned may serve to
shew by whom, and at what times
this Science has been propagated.</p>
                     <p>And though some may object, that
I go against my self in thus playing
the Herald, and reckoning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
of Astrology; and that it had
been more advantageous to my Cause
to have sought to have proved, that
none of Ingenuity or Learning had
ever studied in these matters: yet let
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41381:53"/>
them know, that it makes much for
me upon Consideration, that none of
these ever descended to these Nonsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Fopperies, wherewith Judicial
Astrology is stuffed full, and which
has brought into Question the more
material points of the Heavenly
Reading. Nor have these Fortune-tellers
any more reason to boast, that
so many Worthy men have imployed
themselves in Contemplating the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bodies, than the <hi>Romanists</hi> to boast
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Apostles Doctrine,
forasmuch as both of them have lost
their Art and Religion with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and Fopperies.</p>

                     <p>THat Curiosity is the Epidemick
Disease of the Mind, every
man may Experience in himself, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41381:54"/>
observe in others, which if it was
not so, there had been no occasion of
the present Discourse. Yet forasmuch
as through the Impudent Rashness of
some, and the Serious simplicity of
others, not only the Stars, but also
the Votes and Desires of men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into an Art, and made (against
their own Nature) Foretellers of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Contingencies; it will not be, I
hope, impertinent to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to Discusse the Business, and to
Search out what Solidity and Truth
there is in their Opinions and Tenets.
Which that we may do, I shall reduce
my Discourse to Three Heads.</p>
                     <p>1. A proposal of their Principles,
who are persuaded of the Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Stars, and have given up
their Votes for Judicial Astrology.</p>
                     <p>2. An Examination of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
to see how their Principles
accord with reason.</p>
                     <p>3. A Confutation of their False and
Erroneous Opinions, not only in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41381:54"/>
smaller Deductions and Conclusions,
but also in the very Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                     <p>Of which I do not intent to make
a long Treatise, but only briefly to
Touch at the foresaid Method, and so
have done.</p>
                     <p>Grand Patrons and Favourites of
the affirmative (I mean Sticklers for
Judicial Astrology) were the Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianists,
spawned from the <hi>Gnosticks;</hi>
who amongst other their prodigious
Errours had this, that the Stars had
especial and supreme Influence and
Predominance over man, and Taught,
that the several parts of his Body were
in Subordination to the Twelve Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations:
Assigning to the Head
<hi>Aries, Taurus</hi> to the Neck, <hi>Gemini</hi>
to the Shoulders, and so of the rest,
as you may be informed from every
<hi>Almanack</hi> Writer, affirming that in
good Earnest, which the Poets only
spoke Allegorically, or rather <hi>Poeticà
Licentiâ;</hi> introducing Old <hi>Atlas</hi> with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41381:55"/>
the Heavens on his Shoulders, and
his Body finely Spangled with
Stars.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
their main Arguments, and
Strong Cables, the <hi>Homerick</hi> Chains
wherewith they would Pull down
<hi>Iupiter</hi> and the rest of the Stars to
the very Earth, and imploy them
as Link-boys, to direct us in our
very Pilgrimage here upon Earth,
are reducible to these Heads.</p>
                     <p>1. To places of Scripture, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make for their purpose.</p>
                     <p>2. To reasons which they bring
to make good their party.</p>
                     <p>3. To Experiments and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which they would expect
Credit and consent to their Art.</p>
                     <p>First for places of Scripture. Those
that are most urged by them are
<hi>Genesis</hi> 1. 14. where its said, <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria
caelestia a Deo posita esse in sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.
Iudges.</hi> That the Stars fought
against <hi>Sisera</hi> in their courses. Also
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41381:55"/>
                        <hi>Iob 38 31. Canst thou bind the sweet
influences of the Pleiades? or loose
the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring
forth Mazzaroth in his season, or
canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
Knowest thou the Ordinances of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Canst thou set the Dominion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the Earth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That likewise <hi>Psalm</hi> the 19. 1. <hi>The
Heavens declare the glory of God, and
the Firmament sheweth his handy-work.</hi>
And above all, that of the Star which
appeared to the Wise-men or <hi>Magi,</hi>
who came to see Christ; from all
which places they would conclude,
that the Stars are Signs of Future
Events, and that diversly, according
to their several Aspects, Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Oppositions.</p>
                     <p>The second Rank of Arguments,
are such as are drawn from reason,
which they Form on this manner, as
First,</p>
                     <p>That there can be no other reason
given of the vast number of Wandring-Stars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41381:56"/>
2. There can be no reason given
of the several Motions, so many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
Oppositions, Trines and
Quartiles, or why a Planet (suppose)
should be sometimes in one Sign, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in another, now exalted in his
Dignities in his own house in full force
and power, again sneaking amongst his
Enemies in some Constellation, clearly
contrary to his own Natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or why two or three Planets meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Bull, or Ram, or any other
Sign, should be very Civil and Sober,
and all agree to one thing; and on a
sudden (no body knows for what)
fall out and come to Daggers draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>3. They say there is a strict Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Bond of Amity betwixt
the Caelestial and Sublunary Bodies;
that the Stars have certain Influences
upon the Bodies of men, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
more or less according to their
divers Positions: for example, that
those who are Born in the <hi>Interlunium,</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:41381:56"/>
should be weak and subject to Diseases;
and that those who are Born when the
Moon is in Conjunction with Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
ill-natur'd Planets, do either
die presently, or are troubled with
<hi>Epilepsies</hi> at the New-Moons: that
Physicians observe some Diseases to
increase or abate according to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Aspects and Positure of the Moon
with other Stars. They reason fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that considering it is undeniable
that the Stars have influence over the
Elements, it should be absurd to deny
that man is exempt from that Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
since he does infallibly Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the Nature and Quality of the
Elements; this is for the Body. That
they Swagger over his Mind too, they
Argue thus; The inclinations of the
Mind follow the Temperature of the
Body, and that Temperature of the
Body is altered and disposed of by the
Elements, the Elements by the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Bodies, therefore 'tis certain,
that one may judge of the Manners
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41381:57"/>
and Inclinations of men by the Stars.</p>
                     <p>Another reason they bring, is from
the Author of Astrology, who (as
they say) was <hi>Seth,</hi> and his Children,
and that he, by reason of what he
had heard from <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the
Two-fold Destruction of the World,
Wrote the Fundamentals and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of this Science on two Pillars, the
one of Brick, and the other of Stone;
as also that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were
skill'd in all the Learning of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> and were not
reprehended for it from the Mouth of
God.</p>
                     <p>The last File to patch up a plausible
Toleration for Judicial Astrology is,
from Experiments and Observations
Collected by Practitioners, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by Historians of very good
Credit and Authority.</p>
                     <p>The first is that of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
Written by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> who being
Warned by an Astrologer, to beware
of the Ides of <hi>March,</hi> and the time
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41381:57"/>
being come, and seeing no danger, as
the prediction seemed to signifie, he
jeered the Artist, telling him that
the Ides were come; who answer'd,
They were indeed come, but not past,
and the very same day was <hi>Caesar</hi>
Stab'd in the Senat-house, and dyed
of two and thirty Wounds. At the
Nativity of <hi>Augustus, Publius Nigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
who had calculated it, cryed out,
that the Lord of the whole Earth
was then born, which made <hi>August<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
favour the Astrologers ever after,
and caused the Image of a Goat to
be set upon his Coin, being born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Sign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thrasillus</hi> and <hi>Tyberius</hi> walking
together the Emperour design'd to
have thrown him down a steep place,
and have slain him, but he coming
near the place begun to tremble,
look pale, and shew divers Signs of
horrour and amazment; which
being observed by the Emperour, he
asked what was the matter: the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41381:58"/>
answer'd, He perceived some
great danger very near him; hereupon
the Emperor relented, and forbore to
execute his Tragical Design.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vitellius</hi> being yet a Private man,
the Astrologers told him he should be
Emperor, and afterwards told him
the day of his Death; for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
being displeased with the Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
commanded they should all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of <hi>Italy</hi> by such a day: they
cast out a Paper or Libel, wherein
they desired him not to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with their going out of <hi>Italy</hi> on
that day, for he should then go out
of the world; which according to
their Praedictions proved true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Xiphilinus in vitâ Neronis,</hi> Relates
that when <hi>Nero</hi> was Born, the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
foretold that he should be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and slay his Mother, which
also came to pass.</p>
                     <p>Many other Experiments may be
brought for the Credit of Astrologers,
which I shall not set down, to avoid
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41381:58"/>
Prolixity; who has a mind to know
them, may Consult <hi>Latin</hi> Authors,
and find to their Content: these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of most Validity I have taken
Notice of, partly engaged thereunto
by my proposed Method, and partly
to avoid the Censure of the adverse
party, who might else have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of Foul-play. That we may
in short lay down what is to be thought
of this Art in general, and its Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
we must make a distinction
between certainties and uncertainties,
distinguishing them both from what
is manifestly False, and examine what
power the Stars have over inferior
sublunary Bodies, how far this Art
extends it self; and what is beyond
the Reach both of the Stars and Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
and so we may come to know,
what Praedictions may be certainly
had from the Heavens, what only
probably, and what cannot be known
at all.</p>
                     <p>From the Stars, especially from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41381:59"/>
the Sun and Moon, may be known
the Succession of Day and Night, the
Four-fold Distinction of the year, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Alterations and Changes of
Weather, as Winds, Rain, Tempests,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Also it cannot be denied, that the
Caelestial Bodies have their Influence
and Operation upon the Elements,
especially upon the Air, so as to make
it sometimes Healthful and Sweet,
sometimes Noxious and Destructive.
Also that there several things, which
have a particular dependance upon the
Moon, and those not only Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
but also Men, as may be observed
from those we call Lunaticks, which
is thus effected. The Devil who is
of great Experience and Subtlety,
Chooses those times for the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of such persons, when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
flow abundantly in the Body
(occasioned by the Course of the
Moon) and so insinuating himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the humour, easily Disturbs the
Imagination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41381:59"/>
Astrologers may also give certain
information of the Periods and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Caelestial Orbs, the distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Rising and Setting of the Stars;
the Conjunctions, Oppositions, and
other Aspects, of the Eclypses of the
Sun and Moon, because those things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Regular and necessary
Course of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Amongst those things which are
only probable, and Contingent or to
be Guest at, are particular alterations
in the Air, Collected from the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of certain Changes, usually
attending such an Aspect of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
as also Epidemical Diseases; all
which are only Contingent, because
there may, besides those general and
remote Causes (I mean the positure
of the Stars,) occur several more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medate
Causes, which may disturb
the iotherwise-natural Effects. Such are
the Interposition of some Star in the
Aspect observed of a contrary Nature,
not known of by the Astrologer; the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41381:60"/>
different Qualities of Countreys, and
the diverse Temperatures of the Air,
which may abate the Influence, and
perhaps change the Nature of the
Effect.</p>
                     <p>If Astrologers Err so frequently
in their Praedictions of the Weather,
and other things which depend upon
Natural Causes, we may-confidently
affirm, that those things which depend
meerly at the will and pleasure of man,
are such, as Astrologers cannot at all
judge of.</p>
                     <p>To shew the vanity and idleness of
this Science, I shall make use of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
both Divine and Humane,
2. Reason, and 3<hi>dly.</hi> their own False
Observations and Praedictions.</p>
                     <p>As for Divine Authority, no greater
Argument can be brought against it,
than that it is so often spoken against
in Holy Scriptures, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.
22. where all manner of Divination
is forbidden, inquiring after that which
is to come is forbidden, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41381:60"/>
                        <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 6. God by his Prophet <hi>Esaiah</hi>
Taxes the vanity of this Art, and of
those that are Deluded by them, <hi>Esai.</hi>
47. 12. 13. <hi>Stand now</hi> (says he) <hi>with
thy Enchantments, and with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of thy Sorceries, wherein thou hast
laboured from thy Youth; if thou shalt
be able to profit, if so be thou maist pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
Thou art wearied in the multitude
of thy Counsels: let now the Astrologers,
the; Star-gazers, the monthly Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticators
stand up, and save thee from
these things that shall come upon thee.</hi>
God likewise commands the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
that they Learn not the ways of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
and that they be not afraid of the
Signs of heaven, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fear.
God threatens Confusion, Folly, and
Destruction to such like, <hi>Esai.</hi> 44. 20.</p>
                     <p>Next come the Ancient Fathers,
who subscribe to the Authority of the
Scriptures, and vote down this way
of Divination; out of whose Writings
many things tending to this purpose
may be gathered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:41381:61"/>
Nay so unreasonable and Prophane
has this Science always been accounted
that (except a few Brainsick persons,
who have practised it) it has been
condemned by most Grave and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men, and by the Edicts of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heathen aswell as Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
as also by General-Councils;
see the Acts of the first General-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in which the <hi>Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
(as I said before) great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of this Art were Condemned and
Excommunicated. Nor did this sort
of men fare better with the Emperors;
they were Banished the City by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus;</hi>
Expelled out of <hi>Italy</hi> first by
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> afterwards by <hi>Claudius;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by <hi>Vitellius</hi> they were Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to Death: twice by <hi>Domitian</hi>
were they Banish'd out of <hi>Italy,</hi> as
being a sort of men Treacherous to
Princes, and Faithless to those that
Trusted in them. There is also (which
ought to have been named first) a
Law made by <hi>Caesar</hi> to this purpose,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41381:61"/>
                        <hi>If any Magician, or Conjurer, or Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer,
or Mathematician, or Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Dreams be taken within my Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
let him suffer Punishment;
but if he be Convict, and continue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
let him be Wrackt, and Lanced
according to his Desert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Likewise 'twas Decreed by <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperours,
that the Books of the Mathematicians
should be Burnt in the presence of the
Bishops.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Fathers; now I come to the
second particular, that is, Reason.
Whereupon I thus Argue, Forasmuch
as Natural things and such as depend
meerly upon Natural Causes, cannot
be positively affirm'd, but only go
under the Notion of probabilities; 'tis
not to be thought that Contingencies
and things depending upon mans will,
(and such are most wherein Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
have to do) should be hit of
by their doubtful and Fantastical Rules
of Art.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41381:62"/>
2. If the Stars have such Praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy
as is pretended, it must either
be as Causes, or Signs; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Causes, for that would infer a
necessity of similar Effects, which no
man will either pretend to, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate;
nor can it be a Causality,
or to speak plainer, an inclining, but
not a compelling Power, that being
of as bad consequence, for then how
should Partial and Remote Causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
real and positive Effects?</p>
                     <p>But if they be only Signs, they must
be either Natural, or Supernatural.
Natural they cannot be, since they
can upon that Score have no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the things signified, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the same Cause: nor can they
be Supernatural, for then we ought to
suppose an Infallibility in the Event.</p>
                     <p>Now as Chymists and Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks
use to flourish in Oratory, and
tell the Credulous Vulgar many fine
Stories of the Temperature of the
Elements, of the proportion of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41381:62"/>
and such like puzling Terms, to
wheedle an opinion of their Skill into
their Auditors: so do Astrologers
lash out into large and extravagant
Encomiums of the Heavenly Bodies,
urge the Coherence betwixt Caelestial
and sublunary things, and tell fine Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that so many Orbs, Stars and
Motions were not made by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to no end; and after much
proving of that which none denies,
they descend to their particulars, their
little Casualties, and Tie every mans
Fortune to some Star or other. What
(say they) shall we think that the
most glorious part of the Creation, in
which (as in a large expanded Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume)
may be Read the wonderful
power and Wisdom of God, was made
to serve to no use? or shall we set at
nought those things which have so
abundantly shewn forth their power
upon the Earth?</p>
                     <p>Let us now descend to their Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
that is, Nativities, and see
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41381:63"/>
what semblance of truth there is in
it.</p>
                     <p>They pretend to observe the very
point of their Nativity, and the places
of the Stars, which are Fixed, which
are Erratick, in what Houses they
arise, which Planets are in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,
which not; whether in a
right Triplicity; whether in a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
or Faeminine Sign; what As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
whether Trine, or Quartile, or
Sextile, or Opposition, or Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and several other hard and
Conjuring Terms. From hence (say
they) it is easie, either by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
considered particularly, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or with the Signs of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,
to Collect the Events of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs, to Describe a mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and give an account of his
good or bad Fortune.</p>
                     <p>Now let us allow them this (which
is indeed more than they can prove)
that the Fortunes of men are Guided
by the Stars; yet what Midwife or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41381:63"/>
Astrologer, either can be so exact, as
to know the very Minute of a Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is necessary to be known,
forasmuch as in the space of one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
there is a vast and unalterable
Celerity in the Motion of the Heavens;
so that before the Infant be wholly
Born, the Constellation will be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Head will be Born under
one, and the Feet under another, which
will (if it was significant) prove but
Cross Fortune to the Party.</p>
                     <p>But supposing that this small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time do not Disturb the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Horoscope; how comes
it to pass that Twins are oftentimes
observed to have such different For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
the one of them Dying in their
Infancy, the other Living to Decrepit
Age: or one of them (perhaps) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to Honours and Dignities, and
continually Courted with opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Advancement, the other not
able to get out of a mean and abject
Condition; the one is inclined to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41381:64"/>
Peace, the other to Quarrelling and
Disorder; the one is strong of Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
the other weak and sickly.</p>
                     <p>A greater difference arises, if the
Twins be one of them Male, and the
other Female: is it possible in such a
Case, that they should both have the
same Genius, and Inclinations? which
ought according to these men, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to follow. I hope there is no
man but may be convinced of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of this Science, if he take Notice
of those that die in the Field, men of
different Ages, Born under different
Constellations; yet all Perishing by
one common Fate.</p>
                     <p>Were all the First-born of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
slain at the Departure of the Children
of <hi>Israel;</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Drowned
in the Red-sea; The <hi>Philistins</hi> Slain
by <hi>Sampson;</hi> The Children put to
Death by <hi>Herods</hi> Officers, Born under
the same Stars? I think none will
Affirm it; If not, Why did they Die
by the same Death? Are all that are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41381:64"/>
Born under <hi>Saturn,</hi> Melancholick? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Iupiter</hi> or the Sun, Princes and
Potentates? Under <hi>Mars,</hi> Souldiers
or Highway-men? Under <hi>Venus,</hi>
Whoremasters? Under <hi>Mercury,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants?</p>
                     <p>I shall now come to Answer those
Arguments which Astrologers bring
out of Scripture, from Reason, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</p>
                     <p>First for Scriptures: to that out of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> 1. 14. I answer, that they
assume more than the Sence of the
words will permit; for though it be
there said, that God set the Caelestial
Lights for signs of things necessarily
depending upon their Course and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet it cannot thence be infer'd,
that they are also signs of things meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Contingent, and proceeding from
the different Motions of mans Will
and Appetite.</p>
                     <p>To that of the Stars fighting against
<hi>Sisera</hi> in their Courses, I answer;
That by Stars in that place (according
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41381:65"/>
to some Interpreters) is meant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which is plausible enough, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as both are promiscuously cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Host of Heaven: or it may be
said, that at that time they did not
Operate by a Natural Influence, but
a Supernatural and extraordinary
Power, God raising up an unusual
Effect in the Stars, of causing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
to the Annoyance of those Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of his people.</p>
                     <p>In that place of <hi>Iob</hi> so much by
them insisted on, is nothing at all to
their purpose: since it may with ease
be Turned against them, that it is to
be understood, that no man can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Statutes of Heaven, but
that God has reserved the Knowledge
of such things to himself; besides,
there is nothing said of the Influence,
and Rule of the Stars over mens
Minds or Actions, nothing of the
knowledge of Future Events, but only
Arguments of the Divine Wisdom,
to convince <hi>Iob</hi> of his weakness and
Frailty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:41381:65"/>
And though it be said, <hi>The Heavens
shew forth the glory of God, and the
Stars declare his Handy-work;</hi> that
makes not for them neither, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the place being partly the same
with that last mentioned, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
Casting up our Eyes to those glorious
Luminaries, we may remember the
power of God, who has made them
all, and continues them in so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and unerring Courses.</p>
                     <p>As for the Star which appeared to
the <hi>Magi</hi> coming to Christ, it was no
Natural but a Supernatural Star,
having a Motion contrary to that of
other Stars; few will (I suppose)
be so impudent as to affirm, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was Governed by the Stars, that
he who Created, should be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to his Creatures. And though
it appear'd at his Birth, and usher'd
him into the world, yet (as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
says) <hi>Non dominabatur Christo
ad decretum, sed famulabatur ad Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41381:66"/>
nec enim subjiciebat imperio,
sed judicabat obsequio.</hi> To make this
an Argument for their Art would be
an absurdity; for if it had force and
signification in his Nativity, why had
it not over all those Born at the same
time with him? I hope they will not
say, that they were all to share in
the same Circumstances of Life.</p>
                     <p>Let us now examine their Reasons,
and see how they will stand Trial.</p>
                     <p>Their first Reason is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a false Supposition, that there can
be no other use for the Stars, than to be
Characters wherein men may Read
their own Fortunes.</p>
                     <p>The second likewise, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
we know no other reason for the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Motions, and Aspects, is not good
Reasoning, for 'twill not hold to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from the Negation of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to the Negation of the thing
we cannot apprehend; so that if we
cannot find what a thing is for, we
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41381:66"/>
cannot justly cut it out a piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and infer a necessity of its being
design'd for that use we have devis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to apply it to.</p>
                     <p>The third reason from the Cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Caelestial and Sublunary
things is no better Logick; for although
they may sway the Elements, yet
there is no reason they should do so in
things meerly Contingent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the Will and slippery
Appetites of Man: though <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or
<hi>Mars,</hi> or any of the rest, meeting in
such an Aspect and Position one with
another, may produce a Tempest in
the Air; yet I cannot perceive a
necessity, that they must Dart a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
into my Affections with their
Malevolent Rays. And supposing the
time of a Nativity can be exactly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
yet what reason can they shew
for Confirmation of their Rules: they
are only such as men have devised, and
that without any ground or Warrant
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41381:67"/>
from Scripture: what reason can they
give that any Aspect should portend
that which they say it does, but only
some Observation of a thing happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that time, which they cannot
averr to proceed from that Aspect, but
that it had been so without it.</p>
                     <p>And though <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> were
given to Studies of this Nature, and
that <hi>Moses</hi> was skill'd in the Learning
of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> of the
<hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> yet it cannot be proved,
that they ever favoured this way of
Divining at things to come: their
knowledge proceeded from another
Cause, to wit, immediate Revelation;
or else was gathered from certain and
Solid Principles.</p>
                     <p>It must be confessed that the Chiefest
Bulwarks wherewith Astrologers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves, are Experiments; yet
are they not so strong, but they may

the Rules Infallible, one amongst an
hundred (perhaps made at the same
time) Hitting, the rest proving False:
why then should all those that Fail be

so stifly to plead for it.</p>
                     <p>Many very Eminent and Learned
men have Discussed the vanity of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Astrology, as <hi>Picus Mirandula,
Cornelius Agrippa, Franciscus Valle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
and divers others, to whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
I refer my Reader.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galeatius</hi> Prince of <hi>Millain</hi> gave a
notable Check to one of these men;
who was arrived at that height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
as to tell the Prince, he was
shortly to Die a sudden and unusual
Death, and that himself was to Live a
long time after him. But mark how
prettily <hi>Galeatius</hi> Confuted the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger;
he caused him to be forthwith
lead to Execution, the Prince survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41381:68"/>
him many years: and indeed 'tis
observable that most of them are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what shall happen to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and whilst they foretel great
Success, and promise Golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to others, cannot Enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>Nor ought we to be Seduced by
the Experiments they Brag of, since
they are most of them only Collected
by little and pretending <hi>Sciolists,</hi>
men of no Faith nor Reputation,
most of them too being Feigned and
Falling out no body knows where nor
when.</p>
                     <p>Again, in those few which truly
happen according to their Praedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
'tis not certain whether the
Artist might Consult with something
else besides the Stars, since many
who Deal with Familiar Spirits,
Mask their Impieties under the Vizor
of Astrology. So St. <hi>Augustine lib.</hi> 5.
