            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER. CONCERNING The VERTUES of an HEROIQUE POEM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Vertues required in an Heroick Poem (and indeed in all Writings published) are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all in this one word <hi>Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Discretion consisteth in this, That every part of the Poem be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and in good order placed to the End and Designe of the Poet. And the Designe is not only to profit, but also to delight the Reader.</p>
            <p>By Profit, I intend not here any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Wealth either to the Poet, or to the Reader; but accession of Prudence, Justice, and Fortitude, by the Example of such Great and Noble
<pb facs="tcp:45587:3"/>
Persons as he introduceth speaking, or describeth acting. For all men love to behold, though not to practise Vertue. So that at last the work of an Heroique Poet is no more but to furnish an ingenuous Reader (when his leisure abounds) with the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of an honest and delightful Story, whether true or feigned.</p>
            <p>But because there be many men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Critiques, and Wits, and Vertuosi, that are accustomed to censure the Poets, and most of them of divers Judgments: How is it possible (you'l say) to please them all? Yes, very well; if the Poem be as it should be. For men can judge what's good, that know not what is best. For he that can judge what is best, must have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered all those things (though they be almost innumerable) that concur to make the reading of an Heroique Poem pleasant. Whereof I'll name as many as shall come into my mind.</p>
            <p>And they are contained, first, in the choice of words. Secondly, in
<pb facs="tcp:45587:3"/>
the construction. Thirdly, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Story or Fiction. Fourthly, in the Elevation of the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Fifthly, in the Justice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of the Poet. Sixthly, in the clearness of Descriptions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, in the Amplitude of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>And (to begin with words) the first Indiscretion is, The use of such words as to the Readers of Poesie (which are commonly Persons of the best Quality) are not sufficiently known. For the work of an Heroique Poem is to raise admiration (princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally) for three Vertues, Valour, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Love, to the reading whereof Women no less than Men have a just pretence, though their skill in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage be not so universal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forein words till by long use they become vulgar, are unintelligible to them. Also the names of Instruments and Tools of Artificers, and words of Art, though of use in the Schools, are far from being fit to be spoken by a
<pb facs="tcp:45587:4"/>
Heroe. He may delight in the Arts themselves, and have skill in some of them; but his Glory lies not in that, but in Courage, Nobility, and other Vertues of Nature, or in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he has over other men. Nor does <hi>Homer</hi> in any part of his Poem attribute any praise to <hi>Achilles,</hi> or any blame to <hi>Alexander,</hi> for that they had both learnt to play upon the Ghittarre. The Character of words that become a Heroe are Property, and Significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but without both the malice and lasciviousness of a Satyr.</p>
            <p>Another Vertue of an Heroique Poem is the Perspicuity and the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Construction, and consisteth in a natural contexture of the words, so as not to discover the labour but the natural ability of Poet, and this is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually called a good Style. For the order of words when placed as they ought to be, carries a light before it, whereby a man may foresee the length of his period; as a torch in the night shews a man the stops and unevenness in
<pb facs="tcp:45587:4"/>
his way. But when plac'd unnaturally, the Reader will often find unexpected checks, and be forced to go back and hunt for the sense, and suffer such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as in a Coach a man unexpectedly finds in passing over a furrow. And though the Laws of Verse (which have bound the Greeks and Latines to number of Feet, and quantity of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, and the English and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to number of Syllables and Rime) put great constraint upon the natural course of Language; yet the Poet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the liberty to depart from what is obstinate, and to chuse somewhat else that is more obedient to such Laws, and no less fit for his purpose, shall not be (neither by the measure, nor by the necessity of Rime) excused; though a Translation often may.</p>
            <p>A third Vertue lies in the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. For there is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Poem and a History in Prose. For a History is wholly related by the Writer; but in a Heroique Poem the Narration is, a great part of it, put
<pb facs="tcp:45587:5"/>
upon some of the persons introduced by the Poet. So <hi>Homer</hi> begins not his <hi>Iliad</hi> with the injury done by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> but makes it related by <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and very briefly as a thing notorious; nor begins he his <hi>Odysses</hi> with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>Ulysses</hi> from <hi>Troy,</hi> but makes <hi>Ulysses</hi> himself relate the same to <hi>Alcinous,</hi> in the midst of his Poem; which I think much more pleasant and ingenious, than a too precise and close following of the time.</p>
            <p>A fourth is in the Elevation of Fancie, which is generally taken for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est praise of Heroique Poetry; and is so, when governed by discretion. For men more generally affect and admire Fancie than they do either Judgment, or Reason, or Memory, or any other intellectual Vertue, and for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of it, give to it alone the name of Wit, accounting Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but for a dull entertainment. For in Fancie consisteth the Sublimity of a Poet, which is that Poetical Fury which the Readers for the most part
<pb facs="tcp:45587:5"/>
call for. It flies abroad swiftly to fetch in both Matter and Words; but if there be not Discretion at home to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish which are fit to be used and which not, which decent, and which undecent for Persons, Times, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their delight and grace is lost. But if they be discreetly used, they are greater ornaments of a Poem by much than any other. A Metaphor also (which is a comparison contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a word) is not unpleasant; but when they are sharp, and extraordinary, they are not fit for an Heroique Poet, nor for a publique consultation, but only for an Accusation or Defence at the Bar.</p>
            <p>A fifth lies in the Justice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of the Poet, and belongeth as well to History as to Poetry. For both the Poet and the Historian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth only (or should do) matter of Fact. And as far as the truth of Fact can defame a man, so far they are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to blemish the reputation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But to do the same upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb facs="tcp:45587:6"/>
or by inference, is below the dignity not only of a Heroe but of a Man. For neither a Poet nor an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian ought to make himself an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Master of any mans good name. None of the Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> or any other Writer hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, was ever subject to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any of them, nor were they ever heard to plead for themselves, which are things that ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to condemnation. Nor was (I think) <hi>Epicurus</hi> the Philosopher (who is transmitted to us by the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks for a man of evil and voluptuous life) ever called, convented, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convicted, as all men ought to be before they be defamed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a very great fault in a Poet to speak evil of any man in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings Historical.</p>
            <p>A sixth Vertue consists in the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and curiosity of Descriptions, which the ancient Writers of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence call <hi>Icones,</hi> that is <hi>Images.</hi> And an Image is always a part, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:45587:6"/>
the ground of a Poetical compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison. As (for example) when <hi>Virgil</hi> would set before our eyes the fall of <hi>Troy,</hi> he describes perhaps the whole Labour of many men together in the felling of some great Tree, and with how much ado it fell. This is the Image. To w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if you but add these words, So fell <hi>Troy,</hi> you have the Comparison entire; the grace whereof lieth in the lightsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and is but the description of all (even of the minutest) parts of the thing described; that not only they that stand far off, but also they that stand near, and look upon it with the oldest spectacles of a Critique, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. For a Poet is a Painter, and should paint Actions to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing with the most decent words, as Painters do Persons and Bodies with the choicest colours, to the eye; which if not done nicely, will not be worthy to be plac'd in a Cabinet.</p>
            <p>The seventh Vertue w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> lying in the Amplitude of the Subject, is nothing but variety, and a thing without which
<pb facs="tcp:45587:7"/>
a whole Poem would be no pleasanter than an Epigram, or one good Verse; nor a Picture of a hundred figures bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any one of them asunder, if drawn with equal art. And these are the Vertues which ought especially to be looked upon by the Critiques. in the comparing of the Poets, <hi>Homer</hi> with <hi>Virgil,</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> with <hi>Lucan.</hi> For these only, for their excellencie, I have read or heard compared.</p>
            <p>If the comparison be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first and second Vertues, which consist in known words and Style un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, they are all excellent in their own Language, though perhaps the Latin than the Greek is apter to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it self into an Hexameter Verse, as having both fewer Monosyllables and fewer Polysyllables. And this may make the Latin Verse appear more grave and equal, which is taken for a kind of Majesty; though in truth there be no Majesty in words but then when they seem to proceed from an high and weighty imployment of the
<pb facs="tcp:45587:7"/>
mind. But neither <hi>Homer,</hi> nor <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> nor <hi>Lucan,</hi> nor any Poet writing commendably (though not excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) was ever charged much with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known words, or great constraint of Style, as being a fault proper to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators, when they hold themselves too superstitiously to their Authors words.</p>
            <p>In the third Vertue, which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, there is no doubt but <hi>Homer</hi> excels them all. For their Poems (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Introduction of their Gods) are but so many Histories in Verse; whereas <hi>Homer</hi> has woven so many Histories together as contain the whole Learning of his time (which the Greeks call <hi>Cyclopaedia)</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished both the Greek and Latin Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with all the Plots and Arguments of their Tragedies.</p>
            <p>The fourth Vertue which is the height of Fancie, is almost proper to <hi>Lucan,</hi> and so admirable in him, that no Heroique Poem raises such admiration of the Poet, as his hath done, though
<pb facs="tcp:45587:8"/>
not so great admiration of the persons he introduceth. And though it be a mark of a great Wit; yet it is fitter for a Rhetorician than a Poet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth often against Discretion; as when he says</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni. <note rend="inter">
                     <l>
                        <hi>that is,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>The Side that Won the Gods approved most,</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Cato</hi> better lik'd the Side that lost.</l>
                  </note>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>Than which nothing could be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more gloriously to the Exaltation of a man, nor more disgracefully to the Depression of the Gods. <hi>Homer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed maketh some Gods for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and some for the <hi>Trojans;</hi> but always makes <hi>Jupiter</hi> impartial. And never prefers the judgment of a Man before that of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> much less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment of all the Gods to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The fifth Vertue, which is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Impartiality of a Poet, is
<pb facs="tcp:45587:8"/>
very eminent in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> but the contrary in <hi>Lucan. Lucan</hi> shews himself openly in the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> Faction, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eighing against <hi>Caesar</hi> throughout his Poem, like <hi>Cicero</hi> against <hi>Cataline</hi> or <hi>Marc Antony;</hi> and is therefore justly reckon'd by <hi>Quintilian</hi> as a Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian rather than a Poet. And a great part of the delight of his Readers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the pleasure which too many men take to hear Great Persons censured. But <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially <hi>Homer)</hi> do every where what they can to preserve the Reputation of their Heroes.</p>
            <p>If we compare <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> by the sixth Vertue, which is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Images (or Descriptions) it is manifest that <hi>Homer</hi> ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, though <hi>Virgil</hi> himself were to be the Judge. For there are very few Images in <hi>Virgil</hi> besides those which he hath translated out of <hi>Homer,</hi> so that <hi>Virgils</hi> Images are <hi>Homers</hi> Praises. But what if he have added something to it of his own? Though he have, yet
<pb facs="tcp:45587:9"/>
it is no addition of praise, because 'tis easie. But he hath some Images which are not in <hi>Homer,</hi> and better than his. It may be so, and so may other Poets have which never durst compare themselves with <hi>Homer.</hi> Two or three fine sayings are not enough to make a Wit. But where is that Image of his better done by him than <hi>Homer,</hi> of those that have been done by them both? Yes, <hi>Eustathius</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Ogilby</hi> hath observ'd) where they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the falling of a Tree prefers <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s description. But <hi>Eustathius</hi> is in that, I think, mistaken. The place of <hi>Homer</hi> is in the fourth of the <hi>Iliads,</hi> the sense whereof is this:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>As when a man hath fell'd a Poplar tree</l>
               <l>Tall, streight, and smooth, with all the fair boughs on;</l>
               <l>Of which he means a Coach-wheel made shall be,</l>
               <l>And leaves it on the Bank, to dry i'th' Sun;</l>
               <l>So lay the comely <hi>Simoisius,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Slain by great <hi>Ajax,</hi> Son of <hi>Telamon.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>It is manifest that in this place <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45587:9"/>
intended no more than to shew how comely the body of <hi>Simoisius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as he lay dead upon the Bank of <hi>Scamander,</hi> streight, and tall, with a fair head of hair, and like a streight and high Poplar with the boughs still on; and not at all to describe the manner of his falling, which (when a man is wounded through the breast, as he was with a Spear) is always sudden.</p>
            <p>The description of how a great Tree falleth, when many men together hew it down, is in the second of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneads.</hi> The sense of it, with the comparison is in English this:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And <hi>Troy,</hi> methought, then sunk in fire and smoke,</l>
               <l>And overturned was in every part:</l>
               <l>As when upon the mountain an old Oak</l>
               <l>Is hewn about with keen steel to the heart,</l>
               <l>And pli'd by Swains with many heavy blows,</l>
               <l>It nods and every way it threatens round,</l>
               <l>Till overcome with many wounds it bows,</l>
               <l>And leisurely at last comes to the ground.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And here again it is evident that <hi>Virgil</hi> meant to compare the manner
<pb facs="tcp:45587:10"/>
how <hi>Troy</hi> after many Battles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the losses of many Cities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by the many Nations under <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon</hi> in a long War, and thereby weak'ned, and at last overthrown, with a great Tree hewn round about, and then falling by little and little lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely.</p>
            <p>So that neither these two Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor the two Comparisons can be compared together. The Image of a man lying on the ground is one thing; the Image of falling (especially of a Kingdom) is another. This therefore gives no advantage to <hi>Virgil</hi> over <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> 'Tis true, that this Description of the Felling and Falling of a Tree is exceeding graceful. But is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more than <hi>Homer</hi> could have done if need had been? Or is there no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in <hi>Homer</hi> of somewhat else as good as this? Yes, and in many of our English Poets now alive. If it then be lawful for <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> to say, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> would have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the fall of a Tree, he could not
<pb facs="tcp:45587:10"/>
have mended this of <hi>Virgil;</hi> it will be lawful for me to repeat an old Epigram of <hi>Antipater,</hi> to the like purpose, in favour of <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Writer of the famous <hi>Trojan</hi> War,</l>
               <l>And of <hi>Ulysses</hi> Life, O <hi>Jove</hi> make known,</l>
               <l>Who, whence he was; for thine the Verses are,</l>
               <l>And he would have us think they are his own.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The seventh and last commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Heroique Poem consisteth in Amplitude and Variety; and in this <hi>Homer</hi> exceedeth <hi>Virgil</hi> very much, and that not by superfluity of words, but by plenty of Heroique matter, and multitude of Descriptions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons (whereof <hi>Virgil</hi> hath transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but a small part into his <hi>Aeneads)</hi> such as are the Images of Shipwracks, Battles, Single Combats, Beauty, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the mind, Sacrifices, Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other things, whereof <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> (abating what he borrows of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)</hi> has scarce the twentieth part. It is no wonder therefore if all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Learned men both of <hi>Greece</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:45587:11"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> have given the first place in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to <hi>Homer.</hi> It is rather strange that two or three, and of late time, and but Learners of the Greek tongue should dare to contradict so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges both of Language and Discretion. But howsoever I defen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Homer,</hi> I aim not thereby at any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the following Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why then did I write it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had nothing else to do. Why publish it? Because I thought it might take off my Adversaries from shewing their folly upon my more serious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and set them upon my Verses to shew their wisdom. But why without Annotations? Because I had no hope to do it better than it is already done by Mr. <hi>Ogilby.</hi>

               <l>Who to revenge his Fathers blood him slew.</l>
               <l>Ha! How dare mortals tax the Gods, and say,</l>

               <l>My crew with patience no longer can</l>
               <l>Stay for me; therefore think what's to be done.</l>
               <l>Your counsel (said <hi>Telemachus)</hi> is such</l>
               <l>As might become a Father to his Son.</l>
               <l>I'll not forget it. Though your hast be much,</l>

               <l>This said, she mounted from him to the Sky</l>
               <l>In likeness of an Eagle, to his wonder,</l>
               <l>Who thought it was some God, and grew thereby</l>
               <l>Bolder, and on his Father more did ponder.</l>
               <l>And streightway to the Suiters went, who were</l>
               <l>Now come again into the house, and seated</l>
               <l>A Song which <hi>Phemius</hi> then sung to hear,</l>
               <l>Containing how the Grecians retreated</l>
               <l>Unfortunately from the Trojan shore</l>
               <l>By <hi>Pallas</hi> doings whom they had offended.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Penelope</hi> that heard it and was more</l>
               <l>Concerned than they all streightway descended.</l>
               <l>She entred not but in the door did stand</l>
               <l>Vail'd with a Scarf which on her head she wore,</l>
               <l>Having a waiting-woman on each hand,</l>
               <l>And to the singer thus said, weeping sore.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Phemius</hi> y'have better Songs, why sing you then</l>
               <l>This sad one? Fitter 'twere the deeds to tell</l>
               <l>Of mighty Gods, and mighty deeds of men,</l>
               <l>Which sure would please the Company as well.</l>
               <l>Sing one of those, and let them hear and drink</l>
               <l>Give over this. You touch my interest,</l>
               <l>And wound my heart in forcing me to think</l>

               <l>Then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> Good Mother why</l>

               <l>Whose part it is to please the Company?</l>
               <l>It is not he that does the evil bring.</l>
               <l>'Tis none of <hi>Phemius</hi> fault, but th' Act of <hi>Jove</hi>

               <l>Then to her Chamber up she went again</l>
               <l>With her two Maids, and there began to weep,</l>
               <l>Being for her dear husband in great pain,</l>
               <l>And wept till <hi>Pall as</hi> clos'd her eyes with sleep.</l>
               <l>Men while the Suiters into clusters ran,</l>
               <l>And one t'another his thoughts uttered</l>
               <l>With noise enough. But there was not a man</l>
               <l>That did not wish to have her in his bed.</l>
               <l>Then to them spake <hi>Telemachus;</hi> D'ye hear</l>

               <l>Give ear unto the Singer, and forbear</l>
               <l>Clamour. To morrow is the Council day,</l>
               <l>There I shall warn you publikely, no more</l>
               <l>To haunt my house, but each man home to go,</l>
               <l>And there to feast by turns on your own store;</l>
               <l>And if you be not willing to do so,</l>
               <l>But your own means to spare, shall think it best</l>
               <l>To feast your selves on one mans substance all,</l>
               <l>And ruine his estate, go on and feast</l>
               <l>While I upon the Gods for vengeance call.</l>
               <l>O that the mighty <hi>Jove</hi> would so ordain,</l>
               <l>That all mens actions might be repaid</l>
               <l>As they deserve! Then should you all be slain</l>
               <l>Within my doors. After he this had said,</l>
               <l>The Suiters bit their lips, and silent mused</l>

               <l>But if their meaning were that you should reign</l>
               <l>Here, o'r us all, I should be very sorry.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> repli'd, Think what you will.</l>
               <l>If <hi>Jove</hi> consent, why should not I be King?</l>
               <l>What harm is it; with wealth my house to fill,</l>

No matter, whosoe'r be King, not he,</l>

               <l>To reign in <hi>Ithaca</hi> is hard to guess,</l>

               <l>Of house, or land, or goods, by violence,</l>
               <l>As long as there in <hi>Ithaca</hi> be men.</l>
               <l>But tell me who that was, that now went hence,</l>
               <l>Where he was born, and where he dwells, and then</l>
               <l>His errand, whether business of his own,</l>
               <l>Or some news from <hi>Ulysses</hi> brought perchance,</l>
               <l>And went so soon away, t'avoid being known.</l>
               <l>He was no mean man by his countenance.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> My Father's dead,</l>

               <l>With Messengers I trouble not my head,</l>

               <l>His people for their Trade by Sea well known.</l>
               <l>Thus said he, though he doubted not at all</l>

               <l>And Sacrifice my Beeves, and Goats, and Sheep,</l>
               <l>My wine exhaust, and much they cast away.</l>
               <l>For why, <hi>Ulysses</hi> lost is on the deep.</l>
               <l>And I my self unable to defend.</l>
               <l>But shall I so be still, or once be able</l>
               <l>To bring upon these men unjust their end,</l>
               <l>Whose injuries no more are tolerable?</l>
               <l>Take it to heart. Think how 'twill taken be</l>
               <l>By other States. Fear from the Gods some change,</l>
               <l>That are not pleas'd with such iniquity,</l>
               <l>And may in closer order make you range.</l>
               <l>By <hi>Jove</hi> I you adjure, and <hi>Themis,</hi> who</l>
               <l>Convokes Assemblies, and revokes again,</l>

Leave me to suffer misery alone.</l>

               <l>In hatred of you some great evil done,</l>
               <l>And for revenge these men such power you gave.</l>
               <l>But better 'twere for me, that you than they</l>

               <l>But for my case no help can now be found.</l>
               <l>So said <hi>Telema hus</hi> in choler high,</l>
               <l>And from him threw the Scepter to the ground.</l>
               <l>Nor could fotbear to left fall tears and sigh.</l>
               <l>The People piti'd him, but silent sat.</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus,</hi> said he, too passionate</l>
               <l>You are, and too much liberty you take.</l>
               <l>The Peoples hatred you would very fain</l>
               <l>Draw to the Suiters, and procure them shame.</l>
               <l>But from your Mother cometh all your pain;</l>
               <l>And therefore her, not us you ought to blame.</l>
               <l>Three years are gone and past, the fourth is this,</l>
               <l>Since she her Suiters baffled has with Art,</l>
               <l>Putting each one in hope by Messages,</l>
               <l>And Promises that he had gain'd her heart.</l>
               <l>Moreover, setting up a Beam to weave,</l>
               <l>Suiters (said she) since dead <hi>Ulysses</hi> is,</l>
               <l>Stay yet a little while, and give me leave</l>
               <l>To make an end but of one business.</l>
               <l>I must for old <hi>Laertes</hi> make a Cloath,</l>

               <l>For to accuse me they will not forbear;</l>
               <l>But say I very hasty was to wed,</l>
               <l>If I go hence and not provide a shroud</l>
               <l>Wherein <hi>Laertes</hi> may be buried.</l>
               <l>Out of such wealth, that might have been allow'd.</l>
               <l>Her Suiters all were well content. And then</l>
               <l>All day she wove, but ere she went to bed,</l>
               <l>What she had wov'n, she ravell'd out agen.</l>
               <l>Three years her Suiters thus she frustrated.</l>

In the fourth year her women her betraid,</l>

               <l>Since now her purpose could no more be hid.</l>
               <l>To your complaint the Suiters answer thus,</l>
               <l>(Take notice of it you and all the rest)</l>
               <l>Send back your Mother to <hi>Icarius.</hi>

               <l>There let her marry whom they both think best.</l>
               <l>But if she think to vex us longer yet,</l>

               <l>And skilfulness in curious work and shifts,</l>
               <l>Wherein the <hi>Achaean</hi> wives she doth excel,</l>
               <l>Both old and young, <hi>Trro, Alcmen', Micen',</hi>

               <l>Although with us she hath not dealed well.</l>

               <l>So much the longer with you we shall eat.</l>
               <l>Which to <hi>Penelope</hi> will be a glory.</l>

               <l>For so long as she dodges with us thus,</l>
               <l>No whither from your house will we depart.</l>
               <l>Then to him answered <hi>Telemachus,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Antinous,</hi> I ne'r shall have the heart</l>

               <l>For forcing her to leave her husbands bed.</l>
               <l>And from the Furies I shall suffer worse.</l>
               <l>For if I force her from my house to go</l>
               <l>Whether she will or not, she will me curse.</l>
               <l>And men will of me be revenged too.</l>
               <l>If it displease you that she stayeth here,</l>

               <l>But if you needs will feed on me alone,</l>
               <l>I can but to the Gods, for vengeance call,</l>

This said, two Eagles coming were in fight,</l>
               <l>And when they were the Market-place just o'r,</l>
               <l>Th'Assembled heads surveying, stopt their flight,</l>
               <l>And on their broad and levell'd wings they soar.</l>
               <l>Then having torn themselves both neck and cheek,</l>
               <l>They to their right wing rise and fly away.</l>
               <l>What this should mean th'Assembly was to seek.</l>
               <l>And to them thus did <hi>Alitherses</hi> say.</l>
               <l>Hear me ye men of <hi>Ithaca</hi> (said he)</l>
               <l>And you the Suiters that are most concern'd.</l>
               <l>Destruction is rouling toward ye,</l>
               <l>Although it be not by your selves discern'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> from his Friends will not be long.</l>
               <l>And now from <hi>Ithaca</hi> far off is not,</l>
               <l>Seeing what daily done is in the throng.</l>
               <l>And how to kill the Suiters lays his plot.</l>
               <l>Nay many more beside the Suiters may</l>
               <l>Of their misfortune chance to have their part.</l>
               <l>If they desist not soon and come away.</l>
               <l>I speak not this at random but on Art.</l>
               <l>For all must come to pass I told him then,</l>
               <l>When with the <hi>Argive</hi> Lords he went to <hi>Troy,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That after twenty years he should agen</l>
               <l>Return with pain, his men all cast away.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Eurymachus,</hi> Old man go home,</l>
               <l>And there to your own Children prophesie,</l>
               <l>Lest to them any harm hereafter come.</l>
               <l>A better Prophet for these things am I.</l>

                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> far hence dead is certainly</l>
               <l>I know not where. I would thou wert as well.</l>
               <l>For then you would give over to enflame</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus,</hi> who but too angry is;</l>
               <l>In hope to get some Present for the same,</l>
               <l>If you will give it. But I tell you this,</l>

               <l>To set against us any young man here,</l>

We'll set a Fine upon your head so wise,</l>
               <l>Which you to pay will not be well content.</l>
               <l>I my self will <hi>Telemachus</hi> advise</l>
               <l>His Mother may be to her Father sent,</l>
               <l>To make the match, and on the Dower agree,</l>
               <l>Such as becomes him to his Daughter dear.</l>
               <l>Till that be done no hope at all I see</l>

                  <hi>Telemachus,</hi> as haughty as he is,</l>

               <l>And make us all expect her love in vain.</l>
               <l>And 'tis her vertue makes us thus to strive</l>

               <l>For many other Ladies we could wive,</l>
               <l>And be sufficiently delighted in.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> No more will I</l>
               <l>This matter to you press, or to the Woo'rs.</l>
               <l>You and the Gods know all, I do not lie.</l>
               <l>But I demand a Bark of twenty Oars.</l>
               <l>For I intend to travel for a while,</l>
               <l>To hear what men can of my Father say.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Lacedamon</hi> I will go, and <hi>Pyle,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or seek from <hi>Jove</hi> some notice of his way.</l>
               <l>And if alive he be and coming home,</l>
               <l>Though to my cost, I'll stay another year;</l>
               <l>If dead he be, then back again I'll come,</l>
               <l>And Rites of burial will give him here</l>
               <l>Splendid and well becoming his estate,</l>
               <l>And let my Mother her own liking take.</l>
               <l>Having thus spoken, down again he sate.</l>
               <l>And then <hi>Ulysses</hi> old friend <hi>Mentor</hi> spake,</l>
               <l>With whom <hi>Ulysses</hi> left his house in trust.</l>
               <l>Hear me, Ye <hi>Ithacesians,</hi> said he.</l>
               <l>Let no King ever be hereafter just,</l>

               <l>And if at <hi>Ithaca</hi> he mean t'abide,</l>
               <l>No news he will hear of him a great while.</l>
               <l>But never <hi>t'Ithaca</hi> shall come agen</l>

               <l>This said, dismiss'd and scatter'd were the men.</l>
               <l>And to <hi>Ulysses</hi> house the Suiters went,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> to the Sea-side, and pray'd,</l>

               <l>The Woo'rs in killing Cattle were imploy'd,</l>
               <l>And streight unto him went <hi>Antinous,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And laughing, took him by the hand and said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus,</hi> bold and brave Orator,</l>
               <l>Fear from us neither evil word nor deed.</l>
               <l>Eat and drink merrily as heretofore,</l>
               <l>We'll see you furnished with what you need</l>
               <l>Both Ship and Men, and see you soon convei'd</l>
               <l>To <hi>Pyle,</hi> that of your Father you may hear.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> then answered and said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Antinous,</hi> can I be merry here?</l>
               <l>D'ye think that yet too little was the wrong</l>
               <l>The Suiters did me, my estate to waste,</l>
               <l>When I perceiv'd it not, as being young?</l>
               <l>But since I grown am, and my childhood past,</l>
               <l>And somewhat know, and more hear others say,</l>
               <l>I'll do my best to bring them to their end,</l>
               <l>Whether yet I go to <hi>Pyle</hi> or here do stay.</l>
               <l>And yet to go to <hi>Pyle</hi> I do intend,</l>
               <l>And think my passage will not be in vain.</l>
               <l>For I go like a Merchant not a Guest,</l>
               <l>As if to me no Ship did appertain.</l>
               <l>It must be so. The Suiters think it best.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45587:21"/>
This said, his hand from his hand he snatch'd out.</l>
               <l>And then the Suiters that were in the Court,</l>
               <l>Some give him evil words, and others flour,</l>
               <l>And one another with him make good sport.</l>
               <l>He'll come from <hi>Pyle</hi> with Succours, God knows what</l>
               <l>(Said one) or <hi>Sparta,</hi> which shall on us fall.</l>
               <l>Or poyson bring from <hi>Ephiré;</hi> and that</l>
               <l>Put in the Temperer shall kill us all.</l>
               <l>Who knows (then said another) if he go,</l>
               <l>But he his Fathers fate may also have</l>
               <l>Whilst seeking him he wanders to and fro;</l>
               <l>Which would to us no little trouble save.</l>
               <l>His goods amongst us we should soon divide,</l>
               <l>And to his Mother leave his houses free</l>
               <l>And him she chuses to lie by her side.</l>
               <l>Thus they derided him. Then down went he</l>
               <l>Into a large and high rooft room where lay</l>
               <l>In Chests packt up great store of cloth of Gold,</l>
               <l>And Garments very many rich and gay,</l>
               <l>And many Barrels of sweet wine and old,</l>
               <l>Which for <hi>Ulysses</hi> were preserved there</l>
               <l>When he returned to his native Soil.</l>
               <l>In the same room many brass Vessels were,</l>
               <l>And many Barrels of sweet smelling Oyl.</l>
               <l>And double were the Locks upon the door,</l>
               <l>Whereof the Nurse <hi>Euryclea</hi> had the Key.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> call'd for her, and says to her,</l>

               <l>Fill me of wine twelve Pitchers of the best</l>

               <l>To <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and to <hi>Pyle</hi> I go,</l>
               <l>That of my Father, if alive or dead</l>
               <l>There any news be, I the same may know.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Euryclea</hi> then wept and sob'd, and said,</l>
               <l>Dear Child, why will you go from hence so far</l>
               <l>Alone? Your Mother you will make afraid,</l>

Your Father far off is already dead,</l>

               <l>And share your goods amongst them by the head.</l>

               <l>'Tis by the Counsel of a God I go.</l>
               <l>And I require you solemnly to swear</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> to th' Suiters went agen,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> in his likeness to the Town,</l>

               <l>From house to house she goeth up and down.</l>
               <l>And of <hi>Noemon</hi> borrowed a Bark,</l>
               <l>Who not unwillingly it to him lent.</l>
               <l>And now the Sun was down, the Streets were dark,</l>
               <l>And down to the Sea side the Goddess went.</l>
               <l>And the good Ship into the Sea they hale,</l>
               <l>And in it stow all that was needful for't.</l>
               <l>The Mariners were there together all,</l>
               <l>And ti'd the Ship at far end of the Port.</l>
               <l>Mean while the Suiters merrily carouse,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> then their fancies to confound,</l>
               <l>From the Sea-side went back into the house,</l>
               <l>And from their hands the Cups threw to the ground</l>
               <l>And with the love of sleep possest their eyes,</l>
               <l>And made them nod and let their eye-lids down.</l>
               <l>And not long after from their seats they rise,</l>
               <l>And for that night took lodging in the Town.</l>
               <l>Then like to <hi>Mentor</hi> both in Form and Voice,</l>

                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> he calleth out of doors.</l>
               <l>Your men are ready at the Port, she says,</l>
               <l>There they expecting you sit with their Oars.</l>
               <l>Then out they went, and <hi>Pallas</hi> led the way,</l>
               <l>And found the Rowers ready on the Beach.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> then said, Come back I pray,</l>
               <l>To th'house with me, our Victual thence to fetch.</l>
               <l>Which well put up I there have ready laid.</l>

               <l>Nor any else but I and one old Maid.</l>
               <l>Then with <hi>Telemachus</hi> to th'house they go,</l>

               <l>And now the Mariners their Tackle ply.</l>
               <l>First in the midst they set the Mast upright,</l>

With furled Sails the Ship did by them stand.</l>

               <l>For wherefore did you undertake this task,</l>
               <l>But of your Father to hear certainty?</l>
               <l>To <hi>Nestor</hi> then directly go and ask,</l>
               <l>If of <hi>Ulysses</hi> any thing he know.</l>

               <l>With one so old to answer and reply.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> (said <hi>Pallas)</hi> do not fear.</l>
               <l>You'll somewhat prompted be by your own brest</l>
               <l>(You never by the Gods neglected were)</l>
               <l>The God that loves you will supply the rest.</l>
               <l>Then up to <hi>Nestor</hi> they directly went,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> foremost. All about him there</l>
               <l>They found upon the Sacrifice intent,</l>
               <l>(His Sons and Lords) to hasten the good chear.</l>
               <l>Some broaching, and some roasting were of meat.</l>

               <l>Saluted them, and took them both by th'hands,</l>

               <l>Laid Sheepskins with the Wool upon the sands;</l>
               <l>And of the Entrails gave them part to eat.</l>
               <l>And to her hand held up a Cup of Wine.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Neptune</hi> (said he) offer up your Vow,</l>
               <l>For he expresly is the Pow'r Divine,</l>

               <l>Servant to <hi>Neptune.</hi> Whom if by some wile</l>
               <l>You could but catch and hold, he'd answer you</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45587:33"/>
To all you ask. And he my Father is.</l>
               <l>He'll tell you how to get your Ships to Sea;</l>
               <l>And how you shall get home. He knows all this,</l>
               <l>And what's there done. So said <hi>Idothoë.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But how (said I) is't possible for man</l>
               <l>Upon a God Immortal to lay hold,</l>
               <l>When he foreseeing it avoid it can,</l>
               <l>If how to do't he be not by you told?</l>
               <l>I'll tell you (said she) how it may be done.</l>
               <l>Hidden in the Curls of the Sea each day</l>
               <l>Brought in by <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> he lands at Noon,</l>
               <l>And on the sand himself to sleep will lay.</l>
               <l>About him will his footless Sea-calves lie,</l>
               <l>And of the brine abominably smell.</l>
               <l>And thither bring you in the morn will I,</l>
               <l>And how to place your selves instruct you well.</l>
               <l>For three more must come with you lusty men,</l>
               <l>Whom you shall chuse from out your company.</l>
               <l>The old Sea-God his flock will number then,</l>
               <l>And having done, i'th' midst of them will lie,</l>
               <l>Just as a Shepherd lies amongst his sheep.</l>
               <l>Now waver not, but bold and constant be.</l>
               <l>Assoon as you shall see he is asleep,</l>
               <l>Lay hold on him, and keep it constantly.</l>
               <l>For he in divers shapes will with you struggle.</l>
               <l>He will be any Serpent that he please.</l>
               <l>Himself he'll into Fire or Water juggle.</l>
               <l>Therefore hold fast, left he your hands disseize.</l>
               <l>When of himself he shall contented be</l>
               <l>In his first form the matter to debate;</l>
               <l>Take off your hands, and set the old God free.</l>
               <l>Then of your business him interrogate,</l>
               <l>What God it is that hath your hurt contrived.</l>
               <l>How you shall put to Sea. Which way go home.</l>
               <l>This said, into the Sea again she dived.</l>
               <l>Then full of thoughts back to my Ships I come,</l>
               <l>And supt. And when we supped had 'twas night.</l>
               <l>Then slept we by our ships upon the sand.</l>
               <l>But when <hi>Aurora</hi> had brought back the light,</l>
               <l>Then went I with my three men to the strand,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:45587:34"/>
And prayed to the Gods; my men I chose,</l>
               <l>Such men as for the purpose fit I thought.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Idothoë</hi> then from the Sea arose,</l>
               <l>And in her hand four Sea-calves skins she brought</l>
               <l>All raw, her Father thereby to betray.</l>
               <l>And with those skins upon us on the shore</l>
               <l>Scrap'd hollow by her, like Sea calves we lay.</l>
               <l>And there our lodging had been very sore,</l>
               <l>(For so abominably do they stink,</l>
               <l>That no man near them can endure to lie.</l>
               <l>Is it good lying with a Whale d'ye think?)</l>
               <l>But that she for it had a remedy.</l>
               <l>Ambrosia she with her brought, and laid</l>
               <l>The same unto our Noses one by one,</l>
               <l>Which the ill savour of the Fish allai'd.</l>
               <l>And thus we lay expecting till 'twas Noon.</l>
               <l>Then all at once the Sea-calves came ashore,</l>
               <l>And there themselves they bedded orderly.</l>
               <l>At noon came <hi>Proteus,</hi> and counts them o'r,</l>
               <l>And first were counted my three men and I.</l>
               <l>Then lay he also down. And by and by</l>
               <l>He fell asleep. Then we unto him ran,</l>
               <l>And laid hands on him with a hideous cry.</l>
               <l>And he to shew his wondrous Art began.</l>
               <l>A shaggy Lion first he seem'd to be;</l>
               <l>And then a Dragon; then a Leopard;</l>
               <l>And then a Boar; then Water; then a Tree.</l>
               <l>But still we kept our hold, and prest him hard.</l>
               <l>He weary was at last, and then he said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Atrides,</hi> how came you by so much skill</l>
               <l>To hold me thus? What God has me betrai'd?</l>
               <l>What needed you to vex me? What's your will?</l>
               <l>What need, said I, have you from me to hear,</l>
               <l>That bound am to this Isle, and know not how</l>
               <l>To put to Sea, nor what God holds me here,</l>
               <l>When you can tell me (for Gods all things know.)</l>
               <l>Then back, said he, to <hi>Greece</hi> you cannot come,</l>
               <l>Till you to <hi>Aegypt</hi> do return again,</l>
               <l>And pay to all the Gods a Hecatomb.</l>
               <l>That done, you shall pass safely o'r the Main.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45587:34"/>
Thus <hi>Proteus</hi> said. But that I must go first</l>
               <l>Back into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> an ill and long way,</l>
               <l>My heart to hear it ready was to burst.</l>
               <l>'Tis hard, said I, but I'll do all you say.</l>
               <l>But tell me of the <hi>Argives</hi> first, if they</l>
               <l>With their good Ships came all in safety home,</l>
               <l>That I and <hi>Nestor</hi> left behind at <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How many by the way they lost, and whom.</l>
               <l>Some of them scap'd, said he, and some are lost.</l>
               <l>But of the Princes lost are only twain</l>
               <l>In their return. (Upon the <hi>Trojan</hi> Coast</l>
               <l>You know who di'd.) And one the Gods detain.</l>
               <l>First <hi>Ajax</hi> ships by winds were laid aground</l>
               <l>At <hi>Gyrae,</hi> Rocks that on the Deep look down,</l>
               <l>And 'gainst the Sea protection there had found,</l>
               <l>However <hi>Pallas</hi> did upon him frown,</l>
               <l>But that a high provoking word he spake.</l>
               <l>I'll pass, said he, although the Gods say no.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Neptune</hi> then the Rock he sat on brake.</l>
               <l>Both he and it into the water go,</l>
               <l>Where, when he had drunk brine enough, he di'd.</l>
               <l>Your Brother also safely past the Sea,</l>
               <l>And came to <hi>Argos. (Juno</hi> was his Guide.)</l>
               <l>And when he was come near to Mount <hi>Malea,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Forc'd by soul weather he disbarked, where</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Thyestes</hi> formerly his age had spent.</l>
               <l>But now his son <hi>Aegistus</hi> dwelled there.</l>
               <l>The Gods then chang'd the wind, and homeward went.</l>
               <l>Full glad he was, and kiss'd the ground for joy,</l>
               <l>And from him fell the tears abundantly.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Aegistus</hi> that long sought him to destroy,</l>
               <l>Had plac'd a man on purpose to descry</l>
               <l>Th'arrival of the Fleet; whom he had hired</l>
               <l>To watch upon a Hill a year together,</l>
               <l>For Talents ten of Gold that he required,</l>
               <l>And tell him when the Fleet from <hi>Troy</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</l>
               <l>The Watchman saw them, and t' <hi>Aegistus</hi> went</l>
               <l>And gave him notice of their coming in.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Aegistus</hi> then t'effect his bad intent,</l>
               <l>Chose twenty lusty men, and them within</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:45587:35"/>
An Inner-room he placed out of sight.</l>
               <l>And a great Supper bids his men provide;</l>
               <l>Then down went, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to invite,</l>
               <l>With Horses and with Coaches to th'Seaside,</l>
               <l>And brought him up to Supper in great state.</l>
               <l>Then rose the Traytors that in ambush lay,</l>
               <l>And killed him as he at Supper sate.</l>
               <l>Not any man alive went thence away</l>
               <l>That with <hi>Atrides</hi> or with him took part.</l>
               <l>When of his Story he had made an end,</l>
               <l>To break with pity ready was my heart.</l>
               <l>In streams down on my cheeks the tears descend.</l>
               <l>I wished never more to see the Sun,</l>
               <l>And weeping on the sand my self I roll'd.</l>
               <l>But when my Lamentation was done,</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Proteus</hi> said again, Your weeping hold.</l>
               <l>Tears are no remedy. But make baste home.</l>
               <l>There lives <hi>Aegistus,</hi> or if he be slain</l>
               <l>Already by <hi>Orestes,</hi> you will come</l>
               <l>To his Interment. This chear'd me again.</l>
               <l>And then I asked further of him this,</l>
               <l>Since you have told me what's become of two,</l>
               <l>Tell me, the third that stays abroad, who 'tis,</l>
               <l>Alive or dead; though that will grieve me too.</l>
               <l>It is (said he) <hi>Ulysses.</hi> Whom I saw</l>
               <l>In th'Island where <hi>Calypso</hi> dwells, o'th' Shoar</l>
               <l>Weeping, who fain would come to <hi>Ithaca,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But with him neither has a Ship or Oar.</l>
               <l>And you, O <hi>Menelaus,</hi> shall not die</l>
               <l>In <hi>Argos</hi> (for 'tis otherwise decreed)</l>
               <l>But be convey'd <hi>t'Elyzium.</hi> For why,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Jupiter</hi> you wedded have the Seed.</l>
               <l>There humanes lead their lives in greatest ease.</l>
               <l>No Snow nor Frost there is. Refreshed there</l>
               <l>They are by <hi>Zephyr</hi>'s rising from the Seas.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Joves</hi> Son <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> dwelleth there.</l>
               <l>This said, into the Sea he went agen.</l>
               <l>But I with thoughts confused in my head</l>
               <l>Returned back unto my ships and men.</l>
               <l>And soon as we had sup'd the night was spread.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:45587:35"/>
Then back again into the <hi>Nyle</hi> we go,</l>
               <l>And offer'd to the Gods a Hecatomb;</l>
               <l>When we their anger had appeased so,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Agamemnon</hi> there we rais'd a Tomb.</l>
               <l>When this was done, for <hi>Argos</hi> we set sail,</l>
               <l>And quickly to our native Soil we came.</l>
               <l>Th'Immortal Gods gave us a lusty gale,</l>
               <l>And all the way continued the same.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus,</hi> yo've heard all I can say.</l>
               <l>But must not therefore streightway take your leave.</l>
               <l>Until th'eleventh or twelfth day you must stay,</l>
               <l>The Presents I intend you to receive.</l>
               <l>A Chariot you shall have and Horses three,</l>
               <l>And a fair Cup emboss'd to offer wine,</l>
               <l>That in your Vows you may remember me.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> I here have li'n</l>
               <l>Long time already. And my men at <hi>Pyle</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Are weary of expecting me. Else I</l>
               <l>Could stay a year, and never all that while</l>
               <l>My mind have on my house, or Family.</l>
               <l>So much I taken am with your discourse.</l>
               <l>But let my Present be some Monument:</l>
               <l>To <hi>Ithaca</hi> I'll never carry horse,</l>
               <l>They for the Plains are more convenient.</l>
               <l>Large Plains, which you have here in many places,</l>
               <l>And where store is of Wheat, and Rice, and Lote.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Ithaca</hi> there is no ground for races,</l>
               <l>Nor Pastures good enough to feed a Goat.</l>
               <l>In th'Isles about it, gallop can no Horse.</l>
               <l>In th'Isle it self, nor gallop, nor be fed.</l>
               <l>When he had made an end of his discourse,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Atrides</hi> smiling on him stroak'd his head.</l>
               <l>'Tis spoken, said he, like a gallant man,</l>
               <l>And that descended is of Noble blood.</l>
               <l>I'll give you other Presents (for I can)</l>
               <l>In place of these, that shall be full as good.</l>
               <l>A Monument kept in my Treasury,</l>
               <l>Of massie silver a fair Temperer,</l>
               <l>The work of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which was given me</l>
               <l>At <hi>Sidon,</hi> by the King, when I was there.</l>

Whilst they together thus discoursing staid,</l>
               <l>The bidden Guests, fat sheep, rich wine bring in,</l>
               <l>And bread their Wives upon the Tables laid,</l>
               <l>And about Supper busie were within.</l>
               <l>And now the Suiters at <hi>Ulysses</hi> house</l>
               <l>Were throwing of the Stone and Darts. And by</l>

               <l>Unto <hi>Antinous</hi> he spake, and said,</l>
               <l>When will <hi>Telemachus</hi> return from <hi>Pyle?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>My Ship I lent him, and am now afraid,</l>
               <l>I shall have need of her my self the while.</l>
               <l>For over into <hi>Elis</hi> I must pass.</l>
               <l>Twelve Mares of mine there go, and with the same</l>
               <l>Twelve unbroke Mules, their Foals, at grass.</l>
               <l>And some of them I would fetch home and tame.</l>
               <l>At this they star'd. For never dreamed they</l>
               <l>That in good earnest he would go to <hi>Pyle,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But in the fields would with some Herdsman stay,</l>
               <l>And there from us conceal himself a while.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Antinous</hi> then askt, When parted he?</l>
               <l>What Company went with him hence? His own</l>

               <l>And laid upon them planks at equal height.</l>
               <l>Then made his Mast, and set it up on end,</l>
               <l>His Rudder, and a place to sit and guide,</l>

               <l>Four days in making of the Raft he spent.</l>

               <l>This said, the Stream stood still and sav'd the man.</l>
               <l>But weary were his knees and arms. And Brine</l>
               <l>Abundance from his Mouth and Nostrils ran.</l>
               <l>And all his body swell'd was. And in fine</l>
               <l>Speechless and breathless was he like one dead.</l>

               <l>Unto his Servants then command he gave</l>

               <l>And to it set the Mules. Then came her Mother,</l>

               <l>And in a bag of Goat-skin pleasant wine.</l>

               <l>A curse of Oyl to help wash off the sweat.</l>
               <l>Then out, with whip and reins in hand did drive.</l>

               <l>The Mules soon at the River-side arrive,</l>
               <l>And pasture for them there was very sweet.</l>
               <l>And there the Mules first they unharnassed,</l>
               <l>Then pusht them off to graze on the Bank-side.</l>
               <l>The Clothes in Pits with water covered</l>
               <l>They tread, and who should fastest tread, they vi'd.</l>

                  <hi>Nausicaa</hi> then speaks, and to him says,</l>
               <l>You seem to be a good man and discreet.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Jove</hi> on good and bad such fortune lays,</l>
               <l>Happy or otherwise, as he thinks meet.</l>
               <l>And since distress is fallen to your share,</l>
               <l>You must contented be to suffer it.</l>
               <l>But seeing to this place arriv'd you are,</l>
               <l>You shall have Rayment, and what else is fit.</l>
               <l>The City I will shew you, and the name</l>
               <l>The people of this Isle are called by.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Phaeacians</hi> they are call'd. And I am</l>
               <l>Daughter of him that has th'Authority,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Alcinous</hi> the King. And then she cri'd</l>
               <l>Aloud unto the Maids to make them stay.</l>
               <l>Why (said she) run you so away and hide?</l>
               <l>D'ye think the man will carry you away?</l>
               <l>For why, no Enemy can come in hither,</l>
               <l>The Gods so with the Sea have wall'd us in.</l>
               <l>Nor stranger dwells here. But by evil weather</l>
               <l>To come to land this man hath forced been.</l>
               <l>Let's do him good. From <hi>Jove</hi> come Beggars all.</l>
               <l>And welcome to them is what e'r they get.</l>
               <l>Our givings to him will be very small.</l>
               <l>Go therefore set before him Wine and Meat,</l>
               <l>And wash him in the River, in such part</l>
               <l>As cover'd is from wind. And then they did</l>
               <l>(When they had given one another heart)</l>
               <l>Set him in such a place as they were bid.</l>
               <l>And gave him th'Oyl to scour his skin withal,</l>
               <l>And by him a good Cloak and Coat they laid,</l>
               <l>And then they bad him to his washing fall.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> answer'd then, and to them said,</l>
               <l>Stand further off, I pray fair Maids; for I</l>
               <l>My body naked am asham'd to show.</l>
               <l>Then stand they off, and tell their Mistress why.</l>
               <l>(For washing he must have put off his bough.)</l>
               <l>Then washed he his head andshoulders wide,</l>
               <l>And with his hand from's head stroak'd down the brine,</l>
               <l>And with the Cloathes that laid were by his side</l>
               <l>Arrai'd himself, that comely were and fine.</l>

Then <hi>Pallas</hi> to him came, and made him look</l>
               <l>Taller and broader than he was before;</l>
               <l>And from his Hair the colour gray she took,</l>
               <l>And made it like the Hyacynthine flower.</l>
               <l>As one by <hi>Vulcan</hi> or <hi>Athena</hi> taught</l>
               <l>Gold upon Silver skilfully had spread;</l>
               <l>So <hi>Pallas</hi> on <hi>Ulysses</hi> beauty wrought,</l>
               <l>And graceful Majesty upon his head.</l>
               <l>Then sat he on the Sands. <hi>Nausicaa</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then said unto her Maidens, Do you hear,</l>
               <l>How poor he look'd the first time we him saw.</l>
               <l>And now how like a God he does appear.</l>
               <l>And by the Gods, it may be, he was sent</l>
               <l>To dwell amongst the people of this place.</l>
               <l>With such a Husband I could be content</l>
               <l>(If he would stay) and think it no disgrace.</l>
               <l>Go Maids and set before him Wine and Meat.</l>
               <l>Away they went, and did as she them bad.</l>
               <l>And he fell to, and heartily did eat.</l>
               <l>For long before he nothing eaten had.</l>
               <l>Then harnessed the Mules and set them to,</l>
               <l>And folded and put up the Garments all.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nausicaa</hi> went up with Maidens two.</l>
               <l>And then unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> did she call.</l>
               <l>Rise, Stranger to the City let us go,</l>
               <l>That I may send you to my Fathers house,</l>
               <l>Where all the best <hi>Phaeacians</hi> you'll know.</l>
               <l>But hear you (for I think you cautelous).</l>
               <l>Whilst in the Fields the Coach is on the way,</l>
               <l>Amongst my Maidens follow it apace.</l>
               <l>But when you see it near the City, stay</l>
               <l>And that you may well understand the place,</l>
               <l>A Tow'r there is, you'll see it, for 'tis high.</l>
               <l>There 'twixt two Havens is a narrow way,</l>
               <l>You'll see it by the Masts, for Ships there lie.</l>
               <l>Near it the people meet o'th' Market-day.</l>
               <l>And there a Temple fair of <hi>Neptune</hi> stands,</l>
               <l>Of free-stone from the Quarry hewn and fit.</l>
               <l>For the <hi>Phaeacians</hi> imploy their hands</l>
               <l>On Shipping, and no other Art but it.</l>

For Bows and Arrows they care not a pin,</l>
               <l>But for such things as serve to pass the Seas.</l>
               <l>Ships, Cordage, Oars they take their pleasure in,</l>
               <l>And spend their time and labour upon these.</l>
               <l>I am afraid these men will censure me,</l>
               <l>And say (for Censurers are many here.)</l>
               <l>This handsome and tall fellow who is he,</l>
               <l>That's with <hi>Nausicaa,</hi> from God knows where?</l>
               <l>Where did she find him? Must he marry her?</l>
               <l>From some far Country he is landed here</l>
               <l>Wandring by Fortune, or a Traveller.</l>
               <l>For sure I am no such man dwelleth near.</l>
               <l>May be some God from Heav'n descended is,</l>
               <l>And to live with her always hither come.</l>
               <l>So, then to wed a Stranger better 'tis,</l>
               <l>Since she thinks none is good enough at home.</l>
               <l>For many seek her, and the best men here.</l>
               <l>So will they say, and 'twill to be my shame.</l>
               <l>For if another that had done it 'twere,</l>
               <l>I should my self condemn her for the same.</l>
               <l>For 'tis unseemly a sair Maid to see,</l>
               <l>That subject is t'her Parents Government,</l>
               <l>Converse with any man, unless she be</l>
               <l>First married, or their Parents give consent.</l>
               <l>And therefore, Stranger, if you mean to be</l>
               <l>Convoyed by my Father to your home,</l>
               <l>Do as I tell you. Near the way you'll see</l>
               <l>A Grove of Poplars. When you thither come</l>
               <l>You'll find my Father's Vineyard, from the Town</l>
               <l>As far as one that Holla's heard can be.</l>
               <l>And when you thither come, there sit you down</l>
               <l>Till at my Fathers house you think are we.</l>
               <l>Then to the City go; ask where does dwell</l>

               <l>So well his house is known to every one.</l>
               <l>And there go in, and on, until you find</l>

               <l>This said, her Whip upon the Mules laid she.</l>

Lamenting and desiring to go home,</l>

               <l>Out two and fifty lusty Youths to row.</l>

               <l>The Porches, Court, and Rooms with men were fill'd</l>

               <l>Two Kine, eight Swine, &amp; twice six fat Sheep kill'd,</l>
               <l>These flay'd and dress'd, and to the Tables brought,</l>

               <l>And when their thirst and hunger was displac't</l>
               <l>The Singer sung the Song in most request,</l>

               <l>T'invite him to it, and his mind to see.</l>
               <l>Then to <hi>Ulysses</hi> said <hi>Laodamas,</hi>

               <l>'Tis no dishonour for you in this place</l>
               <l>To shew your skill at any Game you know,</l>
               <l>As long as Feet and Hands continue strong</l>
               <l>Come try, and cast your careful thoughts away.</l>
               <l>Your Convoy ready is. 'Twill not be long</l>
               <l>Before you shall be set upon your way.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Laodamas</hi> (then said <hi>Ulysses)</hi> why</l>
               <l>To these your Games invite you me in scorn,</l>
               <l>Upon whose heart so many sorrows lie,</l>
               <l>And am to nothing with much haraship worn,</l>
               <l>And publikely a uppliant now sit,</l>

Think you that Pastimes for such men are fit,</l>
               <l>As from their Country wander in distress?</l>
               <l>Then spake <hi>Euryalus,</hi> uncivilly.</l>
               <l>No, no, said he, I do not think you are</l>
               <l>Much us'd to Pastimes of Activity,</l>
               <l>But rather one that of a Ship takes care</l>
               <l>That Merchant-men from place to place convays,</l>
               <l>And mindful of your fraught are, and can tell</l>
               <l>Which are to sudden wealth the nearest ways,</l>
               <l>What Merchandize will not, and what will sell,</l>
               <l>And in such boisterous Games has little skill.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> frowning on him then repli'd,</l>
               <l>My friend, such words are indiscreet and ill.</l>
               <l>The Gods their Gifts as they think fit divide.</l>
               <l>To one, of Beauty they deny the grace,</l>
               <l>But give him Language steddy and discreet,</l>
               <l>Whereby he honour'd is i'th' Publike Place,</l>
               <l>And men gaze on him going in the street.</l>
               <l>I another they have giv'n a fair aspect,</l>
               <l>Like that o'th' Gods, but have deni'd him wit.</l>
               <l>So find I in your person no defect;</l>
               <l>Only you want the Grace to say what's fit.</l>
               <l>Your words have put me into passion.</l>
               <l>In these your Games you say no skill have I.</l>
               <l>I thought my self inferiour to none</l>
               <l>Whilst on my youth and hands I could rely.</l>
               <l>But tamed now my strength is with much woe</l>
               <l>Wandring at Sea and often hurt in fight.</l>
               <l>Yet of your Games I'll make a trial so,</l>
               <l>Weak as I am. So much your words me bite.</l>
               <l>This said, he took up a much greater stone</l>
               <l>Than that which the <hi>Phaeacians</hi> had flung</l>
               <l>Nor hollow as a Coyt, his Cloak still on.</l>
               <l>And when above his head he had it swung,</l>
               <l>Swiftly away the Stone flew with a hum,</l>
               <l>Which made the brave-<hi>Phaeacian</hi> Seamen couch,</l>
               <l>As o'r their heads they heard it singing come,</l>
               <l>And out went all the other marks by much.</l>
               <l>For <hi>Pallas</hi> in the likeness of a man</l>
               <l>Did set a mark at where the stone did light,</l>

And said the diff'rence be discerned can</l>
               <l>By feeling, though a man had lost his sight.</l>
               <l>And to <hi>Ulysses,</hi> said she, Do not fear</l>
               <l>That any man i'th'Town shall out-throw this.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> very glad was this to hear,</l>
               <l>And that amongst them stood one friend of his.</l>
               <l>Then of himself, began to speak more high.</l>
               <l>Come Youths throw first as far as I have done,</l>
               <l>And then as far or further throw will I.</l>
               <l>And for the other Games come any one</l>
               <l>Since your sharp words provok't me have thereto,</l>
               <l>Buffets, or Wrestling, or to run the race,</l>
               <l>And see if you at these can me out-do,</l>
               <l>Any of you except <hi>Laodamas.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For I to him am come as to a friend</l>
               <l>Of whom I hope for succour in my need.</l>
               <l>He were a fool that with him would contend</l>
               <l>Without whose help his business cannot speed.</l>
               <l>But of the rest not any I refuse;</l>
               <l>And will contend with them for Mastery.</l>
               <l>For I know all the Games the best men use.</l>
               <l>To use the Bowe none abler is than I.</l>
               <l>When many of us had a mind to kill</l>
               <l>Some noted Foe, and all at once did shoot,</l>
               <l>Though every one of us had the same will,</l>
               <l>My Arrow was the first that found him out.</l>
               <l>At <hi>Ilium</hi> in trials of the Bowe</l>
               <l>None found I better than my self but one.</l>
               <l>'Twas <hi>Polyctetes.</hi> Of those that are now</l>
               <l>I think my self inferiour to none.</l>
               <l>With those of former tim I'll not compare,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Hercules,</hi> or <hi>Eurytus</hi> that durst</l>
               <l>Challenge <hi>Apollo. Apollo</hi> took a care</l>
               <l>That Prize should not be plai'd, &amp; kill'd him first,</l>
               <l>As far as other men can shoot an Arrow,</l>
               <l>So far I able am to dart a Spear.</l>
               <l>But lodging I have had at Sea so narrow</l>
               <l>That I may be out-run by some man here.</l>
               <l>So said <hi>Ulysses;</hi> and all silent sat</l>
               <l>Except the King, who thus unto him said,</l>

Stranger, there's no man here offended at</l>
               <l>The words you say. For open you have laid</l>
               <l>Your Vertue, when you were thereto constrain'd</l>
               <l>By the unjust reproaches of this man.</l>
               <l>For such it is as by none can be stain'd,</l>
               <l>But those that nothing say discreetly can.</l>
               <l>And hear me farther what I have to say,</l>
               <l>That t'other Hero's you the same may tell,</l>
               <l>Who with you and your Wife shall feasting stay,</l>
               <l>In what from other men we bear the bell.</l>
               <l>For Cuffs and Wrestling, not much praise we merit,</l>
               <l>But our good Ships and Feet are wondrous swift.</l>
               <l>And these Gifts from our Fathers we inherit,</l>
               <l>Dance, Song, Feasts, Fiddle, and of Garments shift,</l>
               <l>And Baths, and Beds. Dance you that dance the best</l>
               <l>Before the Stranger, that his friends among</l>
               <l>He may say how much we exceed the rest</l>
               <l>Of men, in Ships, in Running, Dance, and Song.</l>
               <l>Fetch out the Fiddle. Then the Squire went in</l>
               <l>To fetch the Fiddle. And the Judges rise</l>
               <l>In number nine, who had elected been</l>
               <l>By publike vote, of Games to hold Assize.</l>
               <l>And order took for large room in the middle,</l>
               <l>And made it to be plained well and even.</l>
               <l>When this was done, then brought out was the Fiddle,</l>
               <l>And by the Squire was to the Singer given.</l>
               <l>Then came the Youngmen that had learn't to dance,</l>
               <l>And of their age were yet but in the flowr,</l>
               <l>And to the middest of the place advance.</l>
               <l>Their feet play up and down like drops in show'r,</l>
               <l>Such sparkling feet <hi>Ulysses</hi> ne'r had seen.</l>
               <l>The Singer as he played sung the Song</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and what love had been</l>
               <l>Held secretly between them all along.</l>
               <l>And how in <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s house they us'd to meet;</l>
               <l>And what he gave her; how the prying Sun</l>
               <l>As they imbrac'd each other chanc'd to see't,</l>
               <l>And told her Husband <hi>Vulcan</hi> what was done.</l>
               <l>How <hi>Vulcan</hi> to his Forge in anger went,</l>
               <l>And on his Anvil hammer'd out strong Chains,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:45587:56"/>
Which neither could be broken, nor relent.</l>
               <l>And when he made an end had of his pains,</l>
               <l>Into the Chamber went where stood his bed.</l>
               <l>His Net o'th' Bed-posts, and the Beams he threw</l>
               <l>Like Spider-webs about a Chamber spread;</l>
               <l>And then to go to <hi>Lemnos</hi> made a shew.</l>
               <l>So subtile were the Chains and finely wrought,</l>
               <l>They could by none, although a God, be seen.</l>
               <l>How <hi>Mars</hi> to watch his going failed not.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Vulcan</hi> was gone out, then <hi>Mans</hi> went in.</l>
               <l>How <hi>Venus</hi> enter'd in, new come from <hi>Jove,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And by him sat. <hi>Mars</hi> took her by the hand,</l>
               <l>And to her said, Let's go to bed, my Love.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Vulcan</hi> is now at <hi>Lemnos</hi> gone a land.</l>
               <l>And how they went to bed and made the Net</l>
               <l>Fall down upon, and hold them as they lay.</l>
               <l>And how they knew no way from thence to get,</l>
               <l>But must till <hi>Vulcan</hi> came to free them stay.</l>
               <l>How <hi>Vulcan</hi> from hard by came quickly in.</l>
               <l>For back he came before he was half way.</l>
               <l>For by the Sun advertis'd he had been,</l>
               <l>And angerly turn'd back without delay;</l>
               <l>And roaring, to the Gods, he said, D'ye see</l>
               <l>What work is here, and how unseemly 'tis?</l>
               <l>And how <hi>Jove</hi>'s Daughter does dishonour me</l>
               <l>Because my Limbs are maim'd, and whole are his?</l>
               <l>I grant he's fair, nor doth as I do halt.</l>
               <l>Ought she to love him therefore more than me?</l>
               <l>For that my Parents is, and not my fault.</l>
               <l>But come ye Gods all, and their Posture see.</l>
               <l>I hate the sight, yet they must not therefore</l>
               <l>Hope e'r the sooner for that, to be free.</l>
               <l>The Net will suffer them to move no more,</l>
               <l>How keen soever on their love they be.</l>
               <l>And till her Father shall the Dow'r repay</l>
               <l>Which for the Girl although incontinent,</l>
               <l>I paid him down, 'cause fair, she was and gay,</l>
               <l>There they shall lie. This said, the Gods streight went</l>

               <l>And that by Arts which make his Ransome greater.</l>
               <l>And how <hi>Apollo</hi> did the Question put</l>

               <l>In such strong chains with <hi>Venus</hi> to be shut,</l>
               <l>While all the Gods are standing by and see.</l>
               <l>How <hi>Hermes</hi> said, O <hi>Phoebus,</hi> that I were</l>
               <l>In <hi>Mars</hi> his place, and did with <hi>Venus</hi> lie,</l>
               <l>And thrice as many Chains about us there,</l>
               <l>Though all the Gods and Goddesses stood by</l>
               <l>And how the Gods at this laught out again,</l>
               <l>Save <hi>Neptune</hi> only, who did never cease</l>
               <l>T'importune <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his wrath restrain,</l>

               <l>And that himself would pay him what was due</l>
               <l>If <hi>Mars</hi> did nor. How <hi>Vulcan</hi> said agen,</l>

               <l>Unsure the Suretiship is of fled men.</l>

               <l>And danc d with often changes on the ground,</l>
               <l>Applauded much by the Spectators all,</l>
               <l>Who with their praises made the place resound.</l>
               <l>O King (then said <hi>Ulysses)</hi> what you said</l>
               <l>Of how your men pass all the world beside</l>
               <l>In Noble Dance, can never be gainsaid.</l>
               <l>I see it to my wonder justifi'd.</l>
               <l>The King well pleased to the Princes spake.</l>
               <l>A worthy man the stranger seems to me.</l>
               <l>Let's think, upon what Present him to make.</l>
               <l>Twelve Princes in <hi>Phaeacia</hi> there be,</l>
               <l>And I the thirteenth am. Let's ev'ry one</l>
               <l>Bestow on him a handsome Cloak and Coat,</l>
               <l>Besides a Talent of pure Gold. That done</l>
               <l>Let it be all together to him brought,</l>
               <l>That he at Supper may sit chearfully.</l>
               <l>And you <hi>Euryalus</hi> go speak him fair.</l>
               <l>For what you said before was injury.</l>
               <l>Go therefore with some Gift your fault repair.</l>
               <l>This said, to fetch the Gifts they sent the Squire.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Euryalus,</hi> O King, since 'tis,</l>
               <l>That also I Present him, your desire;</l>
               <l>I will for reconcilement give him this</l>
               <l>My Sword, with Scabberd all of Ivory,</l>
               <l>And silver Hilt. The Present is not poor.</l>
               <l>And giving it, O Father though' (said he)</l>
               <l>I said amiss, pray think upon't no more.</l>
               <l>And may the Gods restore you to your Land,</l>
               <l>Since absent from your Friends you live in pain.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> took the Sword into his hand,</l>
               <l>And to <hi>Euryalus</hi> thus said again,</l>
               <l>And you my Friend, may you still happy be,</l>
               <l>And of this Sword for ever need have none,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:45587:58"/>
Which reconciling you have given me.</l>
               <l>And as he speaking was he put it on.</l>
               <l>The Sun now set, the King no longer tarri'd,</l>
               <l>But with the Lords went to his house to Sup.</l>
               <l>Along with them the Squires the Presents carri'd</l>
               <l>Unto the Queen <hi>Arete</hi> to lay up.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Alcinous</hi> then said unto the Queen,</l>
               <l>Let a fair Chest be streightway hither brought,</l>
               <l>And for the Stranger see there be laid in</l>
               <l>A comely and a well wash'd Cloak and Coat,</l>
               <l>And of warm water let a Bath stand by,</l>
               <l>That washing he may see the Presents there,</l>
               <l>And sit at Supper the more joyfully,</l>
               <l>And hearken to the Song with better chear.</l>
               <l>And I will give him this my Cup of Gold,</l>
               <l>That offring up unto the Gods the Wine,</l>
               <l>As often as he doth the Cup behold,</l>
               <l>He may both for his own health pray and mine.</l>
               <l>This said, the Maids commanded by the Queen,</l>
               <l>Set up a Caldron with a triple foot,</l>
               <l>Then make fire under, and pour water in.</l>
               <l>Keen was the fire, and soon the water hot.</l>
               <l>Mean while the Queen came in, and with her brought</l>
               <l>A curious chest, and into it laid in</l>
               <l>The Gold, and with it every Cloak and Coat,</l>
               <l>That by the Princes given him had been.</l>
               <l>And then unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> said, Take care</l>
               <l>You bind it fast, lest you be rob'd by one</l>
               <l>Or other, whilst aboard you sleeping are,</l>
               <l>Lest any thing should missing be and gone.</l>
               <l>And when she thus had him admonished,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> of the Chest pull'd down the lid,</l>
               <l>And girt it with a Cord of various thred,</l>
               <l>Thereby to know if any it undid.</l>
               <l>For that trick he by <hi>Circe</hi> taught had been.</l>
               <l>A Woman then unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> said,</l>
               <l>There stands your Bath. Which way you please go in.</l>
               <l>Then went he in, and not a little joy'd.</l>
               <l>For after he had left <hi>Calypso</hi>'s house</l>
               <l>Warm and sweet water he had never seen,</l>

               <l>When him the Maids wash'd and anointed had,</l>
               <l>Out from the Bath he came amongst the men</l>
               <l>With a clean Cloak and comely Garments clad.</l>
               <l>To th'Door the bright <hi>Nausicaa</hi> came then,</l>
               <l>And to <hi>Ulysses</hi> said, Stranger farewel,</l>
               <l>And may you safely at your Land arrive.</l>
               <l>Remember that into my hand you fell,</l>
               <l>And owe to me that you were kept alive.</l>
               <l>O (said <hi>Ulysses)</hi> Daughter of the King,</l>
               <l>To you the Ransom of my life is due.</l>
               <l>And if the Gods me to my Country bring,</l>
               <l>As to a Goddess I will pray to you.</l>
               <l>This said, he went and sate down by the King.</l>
               <l>And now the Meat in Messes some divided,</l>
               <l>Others the lusty wine were tempering,</l>
               <l>And by a Squire the Singer in was guided;</l>
               <l>And at a Pillar in the midst made sit.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> half a Chine of Pork and sat</l>
               <l>Cuts off, and in the Squires hands putteth it,</l>
               <l>And said unto him, Give the Singer that.</l>
               <l>Singers through all the world have reputation,</l>
               <l>And well respected be in ev'ry land.</l>
               <l>The Muses teach them Song, and love the Nation.</l>
               <l>Then went the Squire and put it in his hand.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Demodocus</hi> receiv'd it and was glad.</l>
               <l>Then fell they to the Meat before them laid.</l>
               <l>When Thirst and Hunger overcome they had,</l>
               <l>Unto the Singer then <hi>Ulysses</hi> said,</l>

               <l>I'th'end they all resolved on the last.</l>

               <l>We are a part of <hi>Agamemnons</hi> Bands,</l>

               <l>He is the God of Hospitality,</l>

               <l>Thus I. But he replied with fell intent,</l>

               <l>That counsel'st me to fear the punishment</l>

               <l>This was to sound me. But I saw his mind,</l>
               <l>And a deceitful answer did intend.</l>
               <l>My Ship was wreckt by <hi>Neptune,</hi> and by wind</l>

               <l>To this he answer'd nothing, nor said more;</l>
               <l>But snatching up a couple from the ground,</l>
               <l>Knocks out their brains, like whelps against the floor.</l>
               <l>Then cuts them into joynts, and on them fed:</l>

               <l>When he with humane flesh his belly deep</l>
               <l>Had filld, and drunk the milk that stood him by,</l>
               <l>He laid himself along amongst his sheep,</l>
               <l>And slept. And then I saw I might him slay:</l>
               <l>'Twas but to draw my good Sword from my side,</l>
               <l>And gently on his brest my hand to lay,</l>
               <l>And to the hilts the Sword in's body hide.</l>
               <l>Upon new thoughts that purpose I gave o're;</l>
               <l>For certainly it had destroy'd us quite:</l>
               <l>So great the stone was that lay on the door,</l>
               <l>That to remove it was past all our might.</l>
               <l>So there we sighing staid for day: and when</l>
               <l>The Rosie-finger'd morning did appear,</l>
               <l>He made a fire, and milkt his flock agen,</l>
               <l>And the young Kids and Lambs new suckled were.</l>
               <l>When all his work was at an end, and past,</l>
               <l>Two more of my Companions he takes,</l>
               <l>And on those two he quickly breaks his fast,</l>
               <l>And for his Flock the way he open makes.</l>
               <l>For easily he took the stone away,</l>
               <l>And then again with no less ease he did</l>
               <l>Set up the same, and in its right place lay,</l>
               <l>Than of a Quiver one would do the Lid.</l>
               <l>His flock with noise he drives up to the hills,</l>
               <l>And in the Den leaves us to meditate</l>
               <l>How to revenge (with <hi>Phoebus</hi> help) our ills.</l>
               <l>At last within my brest this counsel sate.</l>
               <l>Near one o'th' Pens there lay an Olive-Tree,</l>
               <l>Straight, and the boughs cut off, which when 'twas dri'd,</l>

               <l>Of the great <hi>Cyclops;</hi> which when we espi'd,</l>
               <l>Of some good Ship we thought might be the Mast,</l>
               <l>Or of a Bark of twenty Oars or more,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Neptunes</hi>

               <l>With a great burthen safe from shore to shore.</l>
               <l>Of this a fathom I cut off, and gave it</l>
               <l>To my Companions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <l>They smooth'd and taper'd it as I would have it;</l>
               <l>I sharpn'd it at point as I thought fit.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:45587:64"/>
Then in the fire the same I hardned well,</l>
               <l>And laid it by with Dung all cover'd o're,</l>
               <l>Which in the Cave from so much Cattle sell;</l>
               <l>For sheep and goats there always were good store.</l>
               <l>From all my Company, who did not fear</l>
               <l>To help me thrust this Bar into his eye,</l>
               <l>I took out four by lot, and such they were</l>
               <l>As I my self did wish; the fifth was I.</l>
               <l>At Ev'ning he returneth with his sheep,</l>
               <l>Into the hollow Cave he brings them all:</l>
               <l>Without, he neither sheep nor goat did keep,</l>
               <l>By Presage, or upon some Heav'nly Call.</l>
               <l>Then with the stone the Caves mouth up he dams,</l>
               <l>And milks his she-goats and his Ews each one;</l>
               <l>And suckles all his young Kids, and his Lambs.</l>
               <l>But after he his work had fully done,</l>
               <l>Another couple of my men he took.</l>
               <l>Then having in my hand an Ivy Kan</l>
               <l>Of good black Wine, I thus unto him spoke:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cyclops,</hi> since you have eaten flesh of man,</l>
               <l>Here, drink this good black Wine upon't, and see</l>
               <l>What excellent good drink we had aboard,</l>
               <l>Whereof I've hither brought a taste to thee,</l>
               <l>Hoping you will some kindness me afford,</l>
               <l>And some assistance in our Voyage home.</l>
               <l>But so intolerably furious</l>
               <l>You are, that no man will dare near you come,</l>
               <l>Knowing how cruel you have been to us.</l>
               <l>When I had said, the good Wine he drank up,</l>
               <l>And was extremely pleased with the same:</l>
               <l>And straightway calling for another Cup,</l>
               <l>Tell me (quoth he) right now what is thy name;</l>
               <l>And I will give thee that shall please thy heart.</l>

               <l>But this some branch of Nectar is divine.</l>
               <l>When he had said, I gave him Wine again.</l>
               <l>Three times I fill'd the Kan, and he as oft</l>
               <l>Drank't off. But when it came up to his brain,</l>
               <l>Then spake I to him gentle words and soft.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:45587:65"/>
                  <hi>Cyclops,</hi> since you my name desire to know,</l>
               <l>I'll tell it you, and on your word rely.</l>
               <l>My name is <hi>Noman;</hi> all men call me so,</l>
               <l>My Father, Mother, and my Company.</l>
               <l>To which he soon and sadly made reply,</l>

               <l>And that's the gift I promised to give you.</l>
               <l>And having said, he laid himself along</l>
               <l>With bended neck, sleeping and vomiting</l>
               <l>Gobbets of Humane Flesh, and Wine among.</l>
               <l>All he before had eaten uttering.</l>
               <l>The Bar with Embers then I covered,</l>
               <l>Till (green as 'twas) with heat I made it shine;</l>
               <l>And with few words my men encouraged,</l>
               <l>Left any should have shrunk from the designe.</l>
               <l>The Bar now hot, and ready to flame out,</l>
               <l>And (though green wood) yet glowing mightily,</l>
               <l>To him my Fellows carried, now stout,</l>
               <l>And set the point thereof upon his eye.</l>
               <l>But I my self erecting with my hand,</l>
               <l>Twirled the Bar about, with motion nimble,</l>
               <l>As Joyners with a string below do stand.</l>
               <l>To give a piercing motion with a wimble.</l>
               <l>So whilst the Brand was entring, I it turn'd.</l>
               <l>The blood that down along it ran was hot;</l>
               <l>And with his Eye the Lids and Brows were burn'd,</l>
               <l>And all his Eye-strings with the fire did strut</l>
               <l>As when a Smith hath heat his Axe or Spade,</l>
               <l>And quickly quenches it while hot it is,</l>
               <l>To harden it, it makes a noise; so made</l>
               <l>His great moist Eye the glowing Brand to hiss.</l>
               <l>He roared so as made the Rocks resound,</l>
               <l>And from his Eye, he pull'd with both his hands</l>
               <l>The burning Brand, and threw it to the ground;</l>
               <l>And so a while he there amazed stands.</l>
               <l>And thence for more <hi>Cyclopses</hi> calls; and they</l>
               <l>(Who dwelt about in every hollow Cave)</l>
               <l>Came in, some one, and some another way;</l>
               <l>And from without the Den ask'd what he'd have.</l>

               <l>I so deceived had, and gull'd by craft.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Cyclops</hi> for the stone now groap'd about,</l>
               <l>Found it, and threw it down, though pained sore;</l>
               <l>Thinking to catch us at our coming out,</l>
               <l>Sitting with Arms extended in the door.</l>
               <l>Such fools he thought us: but I formerly</l>
               <l>Had thought upon the course I was to take;</l>
               <l>And all my cunning, and my Art to try,</l>
               <l>Since no less than our lives was now at stake,</l>
               <l>This Counsel 'twas that in my brest then sat;</l>
               <l>Male sheep there were within the Cave well fed,</l>
               <l>Fair, big, and deeply clad in wool and fat,</l>
               <l>And these, with twigs ta'ne from <hi>Cyclops</hi> his bed,</l>
               <l>I bound together three and three; each three</l>
               <l>Bore one under the middlemost fast bound:</l>
               <l>One Ram, by far the best of all bore me</l>
               <l>Under his brest, my hands in deep wool wound.</l>
               <l>Thus hung we constantly, expecting day.</l>
               <l>The morning came, the Males to pasture hie,</l>
               <l>(The Ews with strutting Udders bleating stay)</l>
               <l>Their Master sitting there in misery,</l>
               <l>Laid's hand upon their backs as out they past,</l>
               <l>Ne'r thinking of their Bellies we were under.</l>
               <l>Mine heavy with his wool and me came last,</l>
               <l>To whom the <hi>Cyclops</hi> said, seeming to wonder,</l>
               <l>Why, silly Ram, art thou the last to come</l>
               <l>Out of the Cave, that formerly was ever</l>
               <l>The foremost to go out, and to come home,</l>
               <l>And foremost at the going to the River;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:45587:66"/>
But now at last? Is't for thy Masters eye,</l>
               <l>Which <hi>Noman</hi> and his Fellows have put forth?</l>
               <l>O couldst thou speak, and tell me where doth lie</l>
               <l>Hidden within, that <hi>Noman</hi> nothing worth,</l>
               <l>I soon would with his brains besmear the floor,</l>
               <l>And ease my vexed heart within me so,</l>
               <l>Which <hi>Noman</hi> hath within me wounded sore.</l>
               <l>This said, he let the Ram that bore me go.</l>
               <l>Got forth a little from the Den and Yard,</l>
               <l>I left my Ram, and set my Fellows free:</l>
               <l>Unto my Ships I brought part of the Herd,</l>
               <l>That to our Fellows we might welcome be,</l>
               <l>We that escapt: But they began to weep</l>
               <l>For those we left behinde us dead, till I</l>
               <l>Commanded them to fetch aboard more sheep,</l>
               <l>And after that their Oars again to ply.</l>
               <l>They brought in more, and each man takes his seat,</l>
               <l>And in due order, with his Oar in hand,</l>
               <l>The water grey into a foam they beat,</l>
               <l>And rowed us a little way from Land,</l>
               <l>As far as one that hollows can be heard;</l>
               <l>So far I stood from shore, I hollow'd then;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cyclops, Cyclops,</hi> why were you not afraid</l>
               <l>To kill and eat, as you have done, my men?</l>
               <l>For since you strangers do so ill intreat,</l>
               <l>And of the Gods themselves no reck'ning make,</l>
               <l>You ought to have expected vengeance great,</l>
               <l>And that your wicked deeds should you o'retake.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Cyclops</hi> then provoked with this mock,</l>
               <l>Threw a great stone at us with all his might;</l>
               <l>And first he swing'd round o're his head the Rock,</l>
               <l>Which just behinde the Rudder chanc'd to light;</l>
               <l>And so much stir'd the water falling in,</l>
               <l>That what with th'eddy and'tide from the Main,</l>
               <l>Brought back to th'Land, and sure we dead had bin,</l>
               <l>But that I quickly thrust it off again.</l>
               <l>Then bad I my Companions to row</l>
               <l>Still further off, till we were out of fear.</l>
               <l>They pli'd their Oars again; and we were now</l>
               <l>At twice the distance that before we were.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:45587:66"/>
And then again I to the <hi>Cyclops</hi> spoke,</l>
               <l>(Though my companions would have hindred me)</l>
               <l>Why (say they) will you still the man provoke?</l>
               <l>How great a stone, how far he throws, you see,</l>
               <l>How near to Land we were, how near to die.</l>
               <l>If he but any one of us hear speak,</l>
               <l>A Rock will straightway from him hither fly,</l>
               <l>And knock our brains out, and our Vessel break.</l>
               <l>So said they; but with me could nothing do,</l>
               <l>I was resolv'd to vex him bitterly.</l>
               <l>

               <l>Some of them would have come and brought me word,</l>
               <l>For I staid long enough. This said, my Bowe</l>
               <l>I took, and at my side my trusty Sword,</l>
               <l>And bad him guide me back the self-same way.</l>
               <l>Then fell he at my feet on both his knees,</l>
               <l>And weeping me intreats to let him stay;</l>
               <l>Your life, quoth he, amongst the rest you'll leese.</l>
               <l>To this I said, <hi>Eurylochus</hi> stay you</l>
               <l>Here at the ship (since you are frighted so)</l>
               <l>Eating and drinking with the rest o'th' Crew;</l>
               <l>Necessity compelleth me to go.</l>
               <l>This said, I went along the shore, till I</l>
               <l>Was at the entrance of the Valley, where</l>
               <l>The house of <hi>Circe</hi> stood. Then <hi>Mercury</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Encountred me. In form he did appear</l>
               <l>Of a fair youth, whose Beard but now began</l>
               <l>In a soft Down to peep above his face,</l>
               <l>Which is the prime of beauty in a man.</l>
               <l>Alas, said he, what make you in this place</l>
               <l>'Mongst trees and shrubs? For I can tell you this,</l>
               <l>Your Mates at <hi>Circe</hi>'s house are lodg'd in sties,</l>
               <l>They now are Swine; you'll of your purpose mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</l>
               <l>You cannot set them free though you be wise,</l>
               <l>But rather you will with them lie. But well,</l>
               <l>I'll give you such an Antidote as you</l>
               <l>Need not to be afraid of any Spell;</l>
               <l>And will besides, her purpose to you shew.</l>
               <l>To make you drink she'll temper you a Cup,</l>
               <l>Which shall not (for the Antidote) bewitch you;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:45587:71"/>
And when she sees that you have drunk it up,</l>
               <l>With her long Wand she presently will switch you.</l>
               <l>Then to her with your naked Sword in hand,</l>
               <l>As if you purpos'd to cut off her head.</l>
               <l>Then she will shriek, and weep, and trembling stand,</l>
               <l>And buy her life with proffer of her bed.</l>
               <l>You must not then refuse the Goddess love,</l>
               <l>If you intend your Fellows to restore:</l>
               <l>Yet make her swear by all the Gods above</l>
               <l>She never will attempt to hurt you more.</l>
               <l>Then gave he me the Herb. The Flow'r was white,</l>
               <l>The Root was black; the Gods do call it Moly,</l>
               <l>And gather it, who have no stint of might.</l>
               <l>For men to think to finde it is a folly.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Hermes</hi> parting mounted to the Sky,</l>
               <l>And I to <hi>Circe</hi>'s house went on my way,</l>
               <l>And musing stood a while, but by and by</l>
               <l>I call'd, and she came forth without delay,</l>
               <l>And calls me in. I enter with sad heart;</l>
               <l>There in a glorious Chair she made me sit</l>
               <l>Studded with silver-Nails, and carv'd with Art;</l>
               <l>Then puts a low Stool to it for my feet,</l>
               <l>And brought the Potion in a Golden Cup,</l>
               <l>Which she had temper'd to her bad designe.</l>
               <l>And soon as ever I had drunk it up</l>
               <l>She switch'd and bad me go lie with the Swine.</l>
               <l>Then start I up with my drawn Sword, and make</l>
               <l>As if I purpos'd to cut off her head.</l>
               <l>Then did she shriek most fearfully and quake,</l>
               <l>And weeping to me these words uttered:</l>
               <l>Who, whence are you? what is your Fathers Name?</l>
               <l>That this drink worketh not, is very strange.</l>
               <l>If any else but tasted had the same,</l>
               <l>He soon had of his figure found a change.</l>
               <l>But you a stubborn heart have in your brest.</l>
               <l>Are you <hi>Ulysses,</hi> that should hither come,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Hermes</hi> told me oft, and be my Guest,</l>
               <l>When from the <hi>Trojan</hi> shore he sailed home?</l>
               <l>Put up your Sword; and that we may confide</l>
               <l>In one another better without dread,</l>
               <l>

Let's to my Chamber go, and side by side</l>
               <l>Compose the things we differ in a bed.</l>

               <l>This said, she swore, and I gave way to love.</l>
               <l>On <hi>Circe</hi> Waiting-women four attended</l>

               <l>Hath granted to peruse Fates Register,</l>
               <l>And know the History of things not done.</l>
               <l>The Ghosts to him stand up when he goes by.</l>
               <l>At this my heart was ready ev'n to break,</l>
               <l>And in the bed long time I weeping lie,</l>
               <l>And turn'd, and wish'd for death. At last I speak:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Circe</hi> (said I) who shall me thither guide?</l>
               <l>Never man yet to Hell went in a ship.</l>

Then to me <hi>Circe</hi> presently repli'd;</l>

                  <hi>Ulysses,</hi> let not that thought break your sleep.</l>
               <l>You need but set your Mast up, hoise your sail,</l>
               <l>And then sit still; you shall not want a Winde:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Boreas</hi> to wast you will not fail.</l>
               <l>When you are come to th'Oceans end, you'll finde</l>

               <l>Such is the drink that's offer'd to the dead.</l>
               <l>And further to them you must make a Vow,</l>

               <l>This said, <hi>Aurora</hi> had the light displai'd,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Circe</hi> cloath'd me with a Coat and Vest,</l>
               <l>

And with a pure white robe her self arraid,</l>
               <l>With a Gold Girdle girt beneath her brest;</l>
               <l>And put upon her head her Vail. Then I</l>
               <l>Went through the house to make my fellows rise,</l>
               <l>And gently said unto them severally,</l>
               <l>Let's go; for <hi>Circe</hi> now doth so advise.</l>
               <l>And well content they were. But safe away</l>
               <l>I could not bring them all. For there was one</l>

                  <hi>Elpenor,</hi> neither forward in a Fray,</l>
               <l>Nor yet of very much discretion;</l>
               <l>Heated with Wine o'r night, himself to cool,</l>
               <l>Up to the houses top he went to sleep;</l>
               <l>But wak'd with noise the rest made, like a Fool</l>
               <l>Ne'r thought of coming down the stairs steep</l>
               <l>Backward; and so to th'earth he headlong sell,</l>
               <l>And broke his Neck-bone, &amp; lay dead o'th'ground.</l>
               <l>And his Soul leaving him, went down to Hell.</l>
               <l>The rest came forth, and stood about me round.</l>
               <l>To these I said, You think without delay</l>
               <l>That we to <hi>Ithaca</hi> are going now;</l>
               <l>But <hi>Circe</hi> bids us go another way,</l>

               <l>The <hi>Theban</hi> Prophet, who is now in Hell.</l>
               <l>This broke the very heart strings of my Mates;</l>

               <l>How to avoid what's once decreed by th'Fates.</l>
               <l>Then to our ship we weeping went. Mean space</l>

               <l>Our Ship lay which we shov'd into the deep;</l>

               <l>Aboard with us one Male, one Female sheep.</l>
               <l>And so for Hell we stood, with fears in minde,</l>
               <l>And tears in eye. But the fair <hi>Circe</hi> sent</l>
               <l>To bear us company, a good fore-winde</l>

               <l>And thither fetcht the sheep for sacrifice.</l>
               <l>Then with my Sword i'th'ground I dig'd a Pit,</l>

               <l>And round again pure Wine pour after it,</l>

               <l>And vowed to those feeble folk, to kill</l>
               <l>As soon as I to <hi>Ithaca</hi> should come</l>
               <l>A barren Heiser, and the Altar fill</l>
               <l>With many more good things I had at home,</l>
               <l>And promis'd to <hi>Tiresias</hi> alone</l>

When I my Vows and Pray'rs had ritely done,</l>
               <l>Of both the Victims straight I cut the throats.</l>
               <l>Their reaking blood stream'd down into the Pit;</l>
               <l>Out come the Ghosts, Maids, Youths, decrepit Age,</l>
               <l>And tender Virgins, they all sented it;</l>
               <l>And Warriours clad in goary Arms, all rage,</l>
               <l>And rushing out of Hell, with hideous cry,</l>
               <l>About the blood bustling they go and turn,</l>
               <l>Which not a little frighted me. Then I</l>
               <l>Bad flay the Victims, and their bodies burn,</l>
               <l>And say their Pray'rs to <hi>Pluto</hi> and his Queen.</l>
               <l>With Sword in hand I sat on the Pits brink,</l>
               <l>Resolv'd till I <hi>Tiresias</hi> had seen,</l>
               <l>That not a Ghost a drop of blood should drink.</l>
               <l>First came my Souldier <hi>Elpenor</hi>'s Spirit,</l>
               <l>Which left the body just when we set sail,</l>
               <l>So that we had no leisure to inter it.</l>
               <l>His heavy fate I did with tears bewail.</l>
               <l>How now (quoth I) <hi>Elpenor?</hi> art thou here</l>
               <l>Already? Couldst thou me so much outstrip?</l>
               <l>I first came forth, and left thee in the Rear.</l>
               <l>Hast thou on foot out gone my good black ship?</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Elpenar,</hi> Issue of <hi>Jove,</hi> Divine</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses,</hi> I had come along with th'Bark,</l>
               <l>But that the Devil and excess of Wine</l>
               <l>Made me to fall, and break my neck i'th' dark.</l>
               <l>I went to bed late by a Ladder steep;</l>
               <l>At top o'th'house the Room was where I lay:</l>
               <l>Wak't at the noise of parting, half asleep</l>
               <l>Headlong I hither came, the nearest way.</l>
               <l>Now I adjure you by your Father, and</l>
               <l>Your VVife, and Son, and all his Seed to come</l>
               <l>(For I assured am that you will land</l>

               <l>To see I have the Rites due to the dead.</l>
               <l>Fear th'anger of the Gods above, and burn</l>
               <l>My body with my arms, from foot to head,</l>
               <l>And cast on earth to cover o're my Urn.</l>
               <l>This done, for men hereafeer sailing by,</l>
               <l>Raise me a little Tomb of Earth by th'shore,</l>

That they may eas'ly see where 'tis I lie.</l>
               <l>Lastly, upon it upright plant my Oar.</l>
               <l>All this (quoth I) I'll do upon my word.</l>
               <l>Thus we discours'd amongst the shades. He stood</l>
               <l>While I continu'd with my naked Sword</l>
               <l>To keep the Sprights from tasting of the blood,</l>
               <l>Then came <hi>Auticlia</hi> my Mothers Ghost.</l>
               <l>Alive I left her when to <hi>Troy</hi> I sail'd</l>
               <l>To fight against it in the <hi>Argive</hi> Host.</l>
               <l>Now seeing her, exceedingly I wail'd.</l>
               <l>And though I grieved were to keep away</l>
               <l>My Mother from the loved blood; yet still</l>
               <l>In the same posture patiently I stay,</l>
               <l>Till I might know <hi>Tiresias</hi> his will.</l>
               <l>Then came the Soul of old <hi>Tiresias,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And of the Gilded-Staff he had in's hand.</l>
               <l>Poor man (quoth he) perceiving what I was,</l>
               <l>What brought thee hither to this ugly Land?</l>
               <l>Stand back a while, and take your Sword away,</l>
               <l>That I may drink, and the Unerring word</l>
               <l>Of Fate deliver to you. I obey,</l>
               <l>Retire, and up I put my trusty Sword.</l>
               <l>Then said the good old Prophet, You are come,</l>
               <l>Honour'd <hi>Ulysses,</hi> to inquire of me,</l>
               <l>What the Gods say about your going home.</l>

               <l>Yet for all that, you may to <hi>Ithaca</hi>

               <l>This said, the Company deep silence seiz'd,</l>

               <l>His look, his stature, and his Noble heart?</l>
               <l>My Guest he is, but you have all a share</l>

               <l>Old <hi>Echineus</hi> said, The Queen says right;</l>
               <l>We shall do well her counsel to obey:</l>
               <l>But since in King <hi>Alcinous</hi> lies the migh,</l>
               <l>'Tis better first to hear what he will say.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Alcinous,</hi> It shall be so,</l>
               <l>Unless I bear the name of King in vain;</l>
               <l>Let not the Stranger till to morrow go;</l>

               <l>It will not trouble me. Nay, that I'd chuse,</l>
               <l>Since you intend to send me rich away:</l>
               <l>For I am sure I shall no honour lo e</l>
               <l>By coming richly home. Kings that have store</l>

               </l>
               <l>I know enough; 'twas I brought him to <hi>Troy</hi>
               </l>
               <l>From <hi>Scyros</hi> Isle. In Councel always he</l>
               <l>First spake his minde, and never spake but well.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nestor,</hi> and I sometimes, and only we</l>
               <l>Th'advice he gave were able to refel.</l>
               <l>In fight he sought no shelter in the throng,</l>

               <l>The names of all he slew I cannot tell;</l>
               <l>They are too many. But 'twas by his Sword</l>

The power had of ord'ring all things there,</l>
               <l>I never saw your Son to wipe his eye,</l>
               <l>Or to wax pale, as many of us did.</l>
               <l>He ever longed to be set on land</l>
               <l>From out the hole in which we all lay hid;</l>
               <l>And to his Hilt he often put his hand,</l>
               <l>And often to his Spear. And when at last</l>
               <l>We won and rifled had the Town of <hi>Troy,</hi>

               <l>For whom the <hi>Argives</hi> did lament no less</l>

               <l>Your mighty heart a while. So ended I.</l>
               <l>To this just nothing he repli'd, but went</l>

Yet there, I think, he would have been content</l>

               <l>Thousands of Souls about me gathered,</l>

               <l>(To be a Monument) upon his Urn;</l>

               <l>Twelve feet she has in all, and ugly ones.</l>
               <l>Six huge long necks; and to each neck a head.</l>

               <l>Half of her body in the Cave she hides;</l>

               <l>There is no labour but you bear it can;</l>
               <l>Your limbs of stubborn steel composed be.</l>
               <l>But you consider not your Mates are tir'd</l>
               <l>With their continual tugging at the Oar,</l>
               <l>And that refreshment is and sleep requir'd,</l>
               <l>Which is not to be had but on the shore,</l>
               <l>But you would have us wander in the night,</l>
               <l>When in the night the greatest winds arise,</l>
               <l>The bane of ships; and when depriv'd of light,</l>
               <l>To save our selves we can no way devise.</l>
               <l>What if great winds should blow from South or West,</l>
               <l>Which often happens, though their King not know</l>
               <l>Or not consent? Therefore I think it best</l>
               <l>To night to sup ashore, to morrow row.</l>
               <l>So said <hi>Eurylochus,</hi> and was commended</l>
               <l>By all my Mates: and presently I knew</l>
               <l>One Daemon or another had intended</l>
               <l>To ruine me, together with my Crew.</l>
               <l>Then said I to <hi>Eurylochus,</hi> 'Twere vain</l>
               <l>To strive against so many men alone.</l>
               <l>But you shall take an Oath that you'll abstain</l>
               <l>From hurting of the Cattle of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of <hi>Circe</hi>'s meat there's left us yet good store.</l>
               <l>This said, they took the Oath; which having done,</l>
               <l>They put into the Harbour, and ashore</l>
               <l>They sup. And when their hunger now was gone,</l>
               <l>Their Mates remembring that in th' hollow Rock</l>
               <l>By th'monster <hi>Scylla</hi> were devour'd, they weep</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:45587:86"/>
And wail, and with their hands they knock</l>
               <l>Their brests, and in that posture fell asleep.</l>
               <l>The Stars had climb'd a third part of the Sky,</l>
               <l>When with a Whirl-winde <hi>Jove</hi> together fetcht</l>
               <l>The Clouds from ev'ry part, and suddenly</l>
               <l>On Sea and Land a dismal night was stretcht.</l>
               <l>And when the Rosie finger'd morning came,</l>
               <l>Our Ship we to a hollow Cave advance,</l>
               <l>Wherein the Sea-Nymphs Seats and Couches have,</l>
               <l>And where they are accustomed to dance.</l>
               <l>Thither I call'd my Mates, and said again:</l>
               <l>Friends, we have meat and drink aboard, be wise,</l>
               <l>And from the Herds and Flocks of <hi>Sol</hi> abstain,</l>
               <l>Who heareth all we say, and all espies,</l>
               <l>To this did my Campanions all assent.</l>
               <l>But for a month there blew no other winde</l>
               <l>Than South and East; so that we there were pent</l>
               <l>I'th'Island longer than we had design'd.</l>
               <l>My Mates, whilst they had bread and meat aboard,</l>
               <l>Forbore to meddle with the Sacred Kine:</l>
               <l>And fetch'd in what the Island did afford</l>
               <l>Of Fish and Fowl, to have wherewith to dine.</l>
               <l>Up I into the Island went aside,</l>
               <l>The Conduct of th'Immortal Gods t'implore,</l>
               <l>That some of them 'twould please to be my Guide,</l>
               <l>And me unto my Country to restore.</l>
               <l>And in a place desended from the winde</l>
               <l>I wash'd my hands; and then with tears and sighs</l>
               <l>Before the Gods I poured out my minde,</l>
               <l>And they a sweet sleep poured on my eyes.</l>
               <l>Mean time <hi>Eurylochus</hi> bad counsel gives</l>
               <l>To his Companions. All deaths, quoth he,</l>

                  </gap>eful to what thing soever lives:</l>
               <l>But death by hunger is the worst can be.</l>
               <l>Let's kill some of the fattest of these Cows,</l>
               <l>And sacrifice unto the Gods on high;</l>
               <l>And to appease the <hi>Sun,</hi> let's all make Vows</l>
               <l>To build a Temple to his Deity</l>
               <l>Enrich'd with Gifts. If not content with this,</l>
               <l>For a few Cows displeas'd he seek our death,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:45587:87"/>
For once to gape and die, far better 'tis</l>
               <l>Than strive with hunger till we lose our breath.</l>
               <l>This said, my Fellows all his counsel take,</l>
               <l>And chase <hi>Sols</hi> sacred Herds, that graz'd hard by;</l>
               <l>And then for recompence their Vows they make</l>
               <l>To build a Temple to his Deity.</l>
               <l>But when they made their Vows, Chaplets they wear</l>
               <l>Of tender leaves pluckt from the spreading Oak.</l>
               <l>White Barley they had none, the which men bear,</l>
               <l>When in their danger they the Gods invoke.</l>
               <l>After the Vow persorm'd, the Kine they flay,</l>
               <l>And take their Thighs and cover them with sat;</l>
               <l>And one of them upon the other lay,</l>
               <l>To burn upon the Altar. After that,</l>
               <l>Their Offering of Drink they pour'd upon</l>
               <l>The Altar, as the Sacrifice they burn.</l>
               <l>It ought t'have been of Wine; but having none,</l>
               <l>They pour'd on water fair, which serv'd the turn.</l>
               <l>When th'Entrails by my Fellows eaten were,</l>
               <l>And fire consumed had the Sacrifice,</l>
               <l>The rest they roast on Spits, and made good chear.</l>
               <l>Just then it was that sleep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <l>But coming near, perceiv'd the vapour rise</l>
               <l>Of roasted meat. Then to the Gods I rore,</l>

               <l>So strange a thing my Mates the while have done.</l>

               <l>When to my Fellows I was come, I rate</l>
               <l>Them all full bitterly, and one by one;</l>
               <l>But all in vain, for now it was too late:</l>

               <l>It smelt of Sulphur rank; and all my Crew</l>

                  <hi>Charybdis</hi> should cast up the Sea, and bring</l>

               <l>In this licentiousness they take a joy.</l>
               <l>Then answered <hi>Jove. Neptune,</hi> what's this you say?</l>

               <l>The Treasure that he shew'd me there was such.</l>

               <l>Whether 'twere better to go home disguis'd,</l>
               <l>Or so as to be known when he is seen.</l>
               <l>The King to me in Holy Form did swear,</l>
               <l>That for the Conduct of <hi>Ulysses</hi> home,</l>

               <l>A ship of that place in the harbour lay</l>
               <l>Ready to part. The King bad land me there.</l>
               <l>But they resolv'd were of another way;</l>
               <l>Which made me yet more misery to bear.</l>
               <l>When of that Land they were got out of sight,</l>
               <l>To sell me for a slave they did agree.</l>
               <l>My Coat and Vest they take from me there right,</l>
               <l>And gave me the torn Coat and Rags you see.</l>
               <l>Late in the Ev'ning they were at the Land</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and bound me fast i'th' ship.</l>
               <l>But they to Sup thought fit upon the Sand,</l>
               <l>And leaving me, out of the Bark they skip.</l>
               <l>But from my Bonds some God sure set me free.</l>
               <l>Then down I went and to the Sea appli'd</l>
               <l>My breast, and round the ship swam speedily,</l>
               <l>And in a great thick Wood my self I hide.</l>
               <l>Sorry they were, and put to Sea again.</l>
               <l>To stay and seek me they lost labour thought.</l>
               <l>Thus by <hi>Jove</hi>'s favour I alive remain,</l>
               <l>And to the house of a good friend am brought.</l>

Then said <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> I confess the Story</l>

               </l>
               <l>And she send one to call me. I come then,</l>

               <l>And these men wish that he may never come.</l>

               <l>As he from place to place for Murther fled,</l>

               <l>He said he saw him with <hi>Idomeneus</hi>

               <l>Rich, at the next Spring, or the next Autumn.</l>
               <l>Therefore, old man, since you are come to me,</l>
               <l>Think not your Story any thing avails,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> to this answers him, and saith,</l>
               <l>Since you trust not my Word, nor Oath beside,</l>

Let's make a Bargain. If <hi>Ulysses</hi> come,</l>

               <l>And a safe Conduct to <hi>Dulichium.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If not, and that I told you prove untrue,</l>
               <l>Then make your Servants threw me from a Cliff</l>
               <l>High and upright, That others may beware</l>
               <l>To cosen men into a false belief</l>
               <l>Of things they know not, but uncertain are.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> Yes, 'twere a fine deed,</l>
               <l>And noble, t'entertain a man with love,</l>
               <l>And with good chear relieve him in his need,</l>
               <l>Then kill him, and beg pardon then of <hi>Jove.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But now I wish the Swine from field were come.</l>
               <l>For time it is of Supper to advise.</l>
               <l>And while they talk, the Swains the Swine bring home,</l>
               <l>And with great noise they pent are in the sties.</l>
               <l>Then did <hi>Eumaeus</hi> to his servants call,</l>
               <l>From out the Herd to choose one of the best</l>
               <l>His far-come friend to entertain withal,</l>
               <l>And mend their own fare also with the rest.</l>
               <l>'Tis long since others the work to us leave</l>

               <l>And they brought in a five-year-old Pig fat;</l>

               <l>Then others take the work into their hands,</l>
               <l>And with keen steel they quickly cut his throat.</l>
               <l>That being done, with many flaming Brands</l>
               <l>They sindge from head to tail his hairy Coat,</l>
               <l>And lay him open. Then <hi>Eumaeus</hi> came</l>
               <l>And folded up the fleshy Thighs in fat.</l>
               <l>And then into the Fire he threw the same.</l>
               <l>The rest they cut in lesser parts. And that</l>

               <l>But one Mess for the Nymphs and <hi>Mercury</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He set aside; and over that he pray'd.</l>
               <l>The rest he set to each one severally.</l>
               <l>But to <hi>Ulysses</hi> the whole Chine was lai'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jove</hi> (said <hi>Ulysses)</hi> be to you as kind</l>
               <l>As you to me, and grant all your request.</l>
               <l>Friend (said <hi>Eumaeus)</hi> now your Supper mind,</l>
               <l>Such as it is. Gods give what they think best.</l>
               <l>Then to the Gods he offer'd the first cut,</l>
               <l>And fill'd a Bowl, and offer'd part of that.</l>
               <l>The Bowl then in <hi>Ulysses</hi> hand he put.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> it receiv'd, and down he sat.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mesaulius</hi> then sets before him bread,</l>
               <l>Who thither brought from <hi>Taphos</hi> was to sell,</l>
               <l>And had been by <hi>Eumaeus</hi> purchased.</l>
               <l>Then heartily unto their meat they fell.</l>
               <l>And when to eat they had no more delight,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mesaulius</hi> took off the bread; and all</l>
               <l>Prepared were for sleep. But cold the night</l>
               <l>And Moonless was; besides much rain did fall.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> to the Company then spake,</l>

               <l>From him, or from some other for his sake.</l>
               <l>Hear me <hi>Eumaeus</hi> (says he) and you folk,</l>
               <l>I have a Tale to tell. This foolish Wine</l>

               <l>And me the third; the wind at North all night,</l>

               <l>With rain congeal'd, our Armour all was white.</l>

And they slept well wrapt up in Cloak and Coat,</l>
               <l>Safe in their Bucklers from the freezing wind.</l>
               <l>But like a fool my Cloak I had forgot.</l>
               <l>I did not think I should such weather find.</l>
               <l>And when a third part of the night was gone,</l>
               <l>I nudg'd <hi>Ulysses</hi> (who did next me lie.)</l>
               <l>He felt me, and to him I made my moan.</l>
               <l>Noble <hi>Ulysses,</hi> I am like to die,</l>
               <l>The weather kills me, I have but a Coat.</l>
               <l>My Cloak some Daemon made me leave behind,</l>
               <l>And of such cold quite took away the thought.</l>
               <l>I cannot tell what remedy to find.</l>
               <l>No sooner said, but remedy he found;</l>
               <l>For able was he both to shift and fight,</l>
               <l>And said unto me in a whisp'ring sound,</l>
               <l>Peace, lest we heard be by some other Wight:</l>
               <l>And then with Head on Eldow, Friend, said he,</l>
               <l>I dreamt we from the ships too far lie here.</l>
               <l>Let some to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> go and see,</l>
               <l>If he would have us rise and come more near.</l>
               <l>Then up rose <hi>Thoas</hi> Son of <hi>Andraemon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And down he laid his Cloak, the which I kept,</l>
               <l>And swiftly did to <hi>Agamemnon</hi> run.</l>
               <l>I'th' Cloak I wrapt my self and soundly slept.</l>
               <l>Were I as young and strong as I was then,</l>
               <l>Some one a Cloak would lend me for respect,</l>
               <l>Or else for kindness, 'mongst so many men.</l>
               <l>But now my Rags are cause they me neglect.</l>
               <l>Old man, then said <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> You have told</l>
               <l>Your Story well. Each word to purpose is.</l>
               <l>To morrow shake your Rags against the cold.</l>
               <l>Of what is needful now you shall not miss.</l>
               <l>Of Cloak and Coat there's none of these has shift.</l>
               <l>But when <hi>Telemachus</hi> from <hi>Pyle</hi> comes back,</l>
               <l>From him you will have all you need, of gift.</l>
               <l>And then you neither Cloak nor Coat will lack.</l>
               <l>And be convey'd to what place you desire.</l>
               <l>With that he rose; and woolly skins of sheep,</l>
               <l>And shaggle Goatskins neer laid to the fire.</l>
               <l>And there <hi>Ulysses</hi> laid him down to sleep.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:45587:100"/>
And over him a Cloak <hi>Eumaeus</hi> laid;</l>
               <l>Both thick and soft it was, which he had kept</l>
               <l>And with it in sharp cold himself arrai'd.</l>
               <l>And thus <hi>Ulysses</hi> warmly cover'd slept.</l>
               <l>By him the young men lay. But to the sties</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> went. For fit he thought it not</l>

                  <hi>Helen</hi> prevented him. I will, said she,</l>

               <l>You saw the Eagle come down from the Hill,</l>

               <l>Freely. For why, with her own Daughter dear</l>
               <l>She brought me up, and never was but kind,</l>
               <l>This Daughter <hi>Ctimene,</hi> when come of age</l>

               <l>For sleep and joy the long nights give us leasure.</l>
               <l>It is not good too soon to go to bed.</l>

               <l>And Stories of our sad Adventures tell.</l>
               <l>For much contentment there is ev'n in that,</l>
               <l>To them that suffer'd have and come off well.</l>
               <l>But to my Story now. An Isle there is</l>

               <l>Well stor'd with Kine, and Sheep, and Wine and Wheat.</l>
               <l>Where Famine never enter'd nor Disease</l>
               <l>Amongst the people. When a man was aged,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Dian'</hi> and <hi>Phoebus</hi> made him die with ease,</l>
               <l>And gentle shafts the pain of death asswaged.</l>
               <l>Two Towns it had. Their Laws were not the same;</l>
               <l>But of them both my Father was the King.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Phoenician</hi> Merchants, Rats, then thither came,</l>

               <l>Then said the Merchant-man that did her wive,</l>

               <l>And when all sworn, and agreed on it were,</l>

               <l>For I the charge have of my Masters Son,</l>
               <l>Much profit he will yield if brought away.</l>

               <l>A year it was before these Merchants went.</l>
               <l>Mean while they buy and lade the Ship. And when</l>

A man unto my Fathers house they sent,</l>

               <l>Yes, said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> for why, I come</l>
               <l>To see you, and to ask about my Mother,</l>

                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> unto <hi>Eumaeus</hi> said,</l>
               <l>And thus about his new-come Guest enquir'd,</l>
               <l>Father (said he) I pray you tell me now</l>
               <l>His own, his Fathers, and his Countries name.</l>
               <l>And farther I desire you let me know</l>

               <l>For verily I can no way devise,</l>
               <l>How he should come on Horsback or on Foot.</l>
               <l>To this <hi>Eumaeus</hi> answered agen:</l>
               <l>He says himself that he was born in <hi>Creet,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And seen the Cities has of many men,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Thesprotian</hi> Rats got him aboard their Ship,</l>

There he found means to give them all the slip.</l>
               <l>So came to mine, and from mine to your hand.</l>
               <l>I give him you, as you think best to use.</l>
               <l>To this again <hi>Telemachus</hi> replies,</l>
               <l>That which you say, <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> is bid news.</l>
               <l>How to receive him I cannot devise.</l>
               <l>I am too young to save him with my hands,</l>
               <l>If injury be done him by the Wooers.</l>
               <l>And at this time my Mother doubtful stands,</l>
               <l>Whether to stay within my Fathers doors,</l>
               <l>And with the people her good name maintain,</l>
               <l>Or with that Suiter wed and go away,</l>
               <l>That to her shall afford the greatest gain.</l>
               <l>But since the Stranger at your house doth stay;</l>
               <l>I'll give him Garments a good Coat and Vest,</l>
               <l>A Spear in's hand, and good Shoes to his feet,</l>
               <l>And him convey to what place he thinks best.</l>
               <l>Or if to keep him here you think it meet,</l>
               <l>I'll hither for him Garments send and food,</l>
               <l>That he no charge be to your Family.</l>
               <l>To set him with the Suiters 'tis not good</l>
               <l>For me nor him, they so unruly be.</l>
               <l>He'll be derided there, and I shall grieve,</l>
               <l>But 'gainst so many men what can be done?</l>
               <l>The strength of one man cannot him relieve.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> then made answer to his Son,</l>
               <l>O Friend (said he) it bites my heart to hear</l>
               <l>What of the Suiters in your house you say,</l>
               <l>How 'gainst your mind they proudly domineer.</l>
               <l>Is it because you willingly give way?</l>
               <l>Or that your people by Divinity</l>
               <l>Adverse are to you or your Government?</l>
               <l>Or are your Kindred that should stand you by</l>
               <l>In Quarrel and in Battle, discontent?</l>
               <l>O, were I young and of the mind I am,</l>
               <l>Or that I were the Great <hi>Ulysses</hi> Son,</l>
               <l>Or he himself, and wandring hither came,</l>
               <l>I'd have my head out off by any one,</l>
               <l>If I were not reveng'd upon them all.</l>
               <l>And though they were too hard for me alone,</l>

I'd rather in my own house fighting fall,</l>
               <l>Than daily see such ugly things there done.</l>
               <l>Strangers abus'd; Maids tous'd ill-favourdly,</l>
               <l>And Corn and Wine consumed without end,</l>
               <l>And to no purpose foolishly. For why,</l>
               <l>They never shall arrive where they intend.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> No word o'th' Gods</l>

               <l>For Marriage with my Mother my house haunt.</l>
               <l>Whilst she can none put off, and will none marry,</l>
               <l>They spend my Corn and Wine, and cattle kill,</l>
               <l>And eating here, and drinking still they tarry,</l>
               <l>And me perhaps at last they murther will.</l>
               <l>But what they shall do none but God can tell.</l>
               <l>But Father go you to <hi>Penelope,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And let her know I am arrived well.</l>
               <l>And let no other person know but she.</l>
               <l>And after you have told her tarry not.</l>
               <l>Make haste. At your return I shall be here.</l>
               <l>For many are they that my death do plot.</l>
               <l>True, said <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> but not ill it were</l>

               <l>Agreed they were; none thought the motion ill.</l>

On Couches and on Chairs their Cloaks they throw,</l>
               <l>Great Sheep, fat Goats enough they sacrifice</l>

               <l>And then <hi>Ulysses</hi> to <hi>Eumaeus</hi> said,</l>

               <l>Only of rugged way I am afraid,</l>
               <l>Give me a good strong staff to lean upon.</l>
               <l>Then on his shoulder he his Scrip did throw;</l>
               <l>Given he had a great Staff to his mind,</l>
               <l>And they two to the Town together go,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> like a Beggar old and lame,</l>
               <l>And all his Rayment ragged was and wretched.</l>
               <l>But when they near unto the fountain came,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> still stood firm upon the path,</l>

               <l>Then said <hi>Melanthius</hi> again, O ho!</l>
               <l>How boldly does this Dog, this Raskal prate.</l>
               <l>Whom one day I shall from hence ship away,</l>

               <l>When this was said, away he went apace,</l>
               <l>And coming to the Suiters in the Hall,</l>
               <l>Against <hi>Eurymachus</hi> he took his place,</l>
               <l>Whom best he loved of the Suiters all.</l>
               <l>And there the waiters set before him meat.</l>
               <l>The Women of the Pantry brought him bread.</l>

The Court with Wall and Hedge is fenced strong,</l>

               <l>Of all my suffrings this is not the worst.</l>
               <l>Of blows and throws I have experience.</l>

               <l>No man a Stranger e're call'd in to Sup,</l>
               <l>And him on no acquaintance did invite,</l>

               <l>I'll never do't. Give him what Alms you will,</l>

               <l>When what had pass'd was told <hi>Penelope,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> strike him to the heart, said she.</l>
               <l>If I my wish had, said <hi>Eurynome,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No Suiter of them all the morn should see.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Penelope</hi> again, 'Tis true,</l>
               <l>They all be enemies, and mean us evil.</l>
               <l>But he the fiercest is of all the Crew,</l>
               <l>And rageth in the house like any Devil.</l>
               <l>A Stranger in distress comes to the door,</l>
               <l>Whom want constrained had to beg his bread.</l>
               <l>The rest all give him somewhat of their store,</l>
               <l>But he a Footstool throweth at his head.</l>
               <l>While she thus and her Women talking were,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> supping sat upon the Sill.</l>
               <l>I fain (said she) would have the Beggar here.</l>
               <l>Fetch him <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> talk with him I will.</l>
               <l>I'll ask him if <hi>Ulysses</hi> he have seen,</l>
               <l>For many men and Cities knoweth he.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> then made answer to the Queen:</l>
               <l>If once the Suiters would but silent be,</l>
               <l>You would be pleas'd his History to hear.</l>
               <l>Three days and nights he stai'd with me an end.</l>
               <l>And of his suffrings much he told me there</l>
               <l>When new arriv'd; but came not to the end.</l>
               <l>As when a man that knows the Art of Song,</l>
               <l>Sings lovely words with sweet &amp; well-tun'd voice,</l>
               <l>The man that hears him thinks not the time long;</l>
               <l>So I in his strange story did rejoyce.</l>
               <l>He said <hi>Ulysses</hi> was his Fathers Guest,</l>
               <l>In th'Isle of <hi>Crete</hi> where reigneth <hi>Minos</hi> race.</l>
               <l>Himself (he said) with many woes opprest,</l>
               <l>The Fates at last him tumbled to this place.</l>
               <l>And that he heard <hi>Ulysses</hi> is hard by,</l>
               <l>And that into <hi>Thesprotia</hi> he's come</l>
               <l>Alive and well; enriched mightily;</l>
               <l>With Treasure which he now is bringing home.</l>

Then said <hi>Penelope,</hi> Go call me hither</l>
               <l>The Beggar, I my self will ask him all.</l>
               <l>And mean while let the Suiters chat together</l>

               <l>Would bring destruction on these enemies.</l>
               <l>This said, it chanc'd <hi>Telemachus</hi> to sneeze.</l>
               <l>She laught, and for the Beggar calls agen.</l>
               <l>You see <hi>Eumaeus, Jove</hi> with me agrees,</l>
               <l>And certainly slain shall be all these men.</l>
               <l>Go call the Beggar, and say this from me,</l>
               <l>If I find true what he shall to me say,</l>
               <l>He shall with Coat and Vest rewarded be.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> to the Beggar went his way.</l>
               <l>And when he near him was, Father, said he,</l>

               <l>About <hi>Ulysses</hi> she inform'd would be,</l>
               <l>And said, If she find all you say be true,</l>
               <l>She clothe you will with a fair Coat and Vest,</l>

                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> to <hi>Eumaeus</hi> answered,</l>

               <l>For he and I have jointly suffered.</l>
               <l>But from the Suiters I much fear a storm.</l>
               <l>Their insolence is known up to the Sky.</l>
               <l>Just now a Footstool one threw at my head,</l>
               <l>When given him no cause at all had I,</l>
               <l>Nor could I by her Son be succoured.</l>

Then back <hi>Eumaeus</hi> went with his excuse,</l>
               <l>And came without him to <hi>Penelope.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How now (said she) does he to come refuse?</l>
               <l>They that are bashful but ill Beggars be.</l>
               <l>Not so, O Queen (said he) he is discreet.</l>
               <l>He prays you stay till setting of the Sun,</l>
               <l>Fearing some danger from the Woo'rs to meet.</l>
               <l>And for you also then 'twill best be done.</l>
               <l>I see (quoth she) the Stranger wants not wit.</l>
               <l>For in the world never so many men</l>
               <l>Contriving mischief did together sit.</l>
               <l>So said <hi>Penelope. Eumeus</hi> then</l>
               <l>Went down and put himself into the throng,</l>
               <l>And to <hi>Telemachus</hi> said in his ear,</l>
               <l>I have been absent from my Swine too long.</l>
               <l>I go, and to your care leave all things here,</l>
               <l>And chiefly of your life to have a care.</l>
               <l>Many there are that bear you evil mind,</l>
               <l>And how to take your life contriving are.</l>
               <l>But may they first their own destruction find.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> And so 'twill be.</l>
               <l>Farewel. But I advise you first to dine.</l>
               <l>The bus'ness here leave to the Gods and me.</l>
               <l>Then din'd he and went back unto the Swine,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>THen came a Beggar to <hi>Ulysses</hi> Gate.</l>
               <l>The man to see to was both great and tall,</l>
               <l>Though but a lither fell w. Down he sate</l>
               <l>Boldly within the Porch before the Hall.</l>
               <l>He had a greedy Gut, and named was</l>
               <l>At first <hi>Arnaeus,</hi> then <hi>Irus;</hi> for he went</l>
               <l>On errants oft, when ever there was cause.</l>
               <l>The Wooers favour made him insolent.</l>
               <l>This Beggar thought to drive <hi>Ulysses</hi> thence.</l>
               <l>Dost see those Princes how they wink at me,</l>
               <l>And by the heels would have me pluckt thee hence?</l>
               <l>Though to do that I should ashamed be.</l>
               <l>Go from the door Old man lest I should do it.</l>
               <l>Up therefore quickly and be gone; arise</l>
               <l>Before that with my fists I force you to it.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> frowning answer'd in this wise:</l>
               <l>Strange man, I neither do thee harm, nor say</l>
               <l>Thee any ill. Here's room for thee and me.</l>
               <l>I do not envy you the meat which they</l>
               <l>Shall give you here, how much so e're it be.</l>
               <l>Envy not other men; I think you are</l>
               <l>As well as I a Beggar; but forbear</l>
               <l>To threaten me too much. You're best beware,</l>
               <l>Old as I am, lest I your lips besmear</l>
               <l>And breast with blood, and so have better room.</l>
               <l>For to <hi>Ulysses</hi> house I'm confident</l>

                  </gap>u never wilt be able more to come.</l>
               <l>This made the Beggar more impatient.</l>
               <l>O (says he) how the Raskal prates! 'Twere well</l>
               <l>To beat the Raskals teeth out, while his Tongue</l>

Thus runs on wheels, till to the ground they fell.</l>
               <l>Let these see fight the Old man with the Young.</l>
               <l>Whilst in great heat they quarrell'd at the door,</l>
               <l>They by <hi>Antinous</hi> observed were,</l>
               <l>Who laughing said there never came before</l>
               <l>Such sport to th'House. The Beggars standing there</l>
               <l>Will go to cuffs, I pray let's hold them to it.</l>
               <l>Then up they start, and round about them stand.</l>
               <l>There are o'th' fire good puddings full of suit,</l>
               <l>Of these, let him that conquers lay his hand</l>
               <l>On which he will. So said <hi>Antinous,</hi>

               <l>And have the priviledge, and none but he</l>

               <l>And of our talk at meat a hearer be.</l>
               <l>The motion pleas'd. And then <hi>Ulysses</hi> spake:</l>

               <l>When all had sworn, then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi>

               <l>None else shall do thee hurt. <hi>Antinous,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Eurymachus,</hi> and I defend you can.</l>
               <l>This said, <hi>Ulysses</hi> cover'd kept his gear,</l>
               <l>But shew'd his shoulders wide, &amp; his strong thighs.</l>
               <l>His large brest and his brawny arms appear.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> standing by inlarg'd his size.</l>
               <l>At which the Suiters greatly wondered,</l>
               <l>And one unto another softly said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Irus</hi> has pull'd an old house on his head.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Irus</hi> then was mightily afraid.</l>
               <l>But yet by force the Servants brought him out,</l>
               <l>His flesh still trembling on his limbs with fear,</l>
               <l>Shew not thy self a Coward and a lout;</l>
               <l>Nor fear a man worn out with many a year.</l>
               <l>For if he get the better, thou shalt go</l>
               <l>Unto King <hi>Takim,</hi> and there by his Law</l>

Thy nose and ears, and privy parts also</l>
               <l>Shall be cut off, and dogs shall eat them raw.</l>
               <l>This made him quake more yet. Into the lists</l>
               <l>They brought him so. Both ready were to fight.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> then thought how to use his fists,</l>

               <l>With laughter almost dead, that stood about.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> drag'd him to the utter-gate,</l>
               <l>And set him to the hedge, as 'twere a Signe,</l>
               <l>And put a Staff in's hand. As there he sate.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> bad him keep out Dogs and Swine.</l>

               <l>This said; ore's head he threw the twisted string</l>
               <l>By which his Scrip hung rag'd and full of holes.</l>
               <l>Then sat him down i'th' Porch. The Suiters enter</l>
               <l>All laughing in, and as they passed by</l>

               <l>As <hi>Philomela</hi> sitting in a tree</l>
               <l>Mourns with a lamentable voice and shrill</l>
               <l>For <hi>Itylus,</hi> and turneth restlesly,</l>
               <l>Whom <hi>Zethus</hi> Son did by misfortune kill:</l>
               <l>Just so my mind divided is in twain;</l>
               <l>Whether to keep my Servants with my Son,</l>
               <l>And my dear Husbands bed, and here remain,</l>
               <l>Or marry one o'th' Suiters, and be gone.</l>

To marry and be gone I could not yet,</l>
               <l>My Son too young was yet to rule th'estate.</l>
               <l>And now grown up, it makes him vex and fret</l>
               <l>To see them daily feast within his Gate.</l>
               <l>I'll tell you now a dream; expound it you.</l>
               <l>I've twenty Geese feeding i'th' yard without.</l>
               <l>A mighty Eagle from the Hills down flew,</l>
               <l>And brake their necks; dead they lay all about.</l>
               <l>The Eagle straightway mounted out of sight.</l>
               <l>I dreaming wept. To see them at the trough,</l>
               <l>Feeding on steeped wheat, I took delight.</l>
               <l>And to bemoan me Ladies came enough.</l>
               <l>And then methought the Eagle came again,</l>
               <l>And on a Beam which through the wall did start</l>
               <l>He sat, and said in humane Language plain,</l>
               <l>Child of <hi>Icarius</hi> trouble not your heart.</l>
               <l>The thing you see is real, not a dream.</l>
               <l>The Geese the Wooers, I the Eagle was,</l>
               <l>And now return'd and sitting on the Beam,</l>
               <l>I am your Husband, and will bring to pass</l>
               <l>The death of all your Suiters. Then wak'd I,</l>
               <l>And went into the Court my Geese to see,</l>
               <l>And found them all there feeding heartily,</l>
               <l>Unhurt, and well as they were wont to be.</l>
               <l>Woman, then said <hi>Ulysses,</hi> no man can</l>
               <l>Expound this Dream but as himself has done,</l>

               <l>In those that come through th' Elephantine tooth.</l>
               <l>But I much fear that my Dream came this way.</l>
               <l>For I have promised to quit this place,</l>
               <l>And come already is th'unlucky day</l>

                  <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> three Swine frankt and fat he brought,</l>

               <l>In all his Swine-sties better there were not.</l>
               <l>And he unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> kindly spake:</l>

               <l>Do they more pity now upon you take</l>

               <l>O, said <hi>Ulysses,</hi> that the Gods would give</l>
               <l>These men what to their insolence is due,</l>
               <l>Who in a house not theirs so lewdly live,</l>
               <l>As if no modesty at all they knew.</l>
               <l>Then came <hi>Melanthus</hi> from a place hard by.</l>
               <l>He had the charge o'th' Goats, &amp; brought the best.</l>
               <l>And spake unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> spightfully:</l>

What Countryman, and what his Parents were?</l>

               <l>God can make Princes go from Land to Land</l>

               <l>This said, he took <hi>Ulysses</hi> by the hand,</l>
               <l>And spake unto him kind and lovingly:</l>
               <l>Father, I wish you as much happiness</l>
               <l>As ever you enjoy'd before. But now,</l>
               <l>I see you are in very great distress.</l>
               <l>O <hi>Jove!</hi> What God so cruel is as thou?</l>
               <l>Though born thou wert, yet pitiest not to see</l>
               <l>The torments of mankind. To think upon</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> makes me weep. It may be he</l>
               <l>Thus begs somewhere, with such apparel on,</l>
               <l>Or else he's dead. O then I am undone.</l>
               <l>He set me o're his Herds when but a Boy;</l>

                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> also did like Prayer make</l>

               <l>Within <hi>Ulysses</hi> house their Coats they laid,</l>
               <l>And set themselves to kill and dress their meat.</l>
               <l>Then from the Herd they sacrific'd a Cow,</l>
               <l>And many well-grown sheep, and goats well fed,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> gave out Cups, <hi>Philoetius</hi> bread,</l>

               <l>On an ill-favour'd stool at Table small,</l>
               <l>And gave him his just share of th'entrails fat,</l>
               <l>And for him fill'd a great gold Cup with wine.</l>
               <l>Sit here, said he, and fare like other men.</l>
               <l>Fear neither blows nor scoffs. The house is mine,</l>

                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> is the owner of it. When</l>

               <l>And you my Mothers Suiters, mock no more,</l>

               <l>At first the Suiters knew not how to take</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> his words, and silent were,</l>
               <l>Admiring that such threatning words he spake,</l>
               <l>So many men provoking without fear.</l>

Let's put these threats up of <hi>Telemachus.</hi>

               <l>Car'd not at all for any thing he said.</l>

               <l>The portion of <hi>Ulysses</hi> was no less</l>
               <l>Than other Suiters had, nor more. For why,</l>

               <l>Us all can bend it as <hi>Ulysses</hi> could</l>
               <l>(For I remember him though I were young)</l>
               <l>So said he, though he thought he bend it should,</l>
               <l>And also shoot through th' Axes every one,</l>
               <l>Though he were only the first to be shot.</l>
               <l>For he the other Suiters had set on,</l>
               <l>And was the first contriver of the Plot.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> then to the Suiters spake,</l>

               <l>My Mother tells me she'll a Husband take,</l>

               <l>And I here merry am that should be sad.</l>
               <l>But be't as 'twill, the Game must now begin,</l>

               </l>
               <l>But what need I set forth my Mothers praise?</l>
               <l>You know't your selves. Therefore I you desire</l>
               <l>To put off all excuses and delays.</l>
               <l>And I my self will be the first to try</l>
               <l>This mighty Bowe, whether I can or no,</l>
               <l>And through the Axes make the Arrow fly.</l>
               <l>'Twill grieve me less to let my Mother go;</l>

               <l>Why should I doubt of governing his State?</l>
               <l>And from him presently his Coat did throw</l>
               <l>And Sword, and then fell to delineate</l>
               <l>The ground whereon the Axes were to stand.</l>
               <l>On one long line he set them all upright.</l>
               <l>The Woo'rs admir'd the justness of his hand;</l>
               <l>For why, the like was ne'r done in his sight.</l>
               <l>Then went he to the Sill to try the Bowe.</l>
               <l>Thrice he essaid it and was near it still,</l>

               <l>Once more had done it. But 'twas not his will.</l>
               <l>For then his Father checkt him with a wink.</l>
               <l>Alas, then said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> must this</l>
               <l>Be all my strength? Too young I am I think.</l>
               <l>Come, let one take the Bowe that elder is.</l>
               <l>This said, the Bowe and Arrow he laid by,</l>

               <l>And feeble arms the Bowe would not relent.</l>
               <l>Then down he laid it there, and lets it stand;</l>

               <l>Since you the bending of the Bowe remit</l>
               <l>To th' Gods to give to whom they please; &amp; they</l>
               <l>To morrow doubtless will determine it,</l>
               <l>Let me now of the Bowe make an essay.</l>
               <l>That I may know whether my strength be spent,</l>
               <l>And what I could before now cannot do.</l>
               <l>Whether I still be firm or do relent</l>
               <l>With hardship, and with want of looking to.</l>
               <l>These words of his made all the Suiters mad</l>
               <l>With fear that he indeed would bend the Bowe.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Antinous</hi> gave him language very bad.</l>
               <l>Thou wretched Stranger, is it not enough</l>
               <l>That of our Feast thou hast an equal part,</l>
               <l>And that of our discourse (and none but thou</l>
               <l>Stranger and Beggar) made a hearer art?</l>
               <l>'Tis wine that makes thee not thy self to know.</l>
               <l>For wine serves all men so that drink too much.</l>
               <l>Wine hurt <hi>Eurytion</hi> the Centaur great.</l>
               <l>His carriage in <hi>Perithous</hi> house was such</l>
               <l>Among the <hi>Lapithae</hi> sitting at meat,</l>
               <l>That angry with't they were, and all arose,</l>
               <l>And with sharp iron cut off both his ears,</l>
               <l>And with the same they pared off his nose.</l>
               <l>A way the cause of his own harm he bears.</l>
               <l>From that day on, Centaurs and men are foes.</l>
               <l>Themselves men hurt by wine immoderate,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:45587:139"/>
So if you bend the Bowe, your ears you'll lose.</l>
               <l>For you'll find here no prating Advocate.</l>
               <l>But to King <hi>Takim</hi> forthwith you shall go,</l>
               <l>And he will of you make a cruel end.</l>
               <l>Therefore sit still, and let alone the Bowe;</l>
               <l>Nor with men younger than your self contend.</l>
               <l>Then said <hi>Penelope,</hi> I'd have you know,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Antinous,</hi> that you do very ill</l>
               <l>To wrong <hi>Telemachus</hi> his Guest. What though</l>
               <l>He bend the Bowe, d'ye think I take him will</l>
               <l>For Husband? I am sure you think not so.</l>
               <l>Let none of you be sad with fear of that.</l>
               <l>Then to her said <hi>Eurymachus,</hi> No no;</l>
               <l>That's not the thing that we be troubled at.</l>
               <l>'Tis of our Honour that we jealous be.</l>
               <l>For how will men and women, think you, prate,</l>
               <l>But that such Suiters wooe <hi>Penelope</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As could not bend <hi>Ulysses</hi> Bowe, but that</l>
               <l>A Beggar that past by by chance could bend it?</l>
               <l>Which unto us will be no little shame.</l>
               <l>Who (said she) live on others means and spend it,</l>
               <l>Should not stand much on Honour and on fame.</l>
               <l>Besides, this Stranger is well made and tall,</l>
               <l>And of a great man says he is the Son.</l>
               <l>Give him the Bowe to try his strength withal.</l>
               <l>For this I'll promise him, and see it done.</l>
               <l>If he do bend it, I'll on him bestow</l>
               <l>Good Clothing and a handsom Coat and Vest,</l>
               <l>Shooes to his feet, Dart, Sword with edges two,</l>
               <l>And send him to such place as he thinks best.</l>
               <l>Then spake to her <hi>Telemachus</hi> her Son:</l>
               <l>Mother, to give the Bowe or to deny't,</l>
               <l>Is in my pow'r, and hinder me can none</l>
               <l>In <hi>Elis,</hi> or <hi>Achaia,</hi> or here right</l>
               <l>From giving it unto this Stranger here,</l>
               <l>If I think fit. But Mother, pray go now</l>
               <l>Up to your Chamber, and look to your work,</l>
               <l>And leave to us to dispute of the Bowe.</l>
               <l>She mused on, and thought his counsel wise;</l>
               <l>And being in her Chamber sore did weep.</l>
               <l>

For th'absence of her Husband, till her eyes</l>
               <l>By th' Goddess <hi>Pallas</hi> closed were with sleep.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> now had brought the Bowe about,</l>
               <l>And come it was to where <hi>Ulysses</hi> fat.</l>
               <l>The Suiters all at once then cried out,</l>
               <l>Swineherd, Rogue, Lout, what meanest thou by that?</l>
               <l>If the Gods please to favour our designe,</l>
               <l>Thou shalt be slain and carried out of sight,</l>
               <l>And there devoured be by thy own Swine.</l>
               <l>This put <hi>Eumaeus</hi> into a great fright.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> then roar'd on th'other part,</l>
               <l>Bear on the Bowe (t' obey all is not best)</l>
               <l>I'll pelt thee (though that thou my elder art)</l>
               <l>With stones home to thy Hogsties like a beast.</l>
               <l>For I the stronger am. O that I were</l>
               <l>But so much stronger than these Suiters all,</l>
               <l>I soon of some of them the house should clear.</l>
               <l>They laught at this, and bated of their gall.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eumaeus</hi> then took up the Bowe agen,</l>
               <l>And gave it to <hi>Ulysses</hi> in his hand.</l>
               <l>This done, <hi>Euryclea</hi> he called then.</l>
               <l>It is, said he, <hi>Telemachus</hi> command</l>
               <l>To lock the doors all; and that if you hear</l>
               <l>Noise in the house of blows, or groaning men,</l>
               <l>Let none go forth, but at their work stay there.</l>
               <l>This said, <hi>Euryclea</hi> went in agen,</l>
               <l>And lockt the doors. <hi>Philoetius</hi> likewise</l>
               <l>Went silently and shut the utter-Gate,</l>
               <l>And with a Ship rope that lay by, it ties,</l>
               <l>And coming back sits where before he sate;</l>
               <l>And lookt upon <hi>Ulysses,</hi> who to know</l>
               <l>What work the worms had in his absence made,</l>
               <l>This way and that way turning was the Bowe.</l>
               <l>At this the Suiters one t'another said.</l>
               <l>This Beggar surely has no little skill</l>

               <l>It sounded like the singing of a Swallow.</l>
               <l>The Suiters then began to be afraid,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Then to the Bowe he set a shaft, and there</l>
               <l>Sitting, shot through the Axes, not one misses.</l>
               <l>The rest of th'Arrows in the Quiver were.</l>
               <l>Then turning to <hi>Telemachus,</hi> he said,</l>

               <l>Nor long a bending of the Bowe I staid.</l>
               <l>You see then that the Woo'rs me falsly tax.</l>

                  <hi>Pallas</hi> was angry at these words of his,</l>
               <l>And chid <hi>Ulysses</hi> then, and askt him where</l>
               <l>His Courage was. And what, said she, is this</l>
               <l>The man that bravely sought nine years at <hi>Troy,</hi>

                  <hi>Mentor</hi> with theirs, his fortune will not mix,</l>
               <l>He and those hopes are gone. Upon the Sill</l>

               <l>She heard him well, and presently without</l>
               <l>More words the door she open'd with her Key.</l>
               <l>And found <hi>Ulysses</hi> standing 'mongst the dead</l>
               <l>Besmear'd with blood. As when a Lion has</l>
               <l>Upon a Cow at pasture newly fed,</l>
               <l>With goary brest and chaps; so dight he was,</l>
               <l>Th'old woman there beholding so much blood,</l>
               <l>And Carcasses so many lying dead,</l>
               <l>At such a mighty work amazed stood;</l>
               <l>And was about to whoop, but hindered</l>
               <l>Was by <hi>Ulysses.</hi> Hold, said he, within</l>
               <l>Your joy, and let it not appear in vain.</l>
               <l>To glory over dead men is a sin.</l>
               <l>These men the Gods, and their own sins have slain.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:45587:145"/>
For neither from above they fear'd the Gods,</l>
               <l>Nor men respected good or bad beneath,</l>
               <l>And therefore now have felt the Heav'nly Rods,</l>
               <l>And brought upon themselves untimely death.</l>

               <l>That me dishonour and do wickedness.</l>
               <l>Fifty, said she, do serve <hi>Penelope,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And learn to work and wait, no more nor less.</l>
               <l>Of these there twelve be that are impudent,</l>
               <l>And care not for me, nor <hi>Penelope.</hi>

               <l>But now I'll to my Ladies Chamber go,</l>
               <l>Where she's asleep. Some God has clos'd her eyes.</l>
               <l>To tell her you are here. But he said, No;</l>
               <l>First call those women who do me despise,</l>
               <l>And have behav'd themselves dishonestly.</l>

                  <hi>Euryclea</hi> obeys, and goes her way,</l>
               <l>And call'd those women; Come away, said she,</l>

               <l>Hear me, said he, what I would have you do.</l>
               <l>Make these lewd women carry hence the dead,</l>
               <l>The Chairs and Tables in the Hall make clean,</l>
               <l>And when that bus'ness they have finished,</l>
               <l>Into the Court make them go forth agen,</l>

               <l>Then came the women down into the Hall</l>

               <l>And presently unto their work they fall.</l>

               <l>You, said <hi>Telemachus,</hi> for the disgrace</l>

               <l>The Gods at last have granted you your wishes.</l>

               <l>The Gods, <hi>Euryclea,</hi> sure have made you mad.</l>
               <l>The Gods can wise men fools, and fools wise make:</l>
               <l>The Gods have done you hurt, more wit you had.</l>
               <l>You do me wrong, that know how little sleep</l>

               <l>I never so well slept since, but still weep.</l>
               <l>And now you come and wake me with a toy.</l>
               <l>Be gone, if't had been any Maid but you</l>
               <l>I should have sent her not well pleas'd away.</l>
               <l>But to your age some more respect is due.</l>
               <l>Go down again into the House you may.</l>

               <l>'Twas he. But seeing him so ill arraid,</l>
               <l>Her mind was chang'd. She thought that he 'twas not.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> his Mother chid, and said,</l>
               <l>Mother, hard-hearted Mother and unkind,</l>
               <l>Why sit you at such distance from my Father,</l>
               <l>And have so little care to know his mind?</l>
               <l>When many Questions you should ask him rather.</l>
               <l>Another woman would not keep off so</l>
               <l>From her own Husband that away had staid</l>
               <l>Twenty years long, and suffer'd so much woe,</l>

                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> to his Son then smilingly</l>
               <l>Said, Let <hi>(Telemachus)</hi> your Mother try me,</l>
               <l>Perhaps she know me better will anon.</l>
               <l>The cause why now so little she sets by me,</l>
               <l>Is that I have ill-favour'd Garments on.</l>

               <l>Who kills one man, unless great friends he have,</l>

               <l>But we have kill'd both many men and brave.</l>
               <l>Therefore consider what is to be done.</l>
               <l>Father (said he) let that be your own eare.</l>
               <l>So wise as you are men say there is none.</l>
               <l>Our hands to do your pleasure ready are.</l>
               <l>Why then I'll tell you what is best to do.</l>
               <l>Put on your Coats; and let the women all</l>

               <l>The Minstrel play; and they to dancing sall;</l>

               <l>When he shall hear such mirth and melody,</l>
               <l>May think, This surely is the Wedding-day.</l>
               <l>That so before this slaughter Fame have spread,</l>
               <l>Depart we may from hence into the field,</l>
               <l>And 'gainst the people of the Town make head,</l>
               <l>And take such counsel more as <hi>Jove</hi> shall yield.</l>
               <l>When this was said, the men their Coats put on.</l>
               <l>The Damsels dress themselves, the Minstrel sung</l>

               <l>And one that heard this as he stood without,</l>

               <l>Fie, Fie, she could no longer now hold out.</l>

               <l>Woman, said he, who has remov'd my bed?</l>
               <l>It cannot be but by a force Divine.</l>

               <l>I'th' Court an Olive-tree stood great and tall,</l>
               <l>Thick as a Pillar. I about it made</l>

               <l>And cutting off the boughs the roof I laid.</l>
               <l>And in the wall a good strong door I form.</l>
               <l>When this done, I cut up by the root,</l>
               <l>And smóoth'd with Iron Tools a lusty Corm,</l>
               <l>And setting it upright fixt the bed to't,</l>
               <l>And pierc'd the wood with wimbles where 'twas meet,</l>

               <l>Like an old Beggar with a Staff in's hand,</l>

               <l>We mock, we rare him, throw things at his head.</l>
               <l>He patiently endured all his harms,</l>
               <l>Until by <hi>Jupiter</hi> encouraged</l>
               <l>From our the Hall he took away the Arms;</l>
               <l>And in an upper Chamber lockt them fast.</l>
               <l>Then craftily he bids his Wife to send</l>

               <l>Th's the beginning was of our ill end.</l>
               <l>For much too weak to bend the Bowe were we.</l>
               <l>But when it was unto <hi>Ulysses</hi> brought,</l>
               <l>Fearing by him left it should bended be,</l>
               <l>We all at once cri'd out, Hold, giv't him not.</l>
               <l>Only <hi>Telemachus</hi> cri'd, Let him try.</l>
               <l>And then 'twas put into <hi>Ulysses</hi> hands.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> bent it very easily.</l>
               <l>Then leapt he to the Sill, and there he stands;</l>
               <l>And round about he lookt upon us grim;</l>

               <l>At whom he took his aim, and killed him;</l>

               <l>And one upon another down we fall.</l>
               <l>'Twas plain, some present God there gave him aid.</l>
               <l>For then he follow'd us about the Hall</l>

               <l>Of Groans and Blows it made a dismal sound.</l>
               <l>And thus, King <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> died we.</l>
               <l>Our Bodies yet there lie upon the ground.</l>
               <l>Our Friends yet unacquainted with it be.</l>

                  <hi>Jove, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> had I been</l>
               <l>Such as I was at <hi>Neritus,</hi> when I</l>

               <l>When you and the proud Suiters were in fight,</l>
               <l>I had made many of them bend the knee.</l>
               <l>And you would have rejoyced at the sight.</l>

               <l>The Nurse had bidden them come speedily.</l>
               <l>They wondered to see <hi>Ulysses</hi> there.</l>
               <l>But he to <hi>Dolius</hi> then gently said,</l>

                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> of himself could not have done</l>

               <l>In <hi>Mentors</hi> shape he plainly did appear;</l>

               <l>My counsel therefore to you now is this,</l>

               <l>So said he then, but little profiting.</l>
               <l>For more than half with alalaes up start,</l>

               <l>When now <hi>Ulysses</hi> and his Company</l>
               <l>Removed had their hunger with good chear,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> said, Some one go forth and see</l>
               <l>Whether the <hi>Ithacesians</hi> be near.</l>
               <l>And then one of the young men standing there</l>
               <l>Went forth and saw them as he past the Sill;</l>
               <l>And turning back, Arm, said he, they are here;</l>
               <l>And then they all put on their Arms of Steel.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> and his Son and Servants, four,</l>
               <l>Six Sons of <hi>Dolius.</hi> And the old men</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Laertes</hi> were and <hi>Dolius</hi> two more.</l>
               <l>Aged they were, but necessary then.</l>
               <l>Then arm'd, <hi>Ulysses</hi> leading, out they go.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pallas</hi> both in person and in voice</l>
               <l>Resembling <hi>Mentor</hi> in came to them too.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> seeing her did much rejoyce.</l>
               <l>And looking on <hi>Telemachus,</hi> he said,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Telemachus</hi> this Battle will declare</l>
               <l>Who Courage has, who not. Be not afraid.</l>
               <l>That you dishonour not your stock beware.</l>
               <l>Father, said he, you shall see by and by,</l>
               <l>You need not be ashamed of your Son.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:45587:156"/>
                  <hi>Laertes</hi> this discourse heard joyfully</l>
               <l>And to the Gods cri'd out in passion,</l>
               <l>O ye kind Gods, and happy day is this!</l>
               <l>O joy! My Son and Grandson are at strife</l>
               <l>Which of the two the most Courageous is,</l>
               <l>And ready to buy Honour with his life.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Pallas</hi> to <hi>Laertes</hi> said, My Friend,</l>
               <l>Son of <hi>Arcesius,</hi> whom the Gods do love,</l>
               <l>With all your force your Spear now from you send.</l>
               <l>But pray first unto <hi>Pallas</hi> and to <hi>Jove.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He praid, and threw his Spear, which th'Helmet smot</l>
               <l>Of old <hi>Eupeithes,</hi> and went into's head.</l>
               <l>Down dead he fell; the Helmet sav'd him not.</l>
               <l>His Armour rattled, and his spirit fled.</l>
               <l>And then fell on, <hi>Ulysses</hi> and his Son,</l>
               <l>Upon the foremost both with Sword and Spear,</l>
               <l>And surely had destroy'd them ev'ry one,</l>
               <l>Had not <hi>Jove</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Pallas</hi> then been there.</l>
               <l>She to the People call'd aloud and said,</l>
               <l>Hold <hi>Ithacesians.</hi> The Quarrel may</l>
               <l>Without more blood be ended. They afraid</l>
               <l>Of th'Heavenly voice began to run away.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ulysses</hi> yet not ceased to pursue</l>
               <l>The Captains of his foes, till from above</l>
               <l>In Thunder <hi>Jove</hi> his sooty Bolt down threw.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Pallas</hi> said, Beware; offend not <hi>Jove.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And glad was then <hi>Ulysses</hi> to give o're.</l>
               <l>By <hi>Pallas</hi> were propounded terms of Peace</l>
               <l>In <hi>Meutor</hi>'s shape; and each part to them swore.</l>
               <l>And thus it was agreed the War should cease.</l>
