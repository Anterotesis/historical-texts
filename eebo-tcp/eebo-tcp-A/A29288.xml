            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>PARIS</hi> being in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Solitude, by reaſon of
the King's Abſence, when
He was following the Wars
in <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Seaſon of the Year
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59414:2"/>
and the Novelty of the thing, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
certain Perſons of Quality to a
retreat in the Country; who had
Souls ſo well fitted for Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that having given the firſt part
of the day to other noble Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſuch as the place afforded
them variety of, they ſpent their
Evenings in diſcourſing upon the
Paſſions, and other things, which
even in Deſarts people of Senſe
may find entertainment in. But
one night their Pleaſures were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
or rather, to ſpeak more
properly, varied by the arrival of
the Poſt with Letters to ſeveral in
the Company, and 'twas the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
propoſal, they ſhould be read
publickly, for the common ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
—Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier,</hi> one
whoſe Wit render'd him not the
leaſt conſiderable amongſt them,
received that which follows.</p>
               <p>IT is two Months ſince I had any
Letter from you; from whene
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59414:2"/>
proceeds this ſilence? Have you ſo
much forgot me, or has any Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
happen'd to you? Ah! how cruel
are you? Tell me if there be any that
has a greater Intereſt than I, in all
that relates to you; and whether you
ought to neglect me at ſuch a rate,
as to believe you owe me not at leaſt
this ſatisfaction. Alas! you love
me not, ſince you can be thus long and
not tell me you do. I find too unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
that all the marks you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me of your Tenderneſs, were but
purely an effect of your Wit; your
Heart had no ſhare in them, at leaſt
they proceeded from Complaiſance ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Kindneſs, and were more the
effects of Gratitude than Inclination:
for I cannot imagine how a man can
love (after the manner that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Love) and live as you do. You
know, that you promiſed me in leaving
this place, to give me an account of
your Life every eight days. I ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59414:3"/>
my ſelf to be ſo pleaſingly flatter'd
with it, that it enabled me to bear
more eaſily the firſt days of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
There is nothing more eaſie
than to abuſe the credulity of a Heart
that loves one, but there is nothing
more baſe, and unworthy. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to comfort my ſelf for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
after a continued happineſs,
as your Preſence gave me, by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
I expected in a converſe by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which would further engage <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s:
But you have allow'd me that Pleaſure
but a ſhort time; what have I done?
and why had you not told me, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was a deſtroyer of Friendſhip in
you? Then perhaps I ſhould have been
prepared for it, and not found my ſelf
under the neceſſity of making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to you, of your ſelf. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to juſtifie your ſelf if you can,
or deceive me by ſome falſe Reaſons.
I am even deſperate to think you Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
and not to find an Excuſe for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59414:3"/>
your Ingratitude, <hi>Adieu.</hi> Neglect
not any thing to make me believe you
are Faithful, and that you have not
wronged me, <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Company were ſo well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with this Letter, that they
would not be ſatisfied without
knowing upon what occaſion it
was writ; and Monſieur <hi>Le Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
with ſome difficulty, was
brought to make the following
Relation.</p>
               <p>It is ſome time ſince, That I
made a Journy a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was
call'd by my affairs: But being the
firſt time I was in that Country,
it is no wonder I loſt my way.
This misfortune happened to me
when I leaſt thought of it; and I
perceiv'd my Error too late to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it; for as it was dark, I found
my ſelf in the midſt of a Wood,
where the farther I went, the
more I was intangled, and out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59414:4"/>
of hopes to get out.—In fine, the
Weather being very bad, and the
ways worſe, I concluded it beſt to
take my Lodging under a Tree, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than expoſe my ſelf to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Accidents I might meet with
in paſſing Rivers and ill ways, at
ſuch a time of Night. I need not
tell you the little pleaſure there is
in being reduced to this Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but it made me hope it would
be the laſt Adventure of Knight-Errantry,
that would ever happen
to me.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was entertaining my ſelf
with theſe unpleaſant Thoughts, a
Peaſant, who by happy chance paſs'd
that way to his own Houſe, came
pretty near me; I ſent my Servant to
deſire him to come to me, whom
we engaged by good Words and
Promiſes to guide Us to ſome Inn.—
He told us, that we were three
Leagues out of our way, and that
he knew of no Lodging, but a
League off, by the moſt deteſtable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59414:4"/>
way in the World.—We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at laſt at a little Village,
where there was but one houſe of
Accommodation. God knows how
ill I was Treated there, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Knockt an hour at the door, to
oblige our Hoſt to riſe; who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, would not open it, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Faith of our Guide, who
ſwore we were honeſt people:
The Peaſant ſtayed with us, and
eat, and drank with us, and lay
in the ſame houſe. I, that had
but a little miſerable Straw for a
Bed, and a couple of vile Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
paſs'd not the Night ſo well
as he, but better however than I
ſhould have done in the Wood.
The trouble, and wearineſs, I had
endured, ſupplied the want of a
better Lodging, and ſerved me at
laſt for a Pillow, ſo that about
break of day I fell aſleep. I had
not ſlept two hours when the
Peaſant entered my Chamber, and
waked me, very briskly to tell me,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59414:5"/>
that Madam the <hi>Abbeſs</hi> expected
me. I received this Complement
with a very wicked Air, and knew
not what he meant by this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
the <hi>Abbeſs,</hi> and was in a
mind to have forgot the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I had to him the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
The poor man knew well,
by the reception I made him, that
I was not pleaſed, although he
deſigned to do me Service; he
went out to carry my Anſwer to
the Perſon that ſent him: But
for my part, I could not poſſibly
recover my Sleep, and thought
only of what this Man had ſaid
to me, that an <hi>Abbeſs</hi> askt for
me: I knew none in that
Country, yet believed there might
be ſome Convent there-abouts;
but could not divine, why they
ſhould ſend for me, unleſs they
took me for another. VVhat ſoever
it was, I confeſs that I made but an
ill return to this Civility; and
if the Peaſant was of an humour to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59414:5"/>
tell all he ſaw, and the diſpleaſure
which I diſcovered when I ſent
him back, this <hi>Abbeſs</hi> had as much
cauſe to complain of me, as I had
reaſon to praiſe her: This refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
began to give me a little
trouble, out of which I was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the coming of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
of this Lady, to tell me,
with a little more Ceremony, that
the Lady <hi>Abbeſs,</hi> to whom this
Village did belong, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her Shepherd, that a Man of
Quality that had loſt his way, was
conſtrained to take up in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Inn, had ſent him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
me to accept of a Lodging
leſs incommodious than that was.
This Complement brought ſome
allay to my trouble; and I was in
Charity with my Peaſant, ſince he
procured me this honour that the
<hi>Abbeſs</hi> did me; I anſwered the
Almoner the moſt civilly that was
poſſible, and deſired him to tell
his Lady, that I had the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59414:6"/>
Sentiments in the
World for the favour ſhe did me;
and that I would come my ſelf
immediately to aſſure her of it:
My Man was up, and I made him
give me Cloaths better than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and with Gallantry enough
prepared for this Viſit. The Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
that ſerved me for a Guide
here, conducted me thither alſo. I
was brought into the Parlour where
I ſtayed not long for her coming.</p>
               <p>I think it is beſt before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further, to give you a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of this <hi>Abbeſs:</hi> You muſt
imagine her to be a Lady of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty eight years old, of
an indifferent Stature, but well
made; her Hair fair and thick;
her Eyes blue and ſparkling; her
Mouth admirably well; her Noſe
very handſome, and her Teeth
paſſable, with the ſhape of her
Face ſo round and charming,
that to ſay Truth, it was more fit
to inſpire Love than Devotion:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59414:6"/>
She had nevertheleſs an Air ſo
ſweet and modeſt, that in pleaſing,
it imprinted a reſpect in us, which
abated our Courage; her Voice
even had ſomething ſo particular,
one cannot expreſs it. I ſaw this
Perſon; and, if I muſt diſguiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from you, will confeſs ſhe
touch't me at firſt fight. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
no longer the ill night
I had paſſed; I almoſt forgot my
ſelf, in ſuffering my ſelf to be
wounded by this fair Priſoner:
'Tis true, I was not taken by
Lines ſo ſtrong as could not be
broken, or at leaſt ſtretched;
yet not ſo ſlight neither, but that
there remained in me a deſire to
pleaſe a Perſon, that pleaſed me
extreamly. She told me moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly,
that ſhe wiſhed I had
paſſed better hours than I had
done in the Inn; and beſeeched
me to ſpend that day with her, to
repoſe my ſelf after the hardſhips
I had endured the preceedent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59414:7"/>
Night: Her requeſt was very kind,
and as I excuſed it, I did it ſo
coldly, that it might be eaſily
ſeen that I had no mind to leave
her yet; but as ſhe had a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
and quick Wit, ſhe told
me, that if ſhe had not all the
power over me, that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ingage me to ſtay, ſhe
did not doubt, but two or three
of her Friends would be able to
prevail with me, as ſoon as I
had ſeen them, and that I had
not reſolution enough to reſiſt
their Prayers as I had done hers:
She had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but
ſhe made the Ladies to be called, of
whom ſhe ſpoke; but I (who was
willing to give her the entire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
aſſured her that ſhe would
tempt me in vain on that ſide, for a
thing which none but ſhe could
obtain of me, and that I did not
believe that there was any thing
in the World that had ſo much
Power over the Spirit of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59414:7"/>
Man, as ſhe, or could better
make themſelves to be obeyed.
This Complement was received of
the <hi>Abbeſs,</hi> as I deſired: She had
modeſty and virtue; yet flattery
always found her weak ſide, and
ſhe could rarely defend her ſelf
from it: She knew, ſhe had beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and though ſhe ſerved not her
ſelf of it, as a worldly perſon;
neither did ſhe neglect it ſo much,
but that ſhe had a certain joy in
having it pleaſe. The three Nuns,
her Friends, arrived as ſhe was
going to anſwer, and changing
ſuddenly her Thoughts; Here is (ſaid
ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turning towards them) ſufficient
to make you recal your words:
theſe Ladies will perhaps teach
you not to anſwer ſo eaſily for
your ſelf, I will leave you with
them for an hour, about ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
buſineſs, and expect to find
you at my return of another
mind. I ſwear to you, Madam,
(anſwered I ſoftly) I will remain
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59414:8"/>
in it for ever; and if <hi>I</hi> could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that <hi>I</hi> ſhould change, <hi>I</hi>
would depart immediately. She
anſwered only with a Smile, for
fear of explaining her ſelf too
much before theſe perſons. <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a very free Converſation with
theſe three Ladies, and knew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
that they affected not, what
was ſerious, but with people whoſe
Cenſures they apprehended: In
effect, they ſeemed pleaſed with
my freedom, and ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
about me with much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
I never in my Life
converſed with Perſons that had
ſo much Wit; every thing, they
ſaid, was ſpoke with much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity,
that it charmed the Ears;
and had not any thing in it of
that Monaſtical Air, which ſpoils
the beſt things that one can ſay,
that is infected with it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it will not tire you, if I
make a deſcription of theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as well as the Abbeſs; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

one of them, which was
her Siſter; and who has the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part in this Hiſtory, and writ
me the Letter which you have
read. She was a Woman of an
admirable ſtature, very fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion'd;
the ſhape of her Face
oval; her Eyes fair, and full of
fire; and if ſhe wanted any thing,
'twas a little colour; her Voice
was very ſweet, and ſhe ſung di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely;
there was never any thing
better formed, and more Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
than her Mouth; the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Teeth anſwered well
to this admirable Carnation; and
the Breath which came from this
fair Mouth, was ſo ſweet, that it
purified the moſt noiſome Air:
I muſt add to all theſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that ſhe had as much Wit
as 'twas poſſible one could have,
and a Wit always at command,
never ſpeaking any thing that
was not worthy of admiration.
I will go no farther with her

deſcription, it will be tireſom, ſince
no longer the Mode; and will only
ſay, that there was not any thing
common in this Lady. The two
others were Perſons amiable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
the one had a little more
Spritelineſs than the other; who
in exchange had more Sincerity,
which rendered her a particular
Friend of the <hi>Abbeſs</hi>'s Siſter.</p>
               <p>In entertained theſe three Nuns
for ſome time with indifferent
things, wherein I endeavoured to
diſcover as much Wit as I could:
They did Wonders on their ſide
to maintain the Converſation,
particularly the <hi>Abbeſs</hi>'s Siſter:
This Charming Perſon ſaid not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, but what was new;
in ſo much, that I believed there
was not any thing in the World
that had ſo much Wit, or could
make ſo good uſe of it. The
<hi>Abbeſs</hi> came at laſt, and certainly
<hi>à propos.</hi> if ſhe had the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to retain what ſhe had gained
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59414:10"/>
upon me, for to ſpeak the truth,
the merit of her Siſter appeared
to me too great to give her leſs
than a Heart. I was upon the
point of changing my firſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as ſhe at her departure almoſt
divined I ſhould; and I was juſt
going to be perjur'd, if her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
had not renew'd the Flame,
which the firſt ſight of her had
kindled in my Soul: her Siſter at
leaſt hindred the progreſs of it;
and I confeſs that had I not ſeen
her, I ſhould have loved the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs</hi>
very well. I never ſtirred
from the Parlour all that day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſometimes with the one, and
ſometimes with other of theſe
two perſons.</p>
               <p>I believe (continued Monſieur <hi>Le
Chevalier)</hi> that the company will
not deſire I ſhould make a long
Story of this Adventure, nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them with every little Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.
<hi>Make not account</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Marchioneſs) <hi>that we will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59414:11"/>
allow you to omit the leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which may be of Conſequence;
and we expect You ſhould be as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in your Relation, as in your
Gallantry. We may permit him</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Dutcheſs) <hi>to paſs over
many little things which he may tell
us another ſeaſon, that we may have
time now for the reſt. I would know</hi>
(purſued the ſame Lady, ſpeaking
to the Cavalier) <hi>with what Air,
and how you managed your ſelf with
theſe two Ladies? and being VVitty,
as they were, how could either of
them ſuffer a Competitor? For me-thinks
it is very difficult to deceive
two Miſtreſſes, much more two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that you muſt almoſt always
ſee together.</hi> I will tell you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(anſwered the Cavalier) what
has happened to me in a year and
halfs time, that I had the honour
to be known to them. For the
firſt time that I ſaw them, I ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a day and a half in the
Viſit, but found enough in this,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59414:11"/>
to make me deſire not to be long
abſent; for all the time I ſtayed
in that Province, I left them as
late as I could, and came back
again as early as poſſible. When
I conſulted the different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I had for the two Siſters,
<hi>I</hi> found, (at leaſt <hi>I</hi> thought ſo)
that <hi>I</hi> was in love with the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,</hi>
and had a great eſteem; and
a moſt tender Friendſhip for the
other. I was charmed with the
Beauty and Sweetneſs of the firſt,
and at the ſame time ſenſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Perfections and
Merit of the other, and had for
her a ſtrange kind of tenderneſs,
even when I was with the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was not much put to it, to
ſtudy my Actions at firſt; if there
happened any thing remarkable in
favour of the Eldeſt, the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was ready to attribute it to
her Quality above her; and the
Elder took all for Gallantry of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59414:12"/>
Spirit, that I ſaid obligingly to
the youngeſt: It is true, this
ſimple Error laſted not long, for
the more we love, the clearer
ſighted we are in the matters to
Rivals; ſo that both growing to
have a little more eſteem for me
than they had, they began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
one another, and obſerved
my Words, and Actions, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Eyes than they had done
hitherto: Sometimes, one told me,
that I praiſed her Siſter, with that
Exaggeration as was only proper to
Love; the other reproacht me, that
<hi>I</hi> always ſought the <hi>Abbeſs;</hi> and
that ſhe obſerved, that <hi>I</hi> was not
pleaſed, but when <hi>I</hi> was with her:
All theſe little Complaints were but
to make me declare my ſelf; and
there was no Remedy, but <hi>I</hi> muſt
do it, after having in vain avoided
it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abbeſs</hi>'s Siſter (whom we
will call <hi>Egidia)</hi> was the laſt that
preſt me, but ſucceeded beſt. She
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59414:12"/>
found the opportunity of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
entertainment, at a ſeaſon
when ſhe knew her Siſter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by ſome affairs, that ſhe could
not diſpence with: and looking
upon me, with an Air the moſt
tender in the World; Monſieur <hi>Le
Chevalier</hi> (ſaid ſhe) It is no longer
time to diſſemble any thing with
you; you have Wit, and know
but too well, that you are not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to me; it is now five or ſix
months ſince we have been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet <hi>I</hi> have never ſaid any thing
poſitively on this point; but this
day <hi>I</hi> will do more for you, than
you can expect from a Woman of
my humour; 'tis to confeſs to you,
that <hi>I</hi> have much tenderneſs and
eſteem for you; if you know me,
you will not think this Confeſſion
little; and if you are obliged to
me, it is for telling you that,
which if <hi>I</hi> pleaſed might have been
concealed all my Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In the Tranſports, that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59414:13"/>
put me, <hi>I</hi> would have taken
her Hand, and Kiſt it a thouſand
times to teſtifie my joy to her;
and how <hi>I</hi> conſidered ſo charming
a Declaration; but ſhe hindered
me, and pulling away her Hand,
ſhe bid me hear her out. If you
believe (purſued ſhe) that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<hi>I</hi> do you in this Declaration,
merits any acknowledgment, give
me that proof of it which <hi>I</hi> ſhall
demand. You are too Gallant a Man,
to be guilty of ſo much baſeneſs, as
'tis to deceive any one; much more,
thoſe who have an eſteem, and
Friendſhip for you:—It is ſome time
ſince <hi>I</hi> diſcovered that the Lady
<hi>Abbeſs</hi> loves you; ſhe her ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
it not from me.—Perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe knows, that <hi>I</hi> too am
guilty of the ſame weakneſs: but
ſhe is of opinion, that you love
none but her; and, if <hi>I</hi> may believe
your Eyes, your Heart has intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with her's. Tell me the
Truth.—Do you love her in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59414:13"/>
good earneſt? Tell me, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
imbarquing my ſelf further in
this affair, I this moment ſacrifice
to her the inclination that I have to
love you: I am yet reaſonable enough
to render Juſtice to my Rival (if
you will have me call her ſo) and
to confeſs to you that She merits
all your thoughts; and ſhe is too
haughty and conſcious of her
worth to be ſatisfied with leſs; and
to tell you the truth, though I
am her Inferior, I am ſo jealous in
this particular, that I ſhould not
without much pain, conſent to
give place even to her. Conſider
with your ſelf a little, and—Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
(ſaid I to her, not being able
to forbear interrupting her) I have
no need to conſider.—It is not
three days, ſince I have but too
clearly explained my ſelf to your
Siſter; if ſhe would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
me.—<hi>I</hi> avow, that
her Goodneſs engaged me to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, that <hi>I</hi> ſtole from you;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59414:14"/>
but <hi>I</hi> am like to prove very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
if no leſs than my Heart
will pay the Obligations I have to
her.—'Twas on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt,
in the evening, when you were in
the Garden, that ſhe took her time
to tell me, That <hi>I</hi> had but one ſtep
to make me to poſſeſs her Heart
intirely, and that this was, that <hi>I</hi>
ſhould hereafter forbear to be ſo
exceeding civil to you.—What
is that you propoſe to me Madam?
(Anſwered <hi>I,</hi> much ſurprized with
what ſhe had ſaid) are you unjuſt
enough to make me purchaſe your
Heart, by ſuch a baſeneſs?—You
muſt pardon me Madam, if you
pleaſe—but <hi>I</hi> cannot believe,
that you would indeed, make me
ſo Criminal.—<hi>I</hi> underſtand you
(replyed ſhe haſtly) and begin to
know the fault, which my impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has made me to commit.
—You eſteem not my Heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to engage you to ſuch a
loſs, as that of my Siſters.—But
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59414:14"/>
before you go too far, <hi>I</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
you, to examine what Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhe has for you, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no other poſſeſs that eſteem,
you pretend to, alone. Madam
(anſwered <hi>I) I</hi> know not what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in your Siſters Heart; but ſince
<hi>I</hi> have received all imaginable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
from her, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have the
greateſt regret in the World, if <hi>I</hi>
gave her the leaſt cauſe to repent
of it. You muſt however, reſolve
upon it (replyed ſhe, with a tone,
fierce, and diſdainful) or pretend
no more to any Kindneſs from me,
which cannot be obtained at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
price. <hi>I</hi> was going to anſwer
her, and ſhould have declared my
ſelf ſo plainly, as to give her oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
no longer to doubt of what
paſt my Soul; when ſhe retired
her ſelf, leaving me to conſider
what <hi>I</hi> was to do.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee Madam (continued
<hi>I</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Egidia)</hi> what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Converſation; <hi>I</hi> have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59414:15"/>
ſeen the <hi>Abbeſs</hi> ſeveral times ſince;
but whether ſhe could not find me
alone, or that ſhe feared to know
too ſoon, what ſhe would rather be
ignorant of, ſhe has not ſince ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to me of any ſuch thing.—
<hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs the Truth, <hi>I</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her fair, her Charms at firſt,
ſurprized my tenderneſs; and what
<hi>I</hi> yet feel for her is worthy a true
Friend; <hi>I</hi> cannot refuſe to rank her
in that number, though even your
ſelf ſhould command the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>This Charming Virgin was ſo
pleaſed with the ſincerity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>I</hi> ſpoke to her, and to find
that there had no more paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her Siſter and <hi>I,</hi> that ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
conſented to our friendſhip:
and being aſſured (as ſhe was) of
the intire poſſeſſion of my Love, ſhe
could not reaſonably do leſs.</p>
               <p>We parted very well ſatisfied,
and more amorous than before, at
leaſt it was ſo on my ſide; that ſoft
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59414:15"/>
tenderneſs, which <hi>I</hi> at firſt had for
her, had already took the form of
a ſtrong Paſſion, which increaſed
dayly, whilſt that <hi>I</hi> had for the
<hi>Abbeſs</hi> diminiſhed as faſt, almoſt
before <hi>I</hi> perceived it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of <hi>Egidia,</hi> of what ſhe felt
for me, appeared to me ſo full of
Charms, that it finiſhed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of my Soul; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
no more of it to her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
then what was ſufficient to
ſay, <hi>I</hi> did not hate her. I lookt
upon her no more, but as a Friend,
and a Perſon to whom <hi>I</hi> was very
much obliged: She quickly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, either that ſhe perceived
ſome alteration in my manner of
acting, or that ſhe feared her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
more ſince we diſcourſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>I</hi> obſerved, that ſhe took
notice of all <hi>I</hi> did, and that ſhe
had not that Confidence in me,
ſhe was accuſtomed to have:
She affected even not to believe
any thing I ſaid to her.—But
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59414:16"/>
when with <hi>Egidia</hi> it was not the
ſame, for what jealouſie ſoever
ſhe felt, ſhe diſcovered none of it
to her; but always ſpoke of me,
as poſſeſſing a Heart, which ſhe
did not fear to loſe. She for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her ſelf ſometimes to rally
upon what ſhe ſaw <hi>Egidia</hi> do
for me. In ſo much, that one day
<hi>Egidia</hi> could not hide her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments,
nor ſuffer without
impatience to ſee her Triumph
over her, when ſhe was well
ſatisfied, that ſhe had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it; and that, ſhe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to her in terms malicious
enough. <hi>I</hi> believe (anſwered the
<hi>Abbeſs,</hi> in a fierce tone, and full
of ſcorn) that my intereſt is ſo
great in that Chevalier, that none
will diſpute it with me, or if any
durſt do it, that it would be in
vain. <hi>Egidia</hi> failed not to anſwer
her, and this little difference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſo far, that not being <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

were parties; they agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to me, and ingage me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
my ſelf before them, and that
ſhe who ſhould be worſt treated,
ſhould ſacrifice to the other all the
inclination ſhe had for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> imagine, that this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
had ſomething in it very
ſingular, and that there would
have been a very delightful Scene
for any one that had heard it.
This reſolution being taken, <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
who was a prudent Woman,
when ſhe reflected on what ſhe
had engaged her ſelf too, choſe
rather to renounce the Glory,
which this Victory might bring
her, (for ſhe did not at all doubt
of it) then expoſe me to thoſe ill
Conſequences, which might follow
this Declaration. Whereupon ſhe
writ me this Letter.</p>
               <p>I Am juſt now come from laying a

I Beg your Pardon, <hi>Madam,</hi> that I

the queſtion that was prepared for

               <p>I forgot to tell you at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that this was one of thoſe
Convents, where the Nuns enjoy
a honeſt liberty, and where Kindred,
and particular Friends are permitted
to enter, and ſee them in their
Apartments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> went to Dine with the <hi>Abbeſs,</hi>
as the place where I ordinarily eat
at, and was very melancholy at
Table contrary to my Cuſtom, for
commonly <hi>I</hi> was ſo happy as to
divert the Company well enough,
which is often the beſt ragouſt at
Meals: the two intereſſed Ladies,
were the firſt that obſerved it, and
the <hi>Abbeſs</hi> ſaid ſeveral obliging
things to me, to put me in a better
humor; but ſeeing I did not anſwer
her; She at laſt, ask'd me, what
the matter was with me, that
made me ſo ſerious? I told her
it was a deſperate pain in my head
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59414:18"/>
that had taken me ſince the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>She had not neglected any thing
that day, to make her ſelf appear
fair; and though the Dreſs of all
Nuns, are almoſt alike, yet I avow
to you, that I found ſomething in
hers ſo particular and agreeable,
that with the ſweet, and obliging
manner wherewith ſhe ſpake to
me, the reſolution <hi>I</hi> had taken to
break with her, began to give me
ſome pain, and without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of her Siſter, ſhe had been
powerful enough, perhaps to have
made me repent it.—There was
always two or three other Nuns of
the <hi>Abbeſs</hi>'s Friends, that uſed to
eat with us, whom ſhe ſubtilly rid
her ſelf of, ſo ſoon as ſhe had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

befal me,) any thing wherewith I
was ſo much affected; and that <hi>I</hi>
ought to give her the ſatisfaction
at leaſt of truſting her, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it was not in her power to cure
me.—<hi>I</hi> do not believe (ſaid
her Siſter, to ſave me the trouble of
anſwering her) that there is any
other cauſe than what he has told
you. One often ſees (continued
ſhe) that people who have ſo much
Wit as <hi>Monſieur Le Chevalier,</hi> are
ſubject to theſe terrible Headachs,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59414:19"/>
and that they paſs from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the other, that is, from
great Mirth, to as great Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
You believe then Siſter (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the <hi>Abbeſs</hi> coldly) that you
know Monſieur's diſtemper, ſince
you take upon you to anſwer for
him; yet I will imagine that it is
not as you ſay, but believe what he
ſhall tell me, of it. And if he'l fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
my advice (ſaid <hi>Egidia)</hi> he
ſhall tell you nothing.—<hi>I</hi> do
know it; and it is ſo much the
harder, for people that know it
not, to judge well of it. Believe
me (ſaid the <hi>Abbeſs,</hi> with a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Smile) if I ask to know it, 'tis
not that <hi>I</hi> am ignorant of it; but
to diſabuſe others, who, I ſee, are
ſo fond of what they fancy they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
that they fear to be undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
—I conjure you Ladies,
(interrupted <hi>I,</hi> all of a ſudden) leave
me as I am.—Whatſoever my
Diſeaſe is, and whenceſoever it
comes, <hi>I</hi> neither can—nor will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59414:20"/>
be cured of it if I cou'd;—I
would only ſuffer leſs. For my
part (ſaid the <hi>Abbeſs)</hi> I who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to divine, nor to penetrate
ſo deep into Hearts, as my Siſter,
would willingly be told of what
nature this Diſtemper is; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
(inſenſibility not being my
Vice, for certain people in the
World) <hi>I</hi> might give 'em eaſe, if
it lay in me to ſweeten their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There could not be any
thing more Gallant, nor Favourably
ſaid for me; and <hi>I</hi> believe, that <hi>I</hi>
ſhould have anſwered her as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
had not <hi>Egidia,</hi> (looking ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
upon me) made me, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
my promiſe, and put me in a
ſtate of not knowing what to ſay.
This amiable Lady perceived the
Confuſion, I was in, and very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely
put in, to the diſcourſe.
It is true (ſaid ſhe) there are certain
ills, that one muſt have recourſe to
the perſon that cauſed them, for a
remedy: but if <hi>I</hi> be'nt miſtaken, this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59414:20"/>
is not <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s caſe; and you are
deceived if you believe, that you
are capable of curing his Diſtemper.
—Whatever it is (purſued ſhe)
<hi>I</hi> am ſo ſenſible for all that concerns
him, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall not be inquiſitous
to hear any of his misfortunes. For
you Madam (continued ſhe, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her Siſter) if you have this
deſire, you may ſatisfie your ſelf,
—but you ſhall permit me, if you
pleaſe, to retire.</p>
               <p>—And after theſe Words,
ſhe went away, and left me alone
with the <hi>Abbeſs,</hi> who believing ſhe
had cauſe to triumph told me, with
a joy, ſhe cou'd not conceal, that
ſhe ſaw well, that my Heart was
quitted to her, ſince the place was,
and that it was ſhe muſt cure me
of the ills whereof I complained;
but ſhe ſaid, She muſt know of my
ſelf, how she was eſtabliſhed in my
Heart, and how much above her
Siſter,—that she had given me
time enough to conſider of it, and

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59414:22"/>
that I muſt reſolve one way, either
not to hope any thing from her Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
or not divide a good that
she deſired the intire poſſeſſion of.
—That she'd allow, <hi>I</hi> should
have a tender eſteem for her Siſter,
but for my Heart, she would fill it
wholly her ſelf; and that she had
merit enough for it.—She was
ſilent here, to ſee a little what I
would ſay, but I made no anſwer;
and I believe that my ſilence told
her enough, and that she took it
for a wicked Omen. Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
after, (ſeeing me ready to
ſpeak, as one that had ſtudied what
to ſay) she prevented me (appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
(it is likely) that <hi>I</hi> would
explain my ſelf contrary to what
she deſired) My God! (ſaid she)
one has little reaſon to be ſatisfied
with you to day; if one were not
of a humour to pardon you eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, and that one had not
pity for you in this diſorder.—
Go, and repoſe your ſelf in your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59414:22"/>
Chamber,—the pain in your
Head requires it,—and I shall
take care that none diſturbs you.
—I retired with this permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
—with ſo much Confuſion
that <hi>I</hi> ſcarce knew what <hi>I</hi> did;
but <hi>I</hi> was not got to the door when
she called me back.—Hark
ye <hi>Monſieur</hi> (ſaid she with an Air
full of ſweetneſs) <hi>I</hi> will ſee you at
eight of the Clock this Night in the
Arbour of the farther Alley, where
<hi>I</hi>'ll expect you with one of my
Friends; and, if you love me you'l
not fail to be there. What do <hi>I</hi>
ſay (continued she haſtily) if you
love me?—Though you should
not love me, you are too much a
Gentleman to fail at a Rendezvous
that <hi>I</hi> give you, there not being any
thing that <hi>I</hi> know, that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with you, from it.—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dien,
—fail not to be there.
Finishing theſe words, she smiled,
and went into her Cloſet, to conceal
from me a Bluſh, that came into
her Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59414:23"/>
Behold! (continued <hi>Monſieur Le
Chevalier)</hi> how <hi>I</hi> came out of this
Converſation that <hi>I</hi> had ſo much
dreaded, which was much more
lucky for me than <hi>I</hi> expected, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eſcaped a terrible Confuſion,
that <hi>I</hi> should have been in, to have
declared my ſelf before theſe two
Ladies, what choice my Heart had
made: But I was not without fear
of my Evening aſſignation; <hi>I</hi> ſaw
well, she would expect me, and
that it was the laſt favour <hi>I</hi> was
like to receive from her.—But
ſince there was no avoiding of it, <hi>I</hi>
was reſolved not to diſguiſe any
thing by unworthy Equivocatings;
thinking <hi>I</hi> should do well to ſerve
my ſelf of this occaſion, that <hi>I</hi> should
find her alone to diſabuſe her, and
not delay it to a longer time: The
honours and favours she did me
augmented dayly, and ſo did my
ingratitude, whilſt she continued
in her Error. It is true, it would
have been unpardonable, if it had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59414:23"/>
been voluntary, but there is no
choice againſt powerful inclination.
—<hi>I</hi> determined upon this piece
of juſtice, and was the reſt of the
Afternoon preparing my ſelf for it.</p>
               <p>They went to Supper about Six
of the Clock, to have more time to
Walk, and I appeared leſs melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
at Table than at Noon: <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
who had not ſeen me ſince ſhe
left me with her Siſter, (though ſhe
had ſought me with extreme impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
to ask me what paſs'd in
that enterview) judg'd from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
ſhe ſaw in my humor, that
I had betrayed her. I ſaw her much
diſcompos'd, and that ſhe ſcarce eat
any thing, ſhe was ſo full of
thoughts: She had her Eyes always
upon me or the Abbeſs, to ſurprize
our looks, and ſee whether we
were of Intelligence to deceive her.
She had not patience to ſit ſo long
at Table as the reſt, but left us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſlight Pretext that ſhe took,
and retir'd into her Chamber; from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59414:24"/>
whence ſhe ſent me word by one of
her Friends (that cunningly acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her ſelf of the Commiſſion)
that ſhe deſired me to come ſpeak
with her there, ſo ſoon as I had
Sup'd. I failed not to wait on her,
and took ſo well my time when the
Abbeſs was with two or three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that came to viſit her, that ſhe
perceived it not. I found this Lady
fitting by a Table which ſhe lean'd
upon, with a very ſad air, who told
me as I entred, that I had no ſmall
obligation to her, for giving me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
by quitting the place, to
come ſo well out of this affair at
her coſt; and that ſhe doubted not
but her Siſter too had made an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it, but that ſhe loved
me ſo well, that ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of any thing that was for my
ſatisfaction; and that when it was
for my repoſe, ſhe would ſacrifice
all things, even her heart. But
changing preſently her diſcourſe,
By what charm (ſaid ſhe) or rather
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59414:24"/>
by what ingagement, hath the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
brought you into good humor?
For methinks you appear very gay
this Evening. Alas! You were very
melancholy this morning, have you
ſome pledge of her heart that gives
you thus much joy? Speak, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,
conceal not any thing from
me: You have betray'd me, and
without doubt could not ſave your
ſelf out of my Rivals hands, but on
theſe conditions. Betray'd you,
Madam I (anſwered I) I beg you
will tell me upon what ground you
have ſuch a Suſpicion? Believe, if
you pleaſe, that being far from
thinking it, I—No, no, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,
(ſaid ſhe interrupting me) I
ſee well you know me not: I am
capable of loving better than you
think, I cannot be ſatisfied with
your heart by peace meal, I would
have it intire to my ſelf, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I have lived in a doubtful hope
for ſome time, that I ſhould obtain
it as I deſired to have it. My Siſter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59414:25"/>
has given me a thouſand Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and I was alarmed by the
leaſt of her looks; that a continual
trouble hath not left me, to enjoy
in quiet the pleaſure there is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one is loved where one loves.
But after ſo many alarms, I am a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
perſwaded—I am reſolved
your Love ſhall not continue divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
though I loſe my ſhare of it;
And you, Monſieur, (continued
ſhe) muſt reſolve in good earneſt
to love the Abbeſs, and endeavour
to pleaſe her only. You'l not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have ſo much pain to do it as I
wiſh, but however I expect ſhe
ſhould confeſs to owe the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it to me, and know that I was
the firſt that motion'd it. I avow
to you (purſued ſhe, making a ſign
to me not to interrupt her) that
I am not without pain for the loſs
of you, and that what I am now
doing is harder to me than death;
but I will conquer, and if I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
power over you, make you do
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59414:25"/>
as I ſay, and look upon me no more
but as one of your Friends. As ſhe
ended theſe words, as ſtream of
Tears forced themſelves from her
fair eyes, and ſhe was ſo ſtrangely
overwhelmed with grief, that my
Heart was rack'd to ſee it: I could
not anſwer her ſuddenly, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
her tenderly, I admired the
Generoſity and good Nature of this
Lady: This tender paſſion which I
diſcover'd through her Tears, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the very bottom of my Soul;
and I determin'd rather to ſacrifice
my Life, than give her occaſion to
doubt my Faith to her. I made her
a thouſand proteſtations of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
when I was able to ſpeak;
and in the Eſtate wherein I was, not
being capable of any weak expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I ſaid ſo many touching things
to her, that ſhe was no longer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to loſe me. After we had
ſpent ſome time in tenderneſs, and
Tranſports which are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
I left her, excuſing my ſelf
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59414:26"/>
with pretence of ſome buſineſs
(without telling her of my aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Abbeſs, leſt ſhe
ſhould prevent it) but that I would
wait on her again before I went to
Bed.</p>
               <p>The hour was paſt that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to meet the Abbeſs, and the
tears of the charming <hi>Egidia</hi> had ſo
well diſpoſed me to do all things for
her, that I dyed with deſire to give
her this teſtimony of my love, after
that ſhe had given me of her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.
I went then to the place,
where I found the Abbeſs with one
of her Friends, that retired ſo ſoon
as ever ſhe ſaw me coming.</p>
               <p>She told me that ſhe began to be
weary of expecting me, and if I had
ſtayed a moment longer, ſhe would
ſcarce have pardoned me. I believ'd
Madam (anſwered I, coldly enough)
that I ſhould come time enough for
what you had to ſay to me. She
was much ſurpriſed with that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
after the obliging Reception
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59414:26"/>
ſhe had made me; but ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to diſſemble it, and without
taking notice of my unjuſt coldneſs,
treated me with all the ſweetneſs
in the world: There was nothing
that was ingaging but ſhe made uſe
of it, nor enchantment that ſhe
ſerved not her ſelf of. It ſuffices
that a Woman is fair, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to one, to make one find a
thouſand charms in her, when ſhe
deſigns to pleaſe. The reſolution I
had taken againſt this fair Abbeſs,
became by little and little unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
at leaſt very weak: She drew
from me a thouſand tenderneſſes I
know not how, and was no longer
the Perſon <hi>I</hi> would abandon: She
poſſeſs'd me ſo much in thoſe few
moments, that there was ſcarce
room left in my Soul for the <hi>Idea</hi> of
the amiable <hi>Egidia:</hi> To ſay the truth,
the Abbeſs knew ſo well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle
flames ſhe had once made
burn, that 'twas impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
ones ſelf from her: One would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59414:27"/>
ſay, that ſhe had ſtudied nothing
all her life but to charm, and the
moſt faithful of Lovers had been
pardonable for every infidelity ſhe
had made him guilty of; for it was
not in the power of man to do his
duty when ſhe ſeduced him. But
not to detain you longer, (when
there are ſo many things to ſay)
<hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs to you that ſhe made
me know, one cannot be aſſured of
any thing where a woman uſes
complaiſance. If this Lady was
not ſatisfied with me, ſhe had, at
leaſt, no occaſion to complain: One
thing might ſurpriſe you, and give
you an ill opinion of me, after the
reſolution I had taken; if I had not
told you that the Abbeſs had
charms none could reſiſt; and that
was, that I begg'd of her my ſelf
that ſhe would not preſs me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my ſelf in that ſhe would
know of me, but content her ſelf
with the power ſhe had over me.
And it was ſo great, that without
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59414:27"/>
lying I believe ſhe might have
made me guilty of the blackeſt perfidiouſneſs
in the world; but by
good fortune ſhe was willing not to
paſs further, becauſe perhaps ſhe
feared not to ſucceed, and that 'twas
not yet her time. She had had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
by ſome of thoſe that
were continually her Spies, of the
Viſit I made her Siſter, and that
they had ſeen her Eyes wet with
Tears: She made ſome ralleries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and told me that ſhe well
knew by my accoſt, the ſtrange im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
theſe tears had made in my
Soul; but ſhe would pardon me
hoping that in time I would accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
my ſelf to ſee people weep.
She ſaid all this, and many other
things, with an air ſo agreeable,
that <hi>I</hi> knew not how to be diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it. the mean while,
it grew very late, which <hi>I</hi> gave
her notice of, though ſhe was not
much pleaſed with it, and told me
that <hi>I</hi> was the moſt impertinent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59414:28"/>
Gallant in the world; but it was
time for us to retire, which we did
with a tender adieu, that engaged
us more than ever.</p>
               <p>All the ſweetneſs ſhe had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
me with, hindred not a
great repentance that ſucceeded it,
and fill'd my heart with a horrible
gall, ſo ſoon as ſhe was out of my
ſight: But this was nothing, there
muſt be ſomething more to puniſh
me for my injuſtice to <hi>Egidia.</hi> The
Abbeſs met her upon her return
back, and maliciouſly ask'd her
where <hi>I</hi> was. <hi>I</hi> know not (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Egidia)</hi> but <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe that not
being well, he went to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
betimes. You are deceived,
Siſter, (anſwered the Abbeſs) and
<hi>I</hi> will tell you that <hi>I</hi> know his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
better than you do: <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him to take the Air in the
Garden, and that would cure him;
as in effect he finds himſelf better:
You may know it from himſelf,
whom <hi>I</hi> parted with here not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59414:28"/>
ſince. <hi>Egidia</hi> remained the
moſt ſurpriſed in the world, and
knew not what to anſwer her; it
was not poſſible to conceal from her
a part of her reſentment, for which
the Abbeſs triumph'd with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
joy, and left her in that eſtate.
This poor Lady could not tell what
to think, after what <hi>I</hi> had ſaid to
her, and the Oaths <hi>I</hi> had made her
two hours before: She had too
good an opinion of me, to believe
lightly at another time what my
Siſter would ſay to my diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
but in this ſhe could neither
doubt nor excuſe me. the Treaſon
was but too manifeſt, and every
thing ſpoke againſt me. She was
at firſt agitated with a thouſand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
paſſions, and ſo much grief
ſeiz'd her at once, that ſhe was not
the ſame; one is always apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what one fears. The firſt
thing that ſhe deſired was to ſee
me, and ſhe ſent her Footboy to
fetch me to her: <hi>I</hi> came, and by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59414:29"/>
the impreſsment ſhe had to ſpeak
with me, <hi>I</hi> had ſome ſuſpicion of
the truth: <hi>I</hi> imagined that this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz
had not been ſo ſecret, but
that ſhe had made ſome ſhift to
come to the knowledg of it; but
did not think that the Abbeſs would
ſo ſpitefully declare it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> found this afflicted Lady alone
in a retired room, and ſaluting her,
<hi>I</hi> ſaw her ſo moved, and in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
that <hi>I</hi> no longer doubted but
ſhe knew of my being in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with her Siſter. She ſpoke not
to me at firſt, and, for my part, my
guilt, and the grief <hi>I</hi> was in for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a fault, had the ſame effect
upon me, that anger and jealouſie
had upon her; ſo that we were
both ſometime without ſaying any
thing: But at laſt, From whence
come you? (ſaid ſhe, with low voice
and with looking at me) <hi>I</hi> anſwered
her that her Boy had met me as <hi>I</hi>
was going to my Chamber. What!
(replyed ſhe, with a more elevated
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59414:29"/>
voice, and regarding me with eyes
fuller of grief than anger) have you
to do a new Treaſon? Did you
make me ſo many promiſes this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
but to deceive me with
more eaſe? What have <hi>I</hi> done to
you? After theſe words grief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
her of ſpeech, and ſhe was
juſt ſwooning away.</p>
               <p>I cannot repreſent to you the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
I was in, to ſee a Perſon dying
that was ſo dear to me: Ah! How
cruel were the moments, and how
happy I ſhould have been to have
dyed alſo, if Heaven would have
heard me, and not laugh at the
pains which Love makes us ſuffer?
I look'd upon her as a man without
ſenſe or motion, and had not the
power to aſſiſt her nor cal, for help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This fainting had not ſo far taken
away her ſenſes, but that ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
upon my face a concern that
ſpoke for me, and nothing (as ſhe
has ſince told me) made her return
ſooner from this cruel indiſpoſition,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59414:30"/>
than the intereſt ſhe ſaw I had in it.
The ſilence and confuſion I was in
made my peace, and all her grief
was not ſtrong enough to reſiſt the
ſatisfaction ſhe received from mine.</p>
               <p>By good fortune two Nuns paſs'd
by juſt then, who ſeeing her in that
eſtate, immediately run to us, and
thought that ſhe was fallen into
ſome Fits that Women are ſubject
to: This made a noiſe in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and the Abbeſs was with the
firſt informed of it, but was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-haſty
to ſuccour her. For my
part, I retired as ſoon as I ſaw there
were people enow about her: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Abbeſs ſent three or
four times to ſpeak with me, I
pray'd her to excuſe me, and ſaid,
that next day I would wait her
pleaſure. <hi>Egidia</hi> (that they had
carried to her Chamber) was come
to her ſelf again, and ſeeing me not
by her Bed ſide, at a time that ſhe
believed, if I had loved her, I could
not have left her; ask'd a Maid that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59414:30"/>
ſerved her ſoftly, if ſhe knew where
I was? This Maid that had ſeen me
go into my Chamber the moment I
quitted her Miſtreſs, with tears
flowing from my eyes, made a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
relation of it to her, wherewith
ſhe was ſo extremely touch'd, that
ſhe prayed her Siſter, who ſate by
her, to ſend for me. The Abbeſs
put her off a good while, and told
her that ſhe had already done it
twice to no purpoſe; and that ſhe
would no more ask to be refuſed.
<hi>Egidia,</hi> who paſſionately deſired to
ſee me, and could not endure I
ſhould paſs the Night in the ſadneſs
wherein I was; reſolved to try if
ſhe could prevail: She thought ſhe
ſhould not hazard much, nor loſe
much credit, if ſhe could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of me more than her Siſter.
She ſent to me then the ſame Maid
that ſhe confided in ſo much, to tell
me, that if I deſired ſhe ſhould be
better, I ſhould come to ſee her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I went to Bed, and that ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59414:31"/>
it, if I had yet a little Love
for her. I cannot tell you how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
I was to obey her, thoſe who
love may eaſier imagine it: I came
then to her Chamber, where was
none but the Abbeſs with her; who
expected with impatience to ſee
how this Scene wou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d paſs: Both
of them perceived preſently a
change of countenance in me. I
know not well what the Eldeſt
thought, but I am ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cauſed pity
in the younger. This poor Lady
look'd upon me with an air ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and touching, that <hi>I</hi> could not
forbear (notwithſtanding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of her Siſter) caſting my ſelf
on my knees before her, and taking
one of her hands, kiſs'd it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, and wet it with my
tears which <hi>I</hi> had not power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain.
There is no doubt but the
Abbeſs ſaw with an ill will theſe
ſenſibilities: Theſe were cruel
ſtrokes, which ſhe could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
diſcovering her reſentments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59414:31"/>
of, whatſoever endeavours ſhe uſed
to prevent it. Certainly Siſter,
(ſaid ſhe with a tone that ſurpriſed
us) Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier</hi> hath done
you ſome great injury, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
wherewith he ſeems to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of you: You cannot refuſe it to
his tears; yet (continued ſhe, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to go away) if you will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
by me, you ſhall not do any
thing, till he has promiſed you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to relapſe into the ſame fault
again; and <hi>I</hi>'ll anſwer for him, that
he cannot promiſe it, or if he do,
that he will be perjur'd. Make this
gallant peace, <hi>I</hi> will retire and leave
you alone, for <hi>I</hi> believe you deſire
no Witneſſes. <hi>I</hi> turned my head to
anſwer her, but ſhe was got out of
the Room, and ſaved me the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<hi>I</hi> ſhould have had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to have ſaid any thing in a
paſſion unbecoming the reſpect <hi>I</hi>
owel her. <hi>I</hi> remained then alone
with <hi>Egidia,</hi> and in greater confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
than when the Abbeſs was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59414:32"/>
there: Although <hi>I</hi> had many things
to ſay, <hi>I</hi> knew not where to begin,
and ſilence was the only Language
of which <hi>I</hi> ſerved my ſelf: But ſhe,
who ſuffered to ſee me afflicted,
(though it was for the Love of her)
after having endeavoured to reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
me by her looks; Well, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,
(ſaid ſhe in a ſoft tone, and
ſqueezing my hand) don't you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of having betrayed the beſt of
your Friends? Think well what you
have ſometimes ſaid to me: How
had you then the courage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me? Speak!—She made me
yet a thouſand other reproaches, to
which ſhe added a hundred things
that <hi>I</hi> cannot relate as they were
ſaid. In a word (to paſs lightly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Subject which touches me yet
in deſcribing it) <hi>I</hi> juſtified my ſelf
to her as well as <hi>I</hi> cou'd; confeſſed
our rendezvouz, what had obliged
me to it, and the reaſon <hi>I</hi> had to
conceal it from her; ſo that ſhe
was well ſatisfied with me. I ſaw
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59414:32"/>
her as ſweet as ever, and ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
more tenderneſs and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in me than ever, that it made
amends for all the pain we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
that night: We never loved
ſo well, and this little diſcontent
ſerved but to increaſe the flames
which were kindled in us. The hour
was already paſs'd that in civility <hi>I</hi>
ſhould have retired at: <hi>I</hi> had no
mind the Abbeſs ſhould ſend me
word ſo, as ſhe might have done,
but the misfortune was, (the doors
of the Convent being ſhut, except
thoſe of her Apartment) <hi>I</hi> muſt of
neceſſity paſs that way to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
'Tis true, that in the eſtate
wherein <hi>I</hi> was, fortified with the
powerful charms of her Siſter, <hi>I</hi>
made little reflection upon what <hi>I</hi>
ought to fear: <hi>I</hi> examined not the
danger there was, and felt <hi>Egidia</hi>
ſo deep in my heart, that <hi>I</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
glad (at leaſt <hi>I</hi> fancied ſo) of
this occaſion to defie all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of the Abbeſs. <hi>I</hi> took
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59414:33"/>
then, ſince there was no avoiding
it, that way to my Chamber, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through the midſt of hers;
where ſhe was alone and undreſs'd.
She offered at firſt to ſtay me a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with her, but I excuſed my
ſelf upon pretence it was late, and
ſhould incommode her: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me, that ſhe knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
I was perſwaded I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be troubleſom to her, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hour it was. But to avoid the
ceremony I might yet uſe, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to take a Seat by her,
for ſhe had ſomething to ſay to me,
and wou'd be obey'd. If you pleaſe
(anſwered I) I will wait till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
No (replyed ſhe briskly) once
more I will ſay it now to puniſh you
for your want of complaiſance—
'tis leſs to oblige than torment you.
<hi>I</hi> turned this conſtraint into rallery,
and called it a ſweet violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was not in my power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
her, for ſhe had cauſed the
doors to be ſhut by which <hi>I</hi> was to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59414:33"/>
paſs. <hi>I</hi> told her then (not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
rude, nor having a deſire to
break unhandſomly with her) that
the endeavours ſhe uſed to ſtay me
were extremely charming; that
there was never a man in the world,
that would not eſteem it great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
eſpecially at ſuch an hour.
I am of opinion (ſaid ſhe) that it
might paſs for ſuch in moſt mens
thoughts but in yours, and who
expreſſes any goodneſs to you, muſt
expect in return but indifference
and ſlights. <hi>I</hi> believe it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to make you a longer relation
of what the Abbeſs ſaid to me, and
what <hi>I</hi> anſwered her: It ſuffices
that you know in general that <hi>I</hi>
needed only to ſee her, to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in my ſtrongeſt reſolutions:
Once more <hi>I</hi> knew not what weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>I</hi> had when near her, but 'tis
certain ſhe made me quite different
from what <hi>I</hi> was, and <hi>I</hi> remembred
no more the deſign <hi>I</hi> had to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
my ſelf from her. She was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59414:34"/>
this night in a charming undreſs,
that in its negligence had a great
deal of Art. <hi>I</hi> am afraid <hi>I</hi> ſhall paſs
with you that don't know this
charming Abbeſs, for the greateſt
Traitor, and baſeſt of Men: <hi>I</hi> was
near two hours with this fair En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantreſs,
and left her as a Man
that had ſcarce the power to do ſo.
What joy, what triumph was this
for her? <hi>I</hi> was no more the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that deſpiſed her favours, but
a re-conquer'd Lover, who left her
not without regret; but certain it
is, that <hi>I</hi> paſs'd the reſt of the Night
very ſadly, and made my ſelf all the
reproaches imaginable. The charms
of this Abbeſs had ſomething in
them which had not power longer
than <hi>I</hi> ſaw them; for a moment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>I</hi> had loſt ſight of her <hi>I</hi> came to
my ſelf, ſaw my crime, and could
not enough repent of it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt viſit <hi>I</hi> made <hi>Egidia,
I</hi> gave her a faithful account of all
that paſs'd between the Abbeſs and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59414:34"/>
                  <hi>I: I</hi> told her the perfidiouſneſs <hi>I</hi>
had been guilty of, at which ſhe
but laught, ſeeing with how much
freedom <hi>I</hi> confeſs'd it; yet ſhe had
a deſire to be revenged of her Siſter,
which ſhe was after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> have already told you how the
Apartments of theſe two Ladies
were not far from each other, which
made them always together, tho'
they loved not much. <hi>Egidia</hi> knew
how deſirous her Siſter was to have
my Picture which <hi>I</hi> had given her,
but ſhe always kept it lock'd up for
fear of her; the Abbeſs waiting but
an occaſion to ſeize of it: <hi>Egidia</hi>
gave her fair hopes: for one day
leaving her Cabinet open (having
taken the Picture with her) went
to walk in the Garden, and gave
the Abbeſs time enough to ſatisfie
her ſelf if ſhe could have found
what ſhe ſought, and had not ſeen
there what for her repoſe ſhe deſired
not to ſee. The poor Abbeſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not the intended malice of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59414:35"/>
her Siſter: She ſearch'd every
where unprofitably for the Picture,
but believed not wholly to have
loſt her labour, having found ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of my Letters to <hi>Egidia.</hi> She
ſhut her ſelf up in the Cloſet to read
them: There was two or three
wherein <hi>I</hi> ſpoke of her; of which
here is one, whereby you may judge
of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Am deſperate, Madam, when I hear
you ſay that I love you not; and
that, Madam, the Abbeſs hath ſeized
on my heart: Do juſtice to your merit,
and if you know your ſelf well, you will
believe you are not to be put in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
together. If I could have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my heart (as you ſay) I would take
away the half of it from you this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to puniſh your incredulity. Fear
not any thing, poſſeſs this poor heart
in quiet, and leave appearances to your
Siſter, which I cannot refuſe her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paſſing for the moſt ingrateful of
men, as in effect I am. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59414:35"/>
You ſee well this Letter was
none of the moſt obliging for the
Abbeſs, and it is not neceſſary, I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine,
to tell you how much ſhe
was enraged at it: Spite, Jealouſie,
and Shame, to ſee her ſelf ſo uſed
by a man that ſhe had had ſo much
goodneſs for, inſpired her at firſt
with the moſt cruel deſigns that an
injured woman is capable of. She
came furiouſly out of the Cloſet,
after having tore all the Letters in
a thouſand pieces, as ſhe would
have done my heart had it been in
her power; and but for the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Lady that was her friend,
I know not whither her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would have hurried her. This
Lady (who was her confident in all
things, and had much diſcretion)
endeavoured by degrees to make
her come to her ſelf: She told her
that ſhe ought to be careful of her
conduct, and that to make a buſsle
in ſuch an affair would not be to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59414:36"/>
her advantage; that ſhe ought to
conſider the place ſhe was in, and
that this would prove no good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for her Nuns. But what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
could make her diſgeſt ſo
cruel an affront! All that this good
Lady could obtain of her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, that
ſhe ſhould not ſee me all that day
to have more time to conſider what
ſhe had to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egidia</hi> returned at laſt from her
walk, and going into her Cloſet,
found all in diſorder there, and the
Letters in the condition that I told
you: The pleaſure of revenge
(which is the greateſt of life to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
made her taſt, in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
contentments, that one muſt be
a Woman and a Lover to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
She could not be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
communicating to me an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that ſhe rejoyced ſo much in;
but firſt ſhe would prepare me to
receive it, that I might not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at it: And having ſent for me
into her Chamber, ſhe ask'd me
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59414:36"/>
what I would ſay if ſhe had made
a quarrel between me and her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?
I anſwered her, that provided
ſhe was not intereſted therein, I
ſhould not be concerned at it. She
related to me afterwards the effects
of the Abbeſs's jealouſie, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me in what a condition my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were. I diſcovered no trouble
at firſt, but at the bottom of my
heart I approved not the action; and
when I reflected on all that I had
writ to her, I could have wiſhed
that ſhe had made uſe of ſome other
means, and that ſhe had taken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arms for her revenge. I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not but the Abbeſs was in a
ſtrange fury, and that this affair
would draw ſome ill conſequences
in which <hi>Egidia</hi> would be the firſt
ſufferer: I could not forbear expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſome of my fears to her, but
aſſuring her withal, that I would
never cenſure any thing that ſhe
did; but that knowing ſo well as I
did her Siſters temper, I feared all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59414:37"/>
things from her paſſion, and that
it would be through her that ſhe
would revenge her ſelf of me. I ſaid
all this in a very tender manner, but
however <hi>Egidia</hi> took it not ſo, who
looking upon me with ſpiteful
ſmile, I ſee (ſaid ſhe) I have alarm'd
you, and that I have not done you
good ſervice. Go, Monſieur, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe, riſing at the ſame time
to go away) go, and caſt your ſelf
at her feet; ſwear to her that you
adore her, and ask her pardon for
all you have writ to me. I! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(anſwered I in ſtopping her)
to accuſe me of ſo much baſeneſs is
to diſavow my heart. Ah! ſuffer
if you pleaſe, that I tell you, you
know me but ill, and that I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to confeſs to her all the paſſion
I have for you in my heart: You
ſhall ſee it if you will, and exact
from me even greater proofs of my
Love; you may do it, and I give
you all this day to have yet this
pleaſure, but to morrow I muſt leave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59414:37"/>
you, and you ſhall ſee how little I
am in pain for your Siſters favour.
This ſudden reſolution ſurprized
<hi>Egidia</hi> a little, and ſhe was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
that ſhe had driven matters ſo
far: She embraced me tenderly, and
did all ſhe could to make me change
my deſign; but with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I left her without promiſing her
any thing. <hi>I</hi> ſpent the remainder
of that day thinking what to reſolve
upon, and after all <hi>I</hi> concluded it
beſt to depart; but that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
me was, how <hi>I</hi> ſhould take my
leave with the Abbeſs, which was
a duty <hi>I</hi> could not diſpence with.
<hi>I</hi> took the time that <hi>I</hi> knew moſt
company would be with her, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
a thouſand bitter reproaches,
that <hi>I</hi> was confident ſhe durſt not
make me before Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> went then at night to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
and ask'd a Nun <hi>I</hi> met
(who was ſent without doubt for
that purpoſe) if <hi>I</hi> could not have
the honour to ſee the Abbeſs? She
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59414:38"/>
ſaid, No, for ſhe was not very well;
but not taking that for an excuſe,
ſhe whiſper'd me in the ear, that
this Order was expreſly for me, and
ſhe counſell'd me as a friend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
<hi>I</hi> confeſs that this proceeding
ſurprized me not ſo much as it
would have done, if <hi>I</hi> had not been
prepared for an ill reception; 'tis
true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, that <hi>I</hi> reſented this
refuſal with ſome deſpight, and
ſhould not have been conſol'd for it,
but by the means it gave me of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting
my ſelf another way, of
the reſpect <hi>I</hi> owed her: 'Twas, in
fine, by writing that <hi>I</hi> reſolved to
bid her adieu, as you ſhall ſee by
this Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Know not, Madam, if it is in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
that you are ſick, that I could
not ſee you; or whether you are weary
of ſeeing me here. The one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give me equal pain, and for fear
of knowing too much, I inform not my
ſelf of that whereof I am glad to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59414:38"/>
ignorant; and leſt I be more unhappy
than I am, I deſign not to preſs you
further to declare it to me, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
hence to morrow. If you were
viſible I ſhould be glad to take leave of
you in form: Suffer, if you pleaſe, that
I make uſe of the only means that is
left for me to bid you Adieu. I kiſs
your Hands moſt humbly.</p>
               <p>This Letter, as you ſee, was not
very gallant, nor well made; and <hi>I</hi>
muſt ſee her (to ſpeak truth) when
<hi>I</hi> ſaid any thing of tenderneſs. She
received the Letter, but made me
no anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Egidia,</hi> who ſaw I would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave her, and that ſhe muſt be
expos'd to all the tempeſt, pray'd
me that before I went, <hi>I</hi> would, at
leaſt, make ſome ſort of peace with
the Abbeſs, and not give the Nuns
occaſion of diſcourſe by ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
departure. She added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that her Siſter would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
believe that 'twas ſhe had made
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59414:39"/>
me haſten my going away, and that
ſhe'd be glad of this pretence to turn
all her reſentments upon her: For
my part, who feared not death
more than the thoughts of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,
which repreſented to me
all the reproaches ſhe'd make me,
and to which I could make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
I could not tell how to reſolve
to ſee her. <hi>Egidia,</hi> who ſaw my
fear and unwillingneſs, graciouſly
conſented at laſt that I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
without taking my leave of
her any other way than as I had
done; but to abſent my ſelf but for
ſome days, expecting till the Spirit
of the Abbeſs was a little ſweetned,
and that I ſhould return if it were
neceſſary, at the leaſt notice ſhe
ſhould ſend me. I put all things in
readineſs to go away next morning,
to ſee one of my friends in the
Neighbourhood; and as I was juſt
going a Horſeback, a Footboy
brought me a Note, wherein I read
theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59414:39"/>
DAr'ſt thou depart without ſeeing
me, thou moſt baſe and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful'ſt
of all men! But go, for 'twould
be too great a favour to ſuffer thy Sight
after thy Treaſons: Yet take thy choice,
that I may ſee how far thy black In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
will carry thee; and if thou
canſt even forget that thou oweſt me
at leaſt this civility in leaving my
Houſe.</p>
               <p>Never was man ſo aſtoniſhed as
I was, after the reading of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
I ſaw well that whatever it
coſt me I muſt ſee her, and only
ask'd the Boy where his Lady was,
who telling me ſhe was alone in her
Chamber, I went thither; but
'twas as a Criminal that preſented
himſelf before his Judge.</p>
               <p>I found the Abbeſs ſo changed,
and ſo ſad, that ſhe would have
touch'd the heart of a Barbarian. I
know not what I did then, but 'tis
certain I was not my ſelf, and that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59414:40"/>
the confuſion her ſight put me into,
cannot be expreſt. She look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me ſome moments without
ſpeaking to me, afterwards ſaid ſhe
to me, What come you here for?
I thought you had been gone alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<hi>I</hi> did not believe, Madam,
(anſwered I) that I ought to do ſo,
when I might have the honour to
ſee you before I went. I come to
take my leave of you, and at the
ſame time, to beg the favour to
know wherein I have offended you.
Wherein you have offended me!
(ſaid ſhe ſighing) Ah! Traytor, you
know it but too well: Well, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
(ſaid I to her) ſince you'l have
me know it, tell me what I muſt
ſuffer for my crime: If Death, be
aſſured my Life depends upon what
you pleaſe to ordain. Death! (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
ſhe again) alas! you have
but too well deſerved it, and that
is my greateſt trouble. What do
you expect then (replyed I in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
if there wants but a Sword to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59414:40"/>
give it me, take mine. In ſaying
ſo, I preſented it ready drawn to
her, and opened my Breſt for her
to pierce it; but ſhe only turned
her head away, and ſaid with a
louder voice, Cruel! thou know'ſt
ill my heart, if thou believeſt I can
be revenged of thee that way: I
wiſh only that my Life were dear
enough to thee, that I might pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thee by taking away that; but
I ſhould not have the ſatisfaction to
ſee thee breathe one ſigh at my
death. As ſhe ſpoke theſe words,
abundance of Tears covered her
Face, and Sobs took away from her
the uſe of her Speech, inſomuch
that my heart was torn with pity.
I knew not what to ſay, fearing ſhe'd
take any thing I ſaid to her for new
infidelities; but as it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to pacifie a Perſon that loves,
and that would be loved, I behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf ſo well, that by degrees
<hi>I</hi> vanquiſhed her anger, and left
her not till <hi>I</hi> ſaw her in a humor to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59414:41"/>
pardon me all things. That which
obliged her to it the ſooner, was
that ſeeing me reſolved to be gone,
ſhe had a deſire to ſtay me, and ſhe
thought ſhe could not prevail by
treating me rudely. <hi>I</hi> was not yet
ſo indifferent to her, that ſhe could
be willing to part with me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and perhaps ſhe did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
(ſo ordinary is it for them in
love to flatter themſelves) to carry
me at laſt from her Siſter: She did
not know that <hi>I</hi> deſigned to abſent
my ſelf but three or four days, but
believed that <hi>I</hi> intended not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
any more; and <hi>I</hi> made her to
have an obligation to me for it. <hi>I</hi>
prayed her, at leaſt, that ſhe would
ſuffer me to to make a little Journy
thereabouts, to which ſhe conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the more willingly, that none
might take notice, and cenſure my
changing of my reſolution, and how
ſoon ſhe was come to her ſelf. She
was glad to obſerve ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that her weakneſs might
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59414:41"/>
not appear, and that it might be
believed that ſhe recovered by time.
Above all, ſhe exacted of me that
I ſhould not ſpeak to her Siſter of
our reconcilement, and that I ſhould
not ſo much as ſee her at parting;
if I would not make her repent of
her great indulgence to me. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
her I would not, and though
<hi>Egidia</hi> ſent to deſire me to come to
ſpeak with her; I prayed her, by
one of her friends, to diſpence with
me, for reaſons <hi>I</hi> would write to
her, which <hi>I</hi> was ſure would ſatisfie
her. To ſay truth, I owed thus
much, at leaſt, to a Perſon that <hi>I</hi>
had ſo great obligations to, and that
had ſo much reaſon to complain of
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> went away then to one of my
Friends houſes, from whence <hi>I</hi> writ
ſeveral Letters to theſe Ladies,
and received as many from them.
In the laſt <hi>I</hi> received from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
ſhe deſired me to come the
day after the receipt of it, to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59414:42"/>
ſame place where <hi>I</hi> laſt ſaw her; and
very ſecretly, eſpecially not to let
her Siſter know any thing of it:
That ſhe would be there at Nine a
Clock at Night, and expect me till
Eleven. <hi>I</hi> ſaw well enough, by this
Letter, that the Abbeſs was calm'd:
<hi>I</hi> believed I could not handſomly
balk the aſſignation; but by apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of Love, <hi>I</hi> thought fit to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
her Siſter of it, that ſhe might
not complain of me, if ſhe came to
know it, as ſhe did the other aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<hi>I</hi> anſwered the Abbeſs,
that I would not fail to wait on her
at Nine a Clock, and this Letter <hi>I</hi>
ſent to her Siſter.</p>
               <p>IF you were in my place, you would
without doubt do what I am going
to do this day, but I aſſure you, 'tis
with all the regret in the world. I
received a Letter yeſterday from your
Siſter, wherein ſhe deſires me to meet
her at Nine a Clock in the Evening in
the Garden, and forbids me above all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59414:42"/>
things to let you know any thing of it.
I believe it will not diſpleaſe you that
I obey her, and that you would counſel
me to it your ſelf if you were here: Fear
not any thing, my Fidelity is proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all her charms; for I am never
more yours, than when I am with her.
<hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> gave to the Abbeſs's Boy my
anſwer to her, and ſent this by a
Servant of mine to <hi>Egidia,</hi> but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before <hi>I</hi> went away my ſelf, that
it might be dark when he came to
the Abby, to deliver it more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He was there at the hour <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and got into the Parlour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any bodies taking notice of him.
When he was there, he heard ſome
body go, but the Night hindered
him from knowing who it was: He
ask'd at a venture, if they would
do him the favour to call Madam
<hi>N</hi>—You muſt know this was the
Abbeſs, who was walking in the
Parlour, and expecting with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59414:43"/>
impatience, the hour of our
meeting. She knew at firſt my
Mans voice, and ſaid, if he would
have any thing with that Lady,
'twas ſhe. Theſe two Ladies voices
were ſo like, that ſometimes their
moſt familiar friends were deceiv'd.
My Man, that knew not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a miſtake, and believed that
it was ſhe he ask'd for, gave the
Letter without delay into her hands,
and believed he had acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very well of the Commiſſion <hi>I</hi>
had given him. The Abbeſs, after
ſhe had taken the Letter, diſpatcht
my Man, and told him it required
no Anſwer. You may eaſily gueſs
at her impatience, to ſee what <hi>I</hi> had
writ to her Siſter; but it would be
difficult to repreſent her trouble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe had ſatisfied her curioſity.
She was not naturally very wicked,
and if jealouſie had not been in it,
ſhe would, perhaps, have content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſelf with reproaches: But
this paſſion does not uſually reſt in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59414:43"/>
ſuch weak revenge; it always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
its deſigns to extremity, a love
offended is the moſt terrible of all
furies. The Abbeſs went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
into her Siſters Chamber,
where ſhe found her alone: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
after all, my Siſter, (ſaid the
Abbeſs to her, after having ſpoke
indifferently enough of me before)
that we are both deceived in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
thoughts we have for
this Gentleman, who has paid with
Treaſons all that goodneſs we have
ſhow'd him. For my part (added
ſhe) <hi>I</hi> am now ſufficiently diſabus'd,
and it is true that I am partly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to you for it, and that without
ſeeing the Letters in your Cabinet,
I ſhould have been yet in a ſtrange
error. If you pleaſe, I'll, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
do you the ſame ſervice:
But, my poor Siſter, you are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt
to his advantage, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
one ſhall ſay to you, you will
not believe that any thing is ſo true,
as what he has told you. What
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59414:44"/>
do you mean (anſwered <hi>Egidia</hi>
coldly) I ſee not any thing that
Monſieur does, that I can blame
him for, nor but what diſcovers
he has much reſpect for me; and
till I have cauſe for the contrary,
I am reaſonable enough not to
change the Sentiments I have for
him. But if one makes you ſee (ſaid
the Abbeſs) that you deceive your
ſelf in thoſe Sentiments, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays
you, and is the baſeſt of all
men, What would you then ſay?
Perhaps (replyed <hi>Egidia)</hi> I ſhould
not be ſo acknowledging, as ſuch
a Service might merit: For, not
to lye, though commonly one takes
no pleaſure in being deceived, yet
in this I muſt confeſs my weakneſs,
that I love to be in an error; an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is not ſo till one knows it. How
you are to be pitied, (replyed the
Abbeſs again) and yet you deſerve
not to be diſabus'd; but you are my
Siſter, and againſt your will I muſt
pity you. Know then, that this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59414:44"/>
honeſt Man, this faithful Friend,
and what elſe you are pleaſed to call
him, begg'd of me by a Note ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday,
to have an interview with
him in the Garden this Evening;
and conjured me, as much as he
cou'd, that it might be ſecret, and
eſpecially that you knew nothing
of it. If you will not believe me,
(continued ſhe, ſeeing ſhe was
troubled, and had changed colour
'twice or thrice) you may but come
along with me to believe your own
eyes. Whatever conſtancy of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
this amiable Lady had, ſhe was
ſhaken by this diſcourſe: The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
was manifeſt, and ſhe could
not doubt of it, when her Rival aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
her ſo poſitively of the thing,
and offered to bring her to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz,
to be witneſs of it her ſelf.
She agreed to the propoſal, gave
her Arms to poniard her ſelf, and
would not defer a moment to ſee
her death, ſince the hour of it was
come.

CONTINUATION
Of this
HISTORY:</head>
               <head type="sub">Told by a Lady of Company.</head>
               <p>I Cannot tell whether Monſieur
<hi>Le Chevalier</hi>'s account be all
true, becauſe he was acquainted
with theſe Ladies a year before I
came to the Convent; but this I
can ſay, that it bears good report
with what I have heard: But I will
warrant what I am going to tell
you, for a very faithful relation of
all that paſſed in my time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59414:46"/>
I was very well received in this
Abby, which ſome croſs affairs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
me to make uſe of for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat:
'Twas near a Month when I
came there, ſince Monſieur <hi>Le Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
had been abſent. I heard him
ſpoke of ſometimes as a very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
man, for whom the Abbeſs had
a great eſteem, and from whom ſhe
received Letters often: I perceived
quickly that this eſteem had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it very tender, and that
there was ſomething in this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
above what we ordinarily ſee
in that paſſion. The Abbeſs, who
had much goodneſs and confidence
in me, ſaid to me a thouſand advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
things of him: She put him
above all men, and ſhe could have
wiſh'd that I had not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him to her, but that I
judg'd it reaſonable in her. As long
as things ſeemed not to me to go
far, I appeared very complaiſant;
but when I came to know that
theſe importments were more of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59414:47"/>
Love than Friendſhip, that it exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
jealouſie between the two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that it cauſed Tears, Sighs,
and Langueors, I could not forbear
ſpeaking my thoughts of it freely
to the Abbeſs, and to repreſent to
her, that an ingagement of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would do her an injury one
day, and that an amorous affair
ought not to enter into a Religious
Houſe. She, in appearance, took
pleaſure in my freedom, but indeed
it begot in her coldneſs to me: She
would have been glad of a little
more complaiſance in my friendſhip,
and her pain being without remedy,
could have wiſh'd I would have
help'd her to ſupport it. This was
the cauſe that I had leſs converſe
with her, and ſeldom ſaw her but
as my duty, that I might not break
altogether with a Perſon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
where I was, and to whom
I had many obligations. Her Siſter
manag'd her ſelf a little better, and
though ſhe had not leſs eſteem and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59414:47"/>
tenderneſs for Monſieur, ſhe acted
nevertheleſs, before the world as
if ſhe were indifferent; for ſhe had
much more wit than her Siſter,
though not ſo much beauty.</p>
               <p>I will begin my recital, if the
company pleaſe, where Monſieur
left yeſterday; all that he has yet
ſaid, being nothing in compariſon
of what I have to tell you.</p>
               <p>Into what anger and tranſports
fell the fair Abbeſs, when ſhe ſaw
the Treaſon of her Lover: The leaſt
thing her paſſion ſuggeſted to her,
was to be revenged of the Traytor,
and to make him be kill'd.</p>
               <p>A Maid that ſhe moſt confided in,
and who was too young to take the
liberty of adviſing her, came every
night before ſhe went to Bed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to me part of theſe follies,
with which, in truth, I could but
divert my ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Abbeſs took then (as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
has told you) her Siſter with
her to this aſſignation, where he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59414:48"/>
failed not to be at the hour appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
His ſurpriſe was great, as you
will imagine, to ſee the two Siſters
together, after what the Abbeſs
had writ to him, that none ſhould
know of this enterview, eſpecially
her Siſter: He remembred more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
what he had writ to her, and
the requeſt he made her in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that ſhe ſhould not be troubled
at this aſſignation. He knew not,
in fine, what to believe, and of a
thouſand thoughts which paſſed
through his Mind, none came near
the right, ſo little likelihood there
was that ſuch a thing ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
In the midſt of thoſe cruel
pains that Spite and Jealouſie made
the Abbeſs ſuffer, ſhe taſted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
joy to ſee the trouble that
Monſieur was in; but her Siſter had
nothing to allay her grief, and uſed
the greateſt violence to her ſelf i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable,
to forbear reproaching
him. She had not patience to ſtay
long there, but went from them,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59414:48"/>
after ſhe had view'd him from head
to foot, with an air of Scorn and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
without ſaying a word
to him. This poor Lover, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to recover of his firſt ſurprize,
when he ſaw how ſhe look'd upon,
and avoided him, fell into a ſecond
much more cruel. I know not (ſaid
he, ſpeaking to the Abbeſs) what
I have done to your Siſter, that my
preſence drives her hence. It is (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Abbeſs coldly) becauſe
your return here was not expected
ſo ſoon, where you have but little
buſineſs. Ah! if it be as you ſay,
Madam, (replyed Monſieur) I ſwear
to you <hi>I</hi> will not continue here long,
for I hate above all things to be
troubleſom to people: But yet, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(added he, ſuddenly) you muſt
not take it ill, if I go and know of
your Siſter, if this be the reaſon that
ſhe treats me thus; after that I ſhall
ſtay no longer with you, than is
neceſſary to bid you adieu. In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, he run after the fair afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59414:49"/>
whom he overtook juſt as ſhe
was going into the Convent. What's
the matter with you, Madam, (ſaid
he to her, almoſt out of breath)
that you fly from me? And why
did I find you in a place where I
ought not to ſee you? Say rather,
thou moſt perfidious, (anſwered
ſhe) that I ought not to ſee thee
there: But at laſt thy Treaſons are
diſcovered, and thou ſhalt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me any longer, for <hi>I</hi> will not
ſee thee again all my life. After
theſe words, ſhe went into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
ſhut the door upon her, and
left Monſieur in the moſt deplorable
condition that a man could be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to: He can tell you that he was
a hundred times going to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and that he would have made
a thouſand reproaches to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
if ſhe could have heard
them. His Conſcience accus'd him
not of any infidelity, he believed he
had not done any thing contrary to
his duty in this Aſſignation, ſince he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59414:49"/>
had given her notice of it, and he
knew well that in relation to this
fair one, he deſerved not the name
of perfidious. So ſevere a treatment
made him reſolve to depart without
expecting any longer, hoping time
would convince his Miſtreſs of the
wrong ſhe had done him; or that
deſpight and abſence would cure
him of his Love. The Abbeſs, who
had followed him, and was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
the miſtake ſhould be clear'd,
arriv'd as he was in this reſolution:
He accoſted her of a faſhion as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
teſtified his deſpair; and
ſcarce looking on her, What you
told me, Madam, (ſaid he to her)
was more than ever <hi>I</hi> could have
thought, and <hi>I</hi> am treated here
with ſo ſtrange an air, that <hi>I</hi> am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd:
There's no other way to
take, than not to ſtay a moment
longer in a place where my preſence
is ſo odious. Behold! (anſwered
the Abbeſs) how Traytors ought to
be recompenc'd for their Treachery?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59414:50"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> have not time, Madam, (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Monſieur) to ask you what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
you have to give me that name.
<hi>I</hi> muſt depart this inſtant to deliver
you from a Man, that is more than
troubleſom to you: 'Tis enough, if
you'l be pleaſed to remember, that
'twas you that cauſed my coming
here at this time: <hi>I</hi> am come, as <hi>I</hi>
promiſed you, and you, perhaps,
brought your Siſter, that you ſo
ſtrictly charged me ſhould know
nothing of it. Yes, Traytor, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, tranſported by her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
and it was in that, that thy
baſe heart has failed thee. Speak!
Tell me, baſe!—If thou haſt not
writ to her, what thou wert deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to conceal. Monſieur was ſo
ſtrangely ſurprized here, that he
remained immovable; and believ'd
effectually that <hi>Egidia</hi> (to continue
the Name which he gave her in his
relation) had made her privy to the
Letter he had writ her. So ſoon
as he was recover'd a little from the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59414:50"/>
diſorder he was in, <hi>I</hi> know not
well, Madam, (ſaid he to her)
what you mean; but if all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
reproaches are but to drive
me from hence, <hi>I</hi> aſſure you that
you give your ſelf this trouble
without need, and leſs would ſerve
to make me reſolve never to ſee you
more. <hi>I</hi> am juſt going from this
Country (continued he, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way)
and bid you, Madam, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
adieu. The Abbeſs ſtayed
him, and told him a little more
calmly, that whatſoever reaſon
there was to treat him yet worſe,
it was not fit he ſhould go away at
ſuch a time of Night. Whether
there be reaſon or no, (replyed
Monſieur briskly) <hi>I</hi> am ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to be thus receiv'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>I</hi> go, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſupport very
impatiently thoſe moments that <hi>I</hi>
am confin'd here. I beg of you,
Madam, (purſued he, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to diſengage himſelf from her)
not to ſtrive, out of a formal piece
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59414:51"/>
of ceremony, for that which would
be troubleſom both to your ſelf and
me. But <hi>I</hi> will not have you go to
night (ſaid the Abbeſs to him) and
if it be true, that <hi>I</hi> have yet power
enough leſt to oblige you to do any
thing for me, you ſhall make me
know it in this: <hi>I</hi> have buſineſs
with you, and 'twill be time enough
to morrow for you to go. Monſieur
prayed her if ſhe had any thing to
ſay to him, not to delay it; and
that in another occaſion he would
be ready to teſtifie the reſpect he
had for her, but that he could not
ſtay now. We ſhall ſee that, ſaid
ſhe, and leaving him, ſhe haſten'd
to the Abby, to give order that his
Horſes ſhould be ſtopp'd; but thoſe
that had it in commiſſion, came a
little too late, for he was juſt going,
and ſeeing the endeavours that
were uſed to hinder him, and that
he wanted time to pack up his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
he choſe rather to leave his
Servant behind him, and went to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59414:51"/>
lodge that Night a League from the
Abby, where he bid him come to
him the next morning.</p>
               <p>The Abbeſs that but a moment
before would not only have been
glad never to ſee him, but to have
revenged her ſelf upon him with
deſtruction, had not now the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to bring her ſelf to conſent to his
departure: How weak is anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an object that is uſed to
charm us? and how ill can a heart
revenge it ſelf of what it loves?
when the Lover ſuffers moſt, in the
ſufferings of the beloved.</p>
               <p>The Abbeſs heard of Monſieurs
departure with a ſenſible diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and gave ſevere words to them
ſhe had ſent to ſtop him for letting
him go. When they told her that
his Servant was not gone, ſhe bid
him be call'd to her, whom by
ſtrength of Preſents, ſhe drew to
tell where his Maſter was: She was
eas'd of half her pain, when ſhe
knew that he lay but a league from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59414:52"/>
her. Her paſſion, which at that
time would have made her attempt
any thing, put into her head a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
which was not pardonable in
one of her habit, except we will
pardon all things to love. This lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
God uſes not to inſpire us ſo
weakly, as to leave it in our power
to conſult reaſon or juſtice; and
there is not any that they baulk,
who are poſſeſſed with him. The
Maid that I have already ſpoke to
you of, that was her particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
came into her Chamber,
and ſeeing her in a profound ſtudy,
believed ſhe had committed a fault,
and went to excuſe her ſelf for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
her. No, no, my dear
Companion, (ſaid the Abbeſs to
her, for ſo 'twas ſhe called her) you
come more luckily than you think,
and I have need of you; and I may
ſay that 'tis from you alone I can
hope aſſiſtance in the pains that I
ſuffer. The Maid anſwered with
much acknowledgment to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59414:52"/>
that the Abbeſs did her, to
conſider her at that rate; and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her with a thouſand proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her fidelity, and that there
was not any thing that ſhe would
not undertake to ſerve her. The
Abbeſs embrac'd her moſt tenderly,
ſigh'd, wept, and touch'd ſo nearly
the heart of her dear Confident,
that ſhe was impatient to know
what ſhe was to do for her; and
with tears in her eyes, beſeech'd
her to tell her, for what it was that
ſhe was afflicted. You are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of any thing that paſſes in
my heart, (ſaid the ſad Lady to her
with an Air extremely deplorable)
nor with what ingratitude Monſieur
<hi>Le Chevalier</hi> has of late repayed the
tenderneſs that I had for him. This
Traytor, after all my kindneſſes,
has been ſo baſe to go away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my conſent, and even without
bidding me Adieu. You ought to
ſee, Madam, in that (reply'd the
Maid diſcreetly) how unworthy he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59414:53"/>
is of your favours, and that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
not any longer your eſteem. I
am reſolved to do as you ſay (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Abbeſs) and am ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
diſpos'd to it; but the pain
that I ſuffer at preſent, and that I
cannot conquer, is but to have the
pleaſure to eaſe my full heart with
reproaching him with his Treaſons,
and that he go not away, perhaps,
in the opinion that I am not yet
perſwaded of his perfidiouſneſs. I
would have the ſatisfaction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him bluſh for his laſt fault,
which I have not yet acquainted
thee with. If thou loveſt me (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe with her ſhaming air) thou
wilt find ſome way whereby I may
ſatisfie this deſire; and, in fine,
break off intirely with the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
of all men: Without that,
my Child, <hi>I</hi> cannot promiſe thee to
live long in the diſpleaſure and rage
I am in, and thou art like to loſe
ſuddenly the beſt of thy Friends
his Maid, who in intrigues of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59414:53"/>
Love, was not the moſt skilful in
the world, and ſaw not yet into the
depth of the Abbeſs's deſign; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to her to write a Letter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to this Traytor; but this
ſatisfaction was too weak for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
Lover: One can never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
ones ſelf well by writing (ſaid
ſhe) upon a Subject of this nature:
To puniſh as we ought, one that is
ſo culpable, the Perſon offended
muſt, with her own mouth, make
all the reproaches he merits, that
ſhe may have the advantage of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his confuſion. Ha! (ſaid the
Maid) Well then, Madam, What
will you do? Stay to expect his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?
The innocence of this Maid
almoſt made the Abbeſs laugh. Can
we (replyed ſhe) keep anger ſo long
againſt one that has once pleas'd
us? No, no, if thou wilt believe
me (purſued ſhe, with a bluſh that
covered all her face) we will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our revenge ſo long a time: I
have courage enough to execute
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59414:54"/>
the deſign, if thou haſt enough to
follow me: We will go find out
this Traytor that is but a League
off, and thou ſhalt be witneſs with
what ſcorn I will manage the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and if it be poſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
a man with reproaches,
Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier</hi> ſhall be he.
So hardy a propoſal at firſt ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſurpriz'd this Maid: She that
could ſcarce go in the Night thro'
the Monaſtery without ſtarts and
fears, could not but think it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and terrible, to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alone to thoſe troubleſom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
they might meet with in
the road: But the Abbeſs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the enterprize ſo eaſie, and
ſo unlikely of any troubleſom ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
in that little way they had
to go, and ſo fair a Night, that at
laſt ſhe perſwaded her, and made
her love the novelty of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Abbeſs, extremely ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
to have gained her dear
companion, thought now only
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59414:54"/>
where to get Horſes. She would
not make uſe of her own, that her
going might be the more ſecret,
but choſe rather to have recourſe to
her Farmer, that lived about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
paces off her; to whom ſhe
preſently diſpatch'd her Valet, that
had always been very faithful to
her, and that ſhe reſolved ſhould
wait upon her in this Journy. Her
order was to tell the Farmer, that
ſhe had need of three Horſes, and
that he ſhould not fail to ſend them
her that Night. Her Valet depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame moment, whilſt the
Ladies went to prepare themſelves
to get a Horſeback. The firſt thing
the Abbeſs did, was to give out that
ſhe was not very well, and would
go to Bed; giving leave to all thoſe
that waited on her to do the like,
and kept only her dear companion
with her, as ſhe often uſed to do.
So ſoon as they were alone, they
began to undreſs themſelves, and
to change their holy habits for thoſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59414:55"/>

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59414:56"/>
of the Country, of which the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
had very handſom ones: She
adorn'd her ſelf with as much care,
as if ſhe had been going to ſome
publick Aſſembly: She was the laſt
dreſs'd, but there could not be any
thing more fine and gallant than
ſhe: Her Apartment was not far
from the Garden, and they could
go to it without noiſe, or being
ſeen of any, as they did; and took
with all ſpeed a way to the back
door, where the Valet was to be
with their Horſes. One would
have ſaid that had ſeen them, that
they had been two Amazons, that
went to aſſault ſome place, they
did ſo encourage one another.
When they were come to the door,
and the Abbeſs, who had the Key,
had open'd it, finding no body
there, they began to be ſoon impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of the Valet's ſtay; but, at
laſt, they heard a noiſe of Horſes,
which gave them ſome hopes; but
we are often deceived in thoſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59414:56"/>
things which we deſire moſt: As
the noiſe increaſed, they began to
fear they were in an error, for the
Valet that they expected was not
to come that way; but the Abbeſs,
who had a little more reſolution
than her follow-adventurer, that
even trembled with fear, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to re aſſure her, telling her
that without doubt it was he, but
that he had taken a compaſs not to
meet any body by the way, and
that this was the occaſion of his
ſtaying ſo long; bidding her go two
or three ſteps, to ſee if ſhe were not
in the right: This poor Maid, that
every thing terrified had not the
courage to do as the Abbeſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her; and beſeech'd her moſt
humbly, not to put her valour to
this tryal; and that ſhe could not
leave her a ſtep without dying, for
the ſhake of every leaf put her into
a mortal fright. The Abbeſs could
not forbear laughing at her cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice,
and bid her not to fear any
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59414:57"/>
thing, for ſhe would go along with
her. Our two valorous Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
with prodigious courage, went
ſome paces to meet thoſe that came;
but they had no ſooner diſcovered
that they were two men that rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace
towards them, but they run
away without ſo much as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
to ſhut the Garden door after
them, never ſtopping till they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at laſt near the Monaſtery, but
ſo out of breath, that they could
ſcarcely ſpeak: Their courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
a little when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at home, and panting with
their hands on their ſides, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to laugh at their ill grounded
fear of two Men that ſought only
their way. After a little reaſoning
upon the caſe, they took heart and
returned the ſecond time to the
door, where they found two Horſes
tyed to a Tree, without any body
by them. The Abbeſs, when ſhe
had look'd well on both ſides her,
without diſcovering any body, was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59414:57"/>
in ſome pain to divine, why theſe
Horſes ſhould be here without her
Valet; but ſhe believed that he was
not gone far, and that they muſt
wait for him, concluding (as it is
eaſie to make any concluſion to our
own advantage) that theſe muſt of
neceſſity be her Farmers Horſes;
and this was not wholly unlikely,
for who elſe could be imagined to
leave two Horſes ſo: But the Valet
came not, and the Abbeſs dyed with
impatience at it; time preſſed her
ſo much, that ſhe was afraid there
was not Night enough left to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
her deſign. This was a great
torment to her: She would have
ſworn a thouſand times (but that
Abbeſſes uſe not to ſwear) that theſe
were her Farmers Horſes, that ſhe
knew them, and that certainly her
Valet was hindred with getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Horſe. 'Tis true, this might
be, but 'twas poſſible alſo theſe
might be the Horſes of the two men
they ſaw; but on that point ſhe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59414:58"/>
would not reaſon, for ordinarily we
love not to be convinced of what
we do not deſire; and we often
chuſe to be deceived with a falſe
ſhew of reaſon, rather than to be
certain of a truth that does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with us.</p>
               <p>Our moſt amorous and impatient
Abbeſs, ſeeing her Valet did not
come, told her faithful Companion,
that they could not ſtay any longer
for him, and that he was not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to them, but that they might
go without him, and he might come
after if he would. She conſented
to all that ſhe pleaſed, and our two
Adventurers mounted without an
Eſquire, and in leſs than an hour
arrived, without any wicked ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
at Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier</hi>'s
Inn. The Abbeſs knock'd at the
door, and inquired for a Gentleman
that lodged there: They told her
that indeed ſuch a one came there
that night, but that he went away
again about an hour after, with a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59414:58"/>
Valet that brought him a Letter.
She queſtion'd again the Maſter of
the Houſe what way they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
what Livery the Valet was in,
if the Gentleman was to return
quickly, if he had eat, till in fine,
ſhe came to queſtion him, if he had
appeared ſad or joyful. But the
Hoſt knew not what to ſay to her,
all that he knew was, that he was
not likely to return that Night, and
that he had not left any Orders
with them. Never any one was
ſo afflicted as the poor Abbeſs then
was: A thouſand thoughts oppreſt
her at once, of which there was
not one that overwhelm'd her not
with trouble: What numbers of
inquietudes, what cruel ſuſpicions,
well or ill grounded, what rage,
what deſpair, to have promis'd her
ſelf ſo much ſatisfaction in coming,
after all the charming Chimera's
that ſhe had fram'd in her Mind, to
return more deſolate than ever?
Her companion, who ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59414:59"/>
to ſee her ſo ſtrangely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
would have been glad ſhe
could have comforted her. Why
do you torment your ſelf, Madam,
(ſaid ſhe to her) 'tis true, we have
loſt our labour, but who knows
whether that is not better for us,
than if we had ſucceeded in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and have found Monſieur <hi>Le
Chevalier:</hi> You know him, Madam,
and that he is not the diſcreeteſt
Perſon in the world; perhaps this
viſit might have been talk'd of, we
are at leaſt aſſured, that we have
taken a Frolick that none knows of.
That none knows of, (replied this
diſtracted Lover?) alas! ſeeſt thou
not that my Siſter knew our deſign,
and that 'twas ſhe without doubt
that ſent this Valet, to advertize
him of what we intended, and to
oblige him to avoid me? But how
is it poſſible (anſwered her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
that this ſhould be as you ſay?
If Monſieur has been ſo long gone
from this place as the Hoſt tells us,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59414:59"/>
you had then ſcarce framed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of coming hither. But what
cauſe (replyed the Abbeſs) wilt
thou then find for his ſudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
In fine, whatever her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
ſaid to her, and whatever
arguments her wit could frame to
perſwade her, ſhe always ended
with ſaying her Siſter had done the
buſineſs, and that nothing could
have oblig'd him to leave his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at that hour, but ſhe. This
thought furiouſly tormented her,
her jealouſie was augmented by it,
and ſhe was aſſaulted with ſo many
pains at once, that ſhe ſaw on all
ſides her nothing but deſpair. How
far different was it with her now,
to what it was ſome moments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
when ſhe was fill'd with the
joyful expectation of ſeeing her dear
<hi>Chevalier?</hi> Whatever her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſaid to her, to divert her mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
ſhe anſwered her only with
ſighs.</p>
               <p>Being at length got home again,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59414:60"/>
they were a little troubled how to
diſpoſe of their Horſes; but at laſt,
they judg'd it the ſafeſt and eaſieſt
way to draw them into the Garden,
and tye them to a Tree till it was
day, that they might ſend them
back to the Farmer: After that,
they had no more to do, than to
go ſtrait to the Convent; but they
were ſcarce come to the middle of
the Garden, when they fancied that
they heard people talk: The Maid,
who was three or four paces before
the Abbeſs, and had not her Spirit
ſo pre-occupyed, was the firſt that
perceived it, and turning to her all
of a ſudden, extremely ſurprized,
told her that, aſſuredly, there was
ſome body in the Garden. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs
hearkned very attentively, and
found that ſhe was not deceived:
'Twas now that all her pains were
ſuſpended, and that ſhe labour'd not
under any but curioſity. Whatever
cauſe we have of trouble, if we
meet with any thing that ſurprizes,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59414:60"/>
it diverts our pains for the time,
and they are, as it were, aſleep in
us. All her ſuſpicion awak'd at
this noiſe, ſhe knew that only ſhe
and her Siſter had a Key from the
Convent to the Garden; and this
reaſon alone was ſufficient to make
her believe, that 'twas certainly
ſhe and Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier,</hi> that
entertained an amorous converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
at leaſt, ſhe was reſolved to
be ſatisfied. Jealouſie ſerves inſtead
of courage to women, and Love
makes them hazard every thing.
This Lady, that perhaps upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occaſion, would have been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with leſs cauſe, now feared
not to go forward, to diſcover if
her Suſpicions were true or no, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Maid (who trembled with
fear) to follow her ſoftly. They
went ſo lightly as they could, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the covert of a Hedg, (for the
Night was very clear, and they
might be ſeen at a diſtance) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a thick Arbor from whence

they heard the voice. The Abbeſs
ſoon knew Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier</hi>'s,
but could not underſtand diſtinctly
what he ſaid; therefore advancing
a little forward, ſhe heard her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ſpeak: But do not you conſider,
(ſaid ſhe) to what you expoſe me?
and how you hazard your ſelf? for
without ſpeaking of what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to ſo many, other unhappy
Maids that have abandon'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Faith of Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there have been but too many
deceiv'd; but granting you to have
more honeſty and honour than all

my flight will occaſion; the
furious ſearch my Parents will make
for us, and into what ſtrange mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
I ſhould caſt you, if you ſhould
fall into their hands: My God!
(continued ſhe) once again attempt
not any thing ſo dangerous! Leave
me rather to dye here with grief,
than precipitate our ſelves to ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
an enterprize. You will
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59414:62"/>
have me then (anſwered the other,
that the Abbeſs knew at firſt to be
Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier)</hi> to expoſe
you to all the ills that Jealouſie can
contrive againſt you; to all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and injuries that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from your furious Siſter, and
a hundred other things that makes
me tremble for you: You know
that I have no longer the liberty to

me; and that I cannot for ſhame
preſent my ſelf here any more, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ill treatment that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and it is to ſay that you
will have me dye. If you love me,
Madam,—If I love you (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
ſhe) you know it but too
well: If you would not have me
doubt of it, (purſued Monſieur <hi>Le
Chevalier)</hi> and that my Love and
Aſſiduity have merited that you
ſhould do every thing for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
you have told me ſeveral times,
give me this demonſtrative proof
of it: Let us render our ſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59414:63"/>
my charming Queen, ſince 'tis
in our power; our flight is eaſie,
your Valet and mine are at the
Garden door, who attends us with
Horſes; all things favour us, and
I promiſe you in three hours to put
you in a place, where not only none
ſhall know where we are, but where
there would not be any thing to be
fear'd if they ſhould. Monſieur was
then ſilent, to ſee what anſwer his
dear <hi>Egidia</hi> would make him. Get
you gone, Monſieur, (ſaid ſhe, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
for I'm afraid if you preſs me
longer, that you'l obtain of me
more than I ought to grant: I beg
of you to go, before my weakneſs
miſleads me from my duty. Do you
your ſelf, if you are more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than I, as you ought to be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
my heart againſt your ſelf,
have pity on my ſinking virtue, and
reſt content with the glory that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but your ſelf is able to reſiſt
you; for I confeſs that I am not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that I have the power of my
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59414:63"/>
ſelf to withſtand you and Love.
Adieu, leave me. After theſe words
they heard her weep, and Monſieur,
Let your ſelf be overcome (ſaid he)
My Dear Soul! Let your ſelf be
perſwaded by a Love ſo tender and
ſo paſſionate: Give up your ſelf to
my care and my fidelity, that is too
well known to you to doubt of it.
There was not any thing he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſay that might gain her,
which tore the heart of the Abbeſs,
as it tender'd hers. It is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to repreſent the different paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe two Ladies: The Love,
the Languors, and tender Sighs of
the youngeſt, no more than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight,
Shame, and Rage of the
eldeſt: Who yet had the patience
to hearken to the end of a diſcourſe,
as cruel for her as it was charming
for her Siſter. She ſaw her wholly
diſpos'd to do as Monſieur <hi>Le Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
would have her, and going
to prepare her ſelf to go away with
him, for ſhe was to fit her ſelf
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59414:64"/>
with a habit more ſuitable the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Country, than that
ſhe wore; and went to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to change it. The Abbeſs let
her paſs, and ſtirr'd not from the
place where ſhe was of ſome time
after, that (her thoughts labouring
of a deſign) ſhe took a conſiderable
compaſs, to come, with her Mask
on her Face, into the Arbor where
Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier</hi> was; who
(as ſhe would have it) taking her
for her Siſter, embraced her with
all tenderneſs. How charming are
you, Madam, (ſaid the tranſported
Lover) to make me attend ſo little
in this extreme impatience I had to
ſee you return! Come, let us go,
ſince nothing oppoſes our deſign,
and ſerve our ſelves of Fortune,
now ſhe is for us. After theſe
words, he led the way, becauſe
they went in a path that but one
could walk in. It is eaſie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the little pleaſure, or rather
the deſpair, wherewith the Abbeſs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59414:64"/>
receiv'd ſo much ſweetneſs that
was not deſign'd for her; and what
violence ſhe uſed to reſtrain her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
this being not a time to let it
appear, nor make her ſelf known.
You ought not to wonder at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs
miſtake, conſidering 'twas
Night, and that there was little
difference in the ſtature of theſe
two Ladies, beſides a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which help'd to deceive
him.</p>
               <p>As this was not a proper place
to entertain her in, he ſaid but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to her, and thought only of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
her and himſelf where he
had deſign'd; and to what he did
ſay ſhe anſwer'd him not a word,
whereof he took no notice, having
his mind ſo full of his enterprize.
They went in this manner quite to
the Garden door, where Monſieur
was not a little ſurpriz'd to find it
ſhut; but ſhe quickly eas'd him of
his pain, and took the key that ſhe
had about her and opened it. By
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59414:65"/>
what means, or rather by what
happineſs, (ſaid he then to her,
knowing that none but the Abbeſs
kept that Key) came you by this
Key? She anſwer'd him no more
than before, at which he ſtayed not
but haſtned to get a Horſeback;
but his Horſes were not there, and
his Valet, who had been looking
them, told him, with a very ſad
tone, that he did not know what
was become of them, and that he
had been more than two hours in
purſuit of them to no purpoſe; that
he was come to tell him of it, and
going again to ſeek them, for he
knew they could not be loſt, and
that no body went that way. I cou'd
never learn the Abbeſs's deſign,
whether what ſhe did was only
ſubtilly to prevent this enterprize,
or whether ſhe would in earneſt
have taken the place of her Siſter;
but this I can tell you, that as ſoon
as ſhe heard what the Valet ſaid of
the Horſes, ſhe return'd into the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59414:65"/>
Garden, and ſhut the door upon her.
Never was man more ſurpriz'd than
this Lover, ſcarce could he believe
what he ſaw, that his Miſtreſs
ſhould leave him in ſuch a manner,
and what was more ſtrange to him,
the ſhutting the door after her. I
believe that none but himſelf can
deſcribe his thoughts in ſo cruel an
adventure. He knock'd five or ſix
times at the door! call'd his Miſtreſs!
complained of Love and Deſtiny!
Curſt! Swore! threatned to kill his
Valet! and, in ſhort, there was no
extravagancy that his rage made
him not to commit. In the mean
time, the Abbeſs return'd towards
her companion full of joy, for what
ſhe had done, and to hear her tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<hi>Le Chevalier</hi> in that paſſion.
She was not yet come to the Arbor,
that I ſpoke of, when ſhe heard the
noiſe of one coming that way, and
who, in all likelihood, muſt be her
Siſter, whom with a ſlow pace, ſhe
went to meet. This poor Lady,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59414:66"/>
that had not all the courage in the
world, and who, beſides the fear
ſhe was in, and that attends all ſuch
actions, walk'd muſing upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
obſtacles and accidents that
ſhe might meet with in the way.
She no ſooner caſt her eyes upon
the Abbeſs, than ſhe believed ſhe
was a Spirit, and trembling with
fear, ſhe made a dreadful out-cry;
and flew with all her might back to
the Convent. The Abbeſs acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her ſelf very agreeably of theſe
adventures, and believed ſhe was
in part revenged of the diſpleaſures
her Siſter had cauſed her; whom
ſhe let flee, and that while return'd
to ſeek her companion, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
her with extreme impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
being furiouſly terrified to be
alone in the midſt of the Garden,
expoſed to all the noiſes ſhe heard,
and even aſſaſſinated with fear:
She related to her all that ſhe had
done ſince ſhe left her, how ſhe
had deceiv'd Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59414:66"/>
and terrified her Siſter; wherewith
they were very merry, and laugh'd
heartily. They ſtayed a little, to
ſee if ſhe would return, but 'twas
in vain; for ſhe, poor Lady, was ſo
diſmay'd, that ſhe almoſt dyed with
the fright; and was forc'd by it, to
keep her Bed a long time. The
Abbeſs and her companion retir'd
at laſt, and took care that none
ſhould go out of the Convent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
double lock'd the door of it.</p>
               <p>This is (ſaid Madam <hi>d' Eyrac,</hi> in
concluding her Story) all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that I know of theſe Ladies
adventures with Monſieur <hi>Le Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier.</hi>
He can tell you now what
I have not been inform'd of: I will
only add, that 'twas no ſooner day,
than the Abbeſs ſent for her Valet,
and ask'd him what was become of
him the Night paſt, and why he
had not been at the door ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him? The Fellow told her,
that he had been with the Farmer,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59414:67"/>
and his Horſes were not at home,
and that at his return he ſaw two
Gentlemen going into the Garden,
whom he durſt not come near, for
fear of being known; and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
half an hour after, he found
the door ſhut. The relation of this
fellow finiſh'd the diſcovery, and
the Abbeſs queſtion'd no longer,
but they were Monſieur <hi>Le Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
Horſes that ſhe had made uſe
of. She gave order to her Valet,
to turn them out of the Garden, but
ſo as they might be found.</p>
               <p>'Tis from you (added Madam
<hi>d' Eyrac,</hi> turning to Monſieur <hi>Le
Chevalier)</hi> that we muſt expect the
reſt: All the company made him
the ſame requeſt, ſo that he could
not deny them. Madam <hi>d' Eyrac</hi>
(purſued he) has told you ſo much,
that I have no more to do than to
cloſe up the Story. You muſt know
then, that after my ill treatment in
the Garden by <hi>Egidia</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs,
by whoſe appointment I came
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59414:67"/>
there, I prepared all things for my
departure, but firſt I writ this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Egidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Know not, Madam, what I have
done to be ſo cruelly treated as I
have been. The Abbeſs deſired to have
in interview with me, and though ſhe
had expreſly commanded me to conceal
it from you, I forbore not to give you
an account of it by a Letter, which I
ſent by my Valet. Is this to betray
you? I ſee well you deſign my death!
Ah! Well, Madam, you ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
but ſhall not have the pleaſure
to ſee it, for I ſtay not here a moment;
but you ſhall quickly hear the ſucceſs of
your unjuſt proceedings, and if the
death of the faithful'ſt of Lovers is
capable of touching ſuch a heart as
yours, I can promiſe my ſelf that you
will, in a little time, repent of having
given it me. Adieu, too cruel fair <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Adieu for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59414:68"/>
As I finiſh'd my Letter, I ſaw
people come from the Abbeſs, who,
after having in vain intreated me to
ſtay that night, would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in good earneſt my going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
but ſeeing me upon the point
of being angry, they oppoſed me
no longer: But my Valet was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
long, and I was afraid the
Abbeſs would come her ſelf, to try
once again her power over me,
which conſtrained me to depart,
and leave him with my baggage.
I gave him my Letter to <hi>Egidia,</hi>
with order to deliver it into her
own hands, and bring me an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
if ſhe'd write one; and thus I
forſook a place, that for a years
time, was the dear Scene of all my
pleaſures, loſt, as I may ſay, with
ſadneſs, and overwhelmed with
different pains, without coming to
my ſelf, or recovering my Sences
in all the way between the Abby
and my Lodging. It may eaſily be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59414:68"/>
gueſs'd, that when I came there,
I deſired neither to eat nor ſleep:
True Lovers, in the eſtate I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
unto, feaſt only upon Tears,
and Sleep avoids them as a mortal
enemy. 'Twas in the heat of theſe
cruel moments, that one came to
tell me there was a Valet below
would ſpeak with me: I bid that
they ſhould bring him into my
chamber, and ſaw that 'twas one
that belong'd to my dear <hi>Egidia.</hi>
I embraced him kindly, who, after
he had complemented me from his
Miſtreſs, gave me a Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I found theſe words.</p>
               <p>YOu do not think I wiſh your
death; you know me too well,
and are ſufficiently perſwaded that if
you had done me all the injuries in the
world, you have but a word to ſay to
make me believe you have not wrong'd
me. I know not what Letter you mean,
for 'tis above three days ſince I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from you: Come and tell me what
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59414:69"/>
it is, for I ſhall dye with diſpleaſure if
you leave me thus, with the fear that
I have done you wrong. I hear that
my Siſter could not prevail with you
to ſtay with us this evening; if you
love me better than you do her, will
you not do ſomething more at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt?
Return, I conjure you, I am
of a humour to pardon you all things,
and if you would have me believe that
you love me, you will give me this
proof of it; for I ſhall not ſleep till I
ſee you, and will expect you two hours
after midnight, in the Great Arbor in
the Garden, and I will judge of the
force of your Love, by the little time
you make me ſtay for you. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ſoon as I had read this Letter,
I got a Horſeback, and arrived in a
very ſhort time under the Walls of
the Garden, where I knew there
was a place that I could get over
with eaſe: But having found the
door open, I profited my ſelf of the
occaſion, which, I confeſs, ſurpriz'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59414:69"/>
me at firſt, but upon ſecond thoughts
I imagin'd, that it happened thro'
the contrivance of <hi>Egidia.</hi> I bid
her Valet tye our Horſes to the foot
of a Tree, and go to advertize my
Servant to prepare himſelf to come
away with me in an hours time.
After I had given this order, I went,
or rather flew to the Arbor, where
I was to find my dear <hi>Egidia.</hi> 'Twas
then that the Abbeſs, returning to
the Garden door, found my Horſes
that ſhe took for her Farmers, and
made uſe of them to make me that
extraordinary viſit.</p>
               <p>But not to dwell upon a little
Story, that begins already to ſeem
tedious, I will only tell you, that
<hi>Egidia</hi> received me in the Arbor
with a joy, that made me forget all
the ill uſage wherewith ſhe had ſo
lately treated me. We let ſome
time paſs in tranſports and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the faireſt day in the world
was never ſo agreeable to me, as
that charming Night. When I ſpoke
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59414:70"/>
to her of the Letter I had writ to
her, and that ſhe aſſured me that
ſhe never received it; we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at firſt that 'twas fall'n into the
Abbeſs's hands; and that my Valet
had either been guilty of a miſtake,
or betrayed me. In fine, after much
juſtification on both ſides; after, I
ſay, many new amities, ſighs, and
languors, that Lovers abound with
in a happy reconciliation, I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to her to ſteal her away, as you
have heard from Madam <hi>d' Eyrac;</hi>
and preſs'd her with ſo much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs,
that in the end, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and went to prepare her
ſelf to follow me I confeſs her
quick return a little ſurpriz'd me,
but who would then have thought
of Madam the Abbeſs? I ſaw her
maſqu'd, in the habit of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that ſhe did not ſcruple to go
with me; and, in a word, if my
Horſes had been ready, I do not
doubt but I ſhould have carried her
away inſtead of her Siſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59414:70"/>
I will not inlarge, by telling you
with what aſtoniſhment I was ſeiz'd
to ſee her go back again into the
Garden, and ſhut the door after
her: At firſt I believed that ſhe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſign'd to make ſport with me,
but as the rallery laſted a little too
long for people that had no time to
loſe, and that ſhe did not return;
in ſpight of me I concluded this was
no longer jeſt. I thought that ſhe
had conſented to follow me only to
deceive me, and that I had been the
moſt abuſed man in the world.
'Twas then that ſhame, deſpight,
and diſdain, excited terrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts
in my Soul, which together
with the diſpleaſure of not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was become of my Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
nor what I ſhould do with my
ſelf, put me in ſo furious a paſſion,
that I vented a thouſand complaints
and reproaches againſt the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Egidia.</hi> I conſider'd this as the
greateſt affront that a Man could
receive; I examin'd every particular,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59414:71"/>
and there was no circumſtance that
ſeemed not impoſſible to me. In
this humor I took my way to the
Village, that being the beſt courſe
I could then think of; and went to
lodge at my ancient Hoſts, where
I paſs'd a much more cruel Night
than the firſt time I had been in
that Houſe. I called to mind all
the cares and ſervices I had rendred
to this ingrate; and all the falſe
promiſes of amity that ſhe had
made me; and being aſtoniſhed not
to have found out the lightneſs of
her humor, I accuſed my ſelf of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
and blindneſs, adding to my
firſt deſpair, an indignation againſt
my ſelf. What extravagant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
had I with my ſelf that
Night! What numbers of unlikely
deſigns I framed! In truth, one is
liable to many follies when one loves
extremely. It was no ſooner day,
than I call'd to my Valet for Ink and
Paper to write to her, but it was
with ſo much trouble and diſorder,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59414:71"/>
that whatever I writ I defaced it as
faſt. Nothing pleaſed me, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I fancied I complain'd too
ſweetly, and ſometimes I feared to
offend her; ſometimes I reſolved to
take leave of her for ever, and a
moment after I repented of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:
But at laſt I writ thus to
her.</p>
               <p>YOu ought, Madam, rather not
to have obliged me, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of it ſo ſoon; nor to have come to
the door with me, to forſake me in ſuch
a manner: 'Twas my ill fortune that
my Horſes were loſt, you ſaw 'twas not
my fault, and you ought rather to have
comforted me, than treat me with that
cruelty, as to leave me without ſaying
a word to me: But above all, why did
you ſhut the door? Or why did you flee
from me? Did you fear any violence
from me? And wherefore did you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
me ſo much happineſs, if you did
not intend it? I ſee well what I ought
to conclude from all this, and that I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59414:72"/>
was deceived to believe you ever lov'd
me. The Maſque is off now, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
accuſing you of Ingratitude or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy,
I leave you to make your ſelf the
reproaches you merit, whilſt I go to
to waſte the remainder of my miſerable
life, in ſome place more happy for me
than this. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Letter was given her by her
Valet, who an hour after brought
me another from her, telling me
withal that ſhe was very ill, which
I might eaſily perceive by her wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that I could ſcarce read; and
where I found theſe words.</p>
               <p>ALl that you have writ to me ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
me in ſuch a manner, that
I believe I ſhall dye with it: I know
not what door you talk of, and all I
can ſay is, that I never ſaw you after
I parted with you in the Arbor, but
met a Spirit as I was coming, the
fright whereof will I think kill me:
'Twas certainly the ſame fantaſm that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59414:72"/>
you ſpeak of, and which, without doubt
came to you in my ſhape. Behold l
how God corrects thoſe that are not
wiſe! I have not ſlept ſince, and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fancy I ſee the Spirit that purſued
me. I ſee the hand of Heaven in it
that I have ſo long offended, let us
profit of its advice, my dear Monſieur,
let's endeavour to be wiſe; for my part,
I am wholly reſolved to lead a better
life, and if you love me you'l do ſo too.
We were going to ruine our ſelves, and
God would preſerve us, let us render
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thanks we owe him for his
goodneſs: See me not of ſome days,
I will think a little of my ſalvation,
and do invite you to do the ſame, and
to look upon me no longer but as one of
your friends. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was exceedingly ſurpriz'd with
the reading of this Letter; but to
tell you the truth, if ſhe had not
been very ſick, I ſhould have taken
all ſhe ſaid for chimaera's and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that ſhe made uſe of to excuſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59414:73"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:59414:74"/>
her inconſtancy: Though I never
gave much faith to ſuch fooliſh ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as that of the Fantaſm; yet
when I reflected upon what ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me, that ſhe had not ſeen me
ſince ſhe left me in the Arbor, I
began to be afraid to examine all
that had happened to me with this
pretended Spirit: I remembred ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well it had not ſaid a word to me,
that it was come ſooner than I could
have expected <hi>Egidia;</hi> I fancyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that it had opened the door
without a key, and that it vaniſh'd
when it left me: In a word, I yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inſenſibly to that error, which
ſerved to make me think in good
earneſt of my Conſcience, and to
make my peace with God. I was
ſome days without ever going to
the Convent, to avoid the ſight of
the Abbeſs, though ſhe ſent ſeveral
times to deſire me to take up my
Lodgings at her houſe as formerly;
excuſing my ſelf ſo well as I could,
till I received this Letter, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59414:74"/>
                  <hi>Egidia</hi> made one of her Friends
write to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Believe God will grant me the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a longer time for repentance:
The Phyſicians have ſome hopes of my
recovery, however it happens come and
ſee me, to the end that if Death parts
us, I may, in dying, have at leaſt this
conſolation of diſcharging my duty, by
telling you things that I am obliged to
tell you. I expect you. <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſcene (purſued Monſieur <hi>Le
Chevalier)</hi> will divert you but little,
it being all of tears. I went to ſee
her, and I avow to you I was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
touch'd with her condition,
that I was in one little better my
ſelf. I could not maſter my ſelf,
nor forbear to eaſe my afflicted
mind by a torrent of tears: All thoſe
that were preſent bore me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and none but the Abbeſs that
was not moved to ſee me thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.
This poor creature, who
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59414:75"/>
ſuffered with me, made ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to ſay things to me the moſt
kind and tender in the world: She
ſpoke to me as if ſhe were to dye
that day, and certainly none thought
ſhe could live much longer: But
Heaven would preſerve her to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the world with a moſt rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of conſtancy, and a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and ſincere friendſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have ſince lived.</p>
               <p>You know not perhaps (ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>d' Eyrac</hi> to him) that none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
ſo much to her recovery
as I; which was in this manner.</p>
               <p>This Maid, or if you pleaſe, the
Companion of the Abbeſs, which,
as I told you more than once, had
much confidence in me, failed not
to give me an account of this laſt
adventure in the Garden, and the
fear your Miſtreſs was in, that it
was not hard for me to gueſs the
cauſe of her illneſs, and to find out
means for her cure. Every body
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59414:75"/>
obſerv'd an extraordinary trouble in
her eyes, and ſuch diſorder in her
words, as though ſhe were in a
continual ſtudy: I pitied her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
and though it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to my Friend to declare the
ſecret wherewith ſhe had truſted
me, I believed that in the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whereto this poor Lady was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
I ought not to omit any
thing for her recovery: I took my
time when there was none with her
but a young Wench that ſerv'd her,
and that I could not ſuſpect; and
ask'd her with an air of confidence,
if her indiſpoſition proceeded not
from ſome diſturbance in her Mind,
and if ſhe believed me not enough
her friend, to truſt me with it. She
look'd fixtly on me and bluſh'd,
believing I meant to ſpeak to her of
Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier;</hi> but when
I told her afterwards that I knew
the cauſe of her illneſs perhaps bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than ſhe her ſelf, and that I
could deliver her from the fear ſhe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59414:76"/>
had been in, in the Garden, ſhe
raiſed her ſelf of a ſudden upon her
Bed, My God! Madam, (ſaid ſhe)
is it poſſible that in my ravings I
have ſpoke of any ſuch things! No,
no, (anſwered I interrupting her)
I know it by another way, and I
believe no body has heard any ſuch
thing from you: The perſons that
cauſed you this fear, told it me;
and I believed I ought not to leave
you longer in this pain: I imagine
you'l be ſo diſcreet, as I ſhall have
no reaſon to complain of you, and
that you'l uſe as you ought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
I have in you. She promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me ſecrecy, and I told her all
that had paſs'd in the Garden, as I
was inform'd of it; at which ſhe
was ſo aſtoniſh'd ſhe could ſcarce
believe it, if <hi>I</hi> had not told her all
that had happened to her ſelf, to
the diſcourſe between her and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Le Chevalier</hi> She bluſh'd at
it, and I ſaw well ſhe was aſham'd
that I knew this particular of her
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59414:76"/>
Life: But to be ſhort, ſince that
time her Mind was compoſed by
degrees, till it came to its firſt ſettl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.
She recovered her health,
and in a little time her ſtrength al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:
I do not know how ſhe has ſince
carried her ſelf towards you, but
this I know, that ſhe made ſtrong
reſolutions, though ſhe could not
forbear loving you, to do it in ſuch
a manner as ſhould not offend God.</p>
               <p>I'll aſſure you, Madam, (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Monſieur <hi>Le Chevalier)</hi> ſhe had
kept them, and that our friendſhip
is no more than what might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Brother and Siſter; though
in truth, I have had much pain to
reduce my ſelf to it, but at laſt I
have brought my will to hers. Tell
us a little, I beg of you, (ſaid the
