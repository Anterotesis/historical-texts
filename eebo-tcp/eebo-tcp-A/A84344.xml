         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGIE
UPON
The much lamented Death of the Right Honourable,
THE
LORD BROOKE.</head>
            <l>WEep not unthriſty Mourners: Why ſo faſt</l>
            <l>Theſe weak devotions due unto his laſt?</l>
            <l>Hoard up ſuch poor expreſsions of the eye,</l>
            <l>Till either Wife, or Child do chance to die,</l>
            <l>Or till thy aged Mothers knell thee call,</l>
            <l>To ſolemnize her petty Funerall.</l>
            <l>Tears are wrongs here, for where ſuch ſorrows come,</l>
            <l>The Land it ſelf ſhould groan, the men be dumb:</l>
            <l>The heart ſhould ſummon down the ſpirits all,</l>
            <l>Till ſence benum'd, and apprehenſion fall,</l>
            <l>Congeal'd into a Trance, and each man be</l>
            <l>A mournfull Statue unto Memorie:</l>
            <l>Or if you needs will weep, as fits the loſſe</l>
            <l>Of ſuch a Friend, ſo ſerious a Croſſe,</l>
            <l>Breathe all the ayre to ſighs, the drops o'th year,</l>
            <l>At once be all contracted to a Tear.</l>
            <l>Then let each Mourner, that hath a deſire,</l>
            <l>Weep out a part, and weeping ſo expire.</l>
            <l>Pardon's great Lord, and thy diviner Ghoſt,</l>
            <l>If by remembring what in thee we loſt,</l>
            <l>Out of that honour and love we owe to thee,</l>
            <l>We loſe our ſelves in an Hyperbole.</l>
            <l>Thus much is juſt and fit, that all may know</l>
            <l>What they unto the name of BROOKE doe owe:</l>
            <l>The Commonwealth's a debter to thy fate,</l>
            <l>Which deſtin'd thee a ſacrifice to th' State:</l>
            <l>But this is the leaſt part, that thou didſt die</l>
            <l>For us; we wrong thy ſacred Memorie</l>
            <l>If we confeſſe no more; thy high-born Soul</l>
            <l>Sought by death deaths Cov'nanters to controul,</l>
            <l>And to diſarm thoſe Engineers of hell,</l>
            <l>Whoſe villanies muſt write their Chronicle.</l>
            <l>It was the Goſpels late eclipſed light</l>
            <l>For which thou li'ſt thus low in death and night,</l>
            <l>And ſtrov'ſt to ſhame and quell each hinderer</l>
            <l>In peace by example, by thy ſword in war:</l>
            <l>For this thy reſolution ſtirr'd thee up</l>
            <l>To give truths enemies and thine the cup</l>
            <l>Of GODS great wrath, and with th'avenging ſword</l>
            <l>To fright all ſuperſtition from the Word.</l>
            <l>This made Romes baſe abettors toile and quake</l>
            <l>When ere they heard what thou didſt undertake;</l>
            <l>This fil'd their mouths with ſlanders, and their hearts</l>
            <l>Sworn to revenge with poyſon'd envious darts</l>
            <l>To wound thy pure Profeſsion with the name</l>
            <l>Of ſchiſme, and a new-found Browniſtick frame:</l>
            <l>This made that baſe inhumane particide</l>
            <l>With unexampled treacherie divide</l>
            <l>Thy ſoule from body (and them both from us)</l>
            <l>To heav'n with a ſtrange deſp'rate <hi>Mittimus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus thou didſt fall, thus diedſt thou, but to live</l>
            <l>In heav'n, and here with us, whilſt we can give</l>
            <l>Or teares, or marble; the portraiture of fame</l>
            <l>Upon two pillars reared to thy Name</l>
            <l>Shall ſtand, where ſhall be read and underſtood</l>
            <l>Thy deaths cauſe, Gods glory, &amp; the Kingdoms good.</l>
