         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian Idea,</hi> formed by Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fantaſie.

And certainly there's no Title more lawful and indubitible then that which is <hi>jure belli,</hi> neither that which is elective ſucceſſive, <hi>jure connubiorum, donative,</hi> Or <hi>teſtamentary,</hi> both by the Law of God and man. They having got it upon the account of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and liberty for the body and conſciences of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon, though (I have cauſe to believe) that they have ſince ſought their own things and not the things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But had it been an unjuſt and inoffenſive quarrel, then they had been Pyrats and Robbers, as <hi>Lucan</hi> calleth <hi>Alexander</hi> M. <hi>orbis terrarum praedonem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other thing that I did obſerve in Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet was, that after the Nobility were inveſted in their ancient right, they ſhould iſſue forth Writs unto all the places of this Common-wealth, to chuſe perſons for every County, Shiere, City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may be every way qualified for the ſervice of that Country, to ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on

For all their Ordinances, Acts, and Statutes, would be invalid and of none effect, without the conſent of <hi>King</hi> in Parliament, they would be in <hi>Eodem Jure,</hi> with a perſon, <note place="margin">33.

And in my Lord <hi>Dyers</hi> reports, 1 <hi>Reg. Maer.</hi> 93. In the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>North.</hi> his Caſe, it was a great doubt among the Juſtices, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>King,</hi> after a Bill paſſed by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, may Commiſſionate certain perſons, by his Letters Pattents, <hi>regium ſuum aſſenſuum conſenſuum, eadam billae, &amp; omnibus in eadem ſpecificatis,</hi> with a <hi>ſciatis igitur,</hi> that he doth thereby ratifie and confirm whatſoever they ſhould do in his name. So that now you ſee Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> airy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and plantaſmes fall unto the ground. Oh that ſuch an eminent perſon, for piety and godlineſs, ſhould turn as the dog to his vomiting, and as the Sow that was waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to her wallowing in the Mire; the Phyloſopher ſaith, that <hi>optimi corruptio eſt peſſima,</hi> Hypocrites &amp; Seducers ſhal wax worſe and worſe, and bring upon themſelves ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Oh what ſhall we ſay to theſe things, let them that ſtand take heed leſt they fall.</p>
            <p>Now that I may wind all in a ſheet of Paper, I would put the great ones in mind of performing their ſolemn promiſes and declarations to exalt Jeſus Chriſt, who is more glorious and excellent then the Mountains of prey. <hi>Abraham</hi> who is the Father of the faithful, as he came from the ſlaughter of the Kings, having reſcued his Brother out of their hands, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> met him and bleſſed him; you are the perſons that have delivered Gods people, and in former times Chriſt hath met you, and bleſſed you (as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115634:5"/>
you have come from the ſlaughter of the <hi>King</hi> and the Nobles) with all divine and ſpiritual bleſſings, who is a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> But now I am afraid you are like <hi>Sompſon,</hi> your ſtrength is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, your honours have put out your eyes, and now the Houſe of this Common-wealth is like to fall upon your heads. Therefore (I pray) hear one word.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Return unto the moſt high, from whom you have departed. And though you preſume that God will not deſtroy you, becauſe you are a Bull-work, and a defence to his People; Oh I muſt tell you, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, they by the weapons of the Spirit, have averted the Judgment, that otherwiſe might have fell upon you. <hi>Saul</hi> was a profeſſor, and propheſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prophets, yet after he came to be <hi>King,</hi> he forgot that God called him from following his Fathers Aſſes (as now ſome do not remember their pedigree, nor their Fathers Houſe) and launched out into all ſinful licentiouſneſs, and God dethroned him, and ſet up his Servant <hi>David</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, Make no peace with unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſay not a confederacy with them that ſay a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, for you muſt be a Nation in the midſt of a Nation, how dear was it like to coſt good <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> for entering into a league with wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſaying, I am as thou art, and my people as thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and we will be with thee in the warr.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115634:6"/>
III. Thirdly, Endeavor the taking away the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens that lie upon us, both as Men and Chriſtians, as men, you ought to impoſe your great taxes and impoſitions upon your enemies, as <hi>Solomon</hi> that oppreſſed the <hi>Cananites</hi> and the <hi>Perinites, &amp;c.</hi> that were enemies to his Kingdome, and ſpared his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral born ſubjects, as Chriſtians: how long ſhall we be villeins regardant, to ſet out the perſons Titles. It is a ſtrange thing, you will not have the judicial Law to be in force, (which is not aboliſhed,) and will have the ceremonial Law (which is eſtabliſhed) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Laſtly, and ſo I will conclude; If you think to hold on your courſe, Kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry, and you periſh from the way; Proclaim him to be both King of Saints, and King of Nations. It is the eternal purpoſe and Decree of God, to make him above the Kings of the World, for he is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, and all the holy Angels have done him fealty, for only the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> is worthy to open the Books, and looſe the Seals thereof. And therefore ſeeing, you have kept Jeſus Chriſt out of the Throne ſo long, the Lord give you Repentance unto Salvation, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be Repented of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115634:6"/>
And now I ſhall put you in mind of a few Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures among many; In <hi>Dan</hi> 7. 13, 14, 27. and in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 23. and in <hi>Iſa</hi> 63. 1, 2. <hi>Who is this that cometh from</hi> Edom, <hi>with dyed Garments from</hi> Bozar? <hi>this that is glorious in his Apparrel, travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength? I that ſpeak in righteouſneſs mighty to ſave. Wherefore art thou red in thine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, and thy Garments like him that treadeth the Winefat? The Garments of Chriſt ſhall be dyed in the blood of his Enemies, as the Garments of the Prieſts was dipped in</hi> Jordan.</p>
