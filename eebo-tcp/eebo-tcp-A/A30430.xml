            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SERMON
Preached before the

IN THE

On <date>the Fifth of November, 1689.</date>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Micah VI. Verse 5.</bibl>
               <q>O my People, remember now what Balak King
of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the Son of
Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye
may know the Righteousness of the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE is somewhat in Ease and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
that does so weaken the
Minds of Men, who are apt enough,
even without that softning, to forget all the
Good they receive, and both the Author of it,
and the Instruments made use of by him in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101259:5"/>
it, that it is necessary to call upon them often
to reflect on what is past; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on these visible Blessings of God to them,
that fall under the observation of all the
World, but on the secret methods, as well as
the hidden designs of Providence. We are
naturally apt to flatter our selves so much,
that we do easily imagine, that the happy
things which at any time befal us, are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of our Wisdom, or the rewards of our
Vertues; if a worse principle does not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
us, and make us ascribe them either to Fate
or Chance.</p>
            <p>No Nation had ever such a wonderful se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Blessings, that did so distinguish them
from all the World round about them, and
gave them such signal Evidences of God's
Power and greatness, of his Mercy and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
of his hatred of Idolatry, as well as of
the Authority of their Law and Religion, as
the <hi>Iews</hi> had; and yet never was there any
Nation under Heaven that was so apt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all this, and to revolt from God into that
very Idolatry, which they saw him punish so
severely in others. Never was there a more
amasing Scene than that which they had seen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101259:5"/>
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi>
the Miracles came so thick one after another,
they were both so various and extraordinary,
and they were so often and so long repeated,
that to one who lays together all that they
saw in a course of Forty years, it appears as
astonishing a part of that History as any of
all the Miracles recorded in it, that a People,
which had such a wonderful Evidence given
them for their Religion, should yet have been
so bent to Idolatry, and so apt to forget God,
and all that he had done for them. No Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now in the World can be in this respect
so guilty as they were, because none have seen
such Miracles.</p>
            <p>But setting aside extraordinary things, it may
be affirmed without any arrogant preferring
our own Nation to others, or any partiality
for our selves, in imagining that we are God's
favourite People; that within this last Age (or,
if we will carry up the matter to so blessed a
Period as the Reformation, that ever since
that time) we have had as many of the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Characters of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation upon
us, both in the Blessings that we have received
from God on the one hand, and in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101259:6"/>
to him on the other, as any under
Heaven.</p>
            <p>The wonderful conjuncture of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that concurred to give the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its first footing among us; The terrible
but short lived shaking it had in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s time, which served only to awaken, and
to prepare the Nation to the long and glorious
Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> The discovering
and defeating all the Designs that were laid,
both against her Person and Government; The
signal overthrow of the boasted <hi>Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada.</hi>
The Uniting the Island afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Head; by which we were delivered
from the danger of War within our selves.
The many Rebellions of the <hi>Irish,</hi> which gave
occasion to so vast a Colony to be sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which rendred that Island that had been
an Incumbrance on the Government before,
so useful to it. The encrease of our Trade,
the many Colonies that we have sent into
<hi>America.</hi> The preserving us during our Civil
Wars, from being made a prey to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and from Strangers getting footing
among us. The putting an end to Anarchy
and Enthusiasm in so serene a manner in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101259:6"/>
Year 60. the long continued Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
since that time, and the preserving us
from our own Follies, and the restraining
those Passions which had like to have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to us, if the precipitated haste of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
had not brought us to our Senses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
before it was too late.</p>
            <p>But to come to the repeated Deliverances of
this Auspicious Day, when one Train that was
laid to blow up the Nation, in its Head and
Representatives, that was so well managed,
and brought so near the Critical Minute, was
just then discovered and prevented; and now
again, when another that was laid to destroy
both Church and State, not only in their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
but in Person, has been not indeed
discovered, but happily prevented and brought
to nothing. For our late Conspirators were not
so cautious as to hide the Fuel that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for our Destruction, since we saw them
persecute in so many other places of <hi>Europe</hi> at
the same time that they talked of Toleration
here among us. When, I say, we have had
such a Series of Deliverances, as perhaps can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be matched in History, since that of the
<hi>Israelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> there is but one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101259:7"/>
thing wanting to make the Parallel compleat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that is our Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> were always murmuring both
against God, and against the Instruments whom
he had raised up for their Deliverance; and after
all that they had seen to render Idolatry detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them, yet they were always apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse
into it. But here the Parallel agrees too
exactly; for it is but too apparent, that upon
every new Instance of Gods care of us, we
have given also new Instances of our Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and Ingratitude, of our not only forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Mercies, but Repining at them, and
of our hardning our selves in our Vices and
ill Nature. God charged his Ancient People in
the Words before my Text,<note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
               <hi>O my People what
have I done unto thee, and wherein have I weari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
thee; testifie against me, for I brought, thee up out
of the Land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of
the House of Servants; and I sent before thee M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Aaron, and Miriam.</hi> These Words may be
applied to this Nation, in some respect, more
literally than to the Jews, for they might have
said that God <hi>had wearied them,</hi> by giving
them a Religion that had so many troublesom
and costly Rites in it; though on the other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101259:7"/>
hand these were nothing in Comparison of
the Rites of Paganism round about them; but
what can we object to God's methods towards
us? He has given us a plain and simple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
he has delivered us from all Bondage,
both in our Spiritual and Temporal Concerns;
and he has sent us mighty Deliverers; <hi>Aarons</hi>
in the Church, and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriams</hi> in the
State, an <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and a <hi>MARY,</hi> as well as
an <hi>Edward,</hi> a <hi>Charles,</hi> and a <hi>WILLIAM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because a general View of too many
things may tend to Evaporate our Thoughts,
rather than to fix them. There is in the
Words that I have read, one Particular set
before the <hi>Israelites,</hi> which carries indeed a great
variety of Instruction in it: They are called
on to remember <hi>what Balak the King of Moab
Consulted, and what Balaam the Son of Beor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the setting this in its true light,
it will be necessary to take a short view of
that Transaction. When the <hi>Israelites,</hi> after
their long march through the Wilderness, were

               </gap>ad given them, two Kings that were in their

               <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the

the King of <hi>Bashan,</hi> not only refused them
passage through their Kingdoms, which they
had desired in a Regular and Peaceable way;
but not satisfied with this, they carried the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
further, and brought together their Forces to
stop their march; but they were defeated and
their Kingdoms were conquered. Upon this
<hi>Balak</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi> apprehended that he might
likewise become a Prey to them: so he fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
according to the Idolatry of that time,
that there were Peculiar Gods for every Nation
and that the Successes of a Nation depended
on the prevalency of the Deity that protected
it, sent to <hi>Balaam,</hi> who was a Prophet held in
Veneration in those Parts, hoping that if he
could be got to curse them, then the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

could give the most effectual Council possible
to <hi>Balak,</hi> for his first debauching the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
and then destroying them. The most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
account of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Inspiration is this, that
God continued for some Ages after the Flood,
to raise up in several Nations Prophets by an
immediate Commission to be his Witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Idolatry, and against the Corruption of
the Traditional Religion, which was handed
down by the first and long-liv'd Patriarchs:
But so imperfect was this Conveiance, though
the long Lives of the Fathers gave it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which it could never have since that time,
that Men did very quickly corrupt both their
Religion and their Morals; and in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
time Idolatry had got strange footing all the
World over: Men in all Ages have had a
strange biass to a sensible Religion, and to a
visible Object of it. In many of these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it is highly probable, that God raised up
both Prophets and Preachers of Righteousness,
that so they might be without excuse: And as
<hi>Noah</hi> warned the Old World, and <hi>Lot</hi> the Men
of <hi>Sodom,</hi> before those Terrible Judgments of
God which destroyed them fell upon them;
so <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> seem to have been
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101259:9"/>
inspired Persons, in whom God made the last Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
upon these Nations. But with this difference,
that the former was a Person that did in all things
answer his Character; whereas the other was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passive in his Inspirations; but these had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
upon himself; so that while he Preached to
others he himself was a Reprobate: For though
God made such impressions on his Imagination,
as gave him views of future Events, and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in the expressing them with a due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Sublimity of Stile, yet these neither
came from his Heart, nor could make any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon it. He loved <hi>Balak</hi>'s Presents,<note place="margin">Numb 22. 7.</note>
which are called the <hi>rewards of his Divination,</hi>
so well, that he would gladly have done any
thing to have deserved them at his hands; yet
he was so restrained by the Divine Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he refused to go to him at first: But a
second Message, carried by more Honourable
Messengers,<note place="margin">Verse 13. 15.</note> enforced with a Promise of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
him to great honour, and of doing whatsoever
he should desire of him,</hi> was a Bait which he
could not reject; so his Heart being set on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
God so far gave way to it, that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to go,<note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> that from the Prophesies
which he should be forced to Pronounce, there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101259:9"/>
might be a further Declaration made of his
Blessing the <hi>Israelites,</hi> not only in the Success
and Prosperity that was then to attend upon
them, but in that wonderful view that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him of a Star, that at a great distance of
time should shine,<note place="margin">Numb. 24.</note> and that then <hi>a Scepter should
rise out of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 17. 19.</note> to which all the Nations round
about should submit; <hi>for out of Iacob should
he come that was to have Dominion. Balak</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his fond and Superstitious Notions,
fancied that the offering many Sacrifices, and
the giving <hi>Balaam</hi> a new Prospect of the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
in several Places, would have changed the
Matter; and so he gave him three different
views of them, at every one of which there
were Seven Altars built, and a Bullock and a
Ram were offered on every one of these Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars;
but all the Preparation that <hi>Balak</hi> made,
and all this shifting the Scene of often, had no
other Effect,<note place="margin">Numb. 23. 24.</note> but that reitterated Blessings on
the <hi>Israelites</hi> were Pronounced at every time:
And when this provoked <hi>Balak</hi> so much, that
he would have no more of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,<note place="margin">Numb. 24. 10. 17.</note>
he then of himself gave forth the most
express and positive one of them all, in favour
of the Jewish Nation, of their Success, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101259:10"/>
of that vast Glory that should accrue to them,
when that Prince, whose appearance should be
accompanied with a Star, should come. But
though <hi>Balaam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 22. 23.</note> as he said himself, <hi>had no power
to speak any thing but the words which God should
put in his mouth;</hi> in which it seems he was so
intirely Passive, that he was not at all Master
of himself, when he fell into those Trances;
yet after those Essays he had vainly made to
Curse them, he offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d an advice to <hi>Balak,</hi> that
had a more certain Effect than all the Curses
that were desired from him could have had;
which was this, he knew well that God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to that People was Conditional, and so
could last no longer than they should continue
observing their Part of the Covenant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he Counselled <hi>Balak</hi> to endeavour first to
Corrupt their Morals, and then to Debauch them
in their Religion; or as it is expressed by the
Spirit of God, Rev. 2. 4. <hi>He taught</hi> Balak <hi>to
cast a Stumbling-block before the People of Israel, to
eat things Sacrific'd to Idols, and to commit Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
lewd Women were sent in among them,
to intice them first to Vice, and then to the
Idolatry of <hi>Baal-peor;</hi> the Rites of which were
so Indecent, that as the Scripture wraps them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101259:10"/>
up in general words; so it is better to pass
them over, than to explain them. This
had the desired effect; the People did defile
themselves in both; <hi>They sate down to eat and
drink, and rose up to play.</hi> But, though God
was by this highly provoked, yet he would
not deliver them up into the Hands of
their Enemies, he sent a Plague among
them, by which in one day there fell Four
and twenty Thousand.<note place="margin">Numb. 25. v. 1.</note> This was done in
<hi>Shittim,</hi> which is here mentioned in my Text;
but when the Wrath of God had broke out<note place="margin">v. 4. 5.</note>
upon them, in so severe a manner, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the destruction made by the Plague,
<hi>Moses</hi> was commanded by God to <hi>hang up all
the Heads of the People against the Sun;</hi> and he
charged the Judges to <hi>stay every one of them
his Men that were joined unto Baalpeor;</hi> this
struck the whole Congregation, so that they
were weeping before the Door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.
But so impudent a thing is Vice,
when strengthned by Idolatry, that <hi>Zunri,</hi>
one of the Princes of <hi>Israel,</hi> brought in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
before them all, as if he had gloried in
that which was his shame. This was an
Object that must needs have given Horrour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101259:11"/>
to all that saw it,<note place="margin">Ps. 106.</note> and it raised such Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in <hi>Phinehas,</hi> that in a Transport of Zeal
he killed them both; upon which the Plague
was staid, God was reconciled to his People,
and in a Battel which they had soon after
this,<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 31. v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Balaam,</hi> that was the Author of this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Advice, was slain: This is that transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Prophet calls upon them to
remember, and in doing it, to <hi>consider of the
Righteousness of the Lord. Righteousness</hi> in the
strict notion of the Word, is <hi>Iustice;</hi> and in
that sence they might, in calling to mind the
passages of that story, reflect on God's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgments in punishing their Fathers,
when they had departed from him, in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Plague among them; in stopping it
upon their Repentance, and upon <hi>Phinehas</hi>'s
zealous deportment; and in turning the
course of his Wrath upon the wicked Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that had cast those Temptations in
their way, and particularly on <hi>Balaam,</hi> the
chief Author of the Counsel.<note place="margin">Ps. 112. 8, .9.</note> But if <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
may be taken,<note place="margin">Ps. 116. 5.</note> as it often is, in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
sence,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 2.</note> for <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 1. 19.</note> then these
words import this, That in reflecting on that
Story, they should observe God's Goodness to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101259:11"/>
his People, in disappointing all the Designs
of their Enemies; in restraining a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that would have willingly divined for
hire, and prophesied whatsoever <hi>Balak</hi> should
have dictated to him; and afterwards, in not
suffering that Corruption, which began to
spread among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to go long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished;
but by the early punishing of a few,
staying the Progress of the Defection, and upon
that zealous performance of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> staying the
Plague likewise. Here are eminent Characters
both of Justice and Mercy: And therefore, since
the People were at this time so apt to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Idolatry, it was fit to put them in mind
both of the Severity and of the Goodness of
God, that in both they might see effectual
Reasons to perswade them to serve God, as
it is expressed in the following words, in <hi>doing
Iustice, loving Mercy, and in walking humbly with
their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far I have gone in explaining my Text,
as it related to the People of <hi>Israel;</hi> I come
now to make it look towards this Nation,
and the Blessings of this Happy day: I shall
not stretch the Parallel so far, as to make
every thing come within it, or to force any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101259:12"/>
strained Allusions, but shall only consider
such things as are both obvious and easie.
It is well known, that when we had got out
of the House of Bondage, the neighbouring
Nations began to be afraid of us, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
against us, to enslave and destroy us;
they had their false Prophet more entirely at
their command, than <hi>Balaam</hi> was at <hi>Balak</hi>'s,
who was, of his own accord, ready enough
to curse us: he needed no Hire to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to it, his own Interest was deep
enough engaged in it. It is true, his Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were spent in angry and lofty words,
without the designed effect: Wars were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
raised within and without, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
League was formed above an Age ago,
which went on with great success for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years, till it had its Crisis in 88, and
then a Fleet, armed with all that either the
Blessings or Curses of that See could add to
it, came against us, while we seemed to be
as Sheep numbred out to the Slaughter, or,
at least, appointed to be Slaves; but all this
Storm went over, and in it we had many
occasions, that invited us to reflect on the
Righteousness of the Lord; when all that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101259:12"/>
Scene of Curses was spent and turned on
them that had denounc'd them against us:
Then the open Methods of Enmity proving
so unsuccessful, secreter Practices were thought
the safer: We were cursed, and devoted to
endless Destruction, so that nothing was
thought too bad for us; and by a succession
of many Conspiracies, the Life of that Great
Princess, upon which our Safety then depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
was struck at; most of those were well
laid, many of them were almost quite ripe,
when by unlook'd-for Accidents and Methods
they were discovered: At last a Design was
laid, in which there was a complicated Train
of all the Mischief that could possibly be done
us in one minute; and even that was brought
so near its conclusion, that had not the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of a Sister prevailed over her zeal
for her Religion, to the preserving her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as is generally believed, the greatest
and happiest Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> had become,
in a moment, the most miserable. How
far this was concerted among the <hi>Balaks</hi> and
<hi>Balaams</hi> of that time, we do not certainly
know: But, a Case of this nature being put
by one of their Writers some years before,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101259:13"/>
in a printed Book, and determined in the
Negative, That a Priest was bound not to
reveal any such design, if discovered to him
in Confession; gives a shrewd indication,
that it was then projected among a sort of
Men, who have never seemed guilty of the
least tenderness of Nature, when Heresie was
in the case. But when their Curses proved
harmless things, and their Designs were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
only to themselves, and to their Friends;
then they fell on new Methods, which have
indeed succeeded better with them. One
has been the dividing us among our selves,
and the engaging us into such mutual quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings,
that their assistance might be alwaies
some way or other necessary to the Party
that was deprest. Thus, though they themselves
were the most inconsiderable Party in the
Nation, yet they have so managed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by shifting sides, as their Interests led
them to it; that they who could not have
stood it out by their own strength, yet by
joining themselves to those who needed such
an accession, and were willing to support
themselves by it, came not only to preserve
themselves, but to make a much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101259:13"/>
Figure among us, than without
those their Practices and our own Follies,
they could ever have pretended to. They
had Art enough on the one hand to make
one side maintain vigorously some indifferent
things, while they could on the other hand
engage the other to as obstinate an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them: They knew well, that in this
Dispute, which side soever lost, they must
needs gain, both by the weakening that it
gave us, and by the advantages that it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them: For, while we grew afraid
only of one another, and angry only at one
another; they were no more lookt after;
and so they had opportunities to work so long
under ground and unobserved, that they had
almost quite undermined us before we were
sensible of our danger: And when they could
conceal it no longer, but that the Mask must
fall off, they even then could so far work on
our mutual Animosities as to make us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for doing half their work: while
some were so far deluded, as to be their
Tools in the destroying our Civil Liberties,
and others, who had complained of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
had yet no sooner an opportunity offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101259:14"/>
them, than they struck in to overthrow
all the Security that we had for our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
under the pretence of enjoying a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
when the price of it was the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Dispensing Power, that must needs
have devoured all in a little time. So that
both sides have deserved by Turns this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
That our Enemies could manage
their Passions so, as to graft their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
on them, and to make them grow out
of them, only with this difference, That the
last deceived are certainly the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
since they had seen and censured other
mens Errors, and yet fell into the same Follies
themselves, when the Designs were become
more barefac'd; and, by consequence, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of that sort were the more Criminal.
This we have all felt, so long, that it may be
now reasonably expected, that the Experience
of past-times, and the publick and solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
that were made in the late Distress,
should now bring us to a right temper,
and, that we should now join all our Forces
together, for we shall have occasion for our
whole strength, while we struggle with such
powerful and vigilant Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101259:14"/>
3. But the second Artifice, which comes
nearer to that in my Text, has been no less
succesful to Them, than fatal to Us; and
that is, The vitiating all our Notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the corrupting the Morals of the
whole Nation. It is plain that they thought
it was a good step to bring us over to <hi>their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
once to make us have <hi>none of our own.</hi>
True Morality can never bear a Religion that
dissolves all Duties, and dispences with all
Obligations; nor can a sense of Religion,
once rightly awak'ned, bear the impositions of
Tyranny, Superstition, and Infallibility: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was necessary for them to propagate
Atheism among us, since men that had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
could easily be brought to profess that
which is next to none, and that agreed best
with their Interests. And this they carried
on in one respect very avowedly; for in
their Books they studied plainly to prove,
That men could have no Certainty for the
Christian Religion, unless they took it on
their word; and so they set themselves to
weaken the force of all those Arguments by
which the Truth of the Christian Faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and to put the whole Authority of it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101259:15"/>
upon the Testimony of the Church. This
was no small comfort to the Atheists, who
from the common Principles of Sense saw
the unreasonableness of believing or submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
implicitly to the Authority of the Church,
and so were glad to be told that this was all
the Evidence that could be brought for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self.</p>
            <p>But the debauching our Morals, was that
which seemed chiefly necessary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
their Designs; and in this their
Agents had too much matter to work upon.
The folly and hypocrisie of some, that in the
late Times had given great Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the profession of Religion, was a handle
that they failed not to make use of, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all secret Prayer, the reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the observation of the Lord's Day,
together with all the shews of Piety, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
Morality was thought the effect of a
mean Education, and of a narrow Mind;
True Piety was despised as a Cant; The
strictness of Virtue, the fidelity to the Vow of
Marriage, Chastity, and Sobriety, were put
out of countenance, as signs of ill-breeding,
or of a weak and superstitious temper. It
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101259:15"/>
look'd big and gallant to laugh at Religion,
to despise the Worship of God, to affront
those that Ministred in Holy Things, and to
set up for the most avowed Disorders on that
Day which is dedicated to the Worship of
God. The open practice of the blackest
Vices, was a good step to assure a man of
their favour, and to make him pass for one
on whom they could depend. Instruments
of Vice were ready to carry on the Design:
and, as if we had been to be drawn to their
Idolatry by the same sort of persons that were
sent in by <hi>Balak</hi> to corrupt the <hi>Israalites,</hi> their
<hi>Balaks</hi> had likewise their <hi>Moabitish</hi> Women
to send among us; which was practised al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as barefacedly as when <hi>Zimri</hi> brought
in <hi>Cosbi</hi> before the door of the Tabernacle in
the face of the whole Congregation.</p>
            <p>This was a Train that being once laid, and
having taken fire, could not but prove fatal
to a Nation that is but too apt to be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the effects of it we feel to this day:
For Vice having over-run us so entirely as
once it did, we cannot be soon freed from so
infectious a Disease; which, wheresoever it
once takes root, drives it so deep, that it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101259:16"/>
cannot be easily extirpated. When a Nation
is once given up to pleasure, and to a profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of living, to Falshood and Treachery,
and to all the arts of dissembling and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
one another, it must be the work
of an Age to bring men back to a decent
Frugality and Sobriety, to an exactness of
Truth, and a strictness of Virtue. Nature
will be long of the side of Pleasure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
these things being soon learned, and
foarce ever forgotten.</p>
            <p>Out of a due reflection on all these things,
we must come at last to know the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord: God has <hi>disappointed the
Councels of our Enemies,</hi> and made all their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners
mad;</hi> they have been taken in <hi>their
own Craft, and in the Net which they laid for us
was their own foot taken.</hi> In every step that
they made, a Spirit of Giddiness and Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
seemed to have been poured out upon
them. I need not repeat things that must
still be fresh in all your memorie, and I hope
will be so long; for we must ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that we owe our Preservation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
much more to Their Folly, than
to Our own Wisdom. When we were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101259:16"/>
to pieces, they used Arts on design indeed
to divide us further, but they helped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us: When we were guilty, even to
madness, of believing every Promise that
they made us, they took care to let us see
how little regard they themselves had to any
of them: When we could not believe that
they would break any of our Laws, they
broke through them all at once, and shewed
us what feeble things either Promises or
Laws are, when Heresie stands in their way.
And thus God in his just and righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
suffered them so far to precipitate all
matters, that they ruined their own designs
by their over driving them.</p>
            <p>We must have acknowledged that God had
been just and righteous, if he had delivered
us over as a prey unto them. We had by our
contempt of the Gospel, and by the ill use
we had made of all his Mercies, and of all
former Deliverances, provoked him to cast
us off; and when we consider the extreme
Miseries into which he has cast other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
the long Oppression, and the hard strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
through which <hi>Scotland</hi> has pass'd, and
the pangs in which <hi>Ireland</hi> continues still, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101259:17"/>
now a Scene of Blood and Misery, and
like to be so yet for some time, if we do not
more effectually interpose for bringing their
Deliverance to a quicker Conclusion; and if
we compare with all this, the gentle Visitation
that we have had, and that has pass'd over us in
so easie and harmless a manner, that few broke
their sleep, or interrupted their method of
living for it: We must, in our reflections on
these things, change the signification of the
word <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and instead of using it in
the sense that imports <hi>strict Iustice,</hi> we must
take it in the other that imports <hi>Mercy and
Goodness;</hi> for who can reflect on these Two
<hi>Fifths of November,</hi> without adoring the riches
of God's Mercy and Goodness to us in them
both? The former was in it self a great
Deliverance, but its Consequences were not
so signal as might have been expected. If
that cursed Train had wrought the designed
Effect, it had been indeed the most fatal Blow
that ever was given: but after all, the
Nation, tho' cast by it into a most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Convulsion, would probably have had
strength enough to have recovered it self;
the Crime would have been revenged, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101259:17"/>
the Nation for ever purged from all such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of Cruelty. The Circumstances
of the Discovery, and the Judgments of God
on the Conspirators, had particular Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of his Righteousness in them, as the
prevarications and denials of the Criminals
had also their Characters of that cursed School
in which they had learned the depths of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
The whole thing was such a Contexture
of the Wickedness of Man on the One hand,
and of the Mercy and Goodness of God on
the Other, as is indeed without an Example
in the Histories of former Times.</p>
            <p>But without derogating from the Blessing
of such a Wonderful Preservation, it may
be affirmed, That as the Danger which we
lately run was greater, so by Consequence,
the Deliverance which had its beginning this
day, is not only the fresher Blessing, and so
the more sensible to us; but is likewise the
more Important in it self of the two. The
<hi>Gunpowder-Treason</hi> was a Personal thing, but
the late Conspiracy was National: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was levelled at the person of one King,
and some of the Branches of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
but the latter was against the Crown
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101259:18"/>
it self; by which one half of that Authority
that belongs to it, was to have been surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
up to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other half must
have become tributary to <hi>France.</hi> Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must indeed have suffered highly by
the one; but it was to have been quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated
by the other. A great many had
perished in a quick and sudden fire by the
one; whereas the end of the other would
have been, that we must all have languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in such slow fires as Inquisitors might have
made for us, or under the studied Cruelties
of Dragoons, according to the <hi>French</hi> Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
if we would not have consigned our
selves over to Everlasting Burnings, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
our Religion. Our Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
might have suffered in the One, tho'
<hi>Spain</hi> at that time was not in a condition to
have made so great a Conquest: But all
must have gone now, when they had so vast
a Power so near them as <hi>France</hi> is, to have
supported and compleated that Destruction
of our Liberties which was so barefacedly
begun, and that had already made so great a
progress among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101259:18"/>
And when I have named <hi>France,</hi> I have said
all that is necessary to give you a Compleat
Idea of the Blackest Tyranny over Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
Persons, and Estates, that can possibly
be imagined, where every Thing that the
Subject possesses is at the Mercy of a boundless
Power, and of a Severity that has no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
either of Truth or Goodness to govern or
allay it; and by which Subjects are treated
with as much Cruelty, as Enemies are with
Barbarity; That has broke thro all that is
Sacred among Men, and has bid Defiance both
to Heaven and Earth. This is a short view of
that from which we are now a second time
delivered. I need not enlarge on the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Characters of the Hand of God in our
Deliverance. These were too visible not to
have been observed by all Men, and they are
yet too fresh in our Memories to be forgotten
by any; but that which few are apt either to
reflect on, or to remember, is the Design of
Heaven in all this, that so we may understand
the <hi>loving Kindness,</hi> as well as the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>We had by our Sins, and our Divisions,
brought our selves very low, we had provoked
God, and irritated one another, therefore he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101259:19"/>
has made us to see and feel the Effects both of
our Sins and Follies, that so we may be
brought to repent of the one, and to correct
the other.</p>
            <p>Let us then resolve to turn to God in good
earnest, and not to provoke him any more,
lest if we stir up his Wrath again against us,
his Displeasure break out upon us in as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a manner as has been hitherto again and
again designed by our Enemies, but still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by his watchful Providence.</p>
            <p>Let us grow ashamed of those Vices which
have so dispirited and corrupted the Nation,
that we were both fit for Destruction, and had
made our selves an easy Prey to our Enemies,
being so shamefully degenerated from the
Vertues of our Ancestors. Let us compose our
Minds to softer Thoughts of one another, that
those Animosities which have arisen from some
small Diversities in Opinions and Ceremonies,
may be allayed, and that we may make such
Observations on the Practices of our Enemies,
as from these to form righter Judgments of
Things, and so come to such temperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
as to love one another; at least, if
we cannot be so wise, or so happy as to agree
all our Differences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101259:19"/>
And let us in a more particular manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the Goodness of God who now gives
us the hopes of happy Days, under the Man
whom he has made so <hi>strong for Himself,</hi>
whom he made first the Instrument of saving
the best Church and People upon Earth after
our own, and who now again has been put on
to preserve and rescue us, as if he were born
to be the Deliverer and Darling of Mankind.
God be blessed for it, we have now a King
and Queen, whose Examples we hope shall
have a great an Influence over us for making
us truly Good, as their Government has for
making us really Happy.</p>
            <p>Let us then study to be Peaceable and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to them; and thankful to God for them,
and then we need not fear what either the
<hi>Balaks</hi> or the <hi>Balaams,</hi> that are contriving our
Destruction, and consulting the Methods of
doing it, can project or set on foot against us.
For if we are at peace with God, and united
at Home, we may assure our selves, that the
course of Blessings which has hitherto fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Him, whom God in his Providence has
set over us, shall not be interrupted but by
a glorious Progress of Triumphs it shall be
carried on, till both the <hi>Balak</hi> that is now set
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101259:20"/>
on our Destruction, shall fall before him, and
those <hi>Balaams</hi> that <hi>divine for her,</hi> and that
<hi>prophesy falsly,</hi> be put to confusion: Which
God of his great Mercy grant, for the glory
of his great Name, through Jesus Christ.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
