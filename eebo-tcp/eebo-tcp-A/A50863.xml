            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> Advocat, as Procurator for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> Pannal, alleadges that he ought not to paſs to the knowledge of an Aſſize; becauſe he had not got a Citation upon, fyfteen days, or at leaſt on a competent time, which is uſual, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſar in all Actions, and much more in Criminal Purſuits, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſeing, if a competent time be not allowed to the Pannal, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludit of the benefit of ane exculpation, without which he cannot prove his Objections againſt Witneſſes, or Aſſyzers, or any other Legal, or competent Defences; And by the late Act of Parliament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Juſtice Court, all Pannalls are allowed to raiſe Precepts of Exculpation, and thereupon to cite Witneſſes, for proving the Objections againſt Witneſſes, and Aſſyzers, which neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth, that a competent time muſt be allowed to the Pannal to execut his diligence, or otherwiſe, how is it poſſible he can prove an Defence of <hi>alibi,</hi> or any other juſt Defence: and as this is moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that clear Act of Parliament, and to material Juſtice, and to the Rules of Humanity, ſo this point has been already fully and often decided, and lately in the caſe of one <hi>Robertſon</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1673. The Inſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is given by His Majeſties Advocat in his Book of Criminals, and Title of Libels, where the Lords found, that albeit <hi>Robertſon</hi> got his Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Priſon, yet he behoved to get it upon fifteen dayes.</p>
               <p>HIS Majeſties Advocat oppons the conſtant Tract of Deciſions, whereby it is ſound, that a perſon Incarcerated may be Tryed upon twenty four houres; and the late Act of Parliament is only in the caſe where a Summons or Libel is to be Raiſed; but here there is no Libel or Summons, but only an Inditement; nor was any Exculpation ſought in this caſe, before the Tryal, which is the caſe provided for by the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>THe Lords, Juſtice-General, Juſtice-Clerk, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of Juſticiary, Repell the Defence, in reſpect the Pannal is a Priſoner, and that it has been the conſtant Cuſtom of the Court, and that the Pannal made no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer application for an Exculpation.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> for the Pannal, alleadges (alwas denying the Libel, and whole Members, and Qualifications thereof) that in ſo far as the Libel is founded upon Harbouring, maintaining, and Intercommuning with the perſons mentioned in the Dittay, the Pannal ought to be aſſoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied, becauſe it is <hi>res hactenus judicata,</hi> he having been formerly purſued before the Lords of his Majeſties Privy Council for the ſame Crimes, and Fined in an conſiderable Sum; and therefore that Crime cannot now be made uſe of as a ground of Treaſon againſt the Pannal.</p>
               <p>HIS Majeſties Advocat anſwers, That he Reſtricts his Libel, to the Pannals entering in a Conſpiracy, for raiſing Rebellion, and for procuring Money to be ſent to the Late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> for carrying on the ſaid Rebellion; and for concealing, and not revealing; neither of which is referred to his Oath; and conſequently was not <hi>res judicata,</hi> there being nothing referred to his Oath; but his Converſe and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with ſome Miniſters, and others within the Kingdom, and his own Gardiner, and his Writing Letters to my Lord <hi>Argile;</hi> and oppons the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60584:4"/>
Decreet of Council it ſelf, and reſtricts the Libel to all the Crimes not inſiſted on in the Decreet.</p>
               <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Replyes, That as to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Correſponding with the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> at any time ſince his Foreſaulture, was expreily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned as an Interrogator to the Pannal in that Purſuit, at His Majeſties Advocat's Inſtance againſt him, before the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council, and that not only his own Correſpondence by himſelf; but alſo by Major <hi>Holms,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carſtares, Robert Weſt, Thomas Shepherd, Richard Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Rumſay,</hi> as the Interrogator bears, as appears by a double of the Act of Council, written by the Clerk of Councils Servant, and is offered to be proven by my Lord Advocats Oath: And as to any Correſpondency with Mr. <hi>Veitch;</hi> it is not Relevant, ſince he was not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Rebel.</p>
               <p>SIr <hi>John Lauder</hi> for his Majeſties Intereſt, anſwers, That he oppons the Decreet of Privy Council, where no ſuch Interrogator was put to the Pannal, and the Decreet muſt make more Faith than any pretended Scroll, and cannot be taken away by His Majeſties Advocats Oath, to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties prejudice; and for Mr. <hi>William Veitch,</hi> he ſtands expreſly Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in <hi>anno</hi> 1667. and the Doom of Forefaulture, is Ratified in the Parliament 1669.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> oppons the Reply, That as to the Correſponding with Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> it does not appear, that he is the perſon mentioned in the Act of Parliament; and albeit he were, as he is not, he having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after come home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> all the puniſhment inflicted upon him was Baniſhment, not to return under the pain of Death, which did take off any former Puniſhment; and it was no Crime in any Perſon to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commune with him, eſpecially in another Kingdom; and by the late Act of Council in <hi>anno</hi> 1683. Even the Converſing, and Intercommuning with declared Traitors, is reſtricted to an Arbitrary puniſhment.</p>
               <p>HIs Majeſties Advocat oppons the ſtanding Doom of Forefaulture againſt <hi>Veitch,</hi> and the Proclamation, or Act of Council it ſelf.</p>
               <p>THe Lords, Juſtice-General, Juſtice-Clerk, and Commiſſioners of Juſticiary, having conſidered the Libel, purſued by His Majeſties Advocat, againſt Mr. <hi>Robert Baille</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> with my Lord Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats Declaration, whereby he Reſtricts the ſame to the Crimes not inſiſted on in the Decreet of Council formerly pronunced againſt the Pannal: They find the ſame Relevant as it is reſtricted, to infer the pain of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and remits the ſame to the knowledge of the Aſſize, and Repells the remnant Defences proponed for the Pannal, in reſpect of the Decreet of Council produced, bearing no ſuch thing as is alleadged, and of the anſwers made by His Majeſties Advocat thereto.</p>

                  <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Tarras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Procurator for the Pannal, objects againſt the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> that he cannot be a Witneſs, becauſe he is <hi>ſocius &amp; particeps criminis;</hi> and it is clear by the 34. <hi>Chap. Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>Rob.</hi> 1. Concerning theſe that are excluded from bearing of Teſtimony that <hi>ſocij &amp; participes ejuſdem criminis, vel incarcerati &amp; vinculati,</hi> cannot bear Teſtimony: As alſo, the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> being preſently under an Inditement of High Treaſon, and under the Impreſſions of Fear, and Death, no perſon in his Circumſtances can be admitted a Witneſs, as is not only clear from the foreſaid Statute, but from the Common Law.</p>
               <p>HIs Majeſties Advocat anſwers, That it is an exception from that Rule, both by the Common Law, and ours, that in the Crime of leſe Majeſtie, and eſpecially, that Branch thereof, which we call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, <hi>ſocius criminis</hi> may be a witnes, and which is introduced very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably by Lawyers, to ſecure the common intereſt of mankind, which is the chief of all Intereſts; and becauſe Conſpiracies cannot be otherwayes proved, and not to allow this manner of Probation, were to allow Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince no man can prove a Plot, but he that is upon it, and how can a man object againſt him as a Witneſs, whom himſelf truſted with his Life, his Fortune, and their common Plot, nor is the intenting of the Lybel any ſtronger qualification, ſince every man that is <hi>ſocius criminis,</hi> is under the ſame impreſſion, and it would rather ſeem the greater and nearer apprehenſions a man has of death, he will be the more ſincere and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Nor has the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> nor did he ever ſeek any ſecurity, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his deponing. And this has been conſtantly, and latlie, conform to the Common Law, as may be ſeen in the hundreds of Citations ſet down by <hi>Maſcard, de probationibus, vol.</hi> 4. <hi>concluſ.</hi> 1318. <hi>num</hi> 21. and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary citations prove only, that regularly <hi>ſocius criminis</hi> cannot be a Witues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60584:5"/>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> replyes, that the Statutes of <hi>Robert</hi> the firſt is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>non eſt diſtinguendum ubi lex non diſtinguit,</hi> and not only was he <hi>ſocius criminis,</hi> which is acknowledged, but he is <hi>incarceratus,</hi> and lying under an Indytment of high Treaſon, and has thrown himſelf on the Kings Mercy, and it is not proper he ſhould be a Witneſs, ſeeing he is in the Kings Mercy, who may give him his life or not, and there was never a Perſon in theſe circumſtances, that ever was admitted a Witneſs.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> adds, That the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> is not only in the caſe of a perſon who ſtands lndyted for High-Treaſon; but muſt be look'd upon, as a perſon condemned for the ſaid Cryme, ſeeing he fully, and amply confeſt the Cryme: <hi>&amp; confeſſas habetur pro convicto,</hi> and never any Lawyer aſſerted, That <hi>damnatus criminis loeſae Majeſtatis</hi> could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a Witnes, and there is nothing more clear, then that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and the Law of all Nations, this Objection ought to be ſuſtained, for the Civil Law is clear, <hi>leg. 11. cod. de teſtibus</hi> and <hi>Matheus</hi> in his title <hi>de probationibus, cap. de teſtibus,</hi> doth aſſert poſitivlie, that the Cryme of leſe Majeſtie, Hereſie, and generally all theſe Crymes <hi>quae ſine ſociis non poſſunt facile admitti,</hi> are not excepted. Aud he aſſerts, that the Lawyers, <hi>viz. Gomeſius, &amp; Decianus,</hi> who are of another Opinion, do acknowledge, <hi>nominatum a reo damnandum non eſſe,</hi> and that they contravert only, <hi>An nominatio rei fit indicium ſufficiens ad torquendum nominatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SIr <hi>George Lockhart</hi> Repeats, and oppons the Anſwer, and the Cryme lybelled, being a Conſpiration of Treaſon, which of it's own nature is manadged, and caryed on by Secrecie and Contrivance; and which is only known to the Complices of the Treaſon, and which cannot be commited <hi>ſine ſociis,</hi> the Law of this Kingdom, and of all Nations, do allow <hi>ſocios cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> to be <hi>teſtes habites,</hi> and not only are they admitted in the caſe of ſuch Conjurations, but generally <hi>in omnibus criminibus exceptis,</hi> amongſt which the Crime of <hi>Perduellion,</hi> and leſe Majeſtie is the chief, and it is abſolutly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that Plots, and Conſpirations of Treaſon can be otherways proven, then <hi>per ſocios,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>participes criminis,</hi> and which is the common opinion of all Lawyers, as may appear by <hi>Farin. Queſt:</hi> 45. And the Authorities cited by him, and which is the inviolable practique of this Kingdom: and as to that pretence, that the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> is under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Treaſon, and has ſubmitted to His Majeſties mercy, and that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſus habetur pro convicto,</hi> it imports nothing, and infers no more then that he is <hi>ſocius criminis,</hi> and is ſtill a habil witnes, as to Conjuration of Treaſon <hi>ſocius criminis hoc ipſo,</hi> that it is acknowledged, or proven, being ſtill under the hazard of Proceſs, or condemnation, which Law regards not in regard of the ſecrecie involved in the nature of the Crime, that either witneſſes <hi>neque actu neque habitu,</hi> can be preſent, ſo that the objection amounts to no leſs then that Conjurations of Treaſon cannot at all be proven: And as to the Law cited from the <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> it imports no more then that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection <hi>regulariter procedit,</hi> in Crimes, which of their own nature are not <hi>perdifficilis probationis,</hi> and are not <hi>inter crimina excepta</hi> ſuch as the Cryme of Conſpiracy and Treaſon is.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Williom Fletcher</hi> Oppons the Objection, and Reply, and further adds, that albeit <hi>crimen loeſae Majeſtatis</hi> be reckoned <hi>inter crimina excepta,</hi> and ſo have ſome priviledge, as to the qualification of Witneſſes, yet it cannot be denyed, but there are ſome Objections competent againſt Witneſs adduced for proving Conſpiracies, and Treaſon, <hi>verbi cauſa,</hi> that a Witnes is a Capital Enemy, or that he is <hi>ſub poteſtate accuſatoris,</hi> and the Objection now pleaded, being taken complexlie, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earl of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60584:6"/>
                  <hi>Tarras</hi> is not only <hi>ſocius criminis,</hi> but alſo, that he is <hi>publico judicio reus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Crime, and that as means to procure His Majeſties ſavour, he has ſubmitted himſelf, and come in His Majeſties mercy, by an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Cryme, before the Dyet of Citation, he is obnoxious to a moſt juſt Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is <hi>ſub poteſtate,</hi> and by the ſubmiſſion, and Confeſſion, his Life and Eſtate is now in His <hi>Majeſties</hi> hands, ſo that he is not only in the caſe of <hi>a reus confeſſus,</hi> but in the caſe of a Witnes, who does abſolutely depend upon His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Advocate the Purſuer; and as a private accuſer, could not addace his own Servants to be Witneſſes, becauſe they are <hi>teſtes domeſtici,</hi> and depend upon him, ſo far leſs ought a Witnes to be adduced, who not only depends, as to his Eſtate, but as to his Life, and the Law gives a very good reaſon, and which is mentioned by <hi>Paulus, lib. 1. receptarum ſententiarum, cap. 12. parag. ult.</hi> In theſe words. <hi>deſe confeſſus, non eſt audiendus ut teſtis, ne alienam ſalutem in dubium deducat qui de ſua deſperavit;</hi> and as to the pretence that a Conjuration is a Cryme ſo occult, that it muſt either be proven by ſuch Witneſſes, or otherways the guilty perſon will eſcape. It is anſwered, that in this caſe. His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Advocate had an eaſie remedie, for he might have purſued the Pannal, before he purſued the Witneſs, and the Terror and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heaſion of the event of a Proceſs for Treaſon cannot be conſtructed otherways, then to have influence upon the Depoſition of the Witnes; and as to the Citation out of <hi>Farinacius,</hi> it is only in the caſe of <hi>ſocius cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> but when he comes to treat <hi>de teſte accuſato vel carcerato. Queſt. 56. articulo 4 to.</hi> He ſayes, <hi>Regula ſit in accuſato quod is pendent<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> adds, that it is a certain principle, that any perſon that is guilty <hi>infamia juris,</hi> cannot be a Witneſs, no more than a perſon that is Convict, and Condemned of Treaſon; and if he were Convict, and Condemned of Treaſon, he could not be a Witneſs, even in the caſe of Treaſon: ſo neither can the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> in this caſe be received a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for he being adduced a Witneſs after he received his Inditment, and confeſſed the Crime, is equivalent, as if he had been actuall Convict; and whatever may be pretended, that <hi>teſtes infames</hi> may be admitted; yet<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nota,</hi> That the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd nothing againſt <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſwood</hi> but what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd againſt himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and upon which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renew'd, the Earl was forfaulted; ſo that there could be no ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion from, his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> it was never aſſerted by any Lawyer, that a perſon Convict of Treaſon can be admitted a Witneſs.</p>

Depones theſe words were ſpoke to him by the Pannal, ſince the holding of the laſt Seſſion of this current Parliament; and before the Pannal and Commiſſar <hi>Monro</hi> went for <hi>London.</hi> Depons that after the Pannal went to <hi>London,</hi> he did give the Deponent an account by Letters, that things were in great Diſorder there, and that he hoped there would be effectual Courſes taken to remeid them. Depones that Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> did come to Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Torwoodlies</hi> Houſe in <hi>May</hi> 1683. or thereby, and brought a Letter to the Deponents Lady unſubſcribed, but the Deponent knows it was <hi>Jerviſwoods</hi> Hand-writing, who was then at <hi>London,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> told the Deponent, that things in <hi>England</hi> were in great diſorder, and like to come to a hight, and that the Countrey Party were conſidering on methods for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion. And that <hi>Archibald,</hi> ſometime Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> was to get ten thouſand pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> whereas thirty thouſand pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> was ſought by the <hi>Scotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> which was to be ſent over to <hi>Holland</hi> to provide Arms; and that the late Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was to Land with theſe Armes in the <hi>Weſt-Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Deponents Friend <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, was to be ſent over with the Money. Depones that <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> and he went to <hi>Gallowſhiels</hi> Houſe, where they met with <hi>Polwort</hi> and <hi>Gallowſhiels,</hi> and that it was talked amongſt them there, that in caſe thoſe in <hi>England</hi> ſhould riſe in Arms, that it was neceſſary in that Caſe, that ſo many as could be got on the Borders ſhould be in readineſs to deal with Straglers and ſeize upon Horſes, and that thereafter they ſhould joyn with thoſe that were in Arms on the Borders of <hi>England.</hi> Depons That in the caſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, it was ſaid, it was convenient the Caſtle of <hi>Stirling, Berwick,</hi> and ſome other Strengths ſhould be ſeiz'd upon; and it was likewiſe ſpoke amongſt them, that ſome perſons ſhould be employed to inquire what Arms was in that Countrey. Depons, That it was ſpoke then, that the beſt time for <hi>Argyle</hi> was to land in the Weſt when there was a ſtur in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or words to that purpoſe. Depons, That every one deſired another to ſpeak to ſuch particular perſons as they could truſt, by letting a word fall indirectly upon ſuppoſition, in caſe of the Riſing in <hi>England</hi> concerning the Affair for preparing of them: And that he was told by <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> thereafter, that there was a Word and Sign to be uſed amongſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſign was by looſing a Button on the Breaſt, and that the Word was Harmony. Depons, the Pannal ſpoke to the Deponent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> that he might acquaint Mr. <hi>William Veitch</hi> a forfault Traitor, who was in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he might keep himſelf cloſe, and be on his guard, leſt he ſhould be catch'd; which was ſince the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was Priſoner in the Tolbooth of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And this is the truth, as he ſhall anſwer to God. <hi>Sic ſubſcribitur,</hi>

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. Upon a letter from Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie,</hi> I came to his houſe in the morning, and he preſently led me to a Chamber, where I found Mr <hi>Robert Martin,</hi> who was lately come from <hi>London,</hi> with whom we ſtayed a little, and diſcourſed of the news, and about the preſent condition, and temper of <hi>England,</hi> and in particular of <hi>London,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> ſaid, was much irritated through ſome attemps upon their Priviledges, either as to the concern of the Sheriffs, or their Charter, but that all honeſt men were of good heart and very brisk, and after ſome general diſcourſes to this purpoſe, <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> and I left him, and walked out a little, and he told me, he was expecting the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, for he had ſent to him; and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> had a Letter to him from <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> then he told me that there were great matters in agitation at <hi>London,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> had come down with a Commiſſion from our friends there, (I do not remember he named any) but that I behoved not to expect, he would impart his Inſtructions to me, for he was to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat them only to <hi>Polwart</hi> and himſelf, (at leaſt for theſe Shyres) and they were to pitch on ſuch as they thought fit to intruſt with the affair, whereupon he aſſured me, that he had great confidence in me, and his kindneſs to me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged him to ſend for me, to acquaint me that matters were now come to a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60584:7"/>
                  <hi>criſis,</hi> and that he had reaſon to think <hi>England</hi> would ſhortly draw to Arme, and ſtand by them, till they were ſatisfied anent the Bill of Excluſion, and what other ſecurity they could propoſe for the Proteſtant Religion, and their Liberties, and that it was no project of any inconſiderable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but a deſign through the Kingdom, and that many of the fineſt men, and of the greateſt intereſt and credit there, had adjuſted almoſt every thing neceſſar for the purpoſe, and had concerted matters with our Friends there, in order to concurrence from this, and had agreed to advance Money for furniſhing Arms here, (I do not remember he told me more particulars at this time) but ſaid, <hi>Polwart</hi> would be at <hi>Gallow-ſhiels</hi> that night, and it would be neceſſar that the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I ſhould confer with him fully, on the buſineſs, about this time the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> lighted, and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> having left us for a little time, being gone to bring Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> asked me, what news, I told him of Mr. <hi>Martins</hi> being there, but that he had given me no account of the deſign of his down-coming, which perhaps he would acquaint him with, but by what I had heard from <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> I underſtood it to be, to engadge us to riſe in Arms ſhortly, whereat the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> hummed, and ſaid, he would look ere he leapt, ſuch a leap, or ſome ſuch expreſſions, preſently Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came, and the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and he retired a little, after the reading An Letter, he gave him, the Contents whereof was (as the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> informed me) only an order from <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> to deliver ſome Money to the bearer, which he had left with him, and the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> called for his Servant, and bad him bring up the Money; in the mean time, <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie</hi> asked me, if I had acquainted the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> with what he ſpoke to me, and I told him, I had let ſomething of it fall to him, but it was not to be thought, that perſons of ſenſe and quality would engadge in ſuch deſigns at random; ſo <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> ſaid, that (though Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> would not commune with us upon his Commiſſion directly) yet he thought it would be fit, we conferred, and without taking notice of his Commiſſion, diſcourſed of things upon ſuppoſitions, and as our own privat notions, abſtract from any proſpect of a preſent deſign, ſo after dinner, we four went to a Chamber, and after ſome general diſcourſes, of the diſcontents of both Kingdoms, theſe ſuppoſitions following were diſcourſed (and as I remember) Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> ſtarted them all, or the moſt part) <hi>viz.</hi> What if the countrey party in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have thoughts of going to Arms (whereof he knew nothing but only ſuppoſed ſuch a thing, for diſcourſing a little freely, and to know our ſentiments, what we thought could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected here in ſuch a caſe) would it not be expedient to have a ſettled Correſpondence betwixt that Party there and here, and might not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be ſo adjuſted, that both Kingdoms ſhould draw out in one day, and might not as many be expected to undertake in theſe Shires, and about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as would ſerve to ſurprize, and ſeize our Rulers (I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any named, but the then Chancellour and Treaſurer) and ſome to joyn with theſe on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> borders, to aſſiſt them to ſurprize <hi>Berwick,</hi> and if for that effect, any Horſe, or Dragoons, that ſhould be in the bounds might not be ſurprized, that their Horſe and Arms might be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to furniſh the Country people, and <hi>Stirling</hi> Caſtle; and if <hi>Argile</hi> ſhould at the ſame time Land in the Weſt, and raiſe that Countrey, would not theſe Meaſures contribute much to the advancement and ſecurity of the Intereſt of that Party here, ſince thereby the Government would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and ſuch ſteps would encourage all that had an inclination to the Countrey Party, to draw to them frankly, and fear many of the other ſide to act againſt them, and ſo they might have leaſure to joyn from all places; and might it not be expected, there would be as many in this Kingdom, as would be able to deal with the Forces here, at leaſt divert them from troubling <hi>England.</hi> This is the ſum, as I remember, of what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60584:8"/>
was propoſed, and diſcourſt of, though I cannot diſtinctly ſay, it was in this method, and expreſſion, nor was all moved at once, but droped now and then, as the Diſcourſe ſeem'd to give riſe to it; and though I cannot fully Re count all that was ſpoke on theſe Heads, and tell diſtinctly, what this and that man ſaid; yet I remember theſe following Anſwers were giving, and (as I judged) acquieſced to by the whole Company; and they were certainly the E. of <hi>Tarras,</hi> his ſentiments and mine, and every one that ſpoke, uſed this or ſome ſuch Precaution, that if they were concerned, or to give counſel in any ſuch caſe, (as they were not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 1. As to the ſettling a Correſpondence, it was confeſt to be very convenient for thoſe of a common Intereſt; but the preſent circumſtances of Affairs were ſuch (as we thought,) that none could be found here who was fit to mannage it, and would undertake it. 2. As to the tryſting at the ſame time, it could not be done without the devulging the Deſign to all Ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which none would undertake, except theſe already in deſperat Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and they could not have generally much influence. 3. The thing was not at all adviſeable for this Kingdom, ſince if any of <hi>Englands</hi> own meaſures miſcarried, they would not ſtur for any ſuch Truſt; and the ſpring of their motions being always at <hi>London,</hi> there might happen an interruption near the appointment, whereof theſe here could have no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous notice, and ſo might keep Tryſt, whereby they would be expoſed a prey; and if they ſhould ſubſiſt any time, or prevail (which was hardly poſſible) the multitude that muſt be imployed, are tainted with ſuch wild and unruly Principles, that if once they got the Sword in their Hands, they would never be brought to Order without a greater force to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe them; neither would any expectation of <hi>Argiles</hi> Landing, be a juſt ground for ſuch a Tryſt, conſidering the uncertainty of Sea-Voyages; and if <hi>Argile</hi> were to be the Head, undoubtedly many people would conclude that he were to be ſuſpected of private deſigns, and that reſtoring him, might lay him aſide: As alſo, that diſpair might blind his uſual prudence, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd prompt him to unſolid, and undigeſted Methods; and ſo it was to be expected, that few of the Gentry (except ſuch as he had ſpecial influence on, or ſuch as were under hard Circumſtances) could embarque with him, 4. As to the ſurpriſing Rulers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was inveigh'd againſt, as an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to be thought of amongſt Proteſtants (eſpecially when the very deſign of it was pretended, to ſecure that Religion, which taught its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to abhor and deteſt ſuch Principles as Popiſh, yea un-chriſtian) ſince it could not be effectuat without Blood-ſhed of people, ſecure in Peace, which being by all approven, Divines and Caſuiſts condemned as unlawful, and meer Aſſaſſination; it was not to be doubted, that as ſuch a practice would caſt a blot upon the whole Affair, and quite take off any pretence of Defenſive Arms, ſo it would ſcar many from joyning. Theſe things were reaſoned again and again: But I do not remember there was any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Concluſion made, but the Diſcourſe was let fall; and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> told us, if any of us had a mind for a ſuit of Armour, he could provide as many as we pleaſed, from one who had made a great many lately, to honeſt men at <hi>London,</hi> of a new faſhion, very light, and at an eaſie Rate; ſo <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> and I gave him our meaſures, E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> told he had a ſuit already; Then <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> ſaid to the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, we would meet <hi>Polwart</hi> at <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſheils,</hi> and deſired we might Commun with him, anent what we had been Diſcourſing, ſo we haſted away, that if poſſible, we might both get home that Night, it being <hi>Saturnday,</hi> and we unfurniſhed, for ſtaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> whiſpered me juſt as I was mounting (as I think) that he was not clear we ſhould commun before <hi>Gallowſhiels,</hi> for he was ſometimes too much Good-fellow, or the like; ſo the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I Rod away together, and upon the way we were both of Opinion, that the Suppoſitions we had diſcourſed of, were in effect Propoſitions, and reſolv'd,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60584:8"/>
if they were inſiſted on by <hi>Polwort,</hi> as we ſuſpected, we would adhere to the former Anſwer, and would undertake nothing in theſe methods; When we came to <hi>Gallowſheils,</hi> the Laird was abroad, and <hi>Polwort</hi> was not come, ſo we had thoughts to go away, being both damped with what had paſſed, and inclining to be free of farder medling; but the Lady would by no means hear of our going till her Husband came, who, ſhe aſſured us, was about the Doors, and ſhe having ſent to call him, he would be in preſently; yet it was ſo late ere he came, that the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have day enough to go home with; ſo <hi>Gallowſheils</hi> would not let him go, and he would not ſtay, unleſs I ſtay'd, ſo we both ſtayed, and not being reſolv'd to Diſcourſe with <hi>Gallowſheils</hi> on what paſſed, we we it to the Tavern, on pretence I might call the Baillie, and ſeek Horſes or Lime, and ſtay'd there till <hi>Polwort</hi> came (which ſeemed unknown to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſheils</hi>) then we returned to <hi>Gallowſheils</hi> Houſe, and after Supper <hi>Polwort</hi> whiſpered the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, and enquired if we had ſeen Mr. <hi>Martin;</hi> and we having told him we had, he enquired, if we were free to commun on the Affair before <hi>Gallowſheils,</hi> we told, as he thought fit, for we could truſt him; Then he whiſpered <hi>Gallonſheils,</hi> and (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood afterwards) asked if he was free to commune on matters of great Secrecy and importance with that Company, to which he aſſented, then we ſat down cloſs together, and as I remember, <hi>Polwort</hi> began the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: But ſince I am not able to follow exactly the method of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or keep the very expreſſions uſed, or repeat all that was ſpoke, or to tell diſtinctly what was every mans part of the Diſcourſe; I ſhall ſet down the Heads, and moſt remarkable Paſſages thereof, that I remember in ſome Articles following; 1. <hi>Polwort</hi> ſignified that he was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (but I do not remember he named his Informer) that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey party in <hi>England</hi> would draw to the Fields ſhortly, as he heard before <hi>Lambaſs,</hi> wherewith <hi>Gallowſheils</hi> ſeem'd viſibly ſurprized; and being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if his Heart fail'd him already, he ſaid he did love it better truly to be walking in his own Parks in Peace, and quiet, than to be medling in ſuch matters; however he aſſured the Company, that if there came any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubleſome world, he would joyn with them firmly; and the E. of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> ſaid, he wondred to hear of any ſuch Reſolution in <hi>England,</hi> for he took it for a Principle amongſt that Party there, that they ſhould make no ſtir in the Kings Life (which the whole Company owned to be their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and deſire) becauſe that might ſtrengthen the Dukes intereſt; and he ſuſpected it was the project of the Common-wealths men, with whom he believed, few <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen would joyn; and he was almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not concur in any riſing during the Kings Life, To which it was anſwered by <hi>Polwort,</hi> that he had indeed heard that principle had been generally agreed to, but it ſeem'd they found, they behoved either to do their buſineſs now, or lay aſide hopes of doing it hereafter, which might be, that if the Charter of <hi>London</hi> were let fall, they would not only loſe all ſafe opportunity of digeſting Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but a great part of their ſtrength, and he heard all things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed mutually, betwixt <hi>Monmouths</hi> Friends and the Heads of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Party; and tho he heard <hi>Monmouth</hi> was ſhy on that account, yet it was hop'd he would engage, for otherways he would be deſerted by that Party. 2. <hi>Polwort</hi> told us the ſuppoſitions above-written as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerted betwixt our friends at <hi>London,</hi> and the principal men of that Party there; ſo the E of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I renewed our former anſwers alſo above-written, and maintained them with all our vigour, wherein <hi>Gallowſheils</hi> joyned forwardly with us; and <hi>Polwort</hi> aſſerted, we went on very good grounds, and he was fully of our opinion, if things were entire but referr'd it to be conſidered, whether it were better to comply with ſome of theſe methods, tho not ſo proper and juſtifiable as were to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60584:9"/>
wiſh'd, then to diſappoint the buſineſs totally, which might be of the beſt conſequence to all the Party, yet we did not condeſcend as I remember to undertake any of theſe methods. And there was a further argument ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt the tryſting above-written, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was talked there was a day appointed in <hi>England</hi> latly in <hi>Shafisberry's</hi> time, which did not hold, ſo they were not to be relyed upon. 3. It was propoſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what methods were moſt proper in the Companies opinon for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to follow in caſe of <hi>Englands</hi> riſing, whereanent it was ſaid, that all that could be expected or deſired from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, that upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain News of <hi>Englands</hi> being in the Fields, thoſe in the Southern Shires who would own that Party, ſhould preſently riſe, and (how ſoon they could get as many conven'd as would be able to deal with ſtragling Parties, or any ſudden riſing in the Countrey) march to joyn them, and that it would be fit theſe in the Northern Shires of <hi>England</hi> waited near the Borders for ſuch, and that they had Officers tryſted there to command, and that then it would be ſeaſonable for <hi>Argile</hi> to land in the Weſt, and theſe Parties on the Borders might divert the Forces till he had time to put himſelf in a poſture. Theſe things ſeem'd to be the ſentiments of the whole Company, but were not finally determined till the opinion of others who were to be communed with by <hi>Polwort</hi> were known: And it was repreſented, there behoved not to be any wilful and obſtinate adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to our own thoughts of things, (but an mutual condeſcendance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerned,) otherwiſe it were not poſſible to bring a publick Deſign to any good iſſue. 4. All the Company ſeem'd to agree, that they ſhould undertake nothing or move in that Affair, till they had a full and certain account what <hi>England</hi> propoſed, what methods they reſolved to follow there, who were to be their Heads, and that if they deſign'd any attempt on the Kings Perſon, or overturning Monarchy, they would not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or clear to joyn: And it being here inſinuated, that the moſt they could do (at leaſt for which there could be any plauſible pretence to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) was to draw together, and without any act of Hoſtility, ſend Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to His Majeſty for redreſs of the preſent abuſes of the Government, and for obtaining ſufficient ſecurity againſt the hazard they apprehended to their Religion and Liberties. It was ſaid by <hi>Polwort</hi> that he was apt to think, that was their very deſign, for he had heard it was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by that Party in <hi>England,</hi> that if once they were in a Body, the King would be prevailed with to quite the Duke, to be tryed for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi> and acceſſion to the Popiſh Plot, and then if the King were once free from the influence of the Dukes Counſels, they were confident he might be moved to reform their Abuſes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Religion and Liberties for the future to their contentment. 5. It was reſolved, that till we got the foreſaid account from <hi>England.</hi> and were ſatisfied thereanent, and knew others here (who were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with) their Sentiements of what methods were moſt proper for us, in caſe we ſhould undertake, we ſhould not meddle further; only it was left to the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, if we thought fit to acquaint Sir <hi>William Scot</hi> younger with ſome of the matter of this Conference overly, without taking notice of our Informers, or ſuch an Conference; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to all to be enquiring (at ſuch as they had ſome truſt in) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly about the affection of our Neigbours, and what Arms there was amongſt them; that if we ſhould get an ſatisfying account, and reſolve to joyn, we might know where to ſeek Men and Arms ſuddenly: here it was ſaid by <hi>Polwort,</hi> as I think, that if the E. of <hi>Tarras, Torwoodlie, Gallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheils,</hi> and I once took Horſe, he thought the moſt part of the Weſt end of <hi>Tiviotdale</hi> and <hi>Selkirk</hi> Shire would ſoon come to us, eſpecially, when they heard <hi>England</hi> was riſen, then we tryſted to meet there againſt <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer</hi> Fair, betwixt and which the forſaid account was expected, but in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60584:9"/>
caſe it came to any of our hands ſooner, we promiſed to advertiſe the reſt, that we might meet, preſently, if the caſe required; this is the ſubſtance and ſum of what paſſed at the forſaid conference, that I can now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but I remember, I was likewiſe told theſe following particulars in privat, by <hi>Polwart,</hi> or <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> (which of them, I cannot diſtinctly tell) the day of the forſaid conference, or within a ſhort time after. 1. That <hi>Polwart</hi> keeped the correſpondence with our friends at <hi>London,</hi> I remember not poſitively of any of them that was named, to be on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue there, except my Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran, Jerviſwood,</hi> and Commiſſar <hi>Monro</hi> (for I hardly knew any of the reſt) and as I think, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſar <hi>Monro</hi> was call'd his correſpondent there. 2. That the Money to be advanced by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> partie to <hi>Scotland</hi> was ready, when Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came from <hi>London,</hi> and it was expected, that within few days after, it would be diſpatched with ſome confident to <hi>Holland,</hi> (whither by Bills, or in Caſh, I cannot ſay) it was call'd ten thouſand pound Sterlin, and was to be imployed (as I was told) by that confident, at <hi>Argyles</hi> ſight, for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms, providing Ships to tranſport them with <hi>Argyle,</hi> to the Weſt here, and ſuch other Charges. 3. That how ſoon our friends at <hi>London</hi> got notice of the ſafe arrival, of the confident forſaid, and all other things were finally concluded there (which was expected would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>June,</hi> as I remember) they would come home, and as they paſſed, would give them, or one of them, an particular account of all reſolutions taken to be communicat to the reſt, that it was not to be expected by Letters, that behoved to be under figures, and dark expreſſions, and as I remember, they were, written as it were about the <hi>Carolina</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome houſhold Furniture, as I was told, for I never remember I ſaw any Letter, either direct to <hi>London,</hi> or ſent from it on that head. 4. I was told there was a Sign, and a Word agreed on by that Party, ſo that men might know with whom they might uſe freedom, the Word, as I remember was <hi>Harmony,</hi> and the Sign, <hi>the opening two Buttons in the breaſt coat and ſhutting them preſently;</hi> this I communicat to the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> but does not mind I ever ſaw it uſed, except when I viſited <hi>Park-Hay</hi> here in Town, about the end of <hi>June;</hi> we diſcourſing a little freely, he asked if I had the Word and Sign of the <hi>Carolina</hi> men, and I having given them, he ſaid ſomething to this purpoſe, that he was afraid that the <hi>Carolina</hi> buſineſs did not go well, for there had been ſome of the Managers expected here (as I think he named <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> or Commiſſar <hi>Monro</hi>) theſe eight days paſt, but there was none come, nor could he learn that any of their Friends had heard from them for ſeveral Poſts. <hi>Polwart, Torwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> and I met at <hi>Gallowſheils,</hi> on Midſummer Fair, but I mind nothing paſſed but private whiſperings. Dated <hi>September</hi> 15. 1684. and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus,</p>

and of a Party in <hi>England,</hi> who would ſecure, or ſeize the King or Duke, and that if any ſhould riſe in Arms to Defend them, or to reſcue the King and Duke: There was another Party who would riſe in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, it was propoſed, that ſome Countrey men ſhould be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, to try their Reſolutions, and that the Reſolutions, of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be told them, to ſee if they would concur. But the Deponent does not remember that this propoſition was approven, or undertaken to be done by any preſent; nor does he remember who manag'd the Diſcourſe. It was likewiſe propos'd, to ſeize the Officers of State, eſpecially the Chancellour and Theſaurer, and the ſaid, Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> was to come to the Weſt from <hi>England,</hi> for advancement of the Deſign; and that the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was to Land in the Weſt Highlands, and to raiſe that Countrey. Of theſe matters, all theſe who were preſent Diſcourſed, as of an Affair that they were agitating, and wherein themſelves were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned, though at that time they did not conclude what their carriage ſhould be; The reaſon why the Deponent cannot be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars is, becauſe he was ſometimes going out, and ſometimes walking up and down the Room; and though the Deponent cannot be poſitive of the very words; yet he is poſitive they were either theſe Words, or Words to that purpoſe. <hi>Sic ſubſcribitur,</hi>

The Deponent remembers not the names of the places.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60584:11"/>
The Deponent ſpoke to the Lord <hi>Stairs;</hi> but cannot be poſitive that he nam'd the Affair to him, but found him ſhy: but the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> told him, he thought <hi>Stairs</hi> might be gain'd to them: And that the Earl of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun</hi> being a man of good Reaſon, and diſobliged, would have great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Countrey, and recommended the Deponent to Major <hi>Holms</hi> with whom the Deponent had ſome acquaintance before, and had brought over a Letter from him to the Earl of <hi>Argyle;</hi> but the Deponent had not then communicate any thing to the ſaid <hi>Holms, James Steuart</hi> laid down a way of correſpondence by Cyphers and falſe Names, and ſent them over to <hi>Holms,</hi> and the Deponent, for their uſe (which Cyphers and Names, are now in the hands of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Officers, as the Deponent ſuppoſes,) and did deſire the Deponent earneſtly to propoſe the 30000. pound <hi>Sterling</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovenamed to the party in <hi>England,</hi> and did not propoſe any leſs; for as the Earl told the Deponent, he had particularly calculate the Expence for Arms, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>James Steuart</hi> ſaid, that if ſome leſs could be had, the Earl would content himſelf, if better might not be; but the Earl always ſaid, that there was nothing to be done without the body of Horſe and Dragoons above-mentioned. During the time of the Deponent his abode in <hi>Holland,</hi> tho he had ſeveral Letters from <hi>Shepard,</hi> yet there was no ſatisfactory account, till ſome time after the Deponent parted from the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and was making for a Ship at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to tranſport himſelf to <hi>England. James Steuart</hi> wrot to him that there was hopes of the Money. The next day after the Deponent came to <hi>England,</hi> he met with Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> who, with Commiſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> and <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> was at <hi>London</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came over; and depons, that he knows not the account of their coming, more then for the perfecting the Tranſaction about <hi>Carolina:</hi> and having acquainted Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> with the Earls demands of the 30000 pound <hi>Sterling</hi> and the 1000. Horſe and Dragoons, Sir <hi>John</hi> carried him to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> to whom the Deponent propoſed the affair, but being an abſolute Stranger to the Deponent, had no return from him at that time; but afterwards having met him accidently at Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> houſe, where he the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had come to ſpeak to <hi>Shepard</hi> about the Money above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the Deponent. The Deponent (when they were done ſpeaking) deſired to ſpeak to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did, and having reiterate the former Propoſition for 30000. pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> and the 1000. Horſe and Dragoons, he the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> told the Deponent, they could not get ſo much raiſed at the time, but if they had 10000. pound to begin, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would ſoon be brought to more; butas for the 1000. Horſe and Dragoons, he could ſay nothing at the preſent, for that behoved to be concerted upon the Borders. The Deponent made the ſame propoſal to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who was much concerned in the Affair, and zealous for the promoving of it. This Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> had in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> before, as the Deponent remembers in a Converſation with the Deponent in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> or the Street ſomewhere thereabout, ſaid, that for the ſaving of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood, it would be neceſſary to cut off a few, inſinuating the King and Duke, but cannot be poſitive whether he named them or not, to which the Deponent ſaid, that's work for our wild People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience does not ſerve me for ſuch things; after which the Deponent had never any particular diſcourſe with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> as to that matter; but as to the other Affair, <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told the Deponent that he was doing what he could to get it effectuate, as particularly that he ſpoke to one Major <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> who is not of the Deponent his acquaintance. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> blamed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Sidney,</hi> as driving deſigns of his own. The Deponent met twice or thrice with the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran, Jerviſwood,</hi> Commiſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> the two <hi>Ceſſnocks, Mongomery</hi> of <hi>Landſhaw,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> where they diſcourſed of Money to be ſent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> in order to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60584:12"/>
on the Affair, and tho he cannot be poſitive the Affair was named, yet it was underſtood by himſelf, and as he conceives by all preſent, to be for riſing in Arms, for rectifying the Government. Commiſſary <hi>Monro,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the two <hi>Ceſſnocks</hi> were againſt medling with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe they judged them men that would talk, and would not do, but were more inclined to do ſomething by themſelves, if it could be done. The Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> thought every thing hazardous, and therefore the Deponent cannot ſay he was poſitive in any thing, but was moſt inclined to have the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to head them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which no particular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was laid down. <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> the Deponent, and Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> were for taking Money at one of theſe Meetings. It was reſolved, that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk to the Juſtice Court ſhould be ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to deſire their Friends to hinder the Countrey from Riſing, or taking raſh Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the account of the Council, till they ſhould ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how matters went in <hi>England.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charges of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Meeting, and was directed to the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie,</hi> who ſent back word that it would not be found ſo eaſie a matter to get the Gentrie of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur: But afterwards in a Letter to Commiſſar <hi>Monro, Polwart</hi> wrote that the Countrey was readier to concur then they had imagined, or ſomething to that purpoſe. The Deponent, as above-ſaid, having brought over a Key from <hi>Holland,</hi> to ſerve himſelf and Major <hi>Holms:</hi> he remembers not that ever he had an axact Copy of it, but that ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other keeped it, and ſo it chanced to be in his cuſtody when a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> came to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating, that he would joyn with the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and follow his meaſures, or obey his Directions. This Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi> thought fit to communicate to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and for the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it was brought to the Deponent, and he gave the Key to Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> who as the Deponent, was informed, was to give it and the Letter to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and he to ſhew it to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> but what was done in it, the Deponent knows not. The Deponent heard the Deſign of Killing the King and Duke, from Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the Deponent ſome were full upon it. The Deponent heard that <hi>Aron Smith</hi> was ſent by thoſe in <hi>England</hi> to call Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> on the account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> but that he does not know <hi>Aron Smith,</hi> nor any more of that matter, not being concerned it it. <hi>Shepard</hi> named young <hi>Hamden</hi> frequently as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe Matters.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>William Carſtares</hi> being again Examined, adheres to his former Depoſition, in all the parts of it, and Depones he knows of no Correſpondence betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> except by <hi>Martin</hi> before named; for thoſe Gentlemen to whom he was ſent, were left to follow their own Methods. <hi>Veitch</hi> ſometimes, as the Deponent remembers, ſtayed ſometimes an <hi>Nicolſon,</hi> Stabler's Houſe, at <hi>London-wall;</hi> ſometimes with one Widow <hi>Hardcaſtle</hi> in <hi>More-fields.</hi> The Deponent did Communicate the Deſign on foot to Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffil,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Meed,</hi> at <hi>Stepney,</hi> who all concurred in the promoting of it, and were deſirous it ſhould take effect; and to one Mr. <hi>Freth</hi> in the Temple, Councellor at Law, who ſaid that he would ſee what he could do in reference to the Money, but there having gone a Report, that there was no Money, to be raiſed, he did nothing in it; nor does the Deponent think him any more concerned in the Affair. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> frequently ſpoke to the Deponent of the Money to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60584:12"/>
be ſent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> whether it was got or not, but the Deponent uſed no freedom with him in the Affair. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did inſinuate once, that the Lords were not inclined to the thing, and that before, they would ſee what they could do in the City.

               <p>YOu have now a Conſpiracy againſt His <hi>Mejeſties</hi> Sacred Perſon, and Royal Government, ſo fully diſcover'd, that they muſt want Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as well as Loyalty, who do not believe the Diſcovery; and they muſt be enemies to ſincerity, as well as to the King, who do not acknowledge it. Beſide, that the Councils of all the three Nations, thought the proof ſufficient, for Indicting a General Thankſgiving through all theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that the Judges of <hi>England</hi> thought the ſame ſtrong enough to infer Forefaulture of Life and Eſtate, againſt ſome of all Ranks there; you have a Diſcovery made here from the Late E. of <hi>Argiles</hi> own Letters, and the Confeſſion of his own Emiſſaries, the two ſureſt proofs that Law ever invented, or the nature of Humane Affairs can allow; and I am this day to add to all this, a new Sort of Proofs in the Proceſs that I now lead againſt this Pannal, from the Confeſſions of Noblemen and Gentlemen, who have been engaged in this wicked Conſpiracy; and who from a ſenſe of their Guilt, are content freely to Depoſe againſt their neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their moſt intimate Friend, in which having thus cleared to you, that there was really ſuch a Conſpiracy, I ſhall, in the next place, proceed to prove this Pannals Acceſſion to it.</p>
               <p>It cannot be imagined, that we would willingly involve our Countrey men in it, without a Conviction ſtronger then our kindneſs to <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor did His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Servants accuſe this Pannal, without the opinion of the ableſt Lawyers of the Kingdom, who did, with them concur, to think that there was not the leaſt occaſion of doubting left, to the moſt indifferent Inqueiſt of his guilt, after they had ſeriouſly, and with reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, read over, and pondered the probation now laid before you.</p>
               <p>The Perſon accuſed of acceſſion to this Cryme is the Ring-leader of all thoſe, who in this Kingdom concurr'd with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſpirators, as you may ſee by the Teſtimonies of all who have Depoſed; and it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed fit and juſt to begin with the moſt guilty, ſo that if he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, there ſhould no man be puniſhed for this Conſpiracie; all the noiſe we have heard of it, is but a Cheat, the Kings Judges have been Murderers, all the Witneſſes have been Knaves, and ſuch as dyed for it have been Martyrs.</p>
               <p>The Acceſſion charged on the Pannal, is not an accidental eſcape, nor is it proved by Witneſſes, who can be ſuſpected of unkindnes to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or his Cauſe, for it is a long tract of a continued deſign, gone about with the greateſt deliberation and concern imaginable, and proved by his neareſt Relations, and perſons ſo deeply engadged in that Cauſe, (for which he Suffers,) that they were content with him to venture their Lives and Fortunes in that quarrel. He is not accuſed of a Crime that can amount only to a ſingle Murder, though that be a dreadful Cryme, but a Rebellion, which was to draw upon us a Civil War, that Murder of Murders, in which hundreths of thouſands were to fall; and to Crown all, he was to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to be the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of a Rebellion, in which one of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60584:14"/>
firſt ſteps was to kill His Sacred <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> and his Royal Brother; and one of the chief Witneſſes which I have led againſt him, is <hi>Bourn,</hi> which <hi>Bourn</hi> confeſſed that he was to kill the King, and who confeſſes the Pannal ſat up ſeveral nights with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> the other contriver of the Kings Murder, and ſo familiar was he with him, that <hi>Bourn</hi> depons, that the ſaid Pannal had been with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> at the drawing of the <hi>manifeſto,</hi> whereby he was not only to be an Actor, but to be the Juſtifier of that horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie: and therefore <hi>Bourns</hi> depons, that <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> (the beſt Judge in that caſe) looked upon him as the chief man, next to <hi>Argyle;</hi> But becauſe no man is preſumed to go to ſuch a hight, without previous inclination and motives, I ſhall to convince you, that this Gentleman was very capable of all that was lybelled againſt him, remember you, that he is Nephew, and Son in Law to the late <hi>Wariſtoun,</hi> bred up in his Family and under his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; about the time of this Plot it was undenyably known, and is now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, by two preſent Witneſſes, the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> that he thought himſelf deſperat, knowing himſelf to be guilty of Treaſon by <hi>Blackwoods</hi> Caſe; and as it's preſumable, that a man that's guilty of one point of Treaſon, will commit another; ſo when a man is deſperat as to his Life and Fortune, he is capable of any thing; he was likewiſe animated to commit this Cryme, by the intelligence he had that there was a Plot in <hi>England,</hi> carryed on by men of ſo great Parts, Fortune and Influence, and by the too probable hopes, that they would get all the Weſtern Shires to joyn with them here, becauſe of the common guilt, in which they had engadged themſelves, by their late extravagances, they made an account of an aſſiſtance of twenty thouſand men; and by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaughs</hi> Depoſition, that theſe Gentlemen expected the concurſe of the Southern-Shires; and thus, I am to prove to you a Cryme, which is in it ſelf, ſo probable and liklie, that it ſhould need little probation, tho I have adduced for your conviction ſufficient evidences, albeit the Cryme were in it ſelf very unliklie.</p>
               <p>The Crymes which I hope I have proved, are, That <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> the Pannal tranſacted for Money to the late Earl of <hi>Argyl,</hi> a declared Traitor. 2. That he deſigned to raiſe a Rebellion. 3. That he intercommuned with the Earl of <hi>Argyl</hi> and Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi> declared Traitors. 4. That he was preſent, where it was treated either that <hi>Argyle</hi> ſhould have Money from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and aſſiſtance from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or that a Rebellion ſhould be raiſed, and that he did not reveal the ſamine; and all theſe being ſound relevant <hi>ſeparation</hi> it is ſufficient for me to have proved any one of them. And if a Gentleman was lately ſound guilty of High-Treaſon, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all the Lords of Seſſion, for not revealing, that Sir <hi>John Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chran</hi> ſought fifty pound <hi>Sterling</hi> from him, though he refuſed the ſame, and tho he believed, it was ſought for a charitable ſubſiſtance to, preſerve him from ſtarving; what deſerves this Pannal, who ſought thirty thouſand pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> to buy him Arms, to invade his Native Countrey?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> was deſigning to carry on a Rebellion, or at leaſt was acceſſory, or (as our Law terms it) was <hi>Art and Part</hi> thereof, is clearly prov'd; but that in this occult and hidden Crime, which uſes not to be prov'd by clear witneſſes; I may lead you thorow all the ſteps of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, which like the links of a Chain, hang upon one another. You will be pleaſed to conſider, that 1. It is proved that he deſired a blind Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go to <hi>England,</hi> not to manage the aſſairs of the <hi>Carolina</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as he confeſs'd, <hi>but to puſh the People of</hi> England <hi>to do ſomething for themſelves, becauſe they did only talk and not do;</hi> and what he would have them to do, appears too clearly, becauſe he tells the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> it was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60584:14"/>
probable, <hi>that if the King were briskly put to it by the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>he would conſent to exclude the Duke from the Succeſſion:</hi> here is not only a Treaſonable Deſign, (though a deſign be ſufficient in Treaſon) but here are expreſs acts of Treaſon proved, <hi>viz.</hi> The treating with the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> upon this deſign, the ſettling a Correſpondence with him for the proſecution of it, and the writing Letters from <hi>London</hi> to him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and the ſending down Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> to compleat it by a general Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; As he deſign'd to puſh on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo he proſecutes cloſely <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Deſign upon all occaſions. On the Road he complains cunningly and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that our Lives, Laws and Liberties, and the Proteſtant Religion were in danger, the ſtile and method of all ſuch as deſign to Rebel; after he arrives at <hi>London,</hi> he engages the Conſpirators there to aſſiſt the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> a declar'd Traitor, with Money to buy Arms; this was indeed to puſh the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to do the moſt dangerous things by the moſt dangerous man, and in the moſt dangerous methods. He enters alſo in a ſtrict Correſpondence with <hi>Ferguſon</hi> the Contriver, with <hi>Shepard</hi> the Theſaurer, and <hi>Carſtares</hi> the Chaplain of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander Monro</hi> another preſent Witneſs, proves that he argued with him, that it was neceſſary to give <hi>Argile</hi> Money expreſsly for carrying on the Rebellion, and that they did meet at <hi>Jerviſwoods</hi> Chamber where this was ſpoke of, and from which Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> was ſent to their Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> to know what they would do; and though the ſilly caution was, that they ſent him to prevent their riſing, yet a man muſt renounce common ſenſe, not to ſee that the deſign was to incite them to Rebellion, and to prevent only their doing any thing in this rebellious deſign, by which the, might loſe themſelves in a too early and abortive Inſurrection here, till things were ready in <hi>England.</hi> For, 1. This Commiſſion was given him in a place, and by a Company who had been themſelves treating immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before of ſending Money to the late E. of <hi>Argile</hi> to buy Arms, and certainly thoſe Arms were to be bought for Men, and not for a Magazine. 2. They were treating how many Men could be raiſed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 3. <hi>Carſtares</hi> Depoſition bears, that <hi>Martin</hi> was ſent to hinder raſh Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till they ſaw how Matters went in <hi>England,</hi> and the return to their Embaſſy bore, that it would not be an eaſie matter to get the Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur; but afterwards better hopes of their riſing was given, which could not have been, if the true Commiſſion had not been to raiſe <hi>Scotland.</hi> 4. That Sir <hi>John Cochran</hi> made a Speech to that purpoſe, is expreſsly prov'd, and that <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe, is prov'd by a neceſſary conſequence; for ſince it's prov'd that he ſpoke, and that he did not ſpeak againſt it, it muſt neceſſarily follow that he ſpoke for it, though the Witneſs is ſo cautious, that he cannot condeſcend upon the words now after ſo long a time; and it is againſt Senſe to think, that <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſwood</hi> who in privat preſs'd the ſame ſo much upon Commiſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> and who was the Deacon-Conveener here, and who, as Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> their Envoy declared, was the perſon who was to be ſent for the Arms, ſhould not himſelf have been the moſt forward man in that Deſign, but above all <hi>exitus acta probat,</hi> this Commiſſioner, (who being a meer Servant, durſt not have propoſed any thing from himſelf, being a mean Perſon, and being one, who, as the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> depoſes, would ſay nothing, but what was in his Paper:) does expreſly declare, that he came from <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> and others; and in the meeting with him, a Rebellion is actually formed, and it is reſolved, they ſhould ſeize the King's Officers of State, Gariſons, and Forces, and that they ſhould joyn with the late E. of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and put their own Forces in a condition to joyn with theſe Forces that were to come from <hi>England,</hi> and they gave a Sign, and a Word, which uſes only to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60584:15"/>
be done in actual War; So here is Treaſon clearly prov'd, by two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Witneſſes, from the firſt Deſign to it's laſt perfection.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be objected, that they are not concurring Witneſſes, but <hi>teſtes ſingulares</hi> upon ſeparat Acts, for in reiterable Crimes, Witneſſes depoſing upon different Acts; do prove if the deeds tend to the ſame end; as for inſtance, if one Witnes ſhould depoſe, that they ſaw a Traitor ſit in a Council of War, in one place, and in another place, they ſaw him in Arms, or that one ſaw him aſſiſt at a Proclamation in one place, and ſaw him in Arms in another; or that one ſaw him writ a Treaſonable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and another ſaw him uſe it; Theſe Witneſſes are ſtill conſidered as conteſtes, or concurring Witneſſes, and ten or twelve Inqueiſts have ſo found, and upon their Verdict, Rebells have been lately hang'd. The learn'd Judges of <hi>England</hi> being all met together did expreſly find, that one Witnes proving, that A. B. ſaid, that he was going to buy a Knife to kill the King, and another depoſing, that he ſaw him buy a Knife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling for what, that theſe two Witneſſes were conteſtes, and prov'd ſufficiently the Cryme of Treaſon, yet there the one Witnes, prov'd only a remote Deſign, and the other an Act, which was indifferent of it's own nature, and became only Treaſonable by the Connexion; But no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ever Depoſed upon things ſo coherent, and ſo connected together, as theſe do, for they depoſe ſtill upon the ſame perſon, carrying on the ſame Deſign of a Rebellion; as to which, in one place, he is exciting his own Nephew, and telling him his Reſolutions, and ſettling a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, at another time, he preſſes Commiſſar <hi>Monro</hi> to the ſame Rebellion. At a third, He holds a meeting at his own Chamber, and ſpeaks concerning it, and from that meeting, he ſends a Truſty, who formes the Rebellion. Beſides all this, tho two Witneſſes be ſufficient, I have adduced Mr. <hi>William Carſtares</hi> Chief Conſpirator, and who choos'd rather to ſuffer violent Torture, than to diſcloſe it, he likewiſe Depoſes upon all theſe ſteps, and connects them together, and this his Depoſition is twice reiterated, upon Oath, after much premeditation. And I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adduce two Depoſitions taken upon Oath, by Sir <hi>Leolin Jenkins,</hi> who was impower'd by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and at the command of the King, and the Council of <hi>England,</hi> upon a Letter from His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State here, In which Depoſition, <hi>Shepard,</hi> one of the Witneſſes, depoſes, that <hi>Baillie</hi> came frequently to him, and deſired him to advance the Money, <hi>and lamented the delays,</hi> and that there was ſo little to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; and who ſhould be better believed then one who was his own Truſtie, and a Perſon who was able to advance ſo great a Sum; <hi>Bourn,</hi> another of the Witneſſes, Depoſes, that <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told him, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpoke frequently to him concerning the ſame Money, and that he ſat up ſeveral nights with <hi>Ferguſon</hi> upon the ſaid Conſpiracy; and who ſhould be better believed then <hi>Ferguſons</hi> confident, and one who was ſo far truſted in the whole affair, that he was to take away that Sacred Life, which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has preſerv'd by ſo many Miracles.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe three Depoſitions, you have heard it objected, that <hi>non teſtimonia ſed teſtes probant,</hi> eſpecially by our Law, in which, by an expreſs Act of Parliament, no Probation is to be led, but in preſence of the Aſſiſe and Pannal. To which it is anſwered, that theſe Depoſitions are not meer Teſtimonies; for I call a Teſtimony, a voluntar Declaration, emitted without an Oath, and a Judge; but theſe Depoſitions are taken under the awe of an Oath, and by the direction of a Judge. 2. <hi>Shepard</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the Pannal himſelf, and he had nothing to ſay againſt him; whereas the great thing that can be objected againſt Teſtimonies (and by our Statute eſpecially) is that if the Party who emits the Teſtimony had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60584:15"/>
been confronted with the Pannal; the impreſſion of ſeeing a perſon that was to die, by his Depoſition, would have made him afraid to Depoſe laxly; and the Pannal likewiſe might, by propoſing Interrogators and Queſtions, have cleared himſelf, and ſatisfi'd the Judges in many things Depos'd againſt him: But ſo it is that Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> having been confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Pannal, before the King Himſelf, who is as far above other Judges, in His Reaſon and Juſtice, as He is in His Power and Authority; He Depoſes that the Pannal was the chief Mannager of this Conſpiracy, next to <hi>Argile,</hi> and that he was ſo paſſionate to have this Money to buy Arms, that he lamented the delays; and can it be imagined that Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> whom he truſted with his Life and his Fourtune, and whom all their Party truſted with their Caſh, would have Depos'd any thing againſt him that was not true, eſpecially when he knew that what he was to Depoſe, was to take away his Life and his Fortune; or that if the Pannal had been innocent, he would not when he was confronted with Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> before the King Himſelf, have roar'd againſt Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> if he had not been conſcious to his own Guilt. There is a ſurpriſe in innocence, which makes the innocent exclaim, and it inſpires men with a courage, which enables them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoſe who Depoſe falſly againſt them; and in what occaſion could either of theſe have appear'd, more than in this, wherein this Gentleman was charg'd to have Conſpir'd with the greateſt of Raſcals, againſt the beſt of Princes; and that too in preſence of the Prince himſelf, againſt whom he had Conſpir'd; but Guilt ſtupifies indeed, and it did never more than in this Gentlemans Caſe, whoſe ſilence was a more convincing Witneſs than Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> could be. Mr. <hi>Carſtares</hi> likewiſe knew when he was to Depone, that his Depoſition was to be uſed againſt <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> and he ſtood more in awe of his love to his Friend, than of the fear of the Torture, and hazarded rather to die for <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> than that <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> ſhould die by him: How can it then be imagin'd, that if this man had ſeen <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> in his Tryal, it would have altered his Depoſition; or that this kindneſs, which we all admir'd in him would have ſuffer'd him to forget any thing in his Depoſition, which might have been advantageous in the leaſt to his Friend: And they underſtand ill this hight of Friendſhip, who think that it would not have been more nice and careful, than any Advocate could have been: and if <hi>Caſtares</hi> had forgot at one time, would he not have ſupplyed it at another; but eſpecially at this laſt time, when he knew his Friend was already brought upon his Tryal: and that this renew'd Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was yet a further confirmation of what was ſaid againſt him; and albeit the Kings Servants were forced to engage, that <hi>Carſtares</hi> himſelf ſhould not be made uſe of as a Witneſs againſt <hi>Jerviſwood;</hi> yet I think this kind ſcrupuloſity in <hi>Carſtares</hi> for <hi>Jerviſwood,</hi> ſhould convince you more than twenty ſuſpect, nay than even indifferent Witneſſes; nor can it be imagined, that the one of theſe Witneſſes; would not have been as much afraid of God, and his Oath at <hi>London,</hi> as at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and the other in the Council Chamber in the Forenoon, as in the Juſtice-Court in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>3. The Statute founded on, does not diſcharge the producing of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies otherways than after the Jury is incloſs'd; for then indeed they might be dangerous, becauſe the party could not object againſt them: But ſince the Statute only diſcharges to produce Writ, or Witneſſes, after the Jury is inclos'd; it ſeems clearly to inſinuat, that they ought to prove when they are produc'd in preſence of the Party himſelf, as now they are. And though the Civil Law did not allow their Judges to believe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, becauſe they were confin'd to obſerve ſtrict Law; yet it does not from that follow; that our Juries, whom the Law allows to be a Law to themſelves, and to be confin'd by no Rule, but their Conſcience, may not truſt intirely to the Depoſitions of Witneſſes, though not taken before
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60584:16"/>
themſelves, when they know that the Witneſſes, by whom, and the Judges, before whom theſe Depoſitions were emited, are perſons beyond all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in our caſe. But yet for all this, I produce theſe Teſtimonies, as Adminicles here only to connect the Depoſitions of the preſent Witneſſes, and not to be equivalent to Witneſſes in this legal Proceſs; albeit, as to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the conviction of mankind, they are ſtronger than any ordinary Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>When you, my Lords and Gentlemen, remember that it is not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of a privat party, that accuſes in this caſe; and that even in privat Crimes, ſuch as Forgery, or the murder of Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many Juries here have proceeded upon meer preſumptions, and that even <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> founded his illuſtrious Deciſion, approv'd by God Almighty, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd aſſertion of a mother; I hope ye will think two Friends Depoſing, as preſent Witneſſes, adminiculated and connected by the Depoſitions of others, though abſent; ſhould beget in you an intire belief, eſpecially againſt a Pannal, who has been always known to incline this way, and who, though he was deſired in the Tolbooth to vindicate himſelf from thoſe Crimes, would not ſay any thing in his own defence, and though he offers to clear himſelf of his acceſſion to the Kings murder, yet ſayes nothing to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Conſpiracy entered into with the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> for invading his Native Countrey, which is all that I here Charge upon him, and which he inclines to Juſtifie, as a neceſſary mean for redreſſing Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; I muſt therefore remember you, that an Inqueſt of very worthy Gentlemen did find <hi>Rathillet</hi> guilty, tho there was but one Witneſs led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, becauſe when he was put to it, he did not deny his acceſſion: And two Rogues were found guilty in the late Circuit at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> for having murdered a Gentleman of the Guard, though no man ſaw them kill him; but the murderers having been purſued, they run to the place out of which the Pannals then accuſed were taken, none having ſeen the face of the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aweys; and the Pannals being accus'd: and preſs'd to deny the acceſſion, ſhun'd to diſown the Guilt, but deſired it might be proved againſt them. This may convince you that there are Proofs which are ſtronger then Witneſſes; and I am ſure that there were never more proving Witneſſes then in this caſe, nor were the Depoſitions of Witneſſes ever more ſtrongly adminiculated. Remember the danger likewiſe of emboldening Conſpiracies againſt the Kings Sacred Life, and of encouraging a Civil War, wherein your ſelves and your Poſterity may bleed, by making the leaſt difficulty to find a man Guilty by the ſtrongeſt Proofs that ever were adduced in ſo latent a Crime as a Conſpiracy is. And I do juſtly conclude, that whoever denys that a Conſpiracy can be thus prov'd, does let all the World ſee that he inclines that Conſpiracies ſhould be encouraged and allow'd. Our Age is ſo far from needing ſuch Encouragements, that on the other hand in this, as in all other Crimes, becauſe the Guilt grows frequent and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the Probation ſhould therefore be made the more eaſie, tho in this Caſe the King needs as little deſire your Favour, as fear your Juſtice. And I have inſiſted ſo much upon this Probation, rather to convince the World of the Conſpiracy, than you that this Conſpirator is Guilty.</p>
