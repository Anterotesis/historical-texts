         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION.
BY
The Major General and Council of Officers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> concerning their late Actings there, and for
the Tryal of ſuch Officers and Souldiers as finde themſelves agrieved for being laid aſide.</head>
            <p>FEw Men in this Nation but have known, and few honeſt men but have lamented the ſtrange proceedings of thoſe lately in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
here, who by caſting out of the Army ſeveral eminent and faithful Officers without ſo much as hearing them; and filling up
their rooms for the moſt part with factious ſpirits, Principled againſt Magiſtracy and Miniſtry; gave us but too much cauſe to
believe, ſo ill a way led to a worſe end. But not being able ſo much as to imagine, theſe courſes were taken to bring about that
horrid Deſign which ſince we have had but too much reaſon to believe theſe Injuſtices were ſome foundations of; We eſteem it
our duty with patience to ſubmit, becauſe the Parliament was ſitting, to whoſe Authority and Juſtice theſe proceedings, as we were aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were to be preſented. But ſoon after we underſtood of thoſe ſinful and unparallel'd Actings of a Factious part of the Army in <hi>England,</hi>
who not only contrary to the Laws of God and Man, but even contrary to their own renewed and voluntary Engagements, by force inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the ſitting of the Parliament; and adding iniquity to iniquity, Declared ſome of their Laws to be null and void to all intents and
purpoſes, a preſumption and crime which never any but themſelves durſt be guilty of, and in which, as much as in them lay, they cut up, as
it were by the very roots, all thoſe precious Rights, which with ſo much Bloud and Treaſure had been ſo long and through mercy ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
contended for; whereby we too ſoon and too evidently ſound, That the Parliaments Name and Authority was but made uſe of, to
eject ſuch who they knew would be obedient thereunto: By which courſe having freed the Army of ſuch, they freed all others from the fear
of the Parliament by diſſolving it, as much as in them lay, who had they ſtill ſate, they knew would puniſh their injuſtice, though they could
not prevent it. How guilty herein thoſe lately in Authority in this Nation, and others, have been, to omit the enumerating of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars, may appear by their having been ſo far from declaring againſt, and oppoſing thoſe ruinous Actings, that they on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
not only ſecretly, but openly promoted and encouraged ſuch who againſt an expreſs Act of Parliament in that behalf, did own the
L. General <hi>Fleetwood</hi> for Commander in chief of the Armies in theſe three Nations, and advanced, as much as in them lay, the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſending unto <hi>London,</hi> of two out of each Regiment, to ſubvert the Authority of Parliament, and introduce a new Government, which
in Name only ſhould be Civil, but in Fact and Power ſhould be intirely Military: Nor yet contented with all this (for guilt neither ever is,
nor ever thinks it ſelf ſecure) Orders were actually iſſued for ſecuring and diſarming all that were diſſatisfied with ſuch Proceedings: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
not only a ſlavery was entailed upon us, but even we were deſignedly deprived of all viſible means of ever caſting it off. Being therefore
invited by the higheſt Call of Duty and Neceſſity, we reſolved with the hazard of our lives and eſtates, to reſtore the Authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and to recover thoſe Rights which are of too much value to be tamely loſt. The juſtice and neceſſity of this undertaking was ſo
deeply imprinted on the hearts of many Officers and Souldiers of this Army, that (through the mercy of God) without bloud, we may ſay,
<hi>The ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped:</hi> Men muſt ſay, <hi>It is wonderful in our eyes;</hi> and Chriſtians will ſay, <hi>It is the Lords doing:</hi> It ſeeming to
be <hi>a day of Gods power, the people are ſo willing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next care and duty after the recovery of this Army for the Parliament, was, to put it into ſuch Hands, as we had good cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
by paſt and preſent Actings, would preſerve it for their ſervice; for the accompliſhing whereof, We have been neceſſitated, to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
many Officers, and placed others, qualified as aboveſaid, in their room, till the Parliaments pleaſure were known. In the laying aſide
any Officers, this Rule hath been obſerved, an aſſurance that he had ſubſcribed to the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s being Commander in Chief of the
three Armies; contrary to an expreſs Act of Parliament in that behalf; or had aſſiſted at, or promoted the Election of Two out of each
Regiment, to be ſent to <hi>London,</hi> for the introduction of a new Government, and conſequently, the deſtruction of the Parliaments Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and though none have ben put by, that were not within one of theſe Qualifications, yet all that came under them have not been diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
a difference being put between thoſe that made the ſtream, and ſuch who through inadvertancie did ſwim down in it, and ſince by
their activeneſs for the Parliament, have given good proof of their Repentance for the fault. Thoſe that were guilty within the above-ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Rules, were too many to admit them to a Regular Tryal by the Rules of War, before the Army was firſt put into faithful Hands; ſince
to have made thoſe Judges of guilt, which were participants in it, might have rather proved a ſure means to have the innocent condemned,
then the nocent; and to eject any, without preſcribing a known way for their vindication, if they thought themſelves injur'd, were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to act an Injuſtice in it ſelf, but even that Injuſtice which was ſo lately practiced here, and which we our ſelves (with ſo much cauſe) have
declared againſt. To accord therefore this evil, It is hereby declared, That a Court Martial is eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Head-Quarters, for the
Hearing and Determining the Caſes of all Field-Officers and Captains, which ſhall think themſelves injur'd by being laid aſide: And for
the ſame end, Orders are iſſuing out for Court-Martials to be held in each County, for the inferior Officers and private Souldiers; unto
which reſpective places, ſuch as are conſcious of their not having acted againſt the Parliament, our onely General, may apply themſelves
for Redreſs, where they ſhall be judged according to the uſual Rules and Diſcipline of War. Provided that by or before the 24 day of
<hi>March.</hi> next after the publication hereof, they give in their Names, and ſignifie their deſires to be tryed accordingly; and no Officer who is
put into the Room of him that is to be tried, ſhall ſit as Judge upon that Officer whoſe command he at preſent enjoys. Thoſe to be heard
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> are to give in their deſire thereof to Dr. <hi>Ralph King,</hi> appointed Judge-Advocate; Thoſe to be heard in the Countrey, are to give
in their Deſire to the Chief Officer reſpectively in each County.</p>
