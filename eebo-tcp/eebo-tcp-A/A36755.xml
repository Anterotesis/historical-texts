            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Spoken by Major Mohun.</head>
            <l>POets in Prologues (to cajole the Age)</l>
            <l>Have spent such stocks of Wit upon the Stage,</l>
            <l>That 'tis become the hardest par to'th' Play,</l>
            <l>They've said so much, there's little left to say.</l>
            <l>Yet Criticks, you new Miracles attend,</l>
            <l>As if Wits Treasurie cou'd know no end.</l>
            <l>Like cruel Landlords, who do never weigh</l>
            <l>Hard times, or dammage, when 'tis Quarter day;</l>
            <l>With eager expectation you destrain</l>
            <l>For VVits Excise upon our Poets brain,</l>
            <l>And for a Prologue, you old custom cite:</l>
            <l>They writ with ease who first began to write;</l>

            <l>Nay, here at home, all fancies are as stale,</l>
            <l>Some flatter, some intreat, and others rail:</l>
            <l>And this last Method we must needs confess,</l>
            <l>Has of all others met the most success:</l>
            <l>But our new Poet dares not take this Course,</l>
            <l>He wou'd intreat, but not your likings force;</l>
            <l>For if your Charity don't help him out,</l>
            <l>He does protest he then must turn Bankrupt:</l>
            <l>Not with design as knavish Bankers do)</l>

                     <l>Who quickly found a passage to my heart,</l>

                     <l>Not to be predispos'd of; things of value</l>
                     <l>Are coveted by all, and I soon found love</l>
                     <l>Had preingag'd that heart t'another,</l>

                     <l>For that heart being refus'd, I thence deriv'd</l>

                     <l>And I by consequence must always pine,</l>
