            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have for ſome time waited to expreſs my Reſpects unto you, but having had nothing worthy, I have hitherto ſtood out; nor do I preſume now to build my Security on Merits; but ſince kind Heav'n has deſign'd you for my <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> I kneel at You the Shrine, and offer up the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy <hi>SAMSON</hi> unto You, unhappy indeed, deluded by them tempting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then ſtill imitating the firſt Deluſion: Nor truly, tho' it is a long time ſince, do I think it is out of Date, or that the Ladies have forgot it, (the leſs the more pity;) Or there is no ſign for it yet. But I would not have the Ladies think hard of me, becauſe I pity poor <hi>SAMSON</hi>'s Caſe, and his Miſtreſſes Infidelity; not that I ſuppoſe all Ladies Faithful alike neither. But why do I Carp at the Ladies? thoſe tender, ſoft, ſweet, harmleſs Creatures. Sure, as to outward Appearance, there can't be much harm
<pb facs="tcp:44698:3"/>
in that Sex: But ſtay, and ſince <hi>SIR</hi> You admire 'em too, I ſhan't ſpeak againſt them, but only court your Condeſcention to accept this: And I could wiſh that it was worthy You, who Fortune and Nature conſpiring, have made you the happieſt Man: Fortune gave Quality, Nature Generoſity, Wit, and all Vertuous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, whereby You are ſucceſsful in the Hearts of the Fair, Obliging to all, eſteem'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, ador'd by all; You, You alone, the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Mankind. And theſe uncommon Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have all their Center in Your Breaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with Vices to ſullen Your Glory; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Your Ingenuity ſo gently ſhown in Your ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Poetry, ſeems to derive its Original from the ſweetneſs of Your Diſpoſition; and ſure, Your Favour to, and acquaintance with Poetry, is ſo Great, that You alone deſerve to claim the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. I hope You will accept this, and that it may give You ſome Recreation in the Peruſal; and ſo I beg leave to gratifie my Ambition, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <l>Yes, in the Deſerts, Health and Safety made.</l>
               <l>Now <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> might, with his bright Chariot's hurl'd,</l>

               <l>Now did the Wars and bloody Slaughters ceaſe,</l>
               <l>Encircled with the hopes of Laſting Peace.</l>

               <l>Uncircumcis'd, they mix with Sacred Blood.</l>

               <l>The Heathen Monſters roul'd the Swelling Tide,</l>
               <l>Raging they came, and gap'd Deſtruction wide:</l>

               <l>Like Stars i'th Firmament did ſhine her Eye,</l>

No Stars did in the Firmament appear,</l>

Forgets me quite, his Glory he pulls down,</l>

               <l>Forgets his God, to Women he gives ear,</l>
               <l>Once I already freed him from that care,</l>

               <l>Earthquakes were rais'd, the Sea tempeſtuous grew,</l>
