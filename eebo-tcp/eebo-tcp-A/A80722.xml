            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>AUL GREBNER</hi> came out of <hi>Germany</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and preſented to her a Book of Prophecies, which ſhe gave to Dr. <hi>Nevill</hi> Dean of her Chapel, and he to Trinity College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whereof he was Maſter, where it remains ſtill in the Library, and has of late years been made very famous by the fulfilling
<pb facs="tcp:121287:3"/>
of many of the Predictions in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Nation, and mens hopes of the ſpeedy accompliſhment of ſome others concerning the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exaltation of the afflicted Royal Family. This <hi>Paul Greb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> maried a wife with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune in the North, and had by her a Son called <hi>Obadiah Grebner,</hi> and two Daughters (who both dyed young) after which he made a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into his own Country (leaving his family in <hi>England)</hi> and there deceaſed. <hi>His</hi> ſon abeut the middle of King <hi>James</hi> his time maried too in the North, and had by his wife (who loſt her own life in the Child-birth) this <hi>Ezechiel Grebner,</hi> whom hee bred up very carefully in all manner
<pb facs="tcp:121287:3"/>
of good Literature, being himſelf a perſon of great Piety and Learning, and eſteemed to have the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie as well as his Father, though nothing of that kind was publiſhed by him. From theſe two ſprung our Son and Grandchild of Prophets, who was firſt educated a while at the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent to ſeveral Academies beyond Seas, where he got great reputation for his extraordinary parts and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; at the beginning of the late troubles he returned into <hi>England,</hi> and engaged with the Parliament, not forſaking them, till they (as he was wont to ſay) revolting? had left their Cauſe and Him to ſhift for themſelves among the men whom he
<pb facs="tcp:121287:4"/>
had fought againſt. Ater the death of the King, not onely his deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fact, but his indignation to be ſo abuſed and deluded, as to have his own innocency made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental towards the producing of ſuch wicked Ends, drew him to ſuch an open and avowed hatred of them, as occaſioned the ruine of his eſtate, the danger of his life, and the loſſe twice of his liberty, firſt under the Parliament, and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protector, at the time of whoſe Funeral (as appeareth by the Book it ſelf) this Viſion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him, which that he might write and publiſh with leſſe danger than he had formerly ſpoken, he made a journey into <hi>Germany,</hi> and had
<pb facs="tcp:121287:4"/>
no ſooner done the thing he went for, but he died at <hi>Strasburg</hi> laſt <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> He left all his papers with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentleman called <hi>Conrart Sluys</hi> (who had lived long in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſpoke our language per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well.) There were of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m (as I underſtand) ſeveral little Treaties in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> a book of Verſes upon different occaſions, ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> (for it ſeems he was a great Lover and Writer of Verſe, as you will find by his frequent Excurſions into it in this Diſcourſe) and laſtly three books of Viſions and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies concerning the Affairs of our three Nations; The firſt (which is but as it were a Preface to the other)
<pb facs="tcp:121287:5"/>
is that which is here publiſhed; The ſecond contains a Diſcourſe with the Angel <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> concerning all the late confuſions and misfortunes of it; The third denounces heavy judgements againſt the three Kingdoms, and ſeveral places and parties in them, unleſſe they prevent them ſpeedily by ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repentance, and that greateſt and hardeſt work of it, Reſtitution. There is there upon this ſubject, the burden of <hi>England,</hi> the burden of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the burden of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the burden of <hi>London,</hi> the burden of the Army, the burden of the Divines, the burden of the Lawyers, and many others, after the manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical threatnings in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
<pb facs="tcp:121287:5"/>
Thus I am told by the Gentleman who gave me this firſt book, and who had read the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two. This was left in his hands accidentally, the other were carried, as we believe, into <hi>Italy</hi> by Mr. <hi>Conrart Sluys,</hi> and we have uſed means to recover them from him if it be poſſible, hoping that they may be bleſſedly inſtrumental towards that repentance and converſion of our Nations, which is ſo evidently neceſſary for the diverting of all thoſe calamities which are there fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and which hang already ſo apparently over our heads, that they may be ſeen even by Human Reaſon, as well as foreſeen by Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

            <p>IT was the Funeral day of the late man who made himſelf to be called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, and though I bore but little affection, either to the memory of him, or to the trouble and folly of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121287:7"/>
Pageantry, yet I was forced by the importunity of my company to go along with them, and be a Spectator of that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, the expectation of which had been ſo great, that it was ſaid to have brought ſome very curious perſons (and no doubt ſingular Virtuoſos) as far as from the Mount in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and from the <hi>Orcades.</hi> I found there had been much more coſt beſtowed than either the dead man, or indeed Death it ſelf could deſerve. There was a mighty train of black aſſiſtants, among which too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes in the perſons of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors (being infinitely afflicted for the loſſe of their Brother) were pleaſed to attend; the Herſe was Magnificent, the Idol Crowned, and (not to mention all other Ceremonies which are practiſed at Royal interrements, and therefore by no means could be omitted here) the vaſt multitude of Spectators made up, as it uſes to do, no ſmall part of the Spectacle it ſelf. But yet I know not how, the whole was ſo managed, that, methoughts, it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:121287:7"/>
ſomewhat repreſented the life of him for whom it was made; Much noiſe, much tumult, much expence, much magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, much vain-glory; briefly, a great ſhow, and yet after all this, but an ill ſight. At laſt (for it ſeemed long to me, and like his ſhort Reign too, very tedious) the whole Scene paſt by, and I retired back to my Chamber, weary, and I think more melancholy than any of the Mourners. Where I began to reflect upon the whole life of this Prodigious Man, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I was filled with horror and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his actions, and ſometimes I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined a little to reverence and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his courage, conduct, and ſucceſſe; till by theſe different motions and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind rocked, as it were, a ſleep, I fell at laſt into this Viſion, or if you pleaſe to call it but a Dream, I ſhall not take it ill, becauſe the Father of Poets tells us, Even Dreams too are from God.</p>
            <p>But ſure it was no Dream; for I was ſuddenly tranſported afar off (whether in the body, or out of the body, like St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:121287:8"/>
I know not) and found my ſelf upon the top of that famous Hill in the Iſland <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which has the proſpect of three Great, and Not-long-ſince moſt happy King doms; As ſoon as ever I lookt upon them, the Not-long-ſince ſtrook upon my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and called forth the ſad repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Sins, and all the Miſeries that had overwhelmed them theſe twenty years. And I wept bitterly for two or three hours, and when my preſent ſtock of moiſture was all waſted, I fell a ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an hour more, and as ſoon as I recovered from my paſſion the uſe of ſpeech and reaſon, I broke forth, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (looking upon <hi>England)</hi> into this complaint.</p>

I think I ſhould have gone on, but that I was interrupted by a ſtrange and terrible Apparition, for there appeared to me (ariſing out of the earth, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) the figure of a man taller than a Gyant, or indeed than the ſhadow of any Gyant in the evening. His body was naked, but that nakedneſſe adorn'd, or rather deform'd all over, with ſeveral figures, after the manner of the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> painted upon it: and I perceived that moſt of them were the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the late battels in our civil Warrs, and (if I be not much miſtaken) it was the battel of <hi>Naſbey</hi> that was drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Breaſt. His Eyes were like burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Braſſe, and there were three Crowns of the ſame mettal (as I gueſt) and that lookt as red-hot too, upon his Head. He held in his right hand a Sword that was yet bloody, and nevertheleſſe the Motto of it was <hi>Pax quaeritur bello,</hi> and in his left hand a thick Book, upon the back of wich was written in Letters of Gold, Acts, Ordinances, Proteſtations, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

Engagements, Declarations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though this ſuddain, unuſual, and dreadful object might have quelled a greater courage than mine, yet ſo it pleaſed God (for there is nothhing bolder than a Man in a Viſion) that I was not at all daunted, but askt him reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and briefly, What art thou?

have entered at all into them, or at leaſt have returned back ere we had abſolutely loſt our way; but inſtead of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we have had ſince ſuch a Protector as was his Predeceſſor <hi>Richard</hi> the Third to the King his Nephew; for he preſently ſlew the Common-wealth, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to protect, and ſet up himſelf in the place of it; a little leſſe guilty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in one reſpect, becauſe the other ſlew an Innocent, and this Man did but murder a Muderer.

in their company, which gave me the firſt riſe of jealouſy againſt him, for I did not believe that <hi>Cromwell</hi> amongſt all his forein Correſpondences had ever held any with Angels. However I was not hardned enough yet to venture a quarrel with him then; and therefore (as if I had ſpoken to the Protector him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in White-hall) I deſired him that his Highneſſe would pleaſe to pardon me if I had unwittingly ſpoken any thing to the diſparagement of a perſon, whoſe relations to his Highneſſe I had not the honour to know. At which he told me, that he had no other concernment for his late Highneſſe, than as he took him to be the greateſt Man that ever was of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, if not (ſaid he) of the whole World, which gives me a juſt title to the defence of his reputation, ſince I now account my ſelf, as it were, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized <hi>Engliſh</hi> Angel, by having had ſo long the management of the affairs of that Country.

in <hi>England;</hi> to oppreſs all his Enemies by Arms, and all his Friends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by Artifice; to ſerve all parties patiently for a while, and to command them victoriouſly at laſt; to over-run each corner of the three Nations, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with equal facility both the riches of the South, and the poverty of the North; to be feared and courted by all forein Princes, and adopted a Brother to the gods of the earth; to call together Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a word of his Pen, and ſcatter them again with the Breath of his Mouth; to be humbly and daily petitioned that he would pleaſe to be hired at the rate of two millions a year, to be the Maſter of thoſe who had hired him before to be their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; to have the Eſtates and Lives of three Kingdoms as much at his diſpoſal, as was the little inheritance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to be as noble and liberal in the ſpending of them; and laſtly (for there is no end of all the particulars of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) to bequeath all this with one word to his Poſterity; to die with peace at home,

            <p>By this ſpeech I began to underſtand perfectly well what kind of Angel his pretended Highneſſe was, and having fortified my ſelf privately with a ſhort mental Prayer, and with the ſign of the Croſſe (not out of any ſuperſtition to the ſign, but as a recognition of my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in Chriſt) I grew a little bolder, and replyed in this manner; I ſhould not venture to oppoſe what you are pleaſed to ſay in commendation of the late great, and (I confeſſe) extraordinary perſon, but that I remember Chriſt forbids us to give aſſent to any other doctrine but what himſelf has taught us, even though it

ſhould be delivered by an Angel; and if ſuch you be, Sir, it may be you have ſpoken all this rather to try than to tempt my frailty: For ſure I am, that we muſt renounce or forget all the Laws of the New and Old Teſtament, and thoſe which are the foundation of both, even the Laws of Moral and Natural Honeſty, if we approve of the actions of that man whom I ſuppoſe you commend by Irony. There would be no end to inſtance in the particulars of all his wickedneſſe; but to ſum up a part of it briefly; What can be more extraordinarily wicked, than for a perſon, ſuch as your ſelf qualify him rightly, to endeavour not onely to exalt himſelf above, but to trample upon all his equals and betters? to pretend free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for all men, and under the help of that petence to make all men his ſervants? to take Arms againſt Taxes of ſcarce two hundred thouſand pounds a year, and to raiſe them himſelf to above two Milions? to quarrel for the loſſe of three or four Eares, and ſtrike off three or four hundred

Heads? to fight againſt an imaginary ſuſpition of I know not what two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Guards to be fetcht for the King, I know not from whence, and to keep up for himſelf no leſſe than forty thouſand? to pretend the defence of Parliaments, and violently to diſſolve all even of his own calling, and almoſt chooſing? to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Reformation of Religion, to rob it even to the very skin, and then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it naked to the rage of all Sects and Hereſies? to ſet up Counſels of Rapine, and Courts of Murder? to fight againſt the King under a commiſſion for him; to take him forceably out of the hands of thoſe for whom he had conquered him; to draw him into his Net, with prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations and vows of fidelity, and when he had caught him in it, to butcher him, with as little ſhame, as Conſcience, or Humanity, in the open face of the whole World? to receive a Commiſſion for King and Parliament, to murder (as I ſaid) the one, and deſtroy no leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently the other? to fight againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy

            <p>It is not ſo much out of my affection to that perſon whom we diſcourſe of (whoſe greatneſſe is too ſolid to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the breath of any Oratory) as for your own ſake (honeſt Country-man) whom I conceive to err, rather by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake

            <p>Here the ſpirit of Verſe beginning a little to fail, I ſtopt, and his Highneſſe ſmiling ſaid, I was glad to ſee you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Encloſures of <hi>Meeter,</hi> for if you had ſtaid in the open plain of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt the word Tyrant, I muſt have had patience for half a dosen hours, till you had tired your ſelf as well as me.

               </gap>t what you mean by the name of Tyrant,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121287:19"/>
for I remember that among your antient Authors, not onely all Kings, but even <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf (your <hi>Juvans Pater)</hi> is ſo termed, and perhaps as it was uſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in a good ſence, ſo we ſhall find it upon better conſideration to be ſtill a good thing for the benefit and peace of mankind, at leaſt it will appear whether your interpretation of it may be juſtly applied to the perſon who is now the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Diſcourſe. I call him (ſaid I) a Tyrant, who either intrudes himſelf ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly into the Government of his fellow Citizens without any legal Authority over them, or who having a juſt Title to the Government of a people, abuſes it to the deſtruction, or tormenting of them. So that all Tyrants are at the ſame time Uſurpers, either of the whole or at leaſt of a part of that power which they aſſume to themſelves, and no leſſe are they to be accounted Rebels, ſince no man can Uſurp Authority over others, but by rebelling againſt them who had it before, or at leaſt againſt thoſe Laws
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121287:19"/>
which were his Superiors; and in all theſe ſences no Hiſtory can affoard us a more evident example of Tyranny, or more out all poſſibility of excuſe, or palliation, than that of the perſon whom you are pleaſed to defend, whether we conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r his reiterated rebellions againſt all his ſuperiors, or his uſurpation of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power to himſelf, or his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the exerciſe of it; and if lawfull Princes have been eſteemed Tyrants by not containing themſelves within the bounds of thoſe Laws which have been left them as the ſphere of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by their fore-fathers, what ſhall we ſay of that man, who having by right no power at all in this Nation, could not content himſelf with that which had ſatisfied the moſt ambitious of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? nay, not with thoſe vaſtly extended limits of Soverainty, which he (diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that had been preſcribed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before) was pleaſed (but of great modeſty) to ſet to himſelf? not abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Rebellion and Uſurpation even
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121287:20"/>
againſt his own Laws as well as thoſe of the Nation?</p>
            <p>Hold friend (ſaid his Highneſſe, (pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me by my Arm) for I ſee your zeal is tranſporting you again) whether the Protector were a Tyrant in the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant exerciſe of his power we ſhall ſee anon, it is requiſite to examine firſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were ſo in the Uſurpation of it. And I ſay, that not onely He, but no man elſe ever was, or can be ſo; and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe all power belongs onely to God, who is the ſource and fountain of it, as Kings are of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in their Dominions. Princes are but his Viceroys in the little Provinces of this World, and to ſome he gives their places for a few years, to ſome for their lives, and to others (upon ends or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts beſt known to himſelf, or meerly for his undiſputable good pleaſure) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows as it were Leaſes upon them, and their poſterity, for ſuch a date of time as is prefixt in that Patent of their Deſtiny, which is not legible to you men below.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:121287:20"/>
Neither is it more unlawfull for <hi>Oliver</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Charls</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> when God ſo diſpoſes of it, than it had been for him to have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> in the Lieutenancy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if he had been appointed to it by the King then reigning. Men are in both the caſes obliged to obey him whom they ſee actually inveſted with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by that Sovereign from whom he ought to derive it, without diſputing or examining the cauſes, either of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveal of the one, or the preferment of the other. Secondly, becauſe all power is attained either by the Election and conſent of the people, and that takes away your objection of forcible intruſion; or elſe by a Conqueſt of them, and that gives ſuch a legal Authority as you mention to be wanting in the Uſurpation of a tyrant; ſo that either this Title is right, and then there are no Uſurpers, or elſe it is a wrong one, and then there are none elſe but Uſurpers, if you examine the Original pretences of the Princes of the World.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121287:21"/>
Thirdly, (which quitting the diſpute in general, is a particular juſtification of his Highneſſe) the Government of <hi>England</hi> was totally broken and diſſolved, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht by the confuſions of a Civil War, ſo that his Highneſſe could not be accuſed to have poſſeſt himſelf vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently of the antient building of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, but to have prudently and peaceably built up a new one out of the ruins and aſhes of the former; and he who after a deplorable ſhipwrack can with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Induſtry gather together the diſperſt and broken planks and pieces of it, and with no leſſe wonderfull art and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>licity ſo rejoyn them as to make a new Veſſel more tight and beautifull than the old one, deſerves no doubt to have the command of her (even as his Highneſſe had) by the deſire of the Sea-men and Paſſengers themſelves. And do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider laſtly (for I omit multitude of weighty things that might be ſpoken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this noble argument) do but conſider ſeriouſly and impartially with your ſelf,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121287:21"/>
what admirable parts of wit and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what indefatigable diligence and invincible courage muſt of neceſſity have concurred in the perſon of that man, who from ſo contemptible beginnings (as I obſerved before) and through ſo many thouſand difficulties, was able not onely to make himſelf the greateſt and moſt abſolute Monarch of this Nation, but to add to it the entire Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (which the whole force of the World joyned with the Roman vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue could never attain to) and to Crown all this with Illuſtrious and Heroical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and ſucceſſes upon' all our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Enemies; do but (I ſay again) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, and you will confeſſe, that his prodigious Merits were a better Title to Imperial Dignity, than the bloud of an hundred Royal Progenitors; and will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lament that he lived not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more Nations, than envy him the Conqueſt and Dominion of theſe. Who ever you are (ſaid I, my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion making me ſomewhat bolder) your
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121287:22"/>
diſcourſe (methinks) becomes as little the perſon of a Tutelar Angel, as <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> actions did that of a Protector. It is upon theſe Principles that all the great Crimes of the World have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and moſt particularly thoſe which I have had the misfortune to ſee in my own time, and in my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. If theſe be to be allowed, we muſt break up human ſociety, retire into the Woods, and equally there ſtand upon our Guards againſt our Brethren Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and our Rebels the Wild Beaſts. For if there can be no Uſurpation upon the rights of a whole Nation, there can be none moſt certainly upon thoſe of a private perſon; and if the Robbers of Countreys be Gods Vicegerents, there is no doubt but the Thieves, and Banditos, and Murderers are his under Officers. It is true which you ſay, that God is the ſcource and fountain of all power, and it it is no leſſe true that he is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Serpents as well as Angels, nor does his goodneſſe fail of its ends even
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121287:22"/>
in the malice of his own Creatures. What power he ſuffers the Devil to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in this World, is too apparent by our daily experience, and by nothing more than the late monſterous iniquities which you diſpute for, and patronize in <hi>England;</hi> but would you inferre from thence, that the power of the Devil is a juſt and lawful one, and that all men ought, as well as moſt men do, obey him? God is the fountain of all Powers; but ſome flow from the right hand (as it were) of his Goodneſſe, and others from the left hand of his Juſtice; and the World, like an Iſland between theſe two Rivers, is ſometimes refreſht and nouriſhed by the one, and ſometimes overrun and ruined by the other; and (to continue a little farther the Allegory) we are never overwhelmed with the latter, till either by our malice or negligence we have ſlopt and damm'd up the former. But to come a little cloſer to your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather the Image of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your ſimilitude; If <hi>Cromwell</hi> had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121287:23"/>
come to command <hi>Ireland</hi> in the place of the late Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> I ſhould have yielded obedience, not for the equipage, and the ſtrength, and the guards which he brought with him, but for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which he ſhould firſt have ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from our common Soveraign that ſent him; and if He could have done that from God Almighty, I would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed him too in <hi>England;</hi> but that he was ſo far from being able to do, that on the contrary, I read nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and even publick Proclamations from God Almighty, not to admit him. Your ſecond Argument is, that he had the ſame right for his authority, that is the foundation of all others, even the right of Conqueſt. Are we then ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be conquered by the perſon, whom we hired at a daily rate, like a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, to conquer others for us? did we furniſh him with Arms, onely to draw and try upon our Enemies (as we, it ſeems, falſely thought them) and keep them for ever ſheath'd in the bowels of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121287:23"/>
his Friends? did we fight for Liberty againſt our Prince, that we might become Slaves to our Servant? this is ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent pretence, as neither He nor any of his Flatterers for him had ever the face to mention. Though it can hardly be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or thought of without paſſion, yet I ſhall, if you pleaſe, argue it more calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the caſe deſerves. The right cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of Conqueſt can onely be exerciſed upon thoſe againſt whom the War is declared, and the Victory obtained. So that no whole Nation can be ſaid to be conquered but by forein force. In all civil Wars men are ſo far from ſtating the quarrel againſt their Country, that they do it onely againſt a perſon or party which they really believe, or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be pernicious to it, neither can there be any juſt cauſe for the deſtruction of a part of the Body, but when it is done for the preſervation and ſafety of the Whole. 'Tis our Country that raiſes men in the quarrel, our Country that arms, our Country that payes them, our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121287:24"/>
Country that authoriſes the undertaking, and by that diſtinguiſhes it from rapine and murder; laſtly, 'tis our Country that directs and commands the Army, and is indeed their General. So that to ſay in Civil Warrs that the prevailing party conquers their Country, is to ſay, the Country conquers it ſelf. And if the General onely of that party be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, the Army by which he is made ſo, is no leſſe conquered than the Army which is beaten, and have as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to triumph in that Victory, by which they loſe both their Honour and Liberty. So that if <hi>Cromwell</hi> conquered any party, it was onely that againſt which he was ſent, and what that was, muſt appear by his Commiſſion. It was (ſayes that) againſt a company of evil Counſellours, and diſaffected perſons, who kept the King from a good intelligence and conjunction with his People. It was not then againſt the People. It is ſo far from being ſo, that even of that party which was beaten, the Conqueſt did not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121287:24"/>
belong to <hi>Cromwell</hi> but to the Parliament which employed him in their Service, or rather indeed to the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for whoſe Service (if there had been any faith in mens vows and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations) the Warrs were undertaken. Merciful God! did the right of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Conqueſt remain then in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and didſt thou ſuffer him to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

It appears therefore plainly, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was not a Conquerour, but a Thief and Robber of the Rights of the King and Parliament, and an Uſurper upon thoſe of the People. I do not here de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Conqueſt to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (though it be very rarely) a true title, but I deny this to be a true Conqueſt. Sure I am, that the race of our Princes came not in by ſuch a one. One Nation
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121287:25"/>
may conquer another ſometimes juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if it be unjuſty, yet ſtill it is a true Conqueſt, and they are to anſwer for the injuſtice onely to God Almighty (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing elſe in authority above them) and not as particular Rebels to their Country, which is, and ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be their Superior and their Lord. If perhaps we find Uſurpation inſtead of Conqueſt in the Original Titles of ſome Royal Families abroad (as no doubt there have been many Uſurpers before ours, though none in ſo impudent and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a manner) all I can ſay for them is, that their Title was very weak, till by length of time, and the death of all juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r pretenders, it became to be the true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the onely one. Your third defence of his Highneſſe (as your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe pleaſes to call him) enters in moſt ſeaſonably after his pretence of Conqueſt, for then a man may ſay any thing. The Government was broken; Who broke it? It was diſſolved; Who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it? It was extinguiſht; Who was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:121287:25"/>
it but <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who not onely put out the Light, but caſt away even the very ſnuff of it? As if a man ſhould mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a whole Family, and then poſſeſſe himſelf of the Houſe, becauſe 'tis better that He than that onely Rats ſhould live there. Jeſus God! (ſaid I, and at that word I perceived my pretended Angel to give a ſtart, and trembled, but I took no notice of it, and went on) this were a wicked pretenſion even though the whole Family were deſtroyed, but the Heirs (bleſſed be God) are yet ſurvive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and likely to outlive all Heirs of their diſpoſſeſſors, beſides their Infamy. <hi>Rode Caper vitem,</hi> &amp;c. There will be yet wine enough left for the Sacrifice of theſe wild Beaſts that have made ſo much ſpoil in the Vine yard. But did <hi>Cromwell</hi> think, like <hi>Nero,</hi> to ſet the City on fire, onely that he might have the honour of being founder of a new and more beautiful one? He could not have ſuch a ſhadow of Virtue in his wickedneſſe; he meant one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rob more ſecurely and more richly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121287:26"/>
in midſt of the combuſtion; he little thought then that he ſhould ever have been able to make himſelf. Maſter of the Palace, as well as plunder the Goods of the Commonwealth. He was glad to ſee the publick Veſſel (the Soveraign of the Seas) in as deſperate a condition as his own little Canou, and thought onely with ſome ſcattered planks of that great ſhipwrack to make a better Fiſherboat for himſelf. But when he ſaw that by the drowning of the Maſter (whom he himſelf treacherouſly knockt on the head as he was ſwimming for his life) by the flight and diſperſion of others, and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly patience of the remaining compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that all was abandoned to his pleaſure, with the old Hulk and new mis-ſhapen and diſagreeing peeces of his own, he made up with much adoe that Piratical Veſſel which we have ſeen him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and which how tight indeed it was, may beſt be judged by it's perpetual Leaking. Firſt then (much more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked than thoſe fooliſh daughters in the

Fable, who cut their old Father into pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in hope by charms and witchcraft to make him young and luſty again) this man endeavoured to deſtroy the Building, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could imagine in what manner, with what materials, by what workmen, or what Architect it was to be rebuilt. Secondly, if he had dream't himſelf to be able to revive that body which he had killed, yet it had been but the inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inſolence of an ignorant Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck; and thirdly (which concerns us neareſt) that very new thing which he made out of the ruines of the old, is no more like the Original, either for beauty, uſe, or duration, than an artificial Plant raiſed by the fire of a Chymiſt is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the true and natural one which he firſt burnt, that out of the aſhes of it he might produce an imperfect ſimilitude of his own making. Your laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſuch (when reduced to Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm) that the Major Propoſition of it would make ſtrange work in the World, if it were received for truth; to wit, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:121287:27"/>
he who has the beſt parts in a Nation, has the right of being King over it. We had enough to do here of old with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between two branches of the ſame Family, what would become of us when every man in <hi>England</hi> ſhould lay his claim to the Government? and truly if <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſhould have commenced his plea when he ſeems to have begun his ambition, there were few perſons beſides that might not at the ſame time have put in theirs to. But his Deſerts I ſuppoſe you will date from the ſame term that I do his great Demerits, that is, from the beginning of our late calamities, (for as for his private faults before, I can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh (and that with as much Charity to him as to the publick) that he had continued in them till his death, rather than changed them for thoſe of his latter dayes) and therefore we muſt begin the conſideration of his greatneſſe from the unlucky <hi>Aera</hi> of our own misfortunes, which puts me in mind of what was ſaid leſſe truly of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great,

Firſt, becauſe he has ſuffered nothing to ſettle or take root in the place of that which hath been ſo unwiſely and unjuſtly removed, that none of theſe untempered Mortars can hold out againſt the next blaſt of Wind, nor any ſtone ſtick to a ſtone, till that which theſe Fooliſh Builders have refuſed be

made again the Head of the Corner. For when the indiſpoſed and long tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Commonwealth has wearied and ſpent it ſelf almoſt to nothing with the chargeable, various, and dangerous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of ſeveral Mountebanks, it is to be ſuppoſed it will have the wit at laſt to ſend for a true Phyſician, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it ſees (which is the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration) moſt evidently (as it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to do, and will do every day more and more, and might have done perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly long ſince) that no Uſurpation (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what name or pretext ſoever) can be kept up without open force, nor force without the continuance of thoſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the people, which will at laſt tire out their patience, though it be great even to ſtupidity. They cannot be ſo dull (when poverty and hunger begins to whet their underſtanding) as not to find out this no extraordinary myſtery, that 'tis madneſſe in a Nation to pay three Millions a year for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſervitude under Tyrants,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:121287:30"/>
when they might live free for nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Princes. This, I ſay, will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ly hid even to the ſloweſt capacities, and the next truth they will diſcover af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, is, that a whole people can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the will without having at the ſame time the Power to redeem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thirdly, it does not look (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) as if God had forſaken the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of that man, from whom he has raiſed up five Children, of as Eminent virtue, and all other commendable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as ever lived perhaps (for ſo many together, and ſo young) in any other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the whole World. Eſpecially if we add hereto this conſideration, that by protecting and preſerving ſome of them already through as great dangers as ever were paſt with ſafety, either by Prince or private perſon, he has given them already (as we may reaſonably hope it to be meant) a promiſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of thoſe excellent parts of nature, and mixture of Merit with their Vices in the late diſturbers of our peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, that uſes to be found in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe who are born for the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of new Empires. And I confeſſe I find nothing of that kind, no not any ſhadow (taking away the falſe light of ſome proſperity) in the man whom you extol for the firſt example of it. And certainly all Virtues being rightly devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Moral and Intellectual, I know not how we can better judge of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than by mens actions, or of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than by their Writings or Speeches. As for theſe latter (which are leaſt in merit, or rather which are onely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of miſchief where the other are wanting) I think you can hardly pick out the name of a man who ever was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Great, beſides him we are now ſpeaking of, who never left the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry behind him of one wife or witty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothegm even amongſt his Domeſtique Servants or greateſt Flatterers. That lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

in print which remains upon a ſad record for him, is ſuch, as a Satyre againſt him would not have made him ſay, for fear of tranſgreſſing too much the rules of Probability. I know not what you can produce for the juſtification of his parts in this kind, but his having been able to deceive ſo many particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo many whole parties; which if you pleaſe to take notice of for the advantage of his Intellectuals, I deſire you to allow me the liberty to do ſo too, when I am to ſpeak of his Morals. The truth of the thing is this, That if Craft be Wiſdom, and Diſſimulation Wit, (aſſiſted both and improved with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſies and Perjuries) I muſt not deny him to have been ſingular in both; but ſo groſſe was the manner in which he made uſe of them, that as wiſe-men ought not to have believed him at firſt, ſo no man was Fool enough to believe him at laſt; neither did any man ſeem to do it, but thoſe who thought they gained as much by that diſſembling, as he did by his.

If you ask me why they did not hiſſe, and explode him off of the Stage, I can onely anſwer, that they durſt not do ſo, becauſe the Actors and the Door-keepers were too ſtrong for the Company. I muſt confeſſe that by theſe arts (how groſly ſoever managed, as by Hypocritical praying, and ſilly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by unmanly tears and whinings, by falſhoods and perjuries even Diabolical) he had at firſt the good fortune (as men call it, that is the Ill Fortune) to attain his ends; but it was becauſe his ends were ſo unreaſonable, that no human reaſon could foreſee them; which made them who had to do with him believe that he was rather a well meaning and deluded Bigot, than a crafty and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Impoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

you term it) I am ſo far from doubting, that I intended to Object that diligence as the worſt of his Crimes. It makes me almoſt mad when I hear a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his diligence in wickedneſſe. If I were his Son I ſhould wiſh to God he had been a more lazie perſon, and that we might have found him ſleeping at the hours when other men are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily waking, rather than waking for thoſe ends of his when other men were ordinarily aſleep; how diligent the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are the Scripture often tells us; Their feet run to evil, and they make haſte to ſhed innocent bloud, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 7.

publiquely and ſo outragiouſly to murder his Maſter; It was bold with ſo much inſolence and affront to expell and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe all the chief Partners of his guilt, and Creators of his power; It was bold to violate ſo openly and ſo ſcornfully all Acts and Conſtitutions of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterwards even of his own making; it was bold to aſſume the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of calling, and bolder yet of breaking ſo many Parliaments; it was bold to trample upon the patience of his own, and provoke that of all neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countreys; It was bold, I ſay, above all boldneſſes, to Uſurp this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny to himſelf, and impudent above all impudences to endeavour to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to his poſterity.

We have brought him thus brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (not through all his Labyrinths) to the Supreme Uuſurpt Authority, and becauſe you ſay it was great pitie he did not live to command more Kingdoms, be pleaſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121287:35"/>
to let me repreſent to you in a few words, how well I conceive he governed theſe. And we will divide the conſideration into that of his forein and domeſtique acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The firſt of his forein was a Peace with our Brethren of <hi>Holland</hi> (who were the firſt of our neighbours that God chaſtiſed for having had ſo great a hand in the encouraging and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betting our troubles at home) who would not imagine at firſt glympſe that this had been the moſt virtuous and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable deed that his whole Life could make any parade of? but no man can look upon all the circumſtances with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving, that it was purely the ſale and ſacrifizing of the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that this Countrey could ever hope, and was ready to reap, from a forein War, to the private intereſts of his covetouſneſſe and ambition, and the ſecurity of his new and unſetled Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.

Army, which I wiſh may be obſerved by ours with trembling) ſhould bee ſo ſhamefully defeated by the hands of forty Slaves. It was very ridiculous to ſee how prettily they endeavoured to hide this ignominy under the great name of the Conqueſt of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> as if a defeated Army ſhould have the impudence to brag afterwards of the Victory, becauſe though they had fled out of the Field of Battel, yet they quartered that night in a Village of the Enemies. The War with <hi>Spain</hi> was a neceſſary conſequence of this folly, and how much we have gotten by it, let the Cuſtom-houſe and Exchange inform you; and if he pleaſe to boaſt of the taking a part of the Silver-Fleet (which indeed no body elſe but he, who was the ſole gainer, has cauſe to do) at leaſt let him give leave to the reſt of the Nation (which is the onely loſer) to complain of the loſſe of twelve hundred of her ſhips. But becauſe it may here perhaps be anſwered, that his ſucceſſes nearer home have extinguiſht
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:121287:36"/>
the diſgrace of ſo remote miſcariages, and that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ought more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred for his glory, than St. <hi>Domingo</hi> for his diſadvantage; I muſt confeſſe, as to the honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> courage, that they were not wanting upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (excepting onely the fault of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at leaſt indirectly againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) to the upholding of the renown of their warlike Anceſtors. But for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſhare of it, who ſat ſtill at home, and expoſed them ſo frankly abroad, I can onely ſay, that for leſſe money than he in the ſhort time of his reign exacted from his fellow Subjects, ſome of our former Princes (with the daily hazard of their own perſons) have added to the Dominion of <hi>England</hi> not onely one Town, but even a greater Kingdom than it ſelf. And this beeing all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as concerning his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes abroad, let us examine in the next place, how much wee owe him for his Juſtice and good Government at home. And firſt he found the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

He found our Trade very much decayd indeed, in compariſon of the golden times of our late Princes; he left it as much again more decayd than he found it; and yet not onely no Prince in <hi>England,</hi> but no Tyrant in the World ever ſought out more baſe or infamous means to raiſe moneys. I ſhall onely inſtance in one that he put in practice, and another that he attempted, but was frighted from the execution (even He) by the infamy of it. That which he put in practice was Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; which was the moſt impudent breach of all publick Faith that the whole Nation had given, and all private capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations which himſelf had made, as the Nations General and Servant, that can be found out (I believe) in all Hiſtory from any of the moſt barbarous Generals of the moſt barbarous People.

becauſe it has been moſt excellently and moſt largely layd open by a whole Book written upon that Subject, I ſhall onely deſire you here to remember the thing in general, and to be pleaſed to look upon that Author when you would recollect all the particulars and circumſtances of the iniquity. The other deſign of raiſing a preſent ſum of Money, which he vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently perſued, but durſt not put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, was by the calling in and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> from which he was rebuted by the univerſal outcry of the Divines, and even of the Citizens too, who took it ill that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number at leaſt amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not thought <hi>Jews</hi> enough by their own <hi>Herod.</hi> And for this deſign, they ſay, he invented (Oh Antichriſt! <gap reason="foreign">

their King, it might have had ſome appearance of Gratitude, but he did it onely for love of their Mammon; and would have ſold afterwards for as much more St. <hi>Peters</hi> (even at his own <hi>Weſtminſter)</hi> to the <hi>Turks</hi> for a <hi>Moſquito.</hi> Such was his extraordinary Piety to God, that he deſired he might be worſhipped in all manners, excepting onely that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh way of the Common-Prayer Book. But what do I ſpeak of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked inventions for getting money? when every penny that for almoſt five years he took every day from every man living in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> was as much Robbery as if it had been taken by a Thief upon the High-ways. Was it not ſo? or can any man think that <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> with the aſſiſtance of his Forces and Moſſe Troopers, had more right to the command of all mens purſes, than he might have had to any ones whom he had met and been too ſtrong for upon a Road? and yet when this came in the caſe of Mr. <hi>Concy,</hi> to be diſputed by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121287:38"/>
tryal, he (which was the higheſt act of Tyranny that ever was ſeen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> not onely diſcouraged and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but violently impriſoned the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the Plaintiff; that is, he ſhut up the Law it ſelf cloſe Priſoner, that no man might have relief from, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to it. And it ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that this was done by thoſe men, who a few years before had ſo bitterly decried, and openly oppoſed the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and formal way of proceeding in the trial of a little Ship-money. But though we loſt the benefit of our old Courts of Juſtice, it cannot be denyed that he ſet up new ones; and ſuch they were, that as no virtuous Prince before would, ſo no ill one durſt erect. What? have we lived ſo many hundred years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a form of Juſtice as has been able regularly to puniſh all men that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it, and is it ſo deficient juſt now, that we muſt ſeek out new wayes how to proceed againſt offenders? The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121287:39"/>
reaſon which can onely be given in nature for a neceſſity of this, is, becauſe thoſe things are now made Crimes, which were never eſteemed ſo in former Ages; and there muſt needs be a new Court ſet up to puniſh that, which all the old ones were bound to protect and reward. But I am ſo far from Declaming (as you call it) againſt theſe wickedneſſes (which if I ſhould undertake to do, I ſhould never get to the Peroration) that you ſee I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a hint of ſome few, and paſſe over the reſt as things that are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be numbred, and muſt onely be weighed in groſſe. Let any man ſhow me (for though I pretend not to much reading, I will defy him in all Hiſtory) let any man ſhow me (I ſay) an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of any Nation in the World (though much greater than ours) where there have in the ſpace of four years been made ſo many Priſoners onely out of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Jealouſies of one Tyrants guilty Imagination. I grant you that <hi>Marius</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:121287:39"/>
and <hi>Sylla,</hi> and the accurſed Triumvirate after them, put more People to death, but the reaſon I think partly was, becauſe in thoſe times that had a mixture of ſome honour with their madneſſe, they thought it a more civil revenge againſt a <hi>Roman</hi> to take away his Life, than to take away his Liberty. But truly in the point of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der too, we have little reaſon to think that our late Tyranny has been deficient to the examples that have ever been ſet it in other Countries. Our Judges and our Courts of Juſtice have not been idle; And to omit the whole reign of our late King (till the beginning of the War) in which no drop of blood was ever drawn but from two or three Ears, I think the longeſt time of our wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And wee ſaw, and ſmelt in our open ſtreets, (as I markt to you at firſt) the broyling of humane bowels as a Burnt Offering of a ſweet Savour to our

Idol; but all murdering, and all tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though after the ſubtileſt inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Predeceſſors of <hi>Sicilie)</hi> is more Humane and more ſupportable, than his ſelling of Chriſtians, Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Gentlemen; his ſelling of them (oh monſtrous! oh incredible!) to be Slaves in <hi>America.</hi> If his whole life could bee reproacht with no other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet this alone would weigh down all the multiplicity of Crimes in any of our Tyrants; and I dare onely touch, without ſtopping or inſiſting upon ſo inſolent and ſo execrable a cruelty, for fear of falling into ſo violent (though a juſt) Paſſion, as would make me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that temper and moderation which I reſolve to obſerve in this Diſcourſe with you. Theſe are great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but even theſe are not the moſt inſupportable that wee have endured; for ſo it is, that the ſcorn, and mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and inſultings of an Enemy, are more painfull than the deepeſt wounds
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121287:40"/>
of his ſerious fury. This Man was wanton and merry (unwittily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully merry) with our ſufferings; Hee loved to ſay and do ſenceleſſe and fantaſtical things, onely to ſhew his power of doing or ſaying any thing. It would ill befit mine, or any civil Mouth, to repeat thoſe words which hee ſpoke concerning the moſt ſacred of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, the Petition of Right, and <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> To day you ſhould ſee him ranting ſo wildly, that no body durſt come near him, the morrow flinging of cuſhions, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Snow-balls with his Servants. This moneth hee aſſembles a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and profeſſes himſelf with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tears to be onely their Servant and their Miniſter; the next moneth hee ſwears By the Living God, that hee vvill turn them out of dores, and hee does ſo, in his princely vvay of threatning bidding them, Turn the buckles of their girdles behind them. The Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121287:41"/>
of a vvhole, nay of three whole Nations, was in his eſteem ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible a meeting, that hee thought the affronting and expelling of them to be a thing of ſo little conſequence, as not to deſerve that hee ſhould adviſe with any mortal man about it. What ſhall wee call this? Boldneſſe, or Brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Raſhneſſe, or Phrenſie? there is no name can come up to it, and therefore wee muſt leave it without one. Now a Parliament muſt bee choſen in the new manner, next time in the old form, but all caſhiered ſtill after the neweſt mode. Now he will govern by Major Generals, now by One Houſe, now by Another Houſe, now by No Houſe; now the freak takes him, and hee makes ſeventy Peers of the Land at one clap <hi>(Extempore,</hi> and <hi>ſtans pede in uno)</hi> and to manifeſt the abſolute power of the Potter, hee chooſes not onely the worſt Clay he could find, but picks up even the Durt and Mire, to form
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121287:41"/>
out of it his Veſſels of Honour. It was ſaid antiently of Fortune, that when ſhe had a mind to be merry and to divert her ſelf, ſhe was wont to raiſe up ſuch kind of people to the higheſt Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This Son of Fortune, <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who was himſelf one of the primeſt of her Jeſts) found out the true haut gouſt of this pleaſure, and rejoyced in the extravagance of his wayes as the fulleſt demonſtration of his uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Soverainty. Good God! what have we ſeen? and what have we ſuffer'd? what do all theſe actions ſignifie, what do they ſay aloud to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but this (even as plainly as if it were proclamed by Heralds through the ſtreets of <hi>London)</hi> You are Slaves and Fools, and ſo Ile uſe you? Theſe are briefly a part of thoſe merits which you lament to have wanted the reward of more Kingdomes, and ſuppoſe that if he had lived longer he might have had them; VVhich I am ſo

far from concurring to, that I believe his ſeaſonable dying to have been a greater good fortune to him than all the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and proſperities of his Life. For he ſeemed evidently (methinks) to be near the end of his deceitfull Glories; his own Army grew at laſt as weary of him as the reſt of the People; and I never paſt of late before his Palace (His, do I call it? I ask God and the King pardon) but I never paſt of late before Whitehall without reading upon the Gate of it, <hi>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Uphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.</hi> But it pleaſed God to take him from the ordinary Courts of Men, and Juries of his Peers, to his own High Court of Juſtice, which being more mercifull than Ours below, there is a little room yet left for the hope of his friends, if he have any; though the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unrepentance of his death affoard but ſmall materials for the work of Charity, eſpecially if he deſigned even then to Entail his own injuſtice upon

his Children, and by it inextricable confuſions and Civil Wars upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But here's at laſt an end of him; And where's now the fruit of all that bloud and calamity which his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has coſt the World? Where is it? Why, his Son (you'l ſay) has the whole Crop; I doubt he will find it quickly Blaſted; I have nothing to ſay againſt the Gentleman, or any living of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, on the contrary I-wiſh him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune than to have a long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet poſſeſſion of his Maſters Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

But theſe are ſo farre from making you a Prince, that I am afraid your friends will never have the contentment to ſee you ſo much as a Juſtice of Peace in your own Countrey. For this I perceive which you call Virtue, is nothing elſe but either the frowardneſſe of a Cynick, or the lazineſſe of an Epicurean.
