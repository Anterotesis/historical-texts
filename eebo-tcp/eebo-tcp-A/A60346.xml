            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT the Motion and Desire of your (since De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased)
Father and Husband, my Worthy
Friend, I did, after the Solemnization of his Funeral,
deliver the following Discourse to you in Private. And
in order to Common Good, I have here made it Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
The Father of Mercies accompany it with his
Blessing upon you, and all others into whose hands it
shall come, that thereby Love to and Faith in Christ
may be promoted, together with Holiness of Life and
Comfort at Death. That you may not be unmindful
of that King of Terrors at his greatest distances, nor
terrified by him in his nearest approaches. I was
greatly pleased to see your gracious Deportment under
that Afflictive Providence, which deprived you of one
so desireable, and that you were duely affected with your
Loss, yet sweetly submissive to your God. Though the
Cup was bitter, you did not faint nor murmur. It was
indeed a Mercy that you enjoyed him so long, for he was
full of Dayes, and had a flourishing old Age. And it
may be a Comfort, that you shall see him again in
Heaven, where you shall Eternally rejoyce together
in God. That your Souls may prosper, your Graces
<pb facs="tcp:38376:3"/>
increase, your Comforts abound, your Daies may be
filled with Mercy and Duty, and your selves at last
received into Glory is the Hearty Prayer of</p>

Servant in our
dear Lord Jesus,

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>LUK. 2. 29, 30.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <l>Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace,
according to thy word.</l>
                  <l>For mine Eyes have seen thy Salvation.</l>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the words of Holy <hi>Simeon,</hi> who is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be the Son of <hi>Hillel,</hi> and Chief of the great
<hi>Synedrion,</hi> and Father of the Learned Doctor <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi>
at whose Feet, the great Apostle of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
Paul</hi> was educated. Concerning whom the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
testifies, that he was a Just and Devout man, <hi>i. e.</hi> Godly,
and Righteous, Wary, and Cautious; A man that managed
his Life, and ordered his actions with that due circumspection,
as evidenced his sedulous care of approving himself to God.</p>
            <p>This good man waited for the Consolation of <hi>Israel, viz.</hi> the
incarnation, or coming of the Son of God, the promised, and
longingly expected <hi>Messiah;</hi> in whom all our comforts are laid
up, if we be <hi>Israelites</hi> indeed. That Jesus alone can be our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
who is our Salvation. It is only under his shadow we
can sit with great delight, because under that alone we can sit in
safety. Those men and Women that seek their comforts out of
Christ, will find themselves under miserable disappointment.
And by how much the higher they are raised in hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
by so much the lower they will be plunged into sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and vexation. I do earnestly beseech you, Christians, to
remember this, that Christ is the Consolation of <hi>Israel,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it for your Souls advantage. Especially I speak this to
you, my Friends, who are most nearly concerned in the late
stroak of Providence, and do now mourn under the smart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Learn whither you should repair for support and healing;
even to this Jesus, who to this day, yea, for ever continues to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38376:4"/>
be the Consolation of <hi>Israel:</hi> and in whom you may find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
enough to sweeten this bitter Cup.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Simeon</hi> who thus waited, was well rewarded for his
Faith and Patience, having this assurance given him, that he
should not see Death, until he had seen the Lord's Christ. He
should not see Death until Christ was born. Christ should come
upon Earth before <hi>Simeon</hi> should go to Heaven: From whence
you may learn this truth. That waiting upon God is not in
vain: much time may be spent in it, but it will not be time
mis-spent. God is not wont to send a waiting Soul mourning
away. Such an one may come to God with a tear in it's Eye,
but sooner or later, it shall go from him with a smile upon it's
Countenance. Thou, O mourning, drooping Christian, dost
not see Christ now, he covers himself with a Cloud; well, sink
not under discouragement, but let patience have it's perfect work,
and do thou charge thy Soul to wait on, I am perswaded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou seest Death, thou shalt see Jesus; Christ will manifest
himself unto thee; however, as soon as Death hath closed thy
bodily Eyes, thou shalt both see him, and thy self with him in
Glory.</p>
            <p>Well. <hi>Simeon</hi> having waited long, though not too long, came
into the Temple, which did then exceed in Glory, for there
he met with Jesus. And having met with him, he toook him
up in his arms; and he was a most blessed arm-full; doubtless
the good old man was glad he had got him, and his heart did
leap within him. He never before embraced so great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
an Object. And I tell thee, O Christian, who hast got
Christ in thy Heart, and dost hug him in the arms of thy Faith,
thou hast as much reason to rejoyce, as <hi>Simeon</hi> did, when he
had him in his arms: for it is Christ in you the hope of Glory.
If he be formed in you, you shall be saved by him.</p>
            <p>Having taken Christ in his arms, what did the good man
do? Oh! he blessed God, and truly he had reason. How
could he be without his Song, when he had got him, who was
his strength and Salvation. We have cause to bless God for
Creatures, for our Health, Strength, Estates; and Relations,
because we are less than the least of these, but we have infinitely
more cause to bless God for Christ, because he is a gift of the
dearest love, and of the greatest excellency. All Earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
come from the hand of God, but Christ comes from the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38376:4"/>Some part of that which <hi>Simeon</hi> spake upon this occasion, you
have in the words of the Text, in which take notice of these two
things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Simeons</hi> humble petition and request to God. Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word.</p>
            <p>2. The ground or reason of this his request, <hi>for</hi> mine Eyes
have seen thy Salvation.</p>
            <p>This Scripture being chosen by our deceased Brother for his
Swan like-Song; I shall present you with those several Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I have made upon it, and briefly touch upon them, and so
pass to that which I purpose most to insist upon.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>Every Godly man is God's Servant. So Simeon</hi> stiled
himself here, Lord, lettest thou <hi>thy Servant.</hi> And so did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psalm. 116. 16. O Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy
Servant.</hi> He gloried more in his being Gods Servant, than in
his being King of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wicked men are the Slaves of Corruption, and Vassails of
Satan, the Scriptures saith, they serve divers Lusts, and truly that
is an hard task: if a man cannot well serve two Masters, how
shall he serve divers, many.</p>
            <p>Their service is meer drudgerie and bondage. Two things
may justly discommend it; <hi>viz.</hi> they have dirty works, and
they shall have dreadful wages; their works foul them, and
their wages undoe them.</p>
            <p>But you, O Saints, are the Servants of God, and you are so
upon a threefold account, besides that of your Creation.</p>
            <p>First, Upon the account of your Redemption, which was
brought about by the power of Christ, who rescued you out
of the clutches of sin and Satan. <hi>Luk. 1. 74. He hath delivered
us out of the hands of our Enemies, that we might serve him without
fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You are Gods Servants upon the score of purchase,
that Jesus who purchased Heaven and Glory for you, hath also
purchased you for himself, and the price which he laid down,
was no less, than that of his own Blood: and therefore it is your
unquestionable duty to glorifie him in your Souls, Bodies, and
Spirits. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You are Gods Servants by virtue of Covenant;
you have chosen one another, he hath chosen you for his people,
and you have chosen him for the Lord your God; an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been made and Indentures sealed <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38376:5"/>
               <hi>I entered into Covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou
becamest mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Remember and seriously consider then, whose you are,
and unto whom you belong. Study and acquaint your selves
with your Masters will, and knowing it, apply your selves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the performance of it; let your life be a life of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God; and whatsoever your hand findeth to do, as the
matter of his Will, be sure that you do it with all your might,
knowing that your labour shall not be in vain: and that it is most
highly reasonable you should be as industrious about the work
of God, as you have been about the work of Satan, as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
for your best Friend, as your greatest Enemy; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
for the saving of your Souls, as you have been for the
damning of them. And for your encouragement and quickning,
consider.</p>
            <p>1. First, That in the service of God there is perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
his Yoke is easie, and his burden light. You are never
so much your own men, as when you are Gods servants: You
are so his servants, as that you also are his Children: Your work
is cut out by the hand of a most tender Father, and therefore
it should be done with the Heart and Spirit of a Child. <hi>David</hi>
resolved to run the way of God's Commandements.</p>
            <p>2. As you have the noblest work, so you shall one day have
the most glorious rewards. You may now do your work with
singing, you shall then receive your reward with admiring.
When you have done the work of Servants, you shall be insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the inheritance of Sons, where Christ is, there shall his
Servants also be, to behold his Glory, and to share with him in
it, for the Apostle assures us, that he and his people shall be
glorified together. And their work is not so difficult, nor are
their sufferings so pressing, but that their future Crown will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
excel them for its weight and splendor.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. I Observe. <hi>That Gods Servants must be at Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose,
and not at their own. Lord, lettest thou thy Servant depart.</hi>
I dare not stir without thy order, thou didst send me hither,
and here I must stay, until thou shalt please to send for me hence.
I am weary of being here, Lord wilt thou dismiss me, and
give me leave to be gone. It is Gods unquestionable right to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38376:5"/>
order out as he pleaseth concerning us, and that in these things.</p>
            <p>1. God may cut out for us what work he pleaseth, and lay it
either in active or passive obedience as he thinks good: Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Will is, we must not dispute, but obey it, and so be
like those ministring Spirits, the Angels above who do his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
yea, all his pleasure.</p>
            <p>2. It is Gods right to carve out our allowances, either a full,
or a scantie condition; abundance, or want to set us in a Palace,
or upon a Dunghil, to cloath us in Scarlet, or in Canvas, to give
us comfort or afflictions: We must be wholly at Gods finding.
Feed me, said good <hi>Agur,</hi> with food convenient for me, he
did not prescribe to God, but left God to judge what was
so.</p>
            <p>3. It is fit that God should measure out our time for us, and
bestow upon us a longer or a shorter day of life; we do not live,
nor do we die at our own pleasure, or at the will and pleasure of
men, but God. He is not only our Lord, but also the Lord of
our time. So <hi>David</hi> cheerfully acknowledged, my times are in
thy hands, to make them cloudie, or serene, halcyon, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous,
to prolong, or to contract them, as seemeth good to
him. It is an indubitable part of Gods Royal Prerogative to
order concerning us; and it is the unquestionable duty of our
place to submit to his Orders. Whatsoever he commands, we
must do, even as did the <hi>Centurions</hi> servants; if he said to one of
them, Go, he went, if he said to another, Come, he came.
Reason good we should do so, for all the Commandements of
God are Holy, and Just, and Good; And an Universal Cordial
Respect to them will evidence our sincerity, and secure us from
shame And whatsoever God doth, we must accept not only
kissing his Hand when it sweetly seeds us, nor only his Arm
when it graciously supports, but likewise his Rod, when it doth
smartly lash us. There ought to be no discontents, no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome
murmurings, nor immoderate excessive sorrows, when
he blasts our sweetest Comforts, or kills our dearest Relations;
yea, though he should do it with a violent stroak, for he may do
what he will with his own. When he destroyed <hi>Nadab,</hi> and
<hi>Abihu</hi> by fire in the very act of their sins, <hi>Aaron</hi> their Father
held his peace. He saw that God was provoked by them, and
angry with them, and therefore concluded it his wisest course to
be quiet. It is indeed extreme madness for the Clay to say to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38376:6"/>
to the potter, why dost thou so, or for the creature to contend
with his Creator. Such contendings procure us heavier blows.</p>
            <p>3. Doct. <hi>We may learn that Death is a departure;</hi> Lord!
lettest thou thy Servant <hi>depart.</hi> When a man dies, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves;
He doth not then go back again into nothing, but into
another Place, and into another State. Christ called his Death
a going away. <hi>Joh. 14. 28. Ye have heard how I sayed vnto you,
I go away.</hi> So Joh. 16. 7. <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go
away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you.</hi>
Our Death also is a going away.</p>
            <p>Those that make the longest stay here, must be gone at last.
A wicked man when he dies, departs out of his warm Climate,
and pleasant State, from his Friends and Riches, from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and Delights, into Miseries and Torments, which are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
and Eternal. And it is no wonder if such a man play
loath to depart, and Death be unto him a King of Terrors.
But when an Holy Gracious Person departs, he leaves all his sins
and enemies, all his troubles and sorrows behind him, and he
goes to a better place, and better company, and infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
delights: He enters into peace and into rest, and into the
joy of his Lord. He gets off from the stormy troublesome Sea
of this World, where he was so frequently indangered, and
baths himself in those Rivers of pleasure, which are at God's
Right-hand for evermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Let the consideration hereof quiet us, under those
Breaches which Death makes in our Families and Relations.
Though it be very afflictive to think, my dear Husband is gone,
my tender Father is gone, my loving and faithfull Friend is gone;
Yet this will lighten and sweeten that affliction, if we think whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is gone, from Earth to Heaven, from Troubles to Joy
and Glory, from us to God, Christ, the Spirit, Angels and
Saints above. Oh Blessed, and Everlastingly making Exchange.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Let the consideration hereof quicken us, the good
Lord grant that we all may frequently and seriously think of this
our departure, and industriously bestir our selves in order to a full
preparation for it. Oh let us get our work done before we go;
Christ did so: <hi>Joh. 17. 4. I have finished the work which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38376:6"/>
me to do, and now come I to thee.</hi> Mind; follow, finish that
for which you came into the World, before you are called out
of the World. Oh! get your evidences full and fair, that when
Death siezeth upon you, you may lay hold upon Eternal Life.
Make sure of Heaven before you come to leave the Earth. How
sweet was it for Christ to tell his Disciples, I go to my Father,
and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</p>
            <p>Doct. 4. We may from hence learn this Lesson; <hi>That a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
in peace is exceeding desireable.</hi> This was the subject
matter of <hi>Simeon</hi>'s desire and prayer. Lord, lettest thou thy
Servant depart <hi>in Peace;</hi> He would go out in a calm, neither in
a stink through sin, nor in a storm through fear, but in an holy
peace. This promise was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of
the Faithfull; Thou shalt go to thy Fathers in peace: That is,
with a quiet, pacate and comfortable Spirit, with joy and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
without any trouble for what he should part with, and
without fear of any thing he should meet with. And you find
<hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 37. The Royal Prophet bids you, <hi>Mark the perfect
man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is Peace.</hi>
Whatever troubles he is encountered by, in his way, he hath
Peace at his end.</p>
            <p>A wicked man may dye in Stupidity, but not in Peace, he
may then be secure, but he is not safe, though he then have no
trouble, yet he hath cause enough of trouble. My God saith
there is no Peace to the wicked, neither in his Life, nor at his
Death. Such an one dies in sin, and therefore he cannot dye in
Peace, But now a Godly man, whose heart is sprinkled from
an evil Conscience, hath Peace in his Death, usually he hath
Peace with his own Conscience, that befriends him, witnesseth
for him, speaks comfortably to him, and is an excellent Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
at a dying hour; Always he hath peace with his God, they
are Friends; he is Reconciled to God, and God to him; <hi>Moses</hi>
dyed at the mouth of the Lord; God kist him home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> Well my Friends, I am confident you all desire such a
Death, you would willingly go out of the VVorld in peace.
Oh, let it not be only the matter of your desire, but likewise
of your endeavour, use means in order thereunto, and follow
these directions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38376:7"/>1. Make your peace now; Cease your enmity against God,
throw down your weapons of Rebellion, and return unto your
duty. How can those persons rationally hope, that God should
be a Friend to them when they dye, who are enemies to God
while they live, now, now, seek peace and ensue it.</p>
            <p>2. Make hast to Christ, make sure of Christ, get unto him,
He, and he alone is the peace, and the Prince of peace, there
is no peace to be had out of Christ. Let him saith God, lay
hold upon my strength, that is upon Christ, that he may make
peace with me, and he shall make peace with me. Have a care
that you be not found in your sins, nor in your selves, nor in
your own Righteousness, trusting in that; No, no, saith <hi>Paul.
Phil. 3. 8, 9. I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count
them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Look after a sanctifying change in your hearts and natures,
follow Peace and Holiness; Holiness both of inward Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of outward Conversation; Grace ushers in peace, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and peace go together, the work of Righteousness is peace,
and the effect of Righteousness is quietness and assurance for
ever. By the study and practice of Holiness you may lose your
peace with some men, but you will keep up, and maintain your
peace with God, yea, and with good men too. <hi>Prov. 22. 11.
He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips, the
King shall be his Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 5. VVe may from these words gather this instruction.
<hi>That a truly gracious man, may very well be willing and free, and
forward to dye.</hi> Thus good <hi>Simeon</hi> was here, he prayed for
Death; Let me depart, let me be gone out of this VVorld;
Do thou Lord send for me, that I may come to thee. And not
only so, but he also prayed for a quick dispatch, a speedy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
as one that was in hast to be gone: As you may learn
from that particle <hi>Now,</hi> now lettest thou thy Servant depart; He
did full well know, that he must dye one day, that was certain
and unavoidable, the Chambers of the grave are prepared for all
the living. but he would dye presently, now O Lord! now
without more ado; now without any longer tarrying. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man doth not care how long Death stays; he puts that day
far from him, because he looks upon it as a very evil day; But
good <hi>Simeon</hi> did not care how soon Death came, he lookt for it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38376:7"/>
yea, and he long'd for it, he thought it was too slow pac'd,
and its motions towards him not quick enough; He knew Death
would do him a good turn, and therefore he was a voluntier in
dying.</p>
            <p>And I must say this, supposing that a Godly man have no cloud
upon his Spirit, and no flaw nor blurr in his Evidence, supposing
that God shines upon his Soul with the bright and comfortable
Beams of his love and favour, and that his own Conscience doth
speak comfort to him plainly, I know no reason, no solid, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
reason why he should be backward, and unwilling to dye,
unless it be serviceableness and usefulness in the World: If once
a Christians work be done, what should he stay here for? If
once he be full ripe for Glory, why should he stand any longer?
It is not worth his while to continue here, were it not that he
may do good in his place, and be helpfull to others, and yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
serve the interest of Gods name and glory, and upon that
account he ought to deny himself, and be willing to wait yet lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for his Rest and Crown. Thus it was with Holy <hi>Paul:
Phil 1. 23. I have a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which,
is far better;</hi> It was better for him, he knew he should mend
himself; But saith he, <hi>ver. 24. Nevertheless to abide in the
flesh, is more needfull for you.</hi> They would need his company,
and his labours, his counsels, and his comforts, and upon that
account he submitted. <hi>Ver. 25. Having this confidence, I know
that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherance
and joy of Faith.</hi> And he was content so to abide.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is not any reason at all, why a wicked man should
be willing to dye, he can promise himself no good by it; It doth
not come Peaceably to him, it brings it's sting along with it; He
dyes to dye, his Natural Death is a passage to Eternal: He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
all by Death, and gets nothing; Therefore I say, there is
no reason at all why he should desire to dye. And there is but
one reason (I mean which is worth any thing, and which is not
easily answered,) why a truly Godly man should be willing to
live? And that is serving his Generation according to the will of
God. But I am sure, there are a great many weighty and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
reasons; why such an one should be willing to dye, and
not only submit to Death, but also welcome it, and long for it,
of which I shall speak more by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:38376:8"/>Doct. 6. A Sixth Instruction, which these words do most free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afford us, is this; <hi>That though a Godly man be never so desirous
to dye, yet it is his duty, and will be his business to stoop, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his will to the will of God.</hi> Thus it was with this holy man,
he was willing and desireous to dye, he even longed to be gone:
Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart, but he would not go
without license, he would stay Gods time.</p>
            <p>Though Heaven be never so desireable, and this World ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so troublesome, though the Country be never so pleasant,
and the way thither never so tedious: Be our sicknesses, pains
and crosses never so great and heavy; Be our enemies never so
furious and violent, our dangers never so eminent, our persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
never so sharp and bitter, our temptations never so fierce
and fiery, we must in patience possess our Souls, and be content
to bear them, till God shall please in his own time to command
for us, a deliverance out of them. Let our conditions be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so dark and dismal, we must not escape by opening the door
with the Devils Key, nor break out of Prison by offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to our own lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> had very dreadfull exercises, his State was sad and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
He was stript of all his outward enjoyments, bereaved
of his beloved Children, smitten in his body with sores and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,
his Wife was a cross to him, and his Friends cruel;
God himself carried as his enemy, and set him up for a mark to
shoot at; He had but one comfort left him, that was the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a good Conscience; Yet he was resolved to wait all the
days of his appointed time, untill his change should come. He
would not make more hast than good speed. As long as God
was pleased to tarry, holy <hi>Job</hi> was well pleas'd to wait. VVe
should write after so fair a Copy, so to do is both our wisdom
and our interest: For God is wiser than we, his VVisdom is
infinite, and his time is always best. He that goeth to his grave
in Gods time, goes as a shock of Corn in its season. God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
plucks his fruit, vvhen it is ripe and fit to be gathered;
He vvill not pluck it sooner, and it shall not hang any longer.</p>
            <p>Doct. 7. The seventh Doctrine vvhich these vvords afford us is
this. Gods promises are to be pleaded by us. Thus in the
Text; Novv lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy word;</hi> There is the argument that he useth for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38376:8"/>
enforcing his Petition. He had received a Revelation from
God, that he should not see Death, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he should not
die, he should not taste of Death, though he saw the Death of
others, yet he should not see his own Death, until he had seen
the Lord's Christ, the Messiah, or the Lord's anointed one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Jesus the Saviour. And now, saith He, Lord, now that I
have seen him, do thou graciously grant me my dismission. Be
it unto me according to thy word.</p>
            <p>Have you a word, O Christians, a word of promise, blessed
be God you are rich in them, God hath abounded in promises
to his people. You have words of inestimable value, words
better than Gold, better than mans bonds, words that are suitable
to, and cordial in every condition, into which providence can
cast you. Now then, what is your duty with reference to
these words, but to make use of them. It is pity they should
lie by neglected, as useless. Fetch them out as you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and live upon them, that when you are rich in promifes,
you may not be poor in comforts. You do deal disingeniously
with God, and unworthily with promises, unless you use them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If any one should propound this question, What is that
right and proper use which we should make of promises?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I Answer, Turn them into Faith and Prayer, make use
of the promises as food for your Faith, and matter for your
Prayers. Promises are the Life of Faith, by these things men
live, said good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and they are the strength of Prayer.
So then,</p>
            <p>1. You must believe the promises. Set to your Seal that
God is true, and faithful, that his Word is setled in Heaven, that
all his promises are in Christ <hi>yea,</hi> and in him <hi>Amen: i. e.</hi> of
a most sure and certain accomplishment; and accordingly do
you hope in them, and rejoyce in them, and rely upon them as
security enough; cast your selves upon the word, do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it's truth, do not doubt of its accomplishment, but firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expect the making of it good, whatever the Devil, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reason, and Flesh, and Blood suggest to the contrary. As
long as you have the assurance of a promise, fear not Enemies,
nor Difficulties, nor Dangers, but keep your way, and go on.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38376:9"/>
though there be Lions in it, and other Ravenous Beasts, worse
than they.</p>
            <p>2. Your business is to plead the Word, and urge it, and beg
of God, that he would be pleased to fulfil it. We never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
promises as we ought, until we turn them into Prayer,
and press God with them. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 27.
Thou O Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy Servant,
saying, I will build thee an house, therefore hath thy Servant found
in his heart to pray this Prayer unto thee.</hi> Thus <hi>Simeon</hi> did
here, <hi>let me depart according to thy word:</hi> and you frequently
meet with these expressions in <hi>Psalm. 119. Remember thy Word
unto thy Servant upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</hi> As long
as that word was remembred, <hi>David</hi> knew, he himself should
not be forgotten.—<hi>My Soul cleaveth unto the dust, quicken thou
me according to thy word.—My Soul melteth for heaviness, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
thou me according to thy Word.—Oh, let thy mercies come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, even thy Salvation according to thy word.—I entreated thy
Salvation with my whole heart, be merciful unto me according to
thy word.</hi> You see how good <hi>David</hi> was at it. He had a mind
to be answered. He could not indure to meet with a denying
God. A gracious Soul had rather lose his Comforts upon Earth,
than his Prayers in Heaven. One of the saddest groans that ever
such an one did utter, is, <hi>Lam 3. 8. When I cry and shout, he
shutteth cut my Prayer.</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> to prevent that, he strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his cause as much as he could, and so did bottom his Prayer
upon, and back it with a promise; then he knew himself sure
of acceptance and answer; for God could not deny <hi>Davids</hi>
Prayer, but he must in so doing deny himself too, and falsifie his
own word: and therefore observe, how he gets hold, and keeps
it, and wrestles. <hi>Psal. 143. 1. Here my Prayer O Lord, give
ear to my supplications, in thy faithfulness answer me.</hi> The good
man had the Covenant and Promises at that time in his Heart
and Eye, and thought he, now I may be bold, for I am sure
enough; whom ever he doth send away with a repulse, he can't
me; he is a faithful God, and therefore he will answer me, and
that according to the desert of my heart; in thy faithfulness an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me. And truly, Christians, thus we all should do, if we
would act wisely and advantagiously for our selves. Search the
Scriptures, and see what promises speak appositely to your case,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38376:9"/>
and take them, and carry them by Faith in Prayer unto God,
and there put them in suit. Lord, I want Faith, Patience, and
meekness; I am in such a difficultie, called out to such works,
assaulted with such temptations, environed with such and such
and such dangers, and thus and thus hast thou spoken, Lord
make good thy word unto me thy Servant. This, this is the
way to obtain, and as Princes to prevail with God,</p>
            <p>Doct. 8. The Eighth Doctrine which these words afford us, is
this. <hi>That Christ is God's Salvation.</hi> Good <hi>Simeon</hi> had been delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the sight of Jesus, and now saith he, <hi>mine Eyes have seen
thy Salvation.</hi> He is the Saviour whom God hath chosen in his
Wisdom, raised up in his Love, and sent with Authority. He
is not only willing to save, and mighty to save, but he is
also authorized, and commissioned for it.</p>
            <p>All our Salvation comes from Christ, both our Salvation from
Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal Evils. Our primative Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
from Sin, and from Wrath, comes from Christ. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
us from the guilt of Sin, by his Righteousness imputed to
us, and from the dominion of Sin, by the power of his Spirit
and Grace, and from the damnation which was due to sin, by
the sacrifice of himself, which he offered unto the Justice of his
Father. He rescued us out of the hands of Satan, <hi>as a tempter,</hi>
so that his fiery darts shall not mortally wound us, and as an
Accuser, so that his charges shall not take place, nor prevail
to our condemnation. He doth redeem his people from all their
Iniquities, and from Death, and Hell, and he will never leave
working, until he hath redeemed them from all their distresses.</p>
            <p>And all our positive Salvation doth likewise come from Christ.
It is he that reconciles us to God, that doth make, and keep the
peace between God and us. He doth give us our title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and our fitness for Heaven, and our possession of Heaven.
He giveth both Grace and Glory. He doth first infuse the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Grace, and then adds the Crown of Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He it is
that by his Spirit first breaths into them the breath of a Spiritual
Life, and then imparts to them that Life more abnndantly, and
then at last advanceth them to, and rewards them with Eternal
Life.</p>
            <p>The Scripture calls him the Captain of our Salvation, and
the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:38376:10"/>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Oh, how should we admire the goodness of God in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ to us, and for us; and how should our Mouths be filled
with his praises all the day.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with good <hi>Zacharias,</hi> in <hi>Luk. 1. 68. Blessed be
the Lord God of Israel, who hath visited, and redeemed his people,
and hath raised up an horn of Salvation for us in the house of his
Servant David.</hi> Specially you that have found, and experienced his
Salvation begun upon you; that whereas he is a Stone of stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to others, he is a Stone of support, a Foundation-Stone to
you. And whereas he is a Rock of Offence to Thousands, He
is a Rock of Salvation to you. Surely upon this score most inlarged
places are due to God, and comely for you. That man that
cannot be thankful for Christ, can be truly thankful for nothing.
That heart is cold indeed, which this exceeding Riches of Grace
will not warm, melt, and inflame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Look carefully to it, that you do not fail of this
grace of God, that you do not neglect this great Salvation. Do
not slight Christ, do not stand at a distance from him; for there
is not Salvation in any other. There is no name under Heaven
which is a strong Tower, in which you may be safe, but only
his: No Wings under which you can find healing and security,
but only the Wings of this Eternal Son of Righteousness; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be willing to accept of his help, and that upon his own terms,
which are most just and reasonable. If ever he save you, he
will not save you in your sins, but from your sins. He will be
sin's Death, if he be your Life. He will sanctifie you, as well
as well as save you. He will Rule you, and Govern you, as
well as save you. He will bring you to his Foot, if ever he
bring you to his Throne. God the Father hath exalted him to
be a Prince, as well as a Saviour, and he will be both, or
neither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Be sure to flie to this Jesus in all your dangers, and
distresses. When your Enemies without you are furious, and
fears within you are high, so that your hearts are almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed.
then run to this Rock that is higher than you. When
you find Corruptions are stirring within you, and you know
not how to master them; and when you find Temptations are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38376:10"/>
violent upon you, and you are not in your own strength able to
resist them, then go to Christ, and beg ye of him, that he would
be your Salvation. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> did, when he had a Thorn in
the Flesh, and a Messenger from Satan buffetting him, then he
besought the Lord thrice, and had this assurance, that Christ's
grace was sufficient for him, and Christ's power should be made
known in his weakness. And that gracious answer which was
given to <hi>Paul,</hi> may be an incouragement to you, and all the
people of God, to take the same course in the time of their need,
and as this is a most proper course, so it is most prevailing, for
the Lord is good to them that wait upon him, and to the Souls
that seek him. And if you will consult your own experiences,
they will tell you, that you get most of your comforts, and
most of your victories upon your knees. And our Lord Jesus
himself, by his own example directs you to this means; For
when <hi>Peter</hi> was to be Tempted, then Christ prayed.</p>
            <p>But there remains one thing more, very observable in the
words, upon which I shall more largely insist than I have done
upon all the foregoing points. The sight which this good man,
old <hi>Simeon</hi> had of Gods Salvation was the reason, why he was
so willing and ready, and desirous to depart, and take his last
farewell of this World. From hence I offer to your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this truth.</p>
            <p>Doct. 9. <hi>Those that have had a sight of Gods Salvation, may
very well be desirous of Dissolution, and think long till that happy
day comes, which will convey them into the other World.</hi> Some
men wish for Death meerly in a fret, or discontented fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They
meet with disappointments and crosses, and troubles, their
estates fail them, their trading grows dead, their friends unkind.
A Ship at Sea is cast away or taken by Pirates, they are vexed
at this and the other, and hereupon they are weary of Life,
and now, whether they be fit or no, they would fain dye, thus
it was with passionate <hi>Jonah,</hi> when that a Worm had smote his
Gourd, that it withered, and the Sun darted his scorching
beams upon his head, that he fainted, he wished in himself to
dye, and said in his hast, that it was better for him to dye than
to live. Poor man, he had been put out of sorts, and did then
quite forget himself.</p>
            <p>But this is very ordinary among people, as if every trouble
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38376:11"/>
of life should make life it self a burden. And as if, though our
comforts be consumed, it were not still of the Lords mercies
that we our selves are not consumed; And certainly, as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as it is, it is exceeding sinfull; It speaks a wofull impotency
and weakness of Spirit, yea, and there is in it a Spirit of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against God, when men would live no longer than God
useth them as they themselves please, and orders all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them according to their own mind and humour. If
we did but seriously consider the Sovereignty of God, and that
as we are his creatures, we must be at his dispose, we should
see reason enough to submit to him, and be silent under all his
providences. How great and how heavy soever our Cross is,
we should carry it patiently, and be content to bear it, so long
as our God will have us.</p>
            <p>But now a sight of Christ, and of Gods Salvation by Christ,
is a just and justifiable ground of such a desire, so that still it be
with submission to the vvill and good pleasure of that God in
vvhose hand our lives are. In the handling of this point I shall
do these three things.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shevv hovv or in vvhat vvays a Soul may see God's
Salvation.</p>
            <p>2. That one vvho hath had the sight of Gods Salvation, may
very vvell be vvilling and desireous to dye.</p>
            <p>3. And then improve it by vvay of use and application.</p>
            <p>First, What is it to see God's Salvation, or in vvhat vvays
doth a man or woman see this blessed sight. Unto that I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
this fourfold answer.</p>
            <p>1. There is an ocular vision, or a sight of God's Salvation
with the eyes of the body. This sight those Saints had, vvho
savv Christ, vvhen he vvas here upon Earth, and Tabernacled
among men, and vvho beheld his glory as the glory of the only
begotten of the Father; This sight <hi>Simeon</hi> had, vvhen his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
brought him into the Temple, then <hi>Simeon</hi> took him up
in his arms, and said, mine eyes have seen thy Salvation; And
upon that sight he was raised, and his heart so ravished, that he
vvas vvilling immediately to set sail for the other World; His
Soul vvas ready to take its flight, he thought he had lived long
enough, and had seen enough of these inferiour objects, he
cared not for beholding the vanities of the World any more.
Jesus in his svvathering bands did outshine Princes in their Robes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38376:11"/>
and Thrones. And having once got a sight of him, he thought
there was nothing else upon the face of the Earth worth seeing.
Having seen Christ upon Earth, he had a mind to go see God in
Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now this sight we cannot have, and we need not have it now.
In this respect the Lord Jesus is gone out of our sight The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
do contain him, and so they must, until the time come,
wherein there shall be the restitution of all things. And there is
not any necessity of our seeing him in this manner, we are no
losers by his absence. It was expedient for us that he went away,
for it was upon his going, that the Comforter came, who is to
abide with us for ever. All the work which Christ had to do
upon Earth, was finisht before he went away: what remains
further to be done, he can do it in Heaven, as he sits upon his
his Throne, at the right hand of his Father. And his bodily
presence would contribute nothing at all to our advantage and
comfort. We have a great deal more cause to please our selves
with the thoughts of his being in Heaven, by which we see that
justice is satisfied, yea, that he entred there as our Fore-runner,
to make way for us, and to take a place up for us, and that he
doth there ever live to make intercession for us And upon these
accounts, though now we see him not, yet believing, we may
very well rejoyce with joy unspeakable, and full of Glory. For
so in those dreadful days of Persecution, the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did as you may read in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>II. Therefore there is a mental, or intellectual Vision. A seeing
of Gods Salvation with a spiritual Eye, the Eye of the Soul, the
Eye of Faith, which can see things remote, yea, at the greatest
distance both of time and place. It is the substance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for, and the evidence of things not seen. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Faith
can wade through the greatest difficulties, and look through the
thickest Clouds, and grossest darkness, it can see within the
Vail, and behold those invisible glories which are there.</p>
            <p>That Speech of our Saviour to his Disciples, is applicable to
our present purpose, and richly worth your Consideration. <hi>John
14. 19. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more, but ye see
me, because I live, ye shall live also.</hi> The prophane, wicked, and
unbelieving world should see him no more; they indeed did then
see him, and were offended at him, they slighted and rejected
him, because of his outward meanness, yea, they hated him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38376:12"/>
with a perfect hatred, they conspired his Death, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quiet, till they had seen him cruified, and breath his last.
Well saith Christ, ere it be long, these wretches shall see me no
more. Since I am such a burden to them, I will ease them of that
burden. Since I am their torment and vexation, since I am an
eye sore to them, I will be gone, and they shall see me no more,
they shall be troubled no more with the sight of me, and they
shall be honoured no more with the sight of me. But saith Christ
to his Disciples, you see me; that is, you shall see me. The
Present Tense is put for the Future, to shew the certainty of the
thing. As you see me now, so you shall see me hereafter. And
that not only with your glorified Eye, with which you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
me, when we meet together in my Fathers Palace, where
you shall be like me, because you shall see me as I am, but also
you shall see me with a Spiritual Eye, even that of your Faith,
after my ascension into my Kingdom, you shall so see me.</p>
            <p>And it is observable, that Christ did call upon poor lost Sinners
to take this sight of him long before his incarnation, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Flesh. Thus in <hi>Isa. 45. 22. Look unto me, and be
ye saved all the ends of the Earth, for I am God, and there is none
else.</hi> Now when he thus commanded, and invited all the ends
of the Earth to look to him, you must understand it thus, that
they were to look to him with this Eye of Faith, and that before
he came to take upon him our Nature; and so again that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
place, which respects us Gentiles. <hi>Isa. 65. 1. I am sought
of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that sought me not.
I said, behold me, behold me, unto a Nation that was not called by
my name.</hi> In the same way still they were to behold him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by an Eye of Faith.</p>
            <p>And it was with this sight, that <hi>Abraham</hi> saw him Hundreds
of yeare before he was born. Our Saviour you know speaks
thus to the obstinate and quarrelsome <hi>Jews, John 8. 56. Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abraham rejoyced to see my day, he saw it, and was glad.</hi>
He saw Christs day, or Christ in his day, by an Eye of Faith.
Now, my Brethren in the same manner that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
others under the Old Testament saw Christ before he came in
the Flesh, true Believers now in New Testament times may and
do see him, though he be ascended into Heaven, and hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Flesh with him thither. It is by Faith we see Christ, by
Faith we apply him to our own Souls, and by Faith, that we eat
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38376:12"/>
his Flesh, and drink his Blood, and fetch from him Life and
Strength, Grace, Peace, and Comfort.</p>
            <p>There are two things which Faith is furnished with, and both
of singular use.</p>
            <p>First, Faith hath a long hand, that can reach a great way.
One of the Mighty Monarchs of the World was called <hi>Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
or Long Hand.</hi> Above all Creatures, Faith doth best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that name, there is nothing out of its reach; it can take,
and lay hold upon prophecies and promises, though they shall
not be yet a great while accomplished. <hi>Heb. 11. 13. These all
dyed in the Faith, not having received the promises, but having
seen them afar off, they were perswaded of them, and embraced
them:</hi> as far off as they were, these Saints by Faith got them
into their arms, and hugged them <hi>Babylon</hi> is yet standing, and
triumphing, but the Believers Faith looks into the Prophecie,
and saith, <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, it is fallen.</hi> This long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed
Grace can reach Heaven, it can lay hold upon the hope
that is set before it; it layeth hold upon Eternal Life; nothing
is too hard for Faith, to him that believeth all thing are possible,
and nothing is too high for Faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith hath a quick, strong, and piercing Eye, it
can see up to Heaven and it can see into Heaven; you find in
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. that <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned, yet when those stones were
showred down upon him, and at the last beat the breath out of
his body; yet they could not strike out the Eye of his Faith:
but that was quick still, and saw as well as ever; as you read
verse 55. <hi>Stephen being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
into Heaven, and saw the Glory of God, and Jesus standing at the
right hand of God.</hi> It was doubtless to him a most sweet and
comfortable sight, when he saw Devils incarnate upon Earth,
working his ruine; then to see God incarnate in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
his Faith and Patience, appearing on his behalf, and
standing ready to receive his Soul.</p>
            <p>Faith hath indeed an Eye, like the Eye of an Eagle. They
say, an Eagle can behold the Sun in its greatest splendor and
brightness, it can glare upon the Sun, and by that she tries her
young ones whither they be genuine, or no; Now Faith can
look Christ in the face, it can behold the Sun of Righteousness in
the highest Heavens, who is ten thousand thousand times brighter
than the Sun in the Firmament. The Evangelist tells us <hi>John</hi> 1.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38376:13"/>
               <hi>We beheld his Glory as the Glory of the only begotten Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
The true Believer may and doth by Faith see Christ in
Heaven more clearly and stedfastly than he can see the Sun in
these lower Heavens: For this Sun doth dazle, and weaken, and
blind the Eye that dwells too long upon it; for it is too eminent
an object for the Organ. But now the Sun of Righteousness doth
clear, and fortifie, and strengthen the Eye of Faith, so that the
more he looks, the better he sees, the more able he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the object, because he is thereby more assimilated,
and lusted to it. 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 14. We all, with open Face, beholding
as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
Image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There is a sight of Gods Salvation by the vertue, or help
of inward experience. The gracious Soul sees the Harvest in
the seed, the Topstone in the Foundation that is laid, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the design in the greatness of the preparation. In short,
he sees that which God intends for him by that which God
hath been already pleased to work in him. He doth both see and
feel Salvation begun in the Soul.</p>
            <p>For, my Brethren, we are to know this, and seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, that Salvation is not a thing wholly future, it is not only
after Death, and in the other world, but it is a thing present.
Heaven is to be had here, as well as hereafter, and he that is
not saved here, shall never be saved. He that doth live an utter
stranger to Heaven in this world, shall never enter into Heaven.
The perfecting and completion of the work is reserved for the
next life, but the inchoation and beginning of it is here, even
here the Saints Conversation is in Heaven, there be their
thoughts and affections; they walk with God, and have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with Christ.</p>
            <p>As soon as ever a man is sanctified, he is saved. When Grace
is first planted in the heart, Salvation is begun. When Christ
went home with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> he told him, Salvation is come to
thine house to day. When Christ comes to any heart, Salvation
comes along with him. Grace is glory in the Infancie and Bud:
and as Grace doth thrive and grow, and improve in the heart,
so the work of Salvation is carried on; therefore gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newings
are in Scripture called glorious changes. <hi>We beholding,
as in a glass, the glory of the Lord are changed into the same Image,
from glory, to glory; i. e.</hi> from Grace, to Grace, from lower,
to higher degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:38376:13"/>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Eph. 2. 5 When we were dead in
sins, we were quickned together with Christ, by grace ye are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
If quickened, and made partakers of Spiritual Life, the
life of grace and holyness, then saved. There is Heaven and
Salvation in the smallest quickenings, as there is the total sum
or bargain in the earnest, and the crop or harvest in the first
fruits.</p>
            <p>Observe also that place in the 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Who hath saved
us, and called us with an holy calling.</hi> If you be effectually called
then you are actually saved, not only in <hi>spe,</hi> but in <hi>re,</hi> not only
saved in hope but in deed. That person who is turned from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, is
passed from Death to Life, he is out of reach of eternal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
The same calling is to virtue and glory, and fo far as
that call doth carry a man on in virtue, so high, full so high doth
it advance and raise him up in glory.</p>
            <p>So that when once you do experimentally find this change
wrought in you, sin Crucified and Mortified in you, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Communicated to you. If you find that you are taken off
from the old stock, and ingrafted into the Lord Jesus Christ,
that you are in any measure (though never so small) made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the Spirit, Life and Grace of Christ, then you may
sit down in peace, and heartily rejoyce, for your eyes have seen
God's Salvation. A renewing change is a saving change, and my
brethren consider how much this should commend Grace to us:
Oh how should they desire it, and beg it, and use means for it,
who have it not, and you that have it, how thankfull should
you be, and how should you admire and bless God for it, since
there is Salvation in it, there is a blessing in a cluster, fullness
in Spiritual hungerings, Heaven and Glory in brokenness of
heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Lastly. There are the sights of Heaven in a
way of assurance, and this is the sight of, or the looking to the
perfecting and completion of this most great and blessed work
of Salvation. By assurance the believing Soul sees the matter
brought to an issue, and the top stone laid in the building, which
reaches as high as Heaven. The poor Christian in the midst of
enemies and dangers, and from his low condition, from his
Dunghill or Cottage, can look upon all the glory and happiness
above, and as great as it is, lay hold upon it, and claim it,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38376:14"/>
all this is mine; This God is my God for ever and ever; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will be my Everlasting home, and the Kingdom there my
portion, even as the Proto-Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> in a shower of
stones which fell about his ears, could see Heaven opened,
and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
himself with such thoughts; Thus Jesus stands yonder as
my Friend, my Advocate, and shortly I shall be there with
him.</p>
            <p>To the producing of this Assurance in the heart of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
especially in an high degree, in its fulness, there is required
not only the work, but also the witness of the Spirit. The
work of the Spirit in Sanctification, drawing the divine image
upon the Soul, breathing into it Spiritual Life, and implanting
in it a gracious and holly nature, and then irradiating and shining
upon those graces, that the Soul may see them, and see them
to be what they are, the true grace of God, he doth bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his own work, so that the Soul can say, the Finger of
God was here; This is not Flesh and Blood, this is more than
nature, this is grace indeed. This you read of in <hi>Rom. 8. 16.
The Spirit it self beareth witness with our Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we are the
children of God.</hi> There is the Testimony of our Spirits, our
Consciences, and the Holy Ghost doth super-add his; And in
the mouth of these two witnesses the thing is Established, and
the Believer is satisfied, and cryeth <hi>Abba</hi> Father.</p>
            <p>Take notice of that Prayer which <hi>Paul</hi> put up. <hi>Rom. 15. 13.
That they might abound in hope through the power of the Holy
Ghost.</hi> So that good hope through grace, and the abounding of
that hope, the fullness of Assurance is no other than a divine
work, brought about by the powerfull operation of the Spirit
of God; The Resurrection of Christ from the Dead is the
ground and reason of our hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Holy Spirit of Christ
is the Author of our hope. Now then lay these things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that person who seeth Christ by Faith, who doth expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
an inward change, and who hath the assured hope of
Heaven and Glory, may very well say, that his eyes have seen
God's Salvation.</p>
            <p>And the man that hath been blessed with such a sight, may
very well be free and willing to depart out of this World, to
bid farewell to present comforts and enjoyments, and welcome
Death in its nearest approaches. And this is the second thing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38376:14"/>
unto which I am now to speak, and he that considers what hath
been spoken concerning this sight, will easily see there is enough
in it alone to produce such an effect. But besides that there are
four other sights which will contribute exceedingly towards such
a willingness in such a person.</p>
            <p>1. This man seeth enough in the World to render that bitter
to him; There is Wormwood enough laid upon the breast of
the Creatures, and he tasts it. Here I shall not take notice of
those outward troubles and afflictions, in which he finds great
exercises for his Faith and Patience, though these are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and only things, about which the carnal unregenerate heart
is concerned. If there be no cloud upon his Tabernacle, no
thorn in his side, nor gall in his cup, he sings a lullaby to his
Soul, and concludes all well.</p>
            <p>But sin, sin is that which sowrs and imbitters all to a Godly
man, both other mens sins, and his own sins, without doors and
within.</p>
            <p>First, Other mens sins, that wickedness which the World
lyeth in; Oh, it goeth to his very heart to see the profaneness
and abominations of those among whom he is constrained to
converse, and how that blessed and most holy God, whom he
so dearly loves, is neglected, abused, dishonoured and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them. Upon this account it was that good <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s
Soul wept in secret, and Rivers of Tears ran down <hi>David</hi>'s
eyes, and just <hi>Lot</hi> was vexed from day to day with the filthy
Conversation of the wicked. Such men cannot take their rest
here, because the place is so shamefully polluted, and the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of others are such a stink in his Nostrils.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which doth yet much more pain him is his
own sin, a foul World without, and a wretched heart within,
the plague of that which is not perfectly cured, the sin that
dwelleth in him, the pravity and corruption of his nature, the
old man, that he cannot possibly shake off, that troublesome
old man, together with many and great Transgressions of his
Life. <hi>Hence</hi> such complaints and grounds as these, Oh, what
a wretch am I, should be so unmindfull of God, so unthankfull
to God, so unfruitfull before him? That I should walk so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of him, that hath laid such Obligations upon me. Oh!
that I should offend him so much, and glorifie him no more, and
serve him no better. Oh! this goeth near indeed, this is a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38376:15"/>
sword in his bones, a burden to heavy for him to bear, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from holy <hi>Paul</hi> that bitter cry; O wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from this body of Death! This is
my plague, but whence or by whom cometh my deliverance?
And when he considers that deliverance is wrought by Christ,
he blesseth God for him, and since a perfect deliverance is to be
brought to him by death, he thanks God for it, and this is one
thing that makes this grim Messenger so lovely and acceptable
to him, because he knows by that all the shackles of corruption
shall be knocked off, and he shall be troubled with sin no more.
When he shall once lay down the body of flesh, he shall also
lay down the body of sin and death.</p>
            <p>2. The Godly man sees enough to render all the comforts of
this present life cheap to him; So that he doth not love them too
much, nor value them at too high a rate: They are not so cheap
as that he doth slight and despise them, or is not thankfull to
God for them; He admires the goodness of God in all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
even the very least, the coursest garments he wears, and
the brownest bread he eats, and the meanest lodging, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
bed he hath. I am less said good <hi>Jacob,</hi> then the least of all
thy mercies.</p>
            <p>But they are so cheap, as that he is not unwilling to part
with them, or to go from them; Whensoever God pleaseth
he can part with them: The primitive Christians took joyfully
the spoiling of their goods, and he can go from them. <hi>Paul</hi>
desired to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, he could without
any regret or reluctancy leave the World behind him, so long
as he did see his God and Saviour before him. Those comforts
which God is pleased to afford unto his people while they are
here, are of two kinds; Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
            <p>1. God is pleased to afford unto his People outward Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
comsorts; These he hath in the creature from the hand of
common providence, which feeds and cloaths him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for him, and sometimes wrings out to him waters of a full
cup; But be his portion here never so fat, his outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
never so large, yet they are but low enjoyments, they
are but for a vile body, we do consume and wast, and will
shortly moulder away, and crumble into dust; Be they never
so delicious and pleasant, yet still they are perishing bread, it
perisheth in the using. And besides there is a snare in these
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38376:15"/>
things, so that we must use them with caution and fear; there is
a snare in Relations, and in possessions, a snare in Riches and
Pleasures, a snare in Worldly Honours and Dignities. Oh,
how often do these things divert the mind from God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
the thoughts, and deaden the heart, and embase the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and clog the heels, and hinder holy motions, these
are weights that press down, so that the Christian moves Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
in the way of God, and cannot do those things that the
would, nor any thing as he would; and it doth speak a great
deal of wisdom, and calls for no less care, so to enjoy the world,
and take the comfort of it, as to avoid the snare in it, and to
keep our selves unspotted by it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is pleased to give unto his people here inward
and spiritual comforts, from the hand of his Spirit, in the way of
the Gospel, and Gospel-Ordinances and Duties. He gives them
some clusters from <hi>Canaan,</hi> some <hi>Pisgah</hi>-sights of the Land of
promise, some praelibamens, and foretasts of those Pleasures
which are at his right hand for evermore; there are the kisses
of his Lips, the manifestations of his Love, the witnessings of
his Spirit, the unspeakable joys of Faith: and these are sweet
indeed, and inestimably precious to the gracious Soul. <hi>One day
in thy Courts,</hi> said <hi>David, are better than a Thousand elsewhere.</hi>
What a day of gladness doth a smile of God make, and what
melody is there in the sofest whisper of Divine Love. No such
day in the week, as that of a Sabbath; and no such meeting in
the World, as that with God at an Ordnance, it affords sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
beyond expression.</p>
            <p>But alas! Here is something to allay that sweetness; the good
man doth too too often find himself unfitted for these things, his
Soul is out of tune, he cannot hear, nor can he pray, nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
as he would, nor keep up so warm and intimate a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God as he would: Wandering, and dulness, and
deadness do adhere to his duties; and he blushes and mourns
to see and consider the iniquities of his holy things.</p>
            <p>And then again, he doth too frequently miss of that good
and comfort which he expects, and waits for, he goeth out full
of hopes, and returns home blank; He looks for much, but
gets little; he cannot see his Fathers face, that is covered with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38376:16"/>
a Cloud, nor can he hear his Saviours voice, for he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
himself, and is gone; he cannot find those kindly melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and warmings, and quickenings, and enlargings that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
but he goeth with a pittifully cold, hard, straitned, dead
heart; so that he begins to question Gods Love, and his own
Faith.</p>
            <p>If he doth at any time meet with his gracious God, and is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his doing so. If he can say, God was with me of a truth;
I have this day sate under the shadow of my dearest Saviour with
great delight, and his Fruit hath been sweet to my taste. Alas it
is but short, (<hi>Rara hora brevis mora</hi>) it comes but seldom, and
it lasts not long. It is but a little visit; and no sooner, it may be,
hath the gracious Soul done blessing himself in his enjoyments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but he sees cause to bemoan himself for his loss.</p>
            <p>But however it be with some particular Saints, upon whom
the Sun of Righteousness stands and shines, with constant beams,
yet this is most certain as to all the Saints, that the most sweet,
and full enjoyment which they have of God (while they are
here) the most pleasant and comfortable communion they have
with him, is but mediate. Christ looks upon him through the
Lattice, and they see him but as in a glass, darkly. All their
refreshings are conveyed by Pipes, they do not lie at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head.
When they are most present with the Lord, they
are even then absent from the Lord; and upon this account it
is no matter of wonder to see or hear that they are willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
a dark vision for a clear one, seeing in a glass, for a seeing
face to face; to exchange interrupt pleasures for permanent and
abiding ones, and mediate fellowship for that which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.
Love is an uniting affection, and is set for the strictest and
closest embraces of it's indeared object. And so a Soul that truly
loves God, cannot but desire to be as near to him as it can be,
and ready to exchange the comforts of the way, for the joys and
pleasures of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>3. He that hath seen God's Salvation, hath seen enough to
deliver him from the dread and terrour of Death; for this is
evident and obvious, that if Christ be any mans Salvation, it is
utterly impossible that Death should be his destruction. A man
that is in Christ is not out of the reach of Death, but he is secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the hurt of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38376:16"/>Take an unregenerate man, one that is a stranger unto Christ,
and he cannot see any thing in Death that should commend it to
him: It hath a dreadful aspect, and a worse issue; he hath cause
to fear both Death and its Followers: He is stript at Death,
and lasht in Hell. Death to him is a dark passage to outer and
endless darkness.</p>
            <p>But now as grim as Death looks, a Believer can easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
a great deal, that will make it lovely; even Death it
self hath its beauty; as thus.</p>
            <p>It is a conquered Enemy. Christ went into the Grave it's
strongest hold, and there he baffled it, broke its Chains, and
carried away its Gates; he disarmed, and unstung it; so that
Holy <hi>Paul</hi> did, and every true Believer may play with it, and
triumph over it; 1 <hi>Cor. 15. O Death where is thy sting, O
grave, where is thy victory, the sting of Death is sin, and the
strength of sin is the Law, but thanks be to God, who hath given us
the victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Though Death kill
the Believer, yet it doth not dammage him; and though it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
between his Soul and Body, yet not between him and
God: <hi>who shall separate us from the love of God in Jesus Christ
our Lord? Shall Death,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> no, saith he, in that, as well
as in other things, <hi>we are more than Conquerors through him that
loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay through Christ, death is not only conquered, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to all the Saints; it is now become your Friend, and
Servant, and doth you a real kindness, So that, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells
us, <hi>The day of your Death is better than the day of your Birth.</hi>
You came into the World crying, but you may go out of it
Triumphing, and with the voice of melodie. The Primitive
Christians did not array themselves in Sables at the Funerals of
their Friends; but in White, looking upon their Dying Day,
as the Day of their Nuptials. It was most terrible to Nature to
be torn in pieces by Wild Beasts, to die at a Stake, to breathe
their last in Flames, yet, in such a Death did they glory, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Martyrdom their Crown.</p>
            <p>What though Death carry you from all your present comforts,
it doth at the same time set you out of the reach of all troubles;
and as it carries you from comforts, so it carries you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts;
yea, to such comforts as are far better than those you
part with. It pulls down this decaying and tottering Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38376:17"/>
that a more beautiful and stately Fabrick may be erected.
It takes you out of your sorry Cottages, and carries you to those
Blissful Mansions which are in your Fathers House. The Grave
it self, though it be darksome and lonely, yet it is a good rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
place ever since our Lord lay there: He hath perfum'd it,
and made it both soft and safe. That Bed of Dust is now
better than a Bed of Down, or Roses. It is true, in the Grave,
though Christ's Body did not, yet ours must see Corruption,
they must putrifie, and at last be Converted into Dust; but
that Dust is more precious than Gold Oar, and shall accordingly
be most curiously preserved, not an Atome of it shall be lost.
And that Body which is sown in weakness, shall be raised in
power, and cloathed with immortality, and made like unto
Christ's own most glorious Body.</p>
            <p>4. And Lastly, That man who hath seen Gods Salvation,
hath also seen all things amiable, and desireable in the other
World, whither Death will carry him. He hath looked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Vail, and had a prospect of that better Countrey. There
hath he by the Eye of Faith seen incomparable beauties to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
him, an excellent Glory to adorn him, unspeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to delight him, the best of Friends to invite him, and an
innumerable Company of Angels and Saints to bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>There shall be nothing at all that may offend, nothing in him
to offend God; nothing without to offend him; nothing of sin,
and nothing of sorrow; no temptation, no affliction, no danger,
no loss, no frown, no fear, no sickness, no pain, no want; no
angry withdrawings, not one pricking Briar, nor one vexing
Thorn.</p>
            <p>But there shall be all things that you can desire, and are suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that glorious State unto which you shall be advanced, all
things that will contribute to your happiness and comfort. The
Scripture tells us, <hi>Psal. 16. That in God's presence there will be
a fullness of joy,</hi> and by consequence there can be no scantiness of
enjoyments, but pleasures for evermore, yea, a River of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
nay, a bottomless, and boundless Ocean of them; the
Infinite and Eternal God must himself be exhausted, before the
delights and pleasures of Heaven can be spent. Eye hath not
seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man
what God in the Mansions above hath prepared, and reserved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38376:17"/>
for them that love him. There is a feast of Love, a Crown of
Life, and Robes of Glory. There is <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, and
the joy of their Lord, which is too big to enter into them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they shall enter into it, and be filled, encompassed and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by it, as a small Vessel in the Sea.</p>
            <p>When once the gracious Soul hath set foot upon that coelestial
Countrey, and made its entrance into that stately and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Palace of the great King; he shall be not only filled with
satisfaction, but likewise rapt up into astonishment, and highest
admiration; What am I that God hath brought me hitherto?
And what were all my services, that they should be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
Oh, how light and inconsiderable doth he now think
all his former sorrows and sufferings, if compared with that
far more exceeding, and eternal weight of Glory.</p>
            <p>What low thoughts will he then have of the Skin-deep beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and transitory delights here below, on which the besotted
Children of men do so foolishly dote. And with what an holy
scorn, and indignation will he call to mind that pains men did
take for, and that eagerness with which they did pursue the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
vanities of the Earth, and how they scrambled for them,
and quarrel'd about them.</p>
            <p>And oh how doth he wish and long for that blessed day, in
which the Church militant shall be made triumphant, and
all his gracious Friends, all his Brethren and Sisters in
Christ, all the chosen and beloved of God shall be taken up to the
same place, that they may see what he sees, and be possest of
that which he enjoys. That so they may altogether contemplate
the glory of God, and be satisfied with the fruition of him, and
endear, admire, and extol Father, Son, and Spirit unto all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Lay all these things together, and you will easily see,
that there is great, yea, abundant reason, why those that have
seen Gods Salvation, should be willing, yea, desirous to depart
in peace, and to take their flight into the other world. And now
I come to shut up this discourse with some application.</p>
            <p>And in the first place this serves to shew us, what it is, that
above all things should engage, and draw out the vigour and
strength of our desires; namely, the sight of Gods Salvation.
My Brethren, I beseech you frequently to consider, that we must
all die, there is no shift for it. Death will not be bribed, and it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38376:18"/>
cannot be avoided. It is appointed for all men once to die, by
a Statute-Law enacted in Heaven, which admits of no repeal.
The aged Father of this Family is now gone, and the youngest
Child here must follow him sooner, or later.</p>
            <p>And is it not good for us to prepare for Death? Will it not
be our Wisdom? Will your Wisdom more eminently discover
it self in any thing, than in this? That so this King of Terrours
may not be terrible unto you; that you may not fear him, but
rejoyce in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will die uncomfortably, (this is past all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute)
you will die unhappily, if you die unpreparedly. Oh
the horrour that will sieze an awakened sinner upon a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bed!
When he shall think thus, my glass is run, my time is
spent, I must die, but alas, I am not fit to die. I must now
appear before my Judges, but I have not made my peace.</p>
            <p>Now then go on and consider, what is to be done by you,
in order to this preparation: A Life of vanity and folly will not
fit you; the more you sin, the more you sharpen the sting of
Death. An eager minding the World, and pursuing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of that will not fit you; the more you have indulged
your self in a course of prophaneness, the more afraid you will
be to die; and the more you have set your hearts upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures,
the more loath, and unwilling you wil be to die, when
you come to die, the love of the World will make you unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leave it; and Conscience of sin and guilt will make you
tremble at the thoughts of appearing before God.</p>
            <p>Turn away your Eyes then from beholding vanity, and pray
that they may be opened to see Gods Salvation. Oh, study
Christ, get an intimate acquaintance with him: Beg of God to
reveal him to you, and in you, that you may know him, whom
to know, is life eternal, and never rest quiet nor contented, till
you have seen him by an Eye of Faith, and laid hold upon him
by an hand of Faith, as one that loved you, and gave himself
for you; and have a care that there be not a <hi>(deceptio visus</hi>) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in the case, but look to this, that your sight be saving, and
the Faith you pretend to, the Faith of Gods Elect, that you may
upon good grounds (such as the Scriptures will warrant) appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
him to your selves, as your Lords and Gods, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Rest not in any thing till you find and feel Christ living, and
commanding in you; his Image drawn upon you, his Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38376:18"/>
in your hearts, and his Spirit poured out; Take not up with
a verbal profession, formal duties, and unblameable Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
common convictions, and some stirrings and flushes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
All this may be, and all come to nothing. Hypocrites
may go so far, and yet they do not go far enough, but after all
fall short of Heaven. It is not the form of Godliness that will
avail you, but the power, not a name to live, but the life it self.
God is not taken with empty shews and appearances, he is for
reality and truth in the inward parts; You can take but little
comfort from Christ dying without you, unless you find Christ
formed and living in you: notwithstanding the Death of Christ
you may be for ever lost and damned, unless you be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his Life. Remember and consider that expression,
<hi>Col. 1. 27. Christ in you, the hope of glory.</hi> When Christ dwells
in you by Faith, when he is in you by his Spirit, and by his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
then, and not till then is there a firm Foundation laid, on
which you may build the hope of glory; For hope so grounded
is good hope, such as shall never make ashamed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. The second use will be of Reprehension. Those are
blame-worthy, and deserve reproof, whose eyes have seen
Gods Salvation. Men and Women that do know the Jesus in
whom they have believed, and are made partakers of sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
saving grace, and have had the manifestations of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and Covenant love made to them, and are verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that it shall be well with them when they dye, and that
they shall go to Heaven when they go from Earth, and yet they
are loath to dye, and thoughts of their departure from hence
are afflictive to them.</p>
            <p>When the message of Death was brought by the Prophet to
good <hi>Hezckiah,</hi> he turned his face to the wall, and prayed,
and wept sore. And good <hi>David</hi> himself, though he knew
that God had made with him an Everlasting Covenant, ordered
in all things and sure, yet he cryed, O spare me that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
strength before I go hence, and he seen no more; He
would fain live a little longer, and see a few more days past over
his head.</p>
            <p>I do not wonder that wicked men are loath to dye, for they
get nothing by it, nay, they lose all by it, they are utterly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
and undone by it. Death takes them from all their good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38376:19"/>
things, jovial companions, and pleasant enjoyments, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them into that Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone.
Therefore who would think it strange that they should put from
them the day of their Death, which will be to them such a day
of evil. They have reason to desire Life, yea to say, I would
live always, because it is better for them to live than to dye,
if you kill them you spoil all. Such men may well say to Death,
as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Elijah,</hi> hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p>
            <p>But here is the wonder, that a Godly man should firmly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto this truth, that there is another life after this, and that
that life is unspeakably better than this; There is no compare
between the comforts of this and the glory of that, and they are
also confident, that when once they are absent from the body,
they shall be present with the Lord, and when once this frail,
uncertain, troublesome life shall come to an end, they shall live
that better life, when once they are got off this stormy tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sea, they shall bath themselves Eternally in those Rivers of
Pleasures, which are at God's Right-hand; And yet Death is
a word that sounds harsh in their ears, they care not to hear of
it: when they think of it they are troubled. A Deaths head
upon the board spoils the Mirth, and marrs the Feast, it doth
not only make them serious, that it should do, but it also makes
them sad and dumpish, and still they have desires that they may,
and some hope that they shall have a longer continuance in the
World, and draw out some more years, yet before they come
to the end of their line. I must and do most readily grant that
long life is a blessing, a great blessing, as such, it is the matter
of the promise, but withall know, Eternal Life is a greater
blessing, and he is no loser that lives but a little while here, and
then goes to live for ever with God. For gracious persons that
have seen God's Salvation, and know they have seen it, I say
for such to be unwilling to dye carryes two evils in the Bowels
of it.</p>
            <p>1. It is too great a magnifying of this present evil World,
an over-valuing of it, and a setting too high a rate, indeed an
unreasonable price upon the enjoyments and delights of it;
Your esteem of them are far above their intrinsic worth, what
will carnal men say, who stand by, and see how you are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the World, and unwilling to be divorced from it?
What have they reason to say, but that you find a great deal
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38376:19"/>
in it? You tast the fatness of the Olive, and the sweetness of
the Vine, and so think it is good to be here. Certainly this
speaks your setting your hearts too much upon the Creatures.
And hereby you do justifie and encourage them in their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
they are strengthened in their love of the World, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedness
to it; And also you do hereby cross and thwart God,
and run counter to him in one of his grand designs, which is to
wean his People from the World, and to take their hearts off
from creature delights, which do ingross so much of their time,
and cares, and do so much distract their thoughts, and embase
their Spirits, and hinder them both as to their service of God,
and Communion with him; And indeed, how indecorous and
unbecoming is it for Heaven born Souls to embrace Dunghills,
and for those that profess themselves risen with Christ to set their
affections upon those things that are here upon Earth; And for
you who are the children of God, and heirs of Heaven, to
mind carnal things. It is far more unseemly than to see the heir
of a Crown stopping Ovens, or raking Kennels.</p>
            <p>After these things, saith our Saviour, do the <hi>Gentiles</hi> seek,
that is, those who know no better, who are without God in the
World, who are drowned in the flesh, and understand not the
worth of an immortal Soul, and upon these things let them dote
still, alass, their portion is in this life, being Aliens from the
Covenants of promise: and having no hope. But as for you who
have been taught of God, who have heard of a blessed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
who have seen those invisible glories that are within the
vail, you should be disingaged from all inferiour delights, and
carry towards them with a Spirit of indifference, You should
use the world but do not love it, make it serve your occasions,
but suffer it not to command your affections; While you have
it in your hands, and in your chests, keep it out of your hearts.
The world is (as we use to say of fire) a very good servant, but
a very bad master. Things are usefull and beautifull in their
places, so is the world, but when it is in the heart, it is out of
its place, and then it is stark nought, and doth much hurt.</p>
            <p>2. For those who are the people of God, and do know they
are so, who have seen God's Salvation, I say for them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to dye is a great reproach and disparagement to those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which are above. Christians, you do hereby bring up an
ill report upon the Land of promise, as if the Honey and Milk
of <hi>Canaan</hi> were not so good &amp; desireable as the Garlick &amp; Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38376:20"/>
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what is the interpretation &amp; meaning of such a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
but that you fear it will be to your loss to exchange Earth for
Heaven, &amp; to leave delights Temporal for those that are Eternal.</p>
            <p>What shall I say, this averseness from Death, and loathnesses
to depart from hence is a piece of practical blasphemy, as if
these sorry cottages were better to inhabit than those stately Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
that these puddle delights, and muddy streams were more
delicious and desireable, than that pure River of water of life,
which is clear as Chrystal, and proceeds out of the Throne of
God, and of the Lamb, as if these childish and trifling vanities
did out-weigh and out-worth the glories which are above; And
these pitifull contemptible glow-worms did out-shine and obscure
the Eternal Sun of Righteousness; As if God would take you
from hence to your loss, and you should be better in a strange
Land than in your Fathers house; And the preparations that
God hath made for Eternity, are not so good as those that he
hath made for a short time, and so <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Peter, Paul,</hi> and the rest of the Saints departed, had better
have staid here, and now they are with God, do wish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with us again. In a word, it is as if the immediate and
full enjoyment of God would not be sufficient for you, you could
not find room enough nor goodness and delights enough in a
God, but you must go begging to the door of creatures, and
patch up to your selves an happiness with these small and sorry
shreds of being, and you have found more to live upon, and to
delight your selves in the drop of a bucket, than you can or do
find in the Ocean of goodness. I beseech you seriously consider of
these things, all these things lye uppermost, any one may see
them in such a persons unwillingness and loathness to dye when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God would have him. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. In the third and last place, this may prove a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
consideration, and staff of support in the hands of those
who labour under sorrow and continual heaviness of heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their departure of their gracious and holy Relations,
they are dead, and you carry as if all your comforts were dead
with them. This is certain that when God gives such blows, those,
that have any thing of tenderness, do feel the smart of them.
Breaches in the Family do make breaches upon the Spirit. When
<hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, Jesus wept; Mourning at Funerals is no Soloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,
but a lovely sight, so the sorrow be kept within those
bounds that reason &amp; Religion have set it: And where there are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38376:20"/>
such breaches, they call for binding up; We should all be as so
many good <hi>Samaritans,</hi> pouring Oyl into the wounds of the
Spirit, for the suppleing and healing of them.</p>
            <p>God hath been pleased to come into this Family, and break
the head of it, and cut it off; in taking him away, he took away
a tender Husband, a loving Father, a good Master, a dear Friend,
one that in these evil days owned God, his Waies, and People,
and kept a Church in his House, and his doors open, that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Souls might feed upon, and be refreshed with the bread of
life, which was there from Sabbath to Sabbath, delivered out
unto them. The death of such a person is a common loss, not
only to the Familie, but to the Country too, and because thereof
you are in Heaviness, and afflicted in your Spirits.</p>
            <p>Neither is this your case alone, but of many others. Death
rides in Circuit, and according to the Commission which it hath
received, so it makes it seizures, here in an Husband deprived
of the delight of his Eyes, there is a woman made a Widow,
and her Children Fatherless, Many a faithful, fruitful, useful
Christian is cut down, under whose shadow, and in whose sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
his Relations and Acquaintance did greatly rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Unto such I have something to say, that should prevail to the
silencing of them, and that is this, it is the will of God; the
great God will have it so. Thou wouldest have had thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
thy Wife, thy Father, thy Child lived longer, but
God would have him die now; and this should knock all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relings,
and murmurrings, and discontents down; for there is
all the reason in the world why God's will should take place,
and he should fullfil all his pleasure, and why our will should
submit, and give place to God's.</p>
            <p>And then I have something to say, that may quiet, &amp; satisfie you
under such a providence; for it is not enough for us that we be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
under it, unless we be also reconciled to it, &amp; at peace with it;
now in order thereunto, take these 2 particulars, &amp; consider them.</p>
            <p>1. They did see Gods Salvation before they did depart, and
so they dyed not under terrour, nor in doubt, nor at any uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
but in peace; before Death closed the Eyes of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
God had opened the Eyes of their Faith, and shewn Christ
to them, and his love in Christ; and you have reason to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
good things concerning them, even such as do accompany
Salvation, nay, to be now perswaded of their Salvation it self.
This was the reason of my choosing these words of <hi>Simeon</hi> for the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38376:21"/>
Subject of my discourse at this time, because they were the Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Song of our deceased Brother, the very last words he spake,
save some short, and holy Counsels which he gave to his beloved,
and most hopeful Son, and shall not this satisfie you: But then add,</p>
            <p>2. Now that those Holy ones are dead, they see those things
which they never saw; things that are most richly worth their
seeing; and which, as the case now stands with mankind, they
could not see without dying. They have those sights which
make the seer blessed, they are taken up to the beatifical Vision.
They do not see an end of all their sins and sorrows, nothing
shall defile, nor afflict them more, all filth, and all tears are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away; they see the accomplishment of all their hopes, the
fullfilling of all their prayers, the reward of all their services,
the Crown of all their sufferings.</p>
            <p>They see the excellent Majesty and Glory of that God whom
they had chosen, and do now behold his face in righteousness:
Neither is that sight terrible to them, as it was to <hi>Moses</hi> in the
Mount, so that he did exceedingly fear and quake. No, those
Holy Souls do see God, and live, and rejoyce; that sight is their
satisfaction, and delight. They see that Blessed Jesus, who loved
them, and gave himself for them, and washed them in his own
blood, and made them Kings and Priests unto God; yea, they shall
be like him, for they shall see him as he is. They do see that Holy
Spirit which convinced them, and sanctified them, who directed
them in their difficulties, strengthned them in their weaknesses,
assisted them in their duties, and most sweetly supported, and
comforted them in all their distresses. They see an innumerable
company of Angels and Spirits of Just men made perfect. In
short, they see that which Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard,
neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, namely,
that Glory, Kingdom, Inheritance, those Robes, Crowns,
and Thrones which God hath prepared for them that love him.
And the day is coming, in which they shall again see those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
(that at their flight to Heaven they left behind) in a better
State than ever. And you O Saints shall see them too, and
Christ with them, and then your hearts shall rejoyce, and your
joy no man shall take from you. Only, in the mean time, do you
live believingly, walk humbly, holily, and circumspectly; get your
Vessels filled with Oil, your Lamps burning, and your Loins girt;
make haste to the Kingdom of God, and be ye followers of them,
that through Faith and Patience do inherit the Promises.</p>
