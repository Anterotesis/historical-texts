            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To The Honorable the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes in Parliament Aſſembled. The humble petition of the <hi>Gentry, Clergy,</hi> and others Inhabitants, ſubſcribed of the Counties of <hi>Flint, Denbigh, Mountgomery, Carnarvan, Angleſey, Merioneth,</hi> being the ſix Shires of <hi>Northwales.</hi> As it was preſented this preſent <hi>March</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1641. Accompanied with thirty thouſand hands.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the preſent condition of the Church of England (in the publique liturgy thereof in the ancient liberties and forme of government as they doe now ſtand eſtabliſhed by law) hath been lately brought in queſtion, and manifold petitions from the ſeverall quarters of this Kingdome and other ſuch like addreſſes concerning the ſame have been preſented to this Honourable houſe.</p>
            <p>Wee his Majeſties faithfull Subjects in the Principalities and Counties of North-Wales whom it equally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and as ſtrongly tied in duty and conſcience, doe likewiſe preſume to make our humble Remonſtrance, and we doe it after a long ſilence and expectation joyned with ſome feares.</p>
            <p>And firſt, for thoſe things which concerne the publique ſervice of God as they be of neareſt importance, and we nothing doubt but you will take unto your tendreſt thoughts, ſo we doe earneſtly propound and proſtrate before you that dangerous conſequence of Innovation in matters of ſo high concernment: as we conceave and leave it to your owne great wiſedomes to Iudge, what ſcruples and jealouſies are like to ariſe, if we be taught a new and different way of ſerving God after a full perſwaſion of the lawfullneſſe of that which is preſcribed according to the word of God, not without the deliberate and concurrent approbation and Induſtry of the moſt learned of the Proteſtant Church of this and other Nations, and the poſſeſſion of ſo many yeares in the practiſe thereof, and al ſince the bleſſed time of Reformation.</p>
            <p>The meere report hereof hath already produced no good effect, breeding in the minds of ill diſpoſed perſons Inſolence and contempt, in others perplexity and griefe, not knowing how to ſettle themſelves, or forme their obedience in ſuch diſtractions and ſometimes repugnancy of commands.</p>
            <p>Then for the outward policy and forme of government, under the Iurisdiction of Biſhops, bounded by law and kept within their owne limits.</p>
            <p>It is as we believe, that forme which came into this <hi>Iſland</hi> with the firſt plantation of Religion here, and God ſo bleſt this <hi>Iſland,</hi> that Religion came early in with the firſt dawning of the day very neare or in the time of the Apoſtles themſelves, And in the ſucceſſion of all after ages the ſame hath been conſtantly maintained among us, and that without any eminent interruption or gaineſaying even till theſe our dayes.</p>
            <p>And now from the comfortable experience which we feele and which our Fathers have told us of the conveniency and moderation of this government together with the antiquity of the ſame (a ſtrong argument of Gods ſpeciall protection) we doe in all humility repreſent and pray that the ſame may be ſtill preſerved entire in all the parts thereof, profeſſing yet withall that we heartily diſclaime all ſcandalous Innovation and Popiſh corruption whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And we are the more incouraged in this ſuit, becauſe we finde it to be the unanimous and undivided requeſt and vote of this whole Country, who cannot without ſome trembling entertaine a thought of change. In all which we do not preſume to give any rules, but as it becomes us, humbly declare and open our owne breaſts, &amp; labour to deliver our owne ſoules in teſtimony of our Loyalties and diſcharge of our conſciences, who ſhall ever take comfort to finde the ſame way of honoring God, continued in his owne Houſe of prayer, the Lawes of the Land put to actuall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the peace and government of the Church preſerved, the rumord alterations declined, and the diſtractions already too viſible ariſing thereupon avoyded.</p>
            <p>And as we doubt not but your great wiſdomes will take care that our Doctrine, and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed ſhall be ſtill in force, and obſerved, untill by ſome abſolute Law, and the opinions of learned Convocations, or Synod (according to the Cuſtome of our prudent fore-Fathers in beſt times) it be otherwiſe ordained.</p>
            <closer>So ſhall we never ceaſe to pray for a permanent bleſſing upon your Counſells, and reſolutions, to the generall happineſſe of Church, and Kingdome.</closer>
