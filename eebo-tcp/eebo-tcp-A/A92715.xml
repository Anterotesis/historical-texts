            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have here the Life, Pranks, and Death
of one of the most unparallel'd Thieves in
theſe our dayes, as it was partly delivered
by himſelf, and partly by others that were
converſant with him in his Life. I have
forborn to tell you his petty Thieveries: but becauſe there
is one, which being his firſt, and as it were a Prologue to
his former Actions, I ſhall inſert it here; and thus it
was: Being in the Market-place, where there ſate a
Woman ſelling Puddings, he ſpies her, ſteps unto her,
and feigning himſelf deſiring for to buy, asks her the
price, ſhe told him; but ſpeaking to another Cuſtomer,
he in the interim ſlips as many as handſomely he could
into his codpiece, which having done, told the Woman, He
would not give ſo much; and thereupon left her. Upon
this good ſucceſs, taking himſelf to be one of Fortunes
Favourites, he frequently comes to Market: inſomuch,
that by degrees, from robbing of a Stall, he comes to rob
a Shop; from a Shop, to rob a Houſe; and from a Houſe,
even to dare to rob the Court: until his doings did at laſt
<pb facs="tcp:115591:3"/>
undoe him. Whether it was more for need, or more to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
other Mens applauſe, that thus he lived, I queſtion
which. But ſuch is the Policy of the Devil, that plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to undermine the frailty of a Wretch, he ſhews him
what it is to be admir'd; this ſpurs him on with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of acting ſomething that may make him famous: of
which he runs the hazard, and at laſt is taken: for ſo the
cuſtome of the Devil is, When he hath brought one in a
dangerous way, to leave him in the wolviſh jaws of death.</p>
            <p>Thus hath the wings of Fame flown away with many,
that not onely might have liv'd in the Callings wherein
they were educated, and contentedly; but died peaceably,
and ſo have liv'd, as not to fear to die, and took the
eaſier way to Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> in a Feather-Bed, and not a

            <p>I ſhall not ſtay you any longer at the door, which being
open, you may enter, and view the grandeſt Thief in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
but give me leave, before you wander further, to
give you a true account of what he left behinde him on the

a favourable Conſtruction of
your Proceedings (this day) towards

me that Liberty due to all Chriſtians, from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

freedom of ſpeech to clear the Innocent (at this
my hour of death) that now lie accuſed as being
privy to my Deſigns, and Conſederates with me

am to accuſe no man; no, no, Gentlemen, I abhor
the Thought, much leſs the Action of ſo horrid

willing and free to clear thoſe that are accuſed for
me; which it ſeems is my poor Landlord and

whoſe hard Face and cruel Deſtiny from my ſoul
I pitty, as much as my own, and do proteſt their
Innocency in all reſpects [towards me] whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
However, ſeeing it is my unhappy fortune,
<pb facs="tcp:115591:4"/>
to end my dayes upon this Gibbet, I humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Divine Hand of Juſtice, and deſire the
prayers of all good Chriſtians, to Almighty God,
earneſtly to implore a Remiſſion of all my ſins,
which are many; and enable me to fail through
this violent Storm and Tempeſt, that ſo at the laſt
I may arrive at the Haven of Happineſs, there to
caſt my Anchor of Faith, and lay hold on my Lord

the Executioner ſate ready to do his Office; and
having put the Rope about his Neck, Mr. <hi>Hainam</hi>
pulled out a white Cap out of his Pocket, and
giving it to the Executioner, he put it on the ſaid

File which he had hitherto concealed, he gave it

the Executioner laying his hand upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E was by birth an Engliſh-man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from an ancient Family, and
inſtructed in the rudiments of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
inſomuch, that at the Latine
Speech he proved a good Proficient:
and had likewiſe gain'd a ſmack of divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115591:6"/>
His diſcourſe was pleaſant, ſavouring
much of Scholarſhip and Wit; ſo that whoever
ſaw him, if they had a breaſt that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> harbour'd any
Chriſtian thoughts, would either pity his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or admire his parts. He was ever in his
childhood thus addicted, counting it a greater
credit to be thought wiſe enough to cheat, then
honeſt enough to hate it: And when maturity of
yeares had made him capable of a greater
Game, he findes acquaintance; which if ill, like
Tarre, ſtick where they touch; or, as it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the <hi>Mermaids,</hi> ſings a man into a trance, till
he dances into the mouth of dangers. Thus ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
from one degree of Miſchief to another, he
comes to be acquainted with one <hi>Allen,</hi> and, as I
ſuppoſe, with <hi>Hinde;</hi> which <hi>Allen,</hi> being a Maſter
Thief, and an ingenious Villain, would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
rob on the high-way in his Coach, who
would there ſit in the habit of a Biſhop, while
his men, which were the actors, making his Coach
their ſtore-houſe, becauſe unſuſpected, either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
or putting on a Livery, ride by his ſide in
the nature of his Servants: with which man when
<hi>Hainam</hi> came to be acquainted, having before loſt
the Conſcience, he now reſolves to finde out all
the cuſtomes of a ſinful life: And for his better
education, jonis himſelf to a band of other Villains;
who ſeeing him a forward man, and ſtout, were as
much deſirous of his company, as he was before
ambitious of enjoying theirs. With theſe having
now accompanied in ſome Exploits, it was as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to fall back, as it was facile to begin; but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115591:6"/>
not ſo much through their means, by forcing his
continuance, but by his own; who having taſted
of the Devils bait, and prov'd the pleaſure that
he found in ſin, could neither by intreaties of his
Friends, nor the inſtigations of abundance more,
be diſſwaded from his wicked courſes. Nay, had
he ſeen the Torments of a damned Soul pictured
before his face, or if it might be poſſible, the gates
of their infernal habitations opened to him, where
he might behold the Uſurer choak'd with his Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Gold; the Fornicators, and thoſe wretched
ſouls, that have worn out ſheets of lawleſs Luſts,
upon the Rack of ſteel; the Murtherer, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was fill'd with blood, now crying, water, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to quench his parched thirſt; or the Thief,
with nothing left him but his Miſeries: I ſay, had
he beheld all theſe, they would have ſeem'd but
fancies to him, and no more have touch'd him, or
to as little purpoſe, as a lighted Match does Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
when 'tis wet. Notwithſtanding, he was a
man compleat in parts and perſon; had he had
grace equal to his other endowments, he had been
the Mirrour of the Age. But it ſo pleaſeth the
Almighty wiſe Creator to diſperſe his bleſſings,
to ſome VVit, and to others Vertue; without
which, a mans wiſdome is but a deceiving Guide,
which leads him to the fatal Pit, as it did this man,
helping him, as we may too truly ſay, to a dead lift,
and only ſerved for a varniſh to his villanies, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him how to glory in his ſhame; as if it were
a Maxime to be learned, <hi>That he that feareth not to
ſin, may never fear to ſhew it:</hi> from which indeed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115591:7"/>
he would not be retarded: Nor could any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
be ſo prevalent with him, as to prove an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
to his nimble tongue: inſomuch that he
would often boaſt, That all the Priſons in <hi>England,

acquaintance of Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> one of the
Lords Servants: for his ſeveral courteſies (which as
a Prologue to his Villanies) he beſtowed on the

at his Lords; at which time <hi>Hainam</hi> ſo inſinuated
himſelf into his favour, that a while after, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be done without the others advice: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that coming to be ſenſible each of the
others minde, it was ſuddenly reſolved of, That
<hi>Hainam</hi> ſhould appear the next day at the Lords
outward Hall, where he aſſuredly ſhould finde
<hi>Herbert,</hi> to the end he might receive inſtructions
for the conveying away of the Plate after Dinner.
<hi>Now was the Sop fallen into the Honey-pot;</hi> it fell out
as pat, <hi>as a Pudding for a Friars mouth. Hainam</hi> had
his deſire, and <hi>Herbert</hi> his. The prefixt time,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115591:7"/>
when come, <hi>Hainam</hi> very gallantly attires him,
not varying half an hour from the time agreed
upon, but repairs to the Earl's houſe; where he
had not long continued, but it was notified unto
him, that the Earl had dined, and was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from one end of the Dining-room to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till the Servants had diſpatched, who were
then taking off the wrinkles from their bellies;
and moreover, that the Cloth whereon the Earl
dined, was taken away, and the Voider wherein
the Plate was uſually put, was ſet upon the Cup-boards-head.
<hi>Hainam</hi> having received this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
aſcends the ſtairs, which conducted
him to the room where the Plate ſtood, and where
the Earl was walking; who ſeeing a Gentleman
in ſuch goodly Equipage, and ſuppoſing him to
be a Friend to ſome Gentleman belonging to the
houſe, he courteouſly ſalutes him with a Conjee;
in which ſilent complement, <hi>Hainam</hi> returns the
like, and continued walking in the Room. The
Servants ſeeing a Gentleman walking there, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
him to be ſome Nobleman that came to
give the Earl a viſit. In this manner both parties
were miſtaken, and <hi>Hainam</hi> watching for the
Lords return to the other end of the Room (which
was ſomewhat long) he nimbly whips the Voider
full of Plate under his Cloak, to the value of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
pounds and upwards, and went away, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his journey to the ſide of the Bank, where he
preſently melted it into one great maſſe. The
Butler, according to his cuſtome, comes to fetch
the Plate, which he found miſſing. Then every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115591:8"/>
one was queſtioned, but in vain, no tidings could
be had, neither of the Plate nor Thief: Then the
Steward gets ſome Bills preſently printed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he diſcovered the Lords Arms, with other Marks
which was thereon, and cauſed them to be carried
to moſt Goldſmiths in <hi>London,</hi> and elſwhere, but
to no purpoſe; inſomuch that (to verifie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>He that hath once ſtollen, will ſteal again</hi>) the
former Thief was induced to a further progreſſe,
relying much upon his former fortune; ſo that
not long after, more goods were wanting: and
whether Heaven pointed out the author, I leave
to you to judge; but the Servants having ſome
ſuſpition of Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> cauſed him to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
queſtioned, who was ſo ingenious as to
frame no other anſwer, but a juſt Confeſſion;
which he thus enlarged, telling them, That he had
a ſum of Money of <hi>Hainam,</hi> for informing him of

               <p>AFter his Villanies had made <hi>England</hi> too
hot a place for him to ſtay his foot on, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115591:8"/>
journeys to <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> where being arrived in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of a Gallant, he viſits an eminent Merchant,
with an intent ſeemingly to wooe his Daughter.
The Merchant having the qualities of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
thought he could not in civility but give him
the welcome, if not of a Son, yet a Friend, or a
Gentleman; and to that end, with many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
on both ſides, urged him to chuſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
habitation then his own; and being a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he ſaid, it would redound much as well to his
benefit as conveniency. After many denyals,
which ſeemed barely of a complement, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the proffer; but alledging, Nothing could
more diſſwade him, then the ſmall hopes he had
of his gratuity, or his inſuſſiciencies of requital.
Having been now entertained, rather like a Prince
then a <hi>Picaro,</hi> with all the dainties of a furniſh'd
Table, he feigned himſelf inclinable to ſleep, and
ſeemed deſirous to take his reſt; and to that end,
was conveyed to his Chamber, where he lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
of his intentions, till the folks were bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
of which being by the deadneſſe of the night
informed, he ſoftly deſcends the ſtairs, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks
thoſe rooms where he diſcovered the richeſt
prizes; and having made up a weighty pack, in
the morning betimes he forſakes the houſe, puts
on another ſute of Apparel, and in that caſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
unſuſpected. The next day, every one, when
up, betakes himſelf to his uſual occupation, not
diſcovering the loſſe of any thing, till the day
was half-way ſpent: Then was there calling from
one to another, Where is this thing, and where is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115591:9"/>
that? Who ſaw the ſilver-Tankerd? who ſaw
my Miſtreſſe beſt Scarf, or my Maſters Gold Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
Every one had his anſwer ready tuned, <hi>Not
I,</hi> ſayes one; <hi>Nor I,</hi> ſayes another; <hi>Nor I,</hi> ſayes
a third: which ſounded baſely in the Maſter's
eares. But at eleven of the clock, every one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
at the Gentleman's long tarriance in his
Chamber: The Merchant ſends a ſervant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his health; who when he was at the door,
having no acquaintance with his Name, uſes no
other phraſe then <hi>Sir;</hi> which after his often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing,
he found no eccho: he aſſays the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which he findes in a bare condition, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtitute of its new-come-gueſt, but the very
ſheets whereon he lay, which were no mean ones:
Which when he had obſerved, he acquaints his
Maſter with, who needed then no ſpurs to poſt
him on; he preſently purſues him, by the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of his habit: but <hi>Hainam</hi> had made a ſhift
to change that, before they had cloath'd them with
their own; and having notice that he was purſued,
thought the beſt ſhelter was the Merchants own
houſe, for there none would ſeek him or miſtruſt
him. Thither he goes in his new-chang'd habit,
pretending he had ſome Commodities to ſell
which he had brought from <hi>England,</hi> and would
deſire him to give them houſe-room, for which
he would content him; not-ſo-much for that he
wanted money, and would therefore ſell them, but
becauſe he eſteemed an INNE no ſecure place to
lay them in, by reaſon it was free to all comers,
and the people unknown to him, as well as the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115591:9"/>
Merchant; but having a good opinion of him, he
would wholly relie upon his worth and honeſty.
To this the Merchant willingly conſented: ſo he
left him.</p>

               <p>THe next day he ſends one of his Companions
to this Merchant, whom when he ſaw, he told
him, His buſineſs to him was about his Son, a
youth which then he had with him, who he would
deſirouſly have to reſide with him in the condition
of a Servant: And having intelligence of his good
diſpoſition, and the Trade he drove, he would not
ſpare any moneys to give with him, that he thought
might in reaſon content him. The Merchant
greedy of gain, deſired him to leave his Son, that
they might have ſome experience of one anothers
humours; which he did, and went his way. About
a week after, <hi>Hainam</hi> ſends for this youth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of him what rich Commodities his Maſter
had in his Warehouſe; who having narrowly
eſpied, gives him a punctual information; and for
the better ſurety, brings with him his Maſters
Shop-book, wherein he noted what he uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
The which book <hi>Hainam</hi> peruſes, and
finding a Note of ſeveral Commodities, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115591:10"/>
one had lately left with the Merchant, to the value
of Four hundred pounds, he writes underneath in
the book, <hi>This is mine.</hi> And having an excellent
faculty in counterfeiting of hands, he writes ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the Merchants own fiſt, as followeth, <hi>Left
with me by ſuch a one</hi> (framing an Engliſh Name)
<hi>on ſuch a day, ſuch and ſuch Wares, delivered in the
preſence of</hi> F. M. <hi>and</hi> P. D. Which <hi>F. M.</hi> and <hi>P. D.</hi>
were the one the Merchants man, the other <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams;</hi>
both of which under-write their hands;
and moreover, makes a ſmall Note in a piece of
looſe paper, expreſſing the ſame words: which
Note he orders the youth at his beſt opportunity
to convey into his Maſters cabinet; and with ſome
other inſtructions he took his leave. The youth
return'd with the book to his Maſters home, where
he had not long been, but <hi>Hainam</hi> comes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
for his Maſter, who being then within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
runs out to him, as ſuppoſing he had brought
thoſe things he told him of: But contrariwiſe,
<hi>Hainam</hi> demands of him ſome of thoſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he left with him about a week ſince: The
Merchant was amazed, and asked him what he
meant: he anſwered, To have his goods. Quoth
the Merchant, I have no goods of yours in my
hands. No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quoth <hi>Hainam,</hi> ſure you have, Sir;
you cannot forget ſo ſoon. Quoth the Merchant,
You were with me, and told me that you had
goods, and would ſend them in, but I received
none: No? quoth he, this ſhall not ſuffice, I have
my Witneſſe of it: therefore let me have my
goods by fair means, or I ſhall publiſh your Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115591:10"/>
to the cracking of that little credit you
have in other places. But the Merchant ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
crying, He ſaw not his goods: Inſomuch
that <hi>Hainam</hi> fetcheth Officers, endeavouring to force
them from him. When the Officers were come,
the Neighbors likewiſe crowded in, every one gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a fair character of the Merchant. But after
<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> a long while, nothing could be done,
the one pleading as ignorantly, as the other impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.
Then they examine Witneſſes, who
both confirm'd it: the Merchants man ſaid, that
he by his Maſters order ſet his hand to ſuch a Bill;
ſo ſaid <hi>Hainams</hi> Servant. Then did the Merchant
ſtamp as if he was mad, ſwearing they had a plot
to Rob him; and were they examined, he feared he
ſhould finde ſome of them guilty of his late loſſe,
occaſioned by the ſubtile trick of his counterfeit
Son-in-law. But <hi>Hainam</hi> having now the voyce
of all the people there, who cryed, he was the
Owner, it was plain; he ſends for one of the chief
men in Authority, to whom they ſtated the caſe,
who admired at the Merchants ſtubbornneſſe, that
was ſo lately reputed ſuch an honeſt men; and
willed <hi>Hainam</hi> to open what Cheſts he pleaſed;
and if in caſe he would not deliver the Keyes, to
force them open. Nay, quoth <hi>Hainam,</hi> for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirmation, view his day-book, where if he
hath not croſs'd it out, you ſhall ſee his own hand,
his ſervants hand, and my ſervants; ſo that were
he the verieſt Knave in the world, there could be
no ſhifting of it: So reaches the Book over, which
he looks, and at laſt findes the Wares written in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115591:11"/>
a hand which the Merchant could not deny but he
ſhould know, but avowed he was ignorant of its
coming there. Then the Witneſſes were asked,
Whether they knew thoſe hands? who both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
They were their own: inſomuch that they
wanted little of either making the man mad, or
perſwaded him he had been ſo. And further, ſays
<hi>Hainam,</hi> if you will pleaſe to cauſe this Desk to
be opened, I queſtion not but you ſhall finde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bill of the Wares, which, if I miſtake not,
he lock'd therein. The Merchant in a rage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
He ſhould be hang'd for a cheating Rogue,
ere he ſhould look in his Cabinet or Desk; he
would not open it: Whereupon, the Officers broke
it open, and turning over ſome papers, finde this
ſame Bill: Then did they all rail upon him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly;
who, poor man, could hardly make any
thing audible but his Tears; but with much ado
would cry, Pray ſecure him, for I know he hath
a Familiar: This muſt needs be the Devils work.
And not being able any longer to withſtand the
Authority of the Officers, he ſuffered all the
goods to be carried away, and with them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
his houſe of ſuch an unworthy perſon as
his ſervant, who he ſent away to his Father, and
never heard of him after.</p>

I am ignorant of. The man being entred the

end of the Room to the other; who had no ſooner
turned his back, but <hi>Hainam</hi> following of him,

they found walking, who not knowing but that
they might have ſome real buſineſs with him, goes
unto them; and being come, they joyntly tell
him, That about an hour after that time, he might
expect their return, and then a fuller account of
their buſineſs. Having thus ſaid, they leave him,
who returned to his former walk; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
miſſing the ſilver Table, did miſtruſt them

could get down ſtairs, they were gotten clearly out
of ſight; and taking ſhip for <hi>Paris,</hi> could never

Chains he ſoon unknit; which he with eaſe would

with which he uſed to aſcend a houſe, by thruſting
them into any wall of ſtone or brick; which ſo
eaſily enter'd, that in a ſhort time he would end his
purpoſe. One of theſe Screws he takes, and windes
it into the Priſon-wall; then taking another, with
which he does the ſame a ſtep above the former,
and ſo a third; and by theſe Screws got up unto
the top: the undermoſt of which he pulleth forth,
and ſetteth it above the others. Being almoſt at
his journeys end, and earger to have his Name di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd,

buſie in his Counting houſe, deſired by his man, that
the Gentleman who attended to ſpeak with him,
would be pleaſed to come to him thither, who ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
was conducted by the Merchants ſervant to
his Maſter; where after ſome ceremonies, <hi>Hainam</hi>
took a ſeat, and ſo they fell to diſcourſe; but <hi>Hainam</hi>
who had ſetled his fancy upon ſomething more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him then the diſcourſe, which was three
bags of money which lay upon the Table (every
one containing 100 <hi>l.</hi> a piece) and eying them very

ſeal; and leaving no ſtone unturned to gain his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
made with his eye a diligent ſearch to finde
the ſeal lying any where in the Counting houſe, but
not perceiving any, began to draw to a concluſion of
his diſcourſe, and pretended he had forgot ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115591:22"/>
Merchant a neighbour of his from the ſame Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
at <hi>Cullen;</hi> deſires to be excuſed at that time, that
he muſt ſo abruptly break off their diſcourſe, and he
would wait upon him at ſome other time; the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
being unwilling he ſhould part without the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility

to ſtay and drink a glaſſe of new wine, which with
a great many complements he refuſed, but at laſt
yeelded, if that he would be pleaſed to honour him
with his company to the <hi>Antwerp Tavern</hi> behind the
<hi>Exchange,</hi> where he had appointed to meet with the
neighbour Merchant. At laſt they both concluded ſo
to do; but <hi>Hainam</hi> pretended he had ſome other
buſineſſe with ſome other Gentlemen at another place,
which he would only write a line or two to them, not
to expect his coming at that time, but would give
them directions how to finiſh their buſineſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and ſo deſired that he would be pleaſed to
favour him with a piece of paper, and a pen and inke,
with which he was preſently accommodated; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he took occaſion to write to one of his men that
waited on him, his full mind about the premiſes, which
when he had finiſhed, he deſired the Merchant to
lend him his ſeal to ſeal it, which he preſently took
out of his pocket (it being a ſeal Ring) which <hi>Hainam</hi>
well obſerved to be the ſame impreſſion with the ſeals
on the bags of money, with which he was well pleaſed,
then he made preſently another excuſe to make a
Poſtſcript to his Letter of ſome thing which then came
in his mind; which he did, adding his mind further
how he had projected to deceive the Merchant of
300 <hi>l.</hi> which when he had done, he ſealed his Letter
and gave to one of his attendants, and bid him make
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115591:22"/>
haſt with it, and bring him an anſwer to the <hi>Antwerp
Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Exchange.</hi> So the Merchant
having received his ſeal put it on his finger, and left
his Caſhkeeper in his Counting-houſe, and to the
<hi>Antwerp</hi> they went; where they had not long been,
but falling into diſcourſe of divers buſineſſes, came
at laſt to buſineſſes of Merchandizing, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
fell to praiſing of divers rare inventions and
curious workmanſhip, that at laſt the Merchant came
to praiſe the rare workmanſhip of his Ring, it being
preſented him from the <hi>Indies</hi> rarely graved; which
was the thing <hi>Hainam</hi> principally aimed at to diſcourſe
of. Humbly deſired him he would be pleaſed to let
him ſee it, which the Gentleman willingly aſſented
to, and ſeriouſly viewing of it, praiſed the rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Graver, that had expreſt an Angell
aſcending into the Heavens, threatning vengeance (as
was expreſſed by a flaming ſword in her hand) to a
man underneath her, adoring the Godeſſe <hi>Pecunia,</hi>
which <hi>Hainam</hi> exceedingly admired how rarely it was
expreſt; in the midſt of this admiration, his man
whom he had ſent with the pretended Letter came
in and deſired to ſpeak privately with him; in which
conference <hi>Hainam</hi> gave his man an account of what
he ſhould do for the gaining the three bags of money.
Which was thus neatly done, Sir, ſaid <hi>Hainam,</hi> I
cannot but admire the rare invention of the Graver
which hath done it ſo exquiſitly that no hand in the
world could mend it, nay equall it. <hi>Sirah Franck,</hi> ſayes
<hi>Hainam</hi> to his man, do you know Mr. <hi>Richeſon</hi> the
Stonecutter, that has the Stone a cutting for me which
the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> gave me; Yes and pleaſe your
Honour anſwers his man; pretheee go to him and bid
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115591:23"/>
him come hither preſently, I ſhall and pleaſe your
Honour. Away went the man (and by and by coming
again, as before the plot was laid) told his Maſter he
was at home, but had taken Phyſick that day, and was
in no capacity to go abroad. I am ſorry for that, ſayes
<hi>Hainam,</hi> but I will requeſt ſo much favour of this
Gentleman as to lend me his Ring to ſend to him, to
have him cut mine exactly the ſame impreſſion as is
this, ſo much ſayes he, I am pleaſed with the fancy.
Which the Gentleman readily did; and ſo <hi>Hainam</hi> bid
him make haſt, and go into <hi>Mark-lane</hi> and bid
Mr. <hi>T. H.</hi> come to him preſently, for he had waited
there two houres for him, and bid the Graver take
an exact impreſſion, but bid him not grave his ſtone
till he ſpake with himſelf. Away went his man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not a little pleaſed to ſee that he was like to poſſeſs
the Merchants ſilver; comes to the Merchants houſe,
and enquires for the Caſhkeeper, which when the
Caſhkeeper ſaw him, knew him to be the Gentlemans
man that went out with his Maſter, deſired to know
his buſineſſe, he told him his Maſter was at the
<hi>Antwerp Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and had ſent
for the 300 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Table in the Counting-houſe
ſealed with his Maſters ſeal, and there was his ſeal;
which when the man ſaw, he preſently delivered the
money and ſent his Maſter the Ring again. And the
man for fear the Merchants man ſhould profer to go
along with him to carry the money, told him, his
Maſter deſired him to perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the account he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up as ſoon as he could, and deſired to know
where he might have a Porter to carry the money;
one was called, ſo away they went together into
<hi>Birtchir-lane,</hi> and there he left the money and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115591:23"/>
the Porter, and ſo went to his Maſter and
carried the Merchant his Ring, and told his Maſter
all things ſhould be done according to his mind;
and alſo that the Merchant he ſent him to, was gone
to the <hi>Pie Tavern</hi> at <hi>Aldgate</hi> with ſome other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of his acquaintance, and deſired he would be
pleaſed preſently to come to him thither, which he
ſeemed to be angry at, and ſo with many comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at the laſt called for a reckoning, which the
Merchant would needs pay, and ſo parted. So <hi>Hainam</hi>
and his man went into <hi>Birtchin-lane,</hi> and took the
money between them and away they went, leaving
the Merchant to the protection of his angry Angell,
