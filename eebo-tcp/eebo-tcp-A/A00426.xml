         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

been good for thy Church, if his life had been ſpared
with the loſſe of many of ours: he was a deep chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,

M. <hi>Bolton:</hi> J admired him while he lived, and honoured

too heavy for my ſhoulders, and a very hard task
for thoſe who doe nothing els but ſtudy Oratory: all

earth; another way he was drawne with a deſire to
continue with his beloved brethren warring on

did incite him to long for the former: betwixt theſe
two affections the Apoſtle had a conflict, and he was
ſo perplexed, that he knew not whither to turne him,
he knew not what to chuſe. He was as iron betwixt
two load-ſtones, drawne this way firſt, and then that
way. We read that <hi>David</hi> was on a time <hi>in a great

was free and voluntary; his perplexity ſomwhat
concerned himſelf, the ſhunning of his own evill; but
the Apoſtles was for the good of others, which was
joyned with his own hurt. Behold here as in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective

is good, <hi>for there is no device, nor work, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
nor wiſdome in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> Vaine
hope of future performances hath undone many: ſow
thy ſeed whiles the ſeed time laſteth, if thou looke to

of torment? this preſent life is a time of working, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
running, ſowing, and godly living, after death is
the time of reaping, of receiving wages, garlands and
crownes; an unjuſt thing it is to detaine the labourers

Adverſaries do worthily confute; and how is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
that if he good in the old Law ſuppoſed then
dead, went firſt to torment, that they did not tremble
for feare of death? how could they (as they did) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in peace? and how is it imaginable that GOD
who appointed ſacrifices for all ſorts of ſins and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
ſhould appoint neither expiation nor ſacrifice

ſurely there appeares not to us any token of any ſuch

the ſoules of the righteous then were tranſlated into
a ſtate of happineſſe.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine being thus briefly cleared, we may
from hence draw many concluſions.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth that the ſoule dieth not with the

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23080:11"/>
but that the ſoule is immortall my Text proveth,
how elſe could it part from the body and be with
CHRIST, unleſſe it was a ſeperable ſubſtance, ſith the
body is not with CHRIST till after the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection?
whence is there is naturall confcience that
accuſing power for ſin, that feare of wrath, but from
this principle that the ſoule is immortall? never make
any queſtion of this, when thou dieſt, thy ſoule which
is thy better part dieth not, but is taken out of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as a candle out of a lanthorne, and immediatly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
either in bliſſe or in torment.</p>
               <p>Hence may we in the ſecond place conclude againſt
the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. The ſeule ſleeps not as the body.</note> which though they

of ſoules, till they be raiſed by the power of the LORD
at the laſt day? but how then could Saint <hi>Paul</hi> be with
CHRIST? but to ſay no more againſt theſe ſilly drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
I proceed.</p>
               <p>In the third place, that conceit alſo falls to the
ground,<note place="margin">3. Soules departed immediately ſee God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> which prevailed with many of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and with ſome later writers, that the ſoules of
the righteous ſee not GOD till the laſt day, but are kept
in certaine receptacles in expectation therof. I ſee
no profit to the Auditory by naming them; the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
if they pleaſe may read many of their names in
<hi>Sixtus Senenſis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sixtus Senenſis bibl. San. lib. 6.</note> But how then (ſay I) could Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

condemned by the Church, as robbing heaven
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23080:12"/>
for the preſent of its bleſſed inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hence alſo doth it follow, that though
CHRIST as touching his divinity is every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,<note place="margin">4. Chriſt abſent in body.</note>
for elſe he were not GOD, yet to us in this world
he is abſent as touching his bodily preſence. For,
what is it to be with CHRIST, but to be preſent
where CHRIST is bodily preſent? and againe, <hi>whiles
we are in the body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>wee are abſent from the</hi> LORD: the
Apoſtle then was ignorant of that unhappy perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
point which ſome ſeeme to defend, the ubiquity of
CHRISTS body, for howſoever his humane nature
(eſpecially in the ſtate of glory) is adorned with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
gifts, and advanced to the higheſt dignity,
honour and domination, yet doe the natures of
CHRIST perſonally united remaine diſtinct both in
eſſence, properties, and operations. Yea, and the m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
confeſſe that the divine properties belong to
the humane nature, not by any phyſicall transfuſion
from one ſubject into another,<note place="margin">Hannius tracta. de perſonâ Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, p. 12.</note> but it is only perſonall
and communicated to the humane nature by the grace
of perſonal union inſomuch that the humane nature (as
they ſay) is omnipreſent not in being but in having,<note place="margin">Philip Nichol. l. 1. de omniprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia bominis Chriſti, c. 6.</note>
not in it ſelfe but in the perſon of the word, and thus
do they in words at leaſt deny what they ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for.</p>
               <p>From whence likewiſe it followeth that there is no
Popiſh Purgatory;<note place="margin">5. Againſt Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> the fault is clearely remitted, and
ſo there can be no ſatisfactory torments required.
GOD ſhould (me thinks) but mock us, if they ſay true,
as if he ſhould ſay, I pardon thee thy offence, but I
will puniſh thee for it, I acquit thee of the debt thou
oweſt me, but not of the paiment: but why ſhould not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23080:12"/>
the ſoules of the righteous dying in faith be caried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
into heaven, as well as the ſoule of a man new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
baptized comming to that holy Sacrament in due
manner, and dying before he hath committed a new
ſin, although he was full of ſinne before? there is no
queſtion of this latter, and why ſhould there be of the
former? And if they cannot go to Heaven becauſe
GODS juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, what will becom of all
thoſe that die a little before the judgement? &amp; much
more is the difficulty increaſed in thoſe which paſſe in
a moment from mortalitie to immortalitie at the very
comming of JESVS CHRIST. But I marvel not if Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
do contend for this Purgatory, as being indeed
one of the beſt fires that ever the Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
have had for the heating of their kitchins. For let
this be granted that there is ſuch a fire, and that the
torments there and in the place of the damned differ
but in duration, and there are no torments in this
world comparable to thoſe in Purgatory; let their
Preachers tell their people ſuch a ſuppoſition as this
is, if a foule had beene tormented in Purgatory thirty
yeares,<note place="margin">Diſcipulus de tempore ſer. 60. litera B.</note> and had by an Angell a choiſe either to ſtay
in Purgatory one day long, or to returne into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and do this penance a hundred yeares together, to
tread only on iron nailes which will pierce the feet,
to drinke gall mingled with vineger, and to eat the
courſeſt bread, to be cloarhed with Camels haire, to
lie on the ground, and inſtead of a bolſter to have a
hard ſtore for a pillow, the foule would rather do this
penance a hundred yeares together,<note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 5.</note> then to endure in
Purgatory one day, faith their Preacher. By this and
ſuch like doctrines, the conſciences of their diſciples
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23080:13"/>
are ſtung as with Scorpions; and it is like a gift whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoever it turneth,<note place="margin">Pro. 17 8.</note> it proſpereth, then may they
work them like ſoft waxe by their charitable promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to apply the meanes for their eaſe and reliefe out
of the place of torments. What a wofull ſpeech was
that of our <hi>Richard</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Fox Acts pag. 249.</note> who committed his ſoule to
Purgatory till Doomes day.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, this Doctrine overthroweth their Popiſh
prayers for the dead,<note place="margin">6. Againſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead</note> directed unto GOD to eaſe them,
and free them from the paines of Purgatory, yea and
that kind of kindnes too which many that do profeſſe
the Orthodox doctrine, doe unwarrantably uſe in
words, and further, as a more durable monument of
their miſtake,<note place="margin">Balthaeſar Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Nota in diſputat. Taber. pag. 202.</note> do write upon the grave ſtones of the
dead, GOD be mercifull to the ſoule of this dead man.
For are they with CHRIST? then doe their prayers
bring no profit to the dead, but hurt to the living.
For to ſpeake the faireſt of them, 1. Such prayers can
be no better than an <hi>idle word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12 36.</note> 
                  <hi>for which we must give
an account at that day.</hi> 2. They are an injury to the
dead, and do vertually imply, that ſuch as pray for
them are not perſwaded they are in happineſſe for
whom they pray. 3. This practiſe although it might
be perhaps by ſome qualification juſtifiable in the
intention of the ſpeaker, yet may it breed danger in
the conceit of the hearer, who may turne thy volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
devotion to harden him in the dangerous error
of that opinion; if then no benefit redounds either to
the dead, thy ſelfe, or the hearer, its beſt to leave
thoſe formes of prayer which are made for the dead.
But ignorant perſons being reproved are bold to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in this fooliſh manner, what would you have us
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23080:13"/>
ſay of the dead, would you have us to revile or curſe
them? Oh perverſe minds! as though neceſſitie lay
upon you, either to pray for them or to curſe them?
Belike what diſpleaſeth GOD pleaſeth you paſſing
well: let us ſpeake of the dead as GODS Word tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us to ſpeake of them; ſure I am, it no where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
us to pray for them, nor furniſheth us with
the example of any Saint to that purpoſe, and yet were
their affections to the dead as good as yours. Cannot
you uſe ſuch formes of ſpeech when you fall into
mention of them, they are with GOD, they are at reſt,
they are happy, their memorie is bleſſed, unleſſe you
pray for them.</p>
               <p>But leaving now theſe Uſes of confutation, I come
to thoſe of inſtruction, which are indeed more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for our edification, and more ſutable to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
occaſion, and the firſt is,</p>
               <p>Feare not death (O thou righteous ſoul) overmuch;<note place="margin">Vſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note>
its one benefit we reape from the death of our bleſſed

death is called indeed by <hi>Bildad</hi> in <hi>Iob,</hi>

the moſt terrible,<note place="margin">Iob. 18. 14.</note> ſo it is to the wicked, or at leaſt there

to fetch them thither: but they that live conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
may thinke of death comfortably, and they may
ſing that triumphant ſong,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>O death where is thy ſting!</hi>
they may take this all-devouring ſerpent without any
hurt at all into their boſomes: they that have their
debts paid, dare go out of doores, and are not afraid
to meet the Sergeant; they dare looke on death, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23080:14"/>
welcome him as the King of heavens officer to give
them poſſeſſion of an everlaſting-inheritance; wee
feare our friends when they have a vizour on their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but put it off and we rejoyce in them. Excellent
was the ſpeech of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to the Nobles of his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which with threats and flatteries were ſent to him

nor am J afraid to die, becauſe we have a good
Lord. Doubtleſſe had we (beloved brethren) as much
faith on earth as there is joy in heaven, we would not
be afraid of death: this is the narrow paſſage betwixt
this life and our countrie: on this ſide the bridge we
have many troubles, many ſins, many feares, many
temptations of the Divel, which ſhould make us think
the worſe of our lives, and very willing to leave them:
but on the other ſide, we ſhall be freed from all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
from all ſin, from al moleſtation of the divel, and
ſhall be filled with all the joy our hearts can poſſibly
deſire. So that hitherto we may apply <hi>Sampſons</hi> riddle,

               <p>Secondly, this may ſerve to moderate our exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
mourning for our friends which die,<note place="margin">2. Mourne not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatly for the dead.</note> we hope in

our faces, or putting on mourning garments, ſo

how I ſhould know and be aſſured thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if thou art aſſured hereof, then haſt thou faith,
the maine and fundamentall grace,<note place="margin">1. Faith gives aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Chriſt.</note> not <hi>fundamentum

it juſtifieth, and alſo by a prudent obſervation of

that thou art juſtified by faith; thou haſt alſo the
attendant companion upon faith, that Chriſtian hope
whereby thou waiteſt on GOD till he accompliſh
all his gratious promiſes;<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.</note> if we come againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
as <hi>David</hi> did againſt the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi>

                  <hi>not with ſword,
ſhield and ſpeare, but in the name of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts,</hi> we
are ſure to conquer. If we have theſe graces and by

are we! Bleſſed is he that beleeveth the Lords words
to be all of them true, and bleſſed is he that waiteth
on him, till he manifeſts the truth of his words, that
believeth by faith that GOD is his Father, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by hope that he ſhould ſhew a fatherly affection to
him; who believes that ſalvation belongs to him, and
waites by hope til he enters into poſſeſſion of it: if this
then be the bleſſed frame of thy ſoule, that thou reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt

by word or deed; if thou lookeſt to ſee the face of
CHRIST the righteous Judge with comfort thou wilt
abandon fooliſh ſhame, and fond ſelfe-love, thou wilt

theſe are ſoveraigne helps to keepe us ſpiritually

               <p>Fourthly, often meditate on death, die as it were
daily in the diſpoſition of thy ſoule,<note place="margin">4. Frequent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on death.</note> and preparation

to thoſe that in their life time had their ſcpulchers in

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23080:21"/>

it is a great bitternes to the ſoule to diſpleaſe our beſt

               <p>Fourthly, is it not far better to be there, where we

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> if to be with CHRIST, is beſt of all, then (by
the law of contraries) to be with the divells in hell is

the haires of their heads to ſtand upright, what ſhall
then the terrour and feare of that dark lake be, which

               <p>3. Marke here and in the former verſe that our
Apoſtle ſpeakes as if his ſoule was himſelfe, and as if
his body was no eſſentiall part of man, this is not true
in propriety of ſpeech, and therefore is to be taken
improperly by a Synecdoche, <hi>Integri promembro,</hi> the
whole is put for a part, &amp; here for a principall part of
<hi>Paul,</hi> the ſame trope in the like phraſes touching our
Saviour CHRIST,<note place="margin">John 3. 13. &amp; John 6. 62.</note> is by a kind of Appropriation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Divines the Communication of properties;<note place="margin">Acts 20 28.</note>
and theſe arouſefull termes happily invented to cleare
theſe and many obſcure Texts of Scripture touching
our Saviour. But to returne to our Apoſtle: Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
conſiſteth of fleſh and ſpirit, or ſoule and body, and
yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, for him to abide in the fleſh is
more profitable for them. When hee died he was
with CHRIST; how? not with his body, but with
his ſoule: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is dead and hath ſeene corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
How? in body, not in ſoule. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſpeech abideth not in the fleſh, but his ſpirit a
principall part of <hi>Paul</hi> that is it which during the
terme of his naturall life abideth in the fleſh or body.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>More neceſſary]</hi> This is not ſpoken ſimply but
comparatively, it was not abſolutely neceſſary for
the Church that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould live, for GOD could
even then, as after his departure he did, provide other
Inſtructours to build his Church and Houſe, but yet
it was more neceſſary for their profit that he ſhould
live then die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:23080:26"/>
5. <hi>For you]</hi> But why more neceſſary? was it not
becauſe his appointed time to die was not yet come?
this is true, but perſonall. He mentioneth that which
concernes the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they might take notice
how carefull he was for them, and how thankfull
they ought to be to GOD for him.</p>
               <p>My life is more needfull for you, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

was, but he ſaith not only for them.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why then doth he only name them?</p>

then will become of you my poore children? it would
be better indeed for me to be with my husband, but
it would be worſe with you then now it is, for your

of his aſſertion being common, and the ſame in others
that they were in him, the doctrine is generally true
of every faithfull Paſtour, that they doe more good
to the living Saints while they themſelves doe live,
then when they are dead. The Word of GOD in the

in operation, able to caſt downe ſtrong holds and
whatſoever oppoſeth it ſelfe to it: though Satan be
the ſtrong man that keeps poſſeſſion, yet the LORD is

ſo in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time the Goſpell was come into all

GODS ſervants, even while Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was
alive, and after the Apoſtles by their Succeſſours as
they were Paſtours; as the ſoule in the body, ſo were
Chriſtians diſperſed in the world, even the Getuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

if he tooke it in hand? though the Apoſtles preſence
was but weak, and their ſpeech rude, and their words
diſtaſtfull and unwelcome to the world, yet did they
prevaile, or if they had been to preach to Infants and
children not ſeaſoned with inveterate idolatry, it had
beene no great maſtery to have brought them to the
faith of CHRIST, as it was no great glory to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
to vanquiſh the Indians, when <hi>Benzo</hi> the Italian
reported that he durſt be one of the 25. that would
fight with ten thouſand, nay with twenty thouſand
of that naked people: but the caſe is altered now, for
1. The Apoſtles were but few for number and of no
great reckoning in the world: 2. For the ſame men
to teach a ſtrange doctrine to believe on CHRIST
crucified, and to be ready to lay downe their lives
for him, if they looked to go to heaven. 3. To preach
to the world when many of them did ſeeke after wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and ſecular Philoſophy,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 5.</note> as did the Grecians,
many after ſtate policy and war, as did the Romans,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23080:27"/>
and all of them trained up in a long continued will-worſhip,
and damnable idolatry of a deepe die, yet
the Goſpell by the preaching of it, as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod
amongſt the ſerpents of the Magicians devoured
them all, and brought them to acknowledge allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

much more effectuall ſure is the Word preached to
produce morall vertues, and to enable ſome to doe

reaſon, though not obedientially with a pure intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to obey and glorifie GOD; preaching is a banke to
hinder the inundation of ſinne, and to keepe men in
outward conformity, this keeps calmeneſſe upon the
face of the Church and mankind, which otherwiſe
might degenerate into ſavage brutiſhneſſe. <hi>Herod</hi> was

Sun which ripeneth both the grape and the crab, it is

                  <hi>the devout men that buried Stephen

yet did devout men make great lamentation over <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</hi>
See the bowels of men indued with GODS Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
they are full of affection, full of tenderneſſe, ſo
that the ſtreames thereof do overflow the banks; and
good reaſon, they have fewer friends remaining,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23080:32"/>
and fewer helpers, fewer prayers are made unto

good, and from whom they may receive good. And
according to this preſent occaſion let us practiſe a
duty which we owe in regard of our deceaſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even to mourne: away with that Stoicall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which allowes not their wiſe man to ſigh or

ſorts with religion nor reaſon. No, we have
cauſe all of us to mourne, not you only of this Towne,
but your neighbours round about you, nay this
whole Country; and ſay as <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Elija,</hi> my father,
my father, the Chariots and the horſemen of Iſrael;
he by his faſtings, often and extraordinary prayers,
often hath ſtood in the gap, and mightily wraſtled
with the LORD to keep away judgements; and like
another <hi>Elijah</hi> hath left his mantle, or <hi>Dorcas</hi> her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the poore, ſome godly works, the fruits of
a ſanctified heart and braine behind him, and many
no doubt are ſtrangled in the wombe by his death
which ſhall never ſee light.</p>
               <p>Touching the beginning of his ſtudies,<note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> life.</note> they were
not ſo commendable as could have beene wiſhed, he
was tainted by his Schoolemaſter in his youth, and
continued a Papiſt in heart at <hi>Oxford</hi> certaine yeeres,
and reſolved with one<note n="*" place="margin">Sometimes a Cantabrigian and ſtudent in Chriſts Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> 
                  <hi>Anderton</hi> his ſchoole-fellow,
to have gone to the Seminaries beyond the ſea: but
GOD happily croſſed that deſigne, and effectually
calling him to the ſight of his ſins, and the light of
his truth, drew good out of that evill, and taught him
ſo much the more to deteſt Popery, and to diſcover
hypocriſie and diſſimulation in GODS worſhip and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23080:33"/>
in ordinary converſation above the ordinarie ſtraine
of Writers.</p>
               <p>How induſtrious a ſtudent he was in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
his many note bookes left behind him will beare
witneſſe, and how well reputed he was for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as his other exerciſes, ſo his publike diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before King JAMES will teſtifie.</p>
               <p>But Learning is nothing, Induſtry is nothing to be
praiſed before GOD without grace; grace hath the
preheminence and gives the luſter to all the reſt; the
LORD enriched his heart with a great meaſure of
grace, hence is it that his life was unſtained and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reproofe; though he was not freed from infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yet he was from crimes.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that he was ſo laborious in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
a true ſtudent he was all his daies, as appeares
by his library though great, yet very few bookes in
it which were not read over and noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and he attained that high ſtraine of grave elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
familiar to him, ſcarce imitable by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
you were twiſe a weeke ordinarily fed with
Sermons and Catechiſmes, and with the Expoſition
of Scripture on Holy daies which would have beene
acceptable, wholeſome foode I am ſure, to the moſt
learned auditory of the Land.</p>
               <p>And though he was ſo great a Clerke, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
yet was not he ambitious nor ſought great
matters for himſelfe, and he doth beſeech an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Knight,<note place="margin">Epiſtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to Sir <hi>Robert Carre.</hi>
                  </note> to whom he dedicated his laſt booke,

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:23080:33"/>
His heart was ſet on the right object, and the bent
of his ſtudy was for matter of Sanctification, both
of himſelfe and of his hearers,<note place="margin">Note.</note> for himſelfe he could
profeſſe (and O that all Prieſts and Paſtors could do
the like!) he did I ſay profeſſe to his comfort on his
death bed, that he never taught any godly point, but
he firſt wrought it on his owne heart; towards others
he was a powerfull inſtrument to batter the kingdome
of the divell, he was a downe-right Preacher and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no ſins, he made many an unconverted ſinner to
quake and to tremble at his diſcourſes, as <hi>Felix</hi> did at
<hi>Pauls,</hi> and caſt them into a ſtrong fit of legall humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation;
he was an inſtrument to pull many captives
out of Satans ſnares, many of you can ſtep forth and
ſay he was my ſpirituall father; he had a ſearching
Miniſtery to diſcover the hidden abominations of
ſin, to ſtrengthen and increaſe the graces of thoſe
that did ſtand, to quicken thoſe that languiſhed; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have cauſe to bleſſe GOD for him,<note place="margin">Philemon 19.</note> and <hi>do owe even
themſelves unto him,</hi> as <hi>Philemon</hi> did to <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this ſpectacle before our eyes all of us may
learne ſomething for our imitation: doth any one
prophane GODS ordinances by a diſſembled reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
let him forſake it, and flie from it as from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
(for, I ſpeake to the glory of GODS mercy, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

an upright heart, let him hold out to the end, run his
race and finiſh his courſe both in health and ſickneſſe,
for ſo did our deceaſed brother.</p>
               <p>A great man, great in worth is fallen in our Iſrael,

their duty,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 12, 19</note> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſed he would doe; let
us pity the caſe of all diſobedient perſons: let other
fiſhers, if they thinke good, fiſh for riches, or for
vaine applauſes; but let our chiefe aime be to deliver
a ſinner from the pit of deſtruction, and rather to
ſpeake five words in compaſſion to ſave a ſoule, then
five thouſand for any ſiniſter end whatſoever: the
ſoule of the pooreſt man is very pretious, and the loſſe
of it cannot be redeemed with a world, it is ſinne that
looſeth the ſoule. O how unhappy are all ſinners, how
miſerable! which would make GODS ſervants ſhed
rivers of teares if they thought adviſedly thereof,
and mourne over them as our Saviour did over <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 19 41.</note>
when he beheld their preſent ſecurity, and
foreſaw their future ruine,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou hadst knowne theſe
things that concerne thy peace,</hi> how happy hadſt thou
then beene? let us then be faithfull and laborious,
and ſo much the rather now ought we to be labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
to make up this breach for the loſſe of our
brother, if GOD enables us; the LORD himſelfe is the
heavenly teacher of this leſſon by a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23080:36"/>
in a like caſe. <hi>Moſes my ſervant is dead,</hi> now
therefore ariſe <hi>Ioſhuah—be ſtrong and of a good courage;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioſh. 1. 2, 6.</note>
this our brother GODS ſervant is dead, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who doe by the goodneſſe of GOD remaine yet
alive in a better degree then formerly, be faithfull in
our callings, let us be more induſtrious in reading, in
meditating, in conſcionable preaching, and in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
walking in the feare of GOD, that ſo we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
what we may our great loſſe by the death of
him; and truly we have great encouragements ſo to
do:<note place="margin">Ioſh. 1. 5.</note> for as GOD <hi>was with Moſes,</hi> and promiſed to <hi>be
with Ioſhuah,</hi> ſo will the ſame GOD, if we continue ſo
doing, make the ſame word good unto us, he will be
with us, <hi>He will never leave us nor forſake us;</hi> and when
this ſhort uncertaine,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note> vaine and wretched life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we are already aſſured, that every one of us ſhall
heare to our everlaſting comfort, that bleſſed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Well done thou good and faithfull ſervant, thou
haſt beene faithfull over a few things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>I will make
thee ruler over many things: enter thou
into the joy of thy</hi> LORD. Which he
for his mercy ſake grant unto
us all, <hi>Amen.</hi>
