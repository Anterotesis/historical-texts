         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>the Vow of</hi> DAVID (as seasonable I

of himselfe, his housholde

Motive me thinks were of weight suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

well knoweth) hath added to his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
singular precepts of this kinde;
by which hee as much surpasseth other
Kings, as Kings doe ordinary men, or
men the brute creatures. Yet I thought
it not amisse to adde therunto the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and precepts of that King who
received such a testimony from the
mouth of God as never did any; and
farre surpassed that, in reall acts, which
<hi>Xenophon</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> conceived onely in
imagination.</p>
            <p>This King then if you please to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

(which wee all hope and pray for) wee

the Psalmes seemeth to
challenge a kinde of preheminence
above the rest; inasmuch as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of it was not onely a Prophet
and a King, but a man after Gods

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3797:14"/>
quoted by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
then of any other of the ould
Testament. It was, and still is, more
usually both sung and read, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Iewish Synagogues, but
Christian Assemblies, as well by the
People as the Minister; &amp; that with
more outward reverence then any
other part of holy Writ. It is put for
al the Books of the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as
they are differenced from the law of
<hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44.
And lastly, more Sermons, Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
Meditations, Expositions, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narrations,
upon it have been made
and published, as well by the Iewish
Rabbins, as by the Doctors of the
Christian Church, then upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other scripture whatsoever. Nay,
the very Turks themselves swear as
solemnly by the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> as
by the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And in
truth, hee that hath either practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tried, or shall duly consider, what
a rich store-house it is of all manner
of Prayers, Precepts, Exhortations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3797:14"/>
and Comforts, how this one celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Fountaine yeeldeth all good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to bee knowne, or done, or
had; what a familiar introduction it
is to beginners, a mighty augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vertue &amp; knowledge in such
as are entred before, a strong confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to the most perfect; may
easily conceive the reason why it
hath in all Ages bin esteemed even
of the best and most learned, as a
rare and precious Iewell, worthy to
be laid up in that <hi>Persian</hi> Casket im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
with gould and pearle,
which <hi>Alexander</hi> reserved for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
Iliads. In regard whereof, our
good King <hi>Alured</hi> translated the
Psalter himself into his Saxon tong:
and one of the Emperours caused
this Book to bee bound up in a little
volume by it self, for the special and
daily use of himselfe and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
to serve them as a Manuall, &amp;
alwaies to attend them in their run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Library. And as I would not
sooner commend the reading of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3797:15"/>
book to a Courtier then this: so
would I specially commend this
Psalm to the carefull reading and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
meditation both of my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Master the Prince, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Followers. They shall both
finde their duties lively expressed in
it, as in a mirrour, howbeit it were
indeed first composed rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the former then the later, and
my present choice of it bee chiefly
intended and directed to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>This Psalme, by the consent of
Writers, is a vow of <hi>David:</hi> whether
made before or after his comming
to the Crowne, it is not certain, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
skilleth it much; but, that it is
a vow, all agree. Since then, for the
Person, the maker of it was both of
understanding and power to make
it; since, for the Matter, the thing
therein vowed is both lawfull and
possible; since, for the Manner, hee
made it both deliberately and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with advice and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3797:15"/>
and lastly, since the End of
it was to serve both as a bridle to
prevent and redresse sinne, and as a
spur to stirre him up and incite him
to vertue, and keep him close to the
duties therein promised: we are to
hould it not onely for a warrantable
but a commendable vow; nor only
commendable in <hi>David,</hi> but with
like commendation imitable by us
in like case. And as <hi>David</hi> made this
vow, so had hee speciall care to pay
it, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 15. willing others to do
the like, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50; it beeing indeed
better (as his Son tells us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 5)
not at all to vow, than to vow and
not perform. Yet in wicked vowes,
as that of the Iewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. or in
rash vows, as that of <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; <hi>Iephte,</hi>
that of the Canonists houlds true;
<hi>In malis promissis rescinde fidem, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi
voto muta decretum:</hi> In wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
hould not thy word, in shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
vows change thy purpose: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierome</hi> worthily censures
<hi>Iephte,</hi> that hee was <hi>in vovendo stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3797:16"/>
in praestando impius;</hi> naught in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such a vow as he did, but worse
in performing it.</p>
            <p>The thing heer vowed is either
generall, in the first verse: or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
touching his own Person, from
the second verse to the fift; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
his Attendants, Counsellers
and Officers, from the fift to the
eight; and lastly, touching the

            <p>The matter by him vowed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
is contained in the first verse;
<hi>I will sing mercy and iudgement: unto
thee, O Lord, will I sing.</hi> Wherein,
without any curious descant or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
wee may observe first the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of expressing this vow: it is by
way of singing, which implieth
cheerfulnesse and alacrity: for, <hi>Is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
merry, let him sing? Iames</hi> 5. And,
<hi>How should wee sing the Lords song in a
strange land? Psal.</hi> 137. As God loves
a cheerfull giver: so doth hee a
cheerfull vower. Secondly, the dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3797:16"/>
or rather the burden of this song:
<hi>Mercy and Iudgement.</hi> Thirdly, the
Person to whom hee both sings and
vowes: it is <hi>the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then of his maner of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this vow; <hi>I will sing.</hi> As anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and manifold as is the use of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 21.</note>
so excellent was <hi>David</hi> in the
use thereof; a thing which deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all Ages, and beseemeth all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states;
a thing as seasonable in grief
as in joy; as decent being added to
things of greatest weight and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as beeing used when men most
sequester themselves from action. It
is apt both to quicken the spirits, &amp;
to allay that which is too eager; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both to move and moderate all
affections: yea, such is the force and
efficacy thereof upon that very part
of man which is most divine, that
some have beene thereby indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to think, that the soule of man is
composed of harmony. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(to speak properly) of high and
lowe in sounds, a due proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3797:17"/>
disposition, whether it be by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
or by voice; our Prophet,
the sweet Singer of Israel, having
singular knowledge in them both, as
also in the art of Poetry, judged
them all, as very usefull in civill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
so in sacred actions and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exercises even in the house of
God it selfe not unusefull; leaving
behinde him to that purpose a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of divinely indited poems (how<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit
their metre in the originall bee
now unknowne) and adding unto his
poetry melody, both vocall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall,
by ordaining some of
the Levites skilled in musicke to
praise the Lord by singing and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on instruments, to the number
of foure thousand, 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 5. who,
divided into severall companies, by
course served the Lord in his Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
for the raising up of mens
hearts, and sweetning their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards God.</p>
            <p>The instruments they used in
praising the Lord are most of them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3797:17"/>
reckoned up in the last Psalm: all
which may be reduced to two sorts,
whereof one is called <hi>Negenoth,</hi> such
as made a sound by touching; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Nechiloth,</hi> such as being hollow
made a sound by breathing. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the musicall instrument began,
and the singing voice followed, and
then the song was called <hi>Canticum
Psalmi:</hi> somtime again the song was
first sung with the voice, and the
musicall instrument followed, and
then it is called <hi>Psalmus Cantici:</hi> of
which sort it seems was this Psalm,
both sung privately by <hi>David</hi> for his
better remembrance therof, and by
him appointed to bee sung publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Congregation; as for the
good of others, so thereby to oblige
himself the more strictly to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
thereof.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Davids</hi> time this singing of
sacred hymns was in use, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the songs of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
Exod.</hi> 15. and of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,
Iudg.</hi> 5. After him, his Sonnes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3797:18"/>
songs were no less then a thousand
and five, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 32. And one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
one of his we yet enjoy at this
day, by the name of <hi>Canticum canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi>
the Song of songs; setting
forth unto us the mystical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ &amp; his Church. Christ
himself and his Disciples, according
to the custome of the Iewes, sung a
Psalme, <hi>Mat. 26. 30. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
sung in prison, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. And,
to shew that it was a duty to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 19.</note> both S. <hi>Paul</hi> and
S. <hi>Iames</hi> not onely exhort us to it,<note place="margin">Col. 3 16.</note>
but give us rules for the practice of
it.<note place="margin">Iames 5. 13.</note> In consideration whereof, the
Church of Christ doth likewise at
this present day retain it as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Gods service, and an helpe
both to our edification and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
neither can they well bee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from profanenesse, who eyther
scorn to doo it themselves, or scorn
others for the dooing of it. I will
shut up this point with an excellent
speech of S. <hi>Basils,</hi> touching this use
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3797:18"/>
of singing psalms in Christian Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
or Congregations. <hi>Whereas</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the holy Spirit saw, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
is unto vertue hardly drawen, and
that righteousnes is the lesse accounted of,
by reason of the pronenesse of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to that which delighteth; it pleased the
wisedome of the same Spirit to borrow
from melody that pleasure, which, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with heavenly mysteries, causeth the
smoothnesse and softnesse of that which
toucheth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealth the treasure of good things into
mans minde. To this purpose were those
harmonious tunes of the Psalmes devised
for us, that they which are either in years
but tender and greene, or touching perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of vertue as yet not growne to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
might, when they think they sing,
learn. O the conceit of that heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher!
which hath by his skill found out a
way, that, dooing those things wherein
we delight, we may also learn that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee profit.</hi> And so I com from our
Prophets manner of expressing his
vow (<hi>I will sing</hi>) to the burden of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3797:19"/>
song, <hi>Mercy and Iudgement. I will sing
Mercy and Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ditty or subject-matter of his
song hee promiseth should bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
and grave, and useful; not light
and vain, or unsavory and fabulous,
much less filthy and unclean, fit for
nothing; but, as a sacrifice offred to
the Divell, to defile the mouth and
hart of the singer, to corrupt others,
and to offend chaste ears. For, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
words corrupt good manners,
much more lewd songs; which, the
more artificiall they are, the more
dangerous and pestilent are their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
the pleasantnes of their tune
with more facility and less suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
convaying their poison unto the
soule. <hi>Vse not the company of a woman
that is a singer and a dancer, neither hear
her, lest thou bee taken by her craftinesse,
Ecclus.</hi> 9. 4. To which purpose it was
not unfitly spoken by the Roman
Historian touching <hi>Sempronia</hi> a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
of Rome,<note place="margin">Salust.</note> that shee was
taught <hi>psallere &amp; saltare elegantiùs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3797:19"/>
quàm modestam decebat,</hi> to sing and
dance more gracefully then becam
a modest woman. Besides, these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and wanton songs and son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
as they serve the Divels turn to
convay poison into the minde: so
doo they abate the edge of the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
vigour thereof, bending and
turning it by degrees from a manly
martiall disposition to an effeminate
softness.</p>

skill in singing.</p>
            <p>Now, as the matter of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
song was not fabulous or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:
so was it not diffamatory or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
stuffe, impeaching any mans
reputation, such as the drunkeards
made upon him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 12; a lash
which the greatest Princes cannot
avoid, and the best sometimes feel:
but the knowne authors thereof are
by so much the more severely to
be censured, as they deeply wound,
and are hardly discovered. Finally,
the matter of his song was not his
own triumphs and victories, though
they were many and glorious, aswel
against strangers abroad, as rebels at
home; hee left that to others, Saul
<hi>hath slain his thousand, and</hi> David <hi>his
ten thousand.</hi> And thus having taken
a brief view what the matter of our
Prophets song was not, though too
too rife now-adaies both in Court,
and City, and Country; let us now
consider what it was: <hi>Mercy &amp; Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And first take them jointly: not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3797:20"/>
Mercy without Iudgement, nor
Iudgement without Mercy, but
Mercy and Iudgement both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like <hi>Rahel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> which
twain did build the house of Israel;
or like <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at the transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
of Christ, whereof the one
was the meekest man upon earth,
and the other the most zealous of
the Prophets.</p>
            <p>As the badge of the Ship S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ailed-in was <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> two
twinnes; so the badge of this Psalm
is <hi>Mercy and Iudgement,</hi> inseparable
companions: of whom it may bee
said, as our Prophet sometime spake
of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan, they were lovely
and pleasant in their lives, and in their
deaths they were not divided.</hi> The two
brightest Stars they are in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Majesty; the two fairest
Flowers, and choicest Iewels in the
Imperiall Crown; like the Carnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Lilly, the Ruby and the
Saphire, or the Carbuncle and the
Diamond, yeelding a mutuall and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3797:21"/>
interchangeable Iustre each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
They resemble not unfitly the
two supporters of the Kings armes,
or the two Seraphins stretching out
their golden wings over the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory;
or the white and red Rose
in the same Escutchion.</p>
            <p>We read,<note place="margin">1 Kings 7.</note> that <hi>Salomon</hi> set up two
goodly pillars in the porch of the
Temple, the one called <hi>Iachin,</hi> the
other <hi>Boaz;</hi> which signifie Stability
and Strength: such pillars of the
State are <hi>Mercy and Iudgement.</hi> The
Throne of the King is borne up by
them, as <hi>Salomons</hi> was with Lions of
Ivory on each side. Therefore, as in
one place it is said, that <hi>the Throne is
established by iustice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pro. 16. 12.</note> so in another, that
<hi>it is upheld with Mercy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">pro. 20. 28.</note> Iustice beeing
as the bones and sinewes in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
politicke, and Mercy as the veins
&amp; arteries. They are the two hands
of Action, the two eies of Vertue,
and the two wings of Honour. And
as the eyes, if they bee rightly set,
doo both look one way: so do <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3797:21"/>
and Iudgement;</hi> how-ever in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the vulgar they seem
to look contrary waies. And as the
Trebble and the Base accord best in

               </gap>ound tuneable in his song without

            </p>
            <p>The answer of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi>
is full of excellent instruction.
<hi>Vespasian</hi> asked him what was <hi>Nero's</hi>
overthrowe: he answered; Nero
<hi>could touch and tune the Harp well, but
in government sometimes hee used to
winde the pinnes too high, and sometimes
to let them down too lowe;</hi> thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating,
that hee applied Causticks
and Corrosives where gentle Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
would have served the turne,
&amp; again he applied Lenitives where
Corrosives were needfull. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hee administred Iustice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Mercy, and sometimes Mercy
without Iustice; Iustice without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3797:22"/>
Mercy beeing nothing else but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
like <hi>Esau</hi> red and rough, bitter
as wormwood; and Mercy without
Iustice, but fond pity &amp; foolish par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.
As Mercy then serves to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the edge and rigour of Iustice:
so doth Iustice, to quicken the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and sharpen the dulness of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
As Mercy without Iustice is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned:
so Iustice without Mercy
is hated.</p>
            <p>Astronomers conceive, that the
Crystalline Sphear, which they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be the waters above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
(mentioned in the first of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>)
is set next the first Mover, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
the heat thereof; which, by
reason of the incomprehensible
swiftnes of its motion, would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
set the whole world on fire.
This I take to bee but a fancy of
theirs: but Mercy, I am sure, is set
so neer Iustice, for the cooling and
tempering of it. <hi>Hee that iustifieth the
wicked, and he that condemneth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
they are both an abomination to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3797:22"/>
Lord, Pro.</hi> 17. 15. Now, he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
Mercy, but without Iustice,
will bee sure to justifie the wicked;
and again, hee that pretends Iustice,
but without Mercy, cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the righteous: but the right
mixture and true temper of both, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
the righteous, and condemns
the wicked. Which temper is by S.
<hi>Paul</hi> commended to the publique
Magistrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13: <hi>If thou doo well,
hee is the Minister of God for thy good;
but, to take vengeance of thee, if thou do
evill.</hi> And by S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
and second chapter, <hi>They are
sent of God for the punishment of evill
doers, and the praise of them that do well.</hi>
All precepts touching supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
are in effect comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in these two Remembrances;
<hi>Memento quod es homo,</hi> and <hi>Memento
quod es Deus,</hi> or <hi>vice Dei:</hi> Remember
thou art a man, remember thou art a
God, or in stead of God; the one to
bridle their power, the other their
will. From the former of which is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3797:23"/>
the acts of Mercy, and from the
other of Iustice: nay, the verie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
that they are vice-gods,
is sufficient to put them in minde of
both, inasmuch as <hi>Gracious and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
is the Lord, and all his paths are
Mercy and Truth, Psal.</hi> 25. Hee hath
not one path of Mercy, and another
of Truth: but <hi>all his paths are Mercie
and Truth;</hi> like Crimsin and White
Silk twisted together, or woven one
within the other. His red Cross of
Iustice is ever set in the white strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of Mercy; as the rod of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the pot of Manna were by his
commandement laid up in the same
Ark.</p>
            <p>Through the thickest &amp; blackest
cloud of his Iustice alwaies appears
some beams or sparks of Mercy: and
the clearest sunshine of his Mercy is
overshadowed with showres of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
What infinite Mercy did hee
shew in the redemption of mankind,
when he might justly have tumbled
them down, as hee did the Apostate
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3797:23"/>
Angels to the bottomless pit of hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and yet withall, what infinite Iustice
did hee express in the same action,
in laying the sinnes of the whole
world, and the punishment due to
sinne, upon the shoulders of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
best-beloved, and only-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son! And thus did his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
finde out a way for the making
of his Mercy and Truth one path:
much like <hi>Zal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Iustice in causing one of his sons
eyes to bee put out for comitting
adultery, according to a law newly
before made by himselfe; and his
Mercy, in putting out one of his
owne for the sparing of the other of
his sons, which the law also requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have been put out. Hence S.
<hi>Peter</hi> represents God unto us both
as a Father and as a Iudge, in one &amp;
the same verse, 1. 1. 17; to shew, that
he is mercifull as a Father, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
as a Iudge. So ought his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents

            <p>Having thus handled these two
Vertues jointly together, let us now
take a view of them single &amp; apart:
for, though they neither be, nor can
be, really and in action severed each
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3797:24"/>
from other, yet may they by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and imaginary abstraction. First
then of <hi>Mercy,</hi> because it is both
heer and elsewhere set in the first
place: and that not casually, but of
purpose, and by due desert; as <hi>Peter</hi>
is commonly first named of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
like the Fore-man of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
having a primacy of order before
them, though not a supremacy of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over them. And as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               </gap>ce: so
shall the Sentence of Mercy &amp; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
bee first pronounced at the
last Day. And it is a laudable custom
of Princes, at their first entrance to
their Kingdoms, to shew Mercy, by
hearing the mourning of the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and delivering the children of
death, by loosing the bands of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
by taking off the heavie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
by letting the oppressed goe
free, and by breaking every yoke of
former extortions. Thus, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
himself, as soon as the Crowne
was settled on his head, made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3797:25"/>
if there remained yet alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> on whom he
might shew Mercy, 2. <hi>Samuel</hi> 9. O
how fair a thing is this Mercy in the
time of anguish and trouble! It is
like a cloud of rain that commeth in
the time of drouth. But this <hi>Mercy,</hi>
heer spoken of in the first part of our
Prophets song, stretcheth further;
unfolding it self in <hi>Clemency,</hi> in <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,</hi>
and in <hi>Compassion:</hi> In <hi>Clemencie,</hi>
by pardoning malefactors; in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,</hi>
by releeving the afflicted;
in <hi>Courtesie,</hi> towards all. Of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I shall heerafter have occasion to
speak, in handling those words, <hi>A
froward heart shall depart from me.</hi> For
the present then it shall suffice to
commend unto your consideration
and practice the two former; <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi>
and <hi>Clemency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Compassion</hi> is a vertue, saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,

to delight in the rattling of

            <p>These bee the diverse tunes and
strains, the severall notes and steps
of <hi>Mercie's Song;</hi> then which nothing
is more pleasing in the ears of Men
and Angels, nothing more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto God. For, though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3797:27"/>
that he preferreth Iustice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sacrifice, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 3; yet of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
hee pronounceth, that Sacrifice
is no way comparable unto it: <hi>I will
have Mercy &amp; not Sacrifice, Mat.</hi> 9. 13.
Nay, of Mercy S. <hi>Iames</hi> testifieth,
that <hi>it reioyceth or glorieth against iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And our Prophet, that as the
<hi>Faithfulnesse of God,</hi> which is a part of
his Iustice, <hi>reacheth to the Clouds;</hi> so
doth his <hi>Mercy to the Heavens, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Clouds, Psal.</hi> 36. 5. Where
there is no Mercy to bee hoped for,
there men growe obstinate and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate:
but, where Mercy is expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there is Reverence and a filiall
Fear. <hi>Ther is Mercy with thee that thou
maist bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eared, Psal.</hi> 130. 4.</p>
            <p>And if Mercy breed Feare, much
more Love, the most kindly &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fruit thereof, the surest guard of
Princes persons and estates. Castles
and Fortresses, walled Towns, sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Arcenals and Armories, a Navy
of Ships, Troopes of Horse, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Foot, a masse of Treasure,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3797:28"/>
Ordinance and Artillery, cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him so safe a defence in the
day of trouble, as the Love &amp; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his Subjects, purchased by
dealing mercifully with them. As
then he expects Mercy at the hands
of God: so let him deal mercifully
with those whom God hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands. And as the Mercie of
God is over all his works: so let the
mercy of his most lively image heer
upon earth shine above all his other
vertues; above them, I say, but not
without them: for, though Mercy
bee heer set in the first place, yet is
it coupled with Iudgement, <hi>as milk
and blood that mingled stood. Iudgement,</hi>
like another <hi>Iacob,</hi> layes hould upon
<hi>Mercie's</hi> heel: and though <hi>Mercy,</hi> like
<hi>Pharez,</hi> bee first borne, yet instantly
followes <hi>Iudgement,</hi> like <hi>Zarah,</hi> with
his red thread about his arme. Nay,
without <hi>Iudgement, Mercy</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
in as much as by due execution
of Iustice upon particular members
<hi>Mercy</hi> is shewed in preserving the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3797:28"/>
whole body. And as filiall Feare is
procured by Mercy; so is unfained
Love by such Iustice. As Mercy
then is the more beautiful, the more
comely and amiable Vertue: so is
Iustice at times the more necessary.</p>
            <p>It hath long been, and still is, a
Question controversed between
Physicians and Philosophers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Braine or the Heart be the
more principal member; in as much
as the one is the fountain of life, the
other of sense: so mee thinks, when
I compare these two Vertues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Mercy</hi> is like the Brain qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the immoderate heat of those
spirits that are bred in the heart; but
<hi>Iustice,</hi> like the heart it self, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of those spirits. Now, because
I am to speake of the administration
heerof in handling the last verse of
this Psalme, I will pass to my third
and last part proposed in my Text;
the Person to whom this Song and
this Vow are addressed, and that is
the Lord: <hi>Tibi O Iehova psallam,</hi> to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3797:29"/>
thee, O Iehovah, will I sing.</p>
            <p>This Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> anciently
tearmed <hi>Nomen tetragrammaton,</hi> the
name of foure letters, was to the
Iewes so venerable, that they never
durst pronounce it (as fearing to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
it with their lips) but <hi>Adonai</hi>
(which also signifieth Lord) in stead
thereof. Of all the Appellations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to God in holy Scripture, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
reserved as peculiar to himself,
and never imparted to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
neither doo we finde it given
to God till hee had created man;
thereby to teach us, that as man was
by him made a subordinate Lord of
the other Creatures: so was he the
independent and absolute LORD
both of him and them.</p>
            <p>To this great <hi>Iehovah</hi> then, this
most Soveraigne Lord, this Lord of
lords it is, that <hi>David</hi> addresseth his
Song and his Vow. Hee was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a great Lord, the grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of a mighty and populous
Nation: yet he acknowledgeth this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3797:29"/>
Lord to bee by infinite degrees higher
and greater than himself, and himself to
be but a worm in comparison of Him.
First then, of his <hi>singing to this Lord,</hi> then
of his <hi>vowing</hi> unto him, and lastly of his
<hi>vowing and singing</hi> unto him <hi>Mercy and
Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee ought in our singing n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t so
much to respect the delighting of our
selves or others with the sweet tunea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of the voice, as to do worship
to God by it, and to edifie our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
It is both ryme and reason,
<q>
                  <l>Non Vox, sed Votum; non chordula Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica,
sed Cor;</l>
                  <l>Non Clamans, sed Amans, cantat in
aure Dei.</l>
                  <l>The Heart, not Harp; Devotion, not
the Voice;</l>
                  <l>The Lover, not the Lowd, GOD's
ears rejoice.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Not so much the Lute-string, as the
Heart-string; nor so much the shrill
Voice, as the zealous Affection, sounds
in the ears of God. And heerunto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
the Apostle; <hi>Singing and making
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3797:30"/>
melody to the Lord in your hearts, Eph.</hi> 5. 19.
And againe; <hi>Singing with a grace in your
hearts to the Lord, Colos.</hi> 3. 16: not to your selves,
but to the Lord; or, at leastwise,
rather to the Lord, than to your selves.</p>
            <p>Now, as hee addresseth his <hi>Song,</hi> so
doth he his <hi>Vow</hi> unto the same <hi>Lord,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne Counsell; <hi>Vow &amp;
perform to the Lord your God, Psal.</hi> 76. 11.
The reason is, because all Invocation is
due unto God; and a Vow is alwaies
joyned with invocation, either for the
obtaining the good wee desire, or the
avoiding the evill wee fear. Besides, it
is God only that knows the secret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the heart. As then in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
we pray unto him alone: so unto
him alone are wee to direct our Vows,
who alone is able either to punish us if
wee break them, or to reward us if wee
keep them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, a Vow beeing nothing else
but a promissory oath: as wee are to
swear by none but God; so are wee to
vow to none but God. And, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of an oath are, <hi>Truth, Iudgement</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:3797:30"/>
and <hi>Iustice:</hi> so are they also of a Vow:
<hi>Iudgement,</hi> for the avoiding of rash
vows; <hi>Iustice,</hi> for the avoiding of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vowes; and <hi>Truth,</hi> for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of such as are neither wicked
nor rash, but are made upon good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and tend to good ends.</p>
            <p>Finally, our Prophet both sings and
vows <hi>Mercy and Iudgement</hi> to the Lord;
thereby acknowledging GOD, as his
guide both in the entrance and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of all actions, so in speciall of
Mercy and Iustice; and that he would
exercise these imperiall Vertues not so
much to content himself, or to gratifie
men, as to please and glorifie God: not
so much because men expected it, or
commended it, as because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it, and would take account of
it. Concerning actions of like nature
done for humane respects, the Lord
hath said, <hi>they have their reward, Mat.</hi> 6. 2;
that is, acceptance, honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from men, because they are done
to men: but the Iustice &amp; Mercy, that
have God for their object, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3797:31"/>
to his glory, and set him before
them who is the searcher of hearts;
they, I say, receive their recompence
from God. Many times it falleth out,
that the Prince causeth a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to bee executed: the deed is good;
but perhaps he is moved thereunto ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with desire of revenge, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of suters, then with the detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and vileness of the fact: this work,
I say, in it selfe is just; for, the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
by his sinne deserved the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yet hee that doth it is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
unjust. So much doth vertue
desire to be cherished for her own sake,
or rather so much is God, the fountain
of all vertue, jealous of his honour, and
jealous also of our love, that hee will
have every thing, to the end it may bee
good indeed, referred unto himselfe,
and to the ends that he hath appointed:
as indeed all is taken and cometh from
him alone, and therefore should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to him and his glory onely; as
the rivers, derived from the sea by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
veins &amp; chanels, disburden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3797:31"/>
with full mouth into the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>To bee short: the Prince above all
should referre and approve his actions
to God, seeing that God alone, and not
man, hath set him up; and seeing also,
that hee is not to bee judged by men,
but by God. And now to conclude
this point: great and excellent things,
as wee see, are comprehended under
these two tearms, <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iudgement:</hi>
which are indeed the very summe and
abridgement of all that Kings should
either learn or doo. And, seeing they
are of so deep reach, and extend so far
as they doo, wee may thereby plainely
perceive, that it is no light charge To
be a King; neither is it an art easily lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
To rule well.</p>
            <p>Let not Mercy and Truth forsake thee:
binde them on thy neck, and write them upon
the table of thine hart: so shalt thou finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and good understanding in the sight of
God and man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 3.</p>

of his Vow: heer hee coms to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;

what hee would bee in respect of his
owne life and conversation. Neither
is it to bee omitted without observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that, before he come to deal more
specially about his publike Charge, he
first promiseth the orderly government
of his owne Person. He knew full well,

aright, if they meant by their counsell

so is the law a dumbe Magistrate,

And indeed this is the common course:

mens mindes, not so much by his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
as by his goodnes. The Evangelists
tell us of our Saviour, that hee spake as
one having authority; and the rather,
no doubt, because hee did as he spake:
whereas the Pharises lost their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because they tought and did not.
Hee then that expects and desires, the
people should doo as hee adviseth or

him to his face, that himselfe was the

they act their parts upon an high<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so is the least errour in their action pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
discerned; it beeing in every
mans eye. A small fault in them is as a
mole or wart in the midst of the face,
which cannot be hid. And as men most
greedily gaze upon the Sunne when it
is eclipsed: so doo the multitude more
willingly discourse of the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and vices of their Leaders, then of
their vertues; thereby hoping to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselves, &amp; to scape unpunished.
The best way then to have a Law well
executed, is for the Author of it first to
keep it himselfe in his owne Person.</p>

vitious Princes deserve of the State
they govern, in as much as they are not
onely corrupted themselves, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay
the poison thereof into the bowels
of the State; dooing more harme by
their example, then their sinne. Vpon
which considerations, no doubt, our
Prophet promiseth to begin at the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
&amp; to set in order the first wheel,
by the reformation of himselfe. <hi>I will
behave my self wisely in a perfect way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing hee vowes touching
himselfe, is wise behaviour; prudence,
not sapience; not wise contemplation,
but wise action. It is not wise thoughts,
or wise speaking, or wise writing, or
wise gesture &amp; countenance, will serve
the turn; but wise behaviour: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

are gracefull, but the other need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
For, as the Apostle saith of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Having a shew of godlinesse, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying

are in point of wisdome and sufficiency

adoo about small matters; using all the
perspectives of shifting they can devise
to make an empty <hi>superficies</hi> seem a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that hath depth and bulk.</p>
            <p>It hath been an opinion, The French
are wiser then they seem, the Spaniards
seem wiser then they are: and pity it is
they should bee sundred; but, if they
must needs, better it were to make
choice of a wise behavior without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
than of seeming wise without
behaviour suitable thereunto. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because as the conceptions, so
also the affections of the soul are more
lively and effectually charactered and
unfoulded in deeds than in words; in
as much as words may more easily bee
dissembled than deeds: and true vertue
consists not in knowledge, but in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3797:35"/>
at least as oft as occasion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
are offred, and means affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<hi>The hearers of the law are not iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the dooers thereof,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2; opposing doing to simple
hearing. And, <hi>Blessed are yee if yee knowe
these things, and doo them,</hi> saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
opposing dooing to bare knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
The end then both of hearing
and knowing, is dooing: it is the badge
of our Profession, the pledge of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
the assurance of our effectuall
Vocation, the fruit of our Iustification,
a special part of our Sanctification, and
the high-way to our eternal Salvation:
Faith, without it, beeing but a vain spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
and Hope, but a vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;
and Charity, but a vaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation.
Therefore, saith our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
as some Latine Copies reade it,
<hi>Prudenter agam,</hi> I will doo wisely. It is
a received axiome in Schooles; <hi>Deus
est remunerator adverbiorum, non nominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>
God is a rewarder of Adverbs, not of
Nouns. Their meaning is, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
not so much a good action, as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3797:36"/>
the dooing of it well. For, a man may
do that which is good, either by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
or by compulsion, or by starts: but, to
the well-doing of it, it is requisite, that
hee doo it both <hi>wittingly,</hi> and <hi>willingly,</hi>
and <hi>constantly.</hi> As then we have action
implied in the Verb: so have wee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and willing, and constant action
implied in the Adverb. And as such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the life of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so is wisdom,
of such action; being as it were the knot
in the string, the meddall in the chain,
the gem in the ring of Christian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
sitting as an Empress in the midst
of them, consulting, judging, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ordering things present, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for the future, by comparing
them with the by-past, prescribing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of time, and place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and manner, and measure, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
severall vertue; by failing in the least
of which, they lose both their name &amp;
their nature: Humility, not seasoned
with Wisdome, beeing but basenesse;
and Patience, dulnesse; and Zeal, fury;
and Obedience, slavish subjection; and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3797:36"/>
Bounty, wastefull; and Courage, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate:
but, above all, Mercy and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
require Wisdom. And therefore
our Prophet having tould us, <hi>I will sing
Mercy and Iustice;</hi> hee presently addes,
<hi>I will doo wisely;</hi> Mercy and Iustice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the two scales of the balance, &amp;
Wisdome as the beam between them:
Mercy and Iustice like the two eyes,
and Wisdome like the Optike nerve in
which they both meet.</p>
            <p>A good Chirurgion, as they say,
should have three properties; a Ladies
Hand, a Lyons Heart, and an Eagles
Eye: which may well serve as a fit Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
of these three Vertues, like the
three Sister-Graces ever dancing hand
in hand. But, of the three, Wisdome is
the more excellent, in asmuch as it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
both the other two, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues, in publike, in private, in
war, in peace, in adversity, in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in health, in sicknes, in diet, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
in speech, in action. Which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
knew right well, when he prayed
not for riches, or honor, or a long life;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3797:37"/>
but for Wisdome, <hi>In whose right hand is
length of daies, and, in her le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, riches and
honour: the merchandise thereof is better
than the merchandise of silver, and the gain
thereof is better than gold. It is more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than pearles: and all things that thou
canst desire are not to bee compared unto her:
shee is a tree of life to them that lay hould on
her; and blessed is hee that retaineth her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Wisdome is a singular ornament
to all: so is it in a manner essentiall to
Kings, in as much as by it they raigne,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 8. There are few things presented
to their view in their proper shapes and
colours: which requires in them the

it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 1. 2. 25. 3. The Wise-men
of the East, who brought our Saviour
Presents, are therefore (as I conceive)
specially thought to have been Kings,
because they were wise: and, <hi>Rexillite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi>
said a King, what other is he, <hi>quam

the eleventh of France, to his sonne,

               <hi>Charles</hi> the Eight, that hee should learn
no more Latin but this, <hi>Qui nescit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulare,</hi>
nescit regnare. But surely, had
himselfe learned more than hee did,
it may well bee thought, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have taught him that Lesson; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

            <p>To let go the Living, for fear of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
I will onely instance in <hi>Augustus</hi>
and <hi>Charlemain,</hi> both well learned, and
both very wise and happy Emperours,
great rewarders of learning, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of their Teachers. It will be said,
that many Princes have attained to rare
Wisdom, without learning: yet can it
not be denied, but that learning wisely
used would have added both grace and
strength unto their Wisdome.</p>

so learned men are fittest to judge or
censure. And as the Sciences are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
by the crafty, and admired by
the simple, and by some abused to sloth
or affectation: so wise-men onely use
them aright, not onely for delight and
ornament, but for ability. As then that
State is happy which enjoyes both a
learned and a wise Prince: so is that
most unhappy, <hi>Cuius Rex est Puer,</hi> whose
King is neither learned nor wise. Yet
is it not all kinde of learning or wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which is availeable for the true

may appeare in the miserable ends of
<hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, both in
their kindes wise and learned) but wise
behavior in a perfect way, that is, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
mixed with Piety, guided by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and sanctified with Grace.
Whence our Prophet addes, <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have

that make conscience of any religion:
but our Prophet is bold to put the fool
upon him; <hi>The fool hath said in his heart,
There is no God, Psal.</hi> 14. 1. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
of the Gentiles thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the only wise-men of the world:
but, <hi>while they professed themselves wise,
they became fools, and their foolish heart was
full of darknes, Rom.</hi> 1. 21. The covetous

               <hi>Paul</hi> in

True Wisdome is then to bee found,

            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:3797:39"/>There is a <hi>Divellish</hi> wisdome, rather

such as was that of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight
Bishop of Rome, <hi>who entred like a Fox,
raigned like a Lion, and died like a Dog;</hi> of
<hi>Iezabell</hi> and <hi>Achttophel</hi> in practice, and
<hi>Machivell</hi> in precepts. This wisdome
runs a contrary biass to this <hi>perfect way:</hi>
it is directly opposite unto it, and fights
against it. Again, there is a <hi>Humane</hi> or
rationall wisdome, enlightned at the
torch of right reason, yet left amongst
the remainders of Gods image in man:
and this, though it be beside the <hi>perfect
way,</hi> yet may it bee reduced unto it;
good use (no doubt) may bee made of
it. And lastly, there is a <hi>Divine,</hi> holy,
and heavenly Wisdome, whose begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is the fear of God, whose crowne
is the favour of God, whose guide is
this perfect way, the word of GOD:
which is therfore called a way, because
it leads us to our journeyes end; and a
perfect way, because the Authour of it
is the abstract of all perfection; because
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3797:39"/>
it sufficiently containes in it all things
requisite to bring us to perfection both
of body and soule, both of grace and
glory; and lastly, because it makes those
perfect that walk in it, at least in regard
of endeavour, and the severall parts of
perfection, though not the degrees: as,
a childe may bee said to bee a perfect
man, in that hee hath all the parts of a
man, though hee want the growth and
strength of a man. And if this way
were thus perfect in <hi>Davids</hi> time, what

Vpon these considerations, <hi>Charles</hi> the

in the midst of Israell. <hi>And looke
what was there given in charge to the
King in generall, was afterward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
Iosuah <hi>(a worthy Leader) in
particular,</hi> Iosuah 1. 8. This booke of the
lawe shall not depart out of thy mouth, but
thou shalt meditate therein day and night,
that thou mayst obserue to do according to all
that is written therein: For then thou shalt
make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou
<note n="*" place="margin">Or doe wisely.</note> have good success. <hi>It followeth,</hi> O when
wilt thou come unto me!</p>
            <p>The comming of God unto his
children, is, either by the performance
of his promises, or by the speciall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of his Spirit, or by the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of them unto himselfe. Such as
thinke this <hi>Psalme</hi> was penned before
<hi>Davids</hi> comming to the Crowne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these words, of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Gods promise in setting it
upon his head and settling him in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3797:41"/>
regall Throne, and then this to be the
meaning; <hi>O Lord I will tarry thy leasure,
and keep my selfe within the bounds of my
dutie, till thou hast accomplished that which
thou hast promised unto mee; though thou
delay the matter, and put me off, I will bee
content to walke in the perfect way, and not
once presume to step aside out of it, to compass
that which thou hast sayd thou wilt give me.</hi>
And according to this promise of his,
we may see how hee carried himselfe:
for, although there were a great space
betwixt his anoynting, whereby hee
was by Gods owne mouth proclaimed
heire apparant to the Crowne, after
the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his comming to
it; notwithstanding he had the hearts
of the Subiects, insomuch as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their songs extolled him above
the King; though the soule of <hi>Ionathan</hi>
the Kings eldest sonne were fast linked
to him, and so hee might haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hope to have made a strong party
against <hi>Saul,</hi> who daily provoked him
by most cruell and unjust persecution:
yet <hi>David</hi> kept himselfe in his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3797:42"/>
hee hasted not by any indirect at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
(as did his sonne <hi>Absolon</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
against himselfe) to seeke his
owne revenge, nor to displace the
King and his seed, which hee knew in
time were to be remoued; but patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waited upon God, doing his will:
yea, when God two severall times had
put <hi>Saul</hi> into his hands (once in the
Cave where <hi>David</hi> and his men were
hidden; another time in <hi>Sauls</hi> owne
Tent, where with such courage hee
had adventured) hee was so farre off
from taking away his life (which easily
hee might have donne) that his heart
checked him for cutting off the lap of
the Kings garment, at the one time; &amp;
he sharply rebuked <hi>Abner</hi> for guarding
the Kings person so weakly, at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus did this holy man wisely
carry himselfe in the perfect way of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and loyalty to his cruell Prince,
and persecuting father in law, till God
himselfe (by the way that he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
had set him in the Kings seat.</p>
            <p>The contrary is reported of <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:3797:42"/>
Infant of <hi>Spaine,</hi> if the relation bee

that our late neighbour King, the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to get the quiet possession of that
Crowne, to which hee had unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
right (if their Salique lawe be in

hee was brought up; and such as were
disposed to play with his name, found
in it while he stood out, <hi>Bonus Orbi,</hi>

afterward, <hi>Orbus boni:</hi> but God dallied

in or neer the heart, in the
midst of his Triumphes, Nobility, and
imperiall Citie, to the great astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Christian world.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it was a speech borrowed
frow <hi>Euripides,</hi> and often repeated by
<hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <q>

            <p>But, rather befitting the mouth of a
Heathen, then a Christian: yet are our

Examples in this kinde, of such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heirs apparant to the Crowne, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
snatcht it before their due time,
then received it when it fell.</p>
            <p>Among others, we read that <hi>Richard,</hi>
eldest sonne then living to King <hi>Henry</hi>
the second, approaching the corps of
his Father as it was carrying to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
(adorned according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Kings, with all royall ornaments
open faced) the blood gushed out at
the nostrils of the dead, a signe usually
noted of guiltiness; as if nature yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death retained some intelligence in
the veines, to give notice of wrong, and
check the malice of an unnaturall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender:
at which sight <hi>Richard,</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with horror, is saide to have burst
ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> into extreame lamentations. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth free from
this imputation: who when his father
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3797:43"/>
and himselfe had voluntarily and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
sworne, to suffer <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt
quietly to enioy the Crowne during
his life; yet did hee (as thinking the
time long till hee had it on his owne
head) set his brother of <hi>Glocester</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
King <hi>Henry,</hi> teaching him by the
same Art to kill his owne sonnes and
successors, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard.</hi> For
those Kings that sell the blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at a lowe prize, doe but make the
market for their enemies to buy theirs
at the same rate.</p>
            <p>On the other side, it is recorded in
the <hi>French</hi> History, to the eternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>Robert</hi> eldest sonne to
<hi>Hugh Capet</hi> the first King of their last
race, that being by his fathers consent
and desire crowned King, and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t General in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hee notwithstanding still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<hi>a sonne without waywardness, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
without iealousie, &amp; a King without
ambition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And wee may speake it without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
that his Maiesty now living and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3797:44"/>
long to live, hath left to posterity a
worthy paterne in this kinde, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this crown of England even from
the hand of God: having patiently wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the due time of putting it on, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hee were provoked to hasten it,
refusing the assistance of her enemies,
that wore it as long with as great glory
as ever Princesse did; not entring by a
breach or by blood, but by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gate which his owne right, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence, set open. Neither
would hee, for the settling of his right,
admit the toleration of any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
then that which hee heer found,
and himselfe professed; protesting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
that hee would chuse rather, if
hee were forced to it, to spend the last
drop of his blood, than to enter upon
such conditions. But, God would not
suffer one drop of that sacred blood to
be spilt, which was so ready to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out for his sake.</p>
            <p>Now those, who thinke this Psalme
was penned by <hi>David</hi> after his coming
to the Crown, conceive that at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3797:44"/>
thereunto hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus prayed for
the speciall assistance of Gods Spirit,
aswell in the private carriage of his
owne Affairs and Person, as in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the people committed to his
charge; well knowing, that without it
hee could not observe this Vow to
which hee had bound himself, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
<hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> nor <hi>behave
himselfe wisely in a perfect way,</hi> nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any duty belonging to the office
of a King, or a good man, as he ought.
Hee therefore desires of God, that as
hee had set him in the Kings Throne,
so hee would indue him with all maner
of graces and royall vertues fit for so
high a place; and not onely so, but to
assist and direct him in the exercise of
those graces and vertues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Heart of the King is in the hand of
God, hee turneth it as the rivers of waters,

of true wisdom, &amp; acknowledging

the weaknes of mans wit &amp; judgement,
with the reason therof, in these words:
<hi>Give mee that wisedome, which sitteth by

to have prospered in any thing hee
undertooke afterwardes. Now, looke
what Fortune was to them, the same is
Gods Providence unto us: whereas
on the other side, the most prosperous
in their enterprises, have ever most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ascribed their victories, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
their success-full Counsels,
and happy issues, rather to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3797:49"/>
of divine Providence, than their
owne valour or wit.</p>
            <p>And surely, hee that shall consider
how a day, an houre, a moment is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to overturne the deepest plots
of the gravest Senates, that seemed (as
one speakes) to have been founded and
rooted in Adamant, cannot but withall
acknowledge it as exceeding folly and
ingratitude in any man, so to dote upon
and admire the sufficiencie of his owne
gifts, as to forget the Giver; so much
to rely upon the arme of flesh, that hee
neglect the direction of Gods holy
Spirit: which is, as if a man should set
to Sea without a Pilot, or undertake a
journey through a dangerous Forrest
in a dark night, without a guide. I will
then conclude this point with that
prayer of the People for their Prince,
and the Prince for himselfe; <hi>Give thy
iudgements to the King O Lord: and thy
righteousnesse to the Kings sonne, Psalme</hi>

as he would alwayes have an eye
to the maine chance; not onely to the
end of his actions, but of his life: which
indeed is an excellent meanes both to
walke wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th before;
and uprightly, as hee voweth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
after: When Princes look not so
much upon their plumes and traines,
their present power and magnificence;
as upon their future condition, when
their bodies shall become the like prey
to worms and rottennesse, and their
soules shall vndergoe the like strict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
as the bodies and soules of
their meanest Subjects: When this
great game at Chesse is heere ended,
they must with others be laid up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the common bagge of Nature;
and then shall th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re bee no difference
betweene their dust, and that of the
poorest Begger.</p>
            <p>The rememberance hereof is like a
bitter pill, to purge out the malignity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3797:50"/>
of many wanton and vaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umors; or

and actions, which pass through
it, are thereby cleansed and purified.
As the bird guideth her body with her
traine, and the ship is steered with the
rudder: so the course of mans life is
best directed with a continual recourse
unto his end. It is hard for a man to
think of a short life, and to thinke evill;
or to thinke of a long life, and to thinke
well. Therefore when <hi>Salomon</hi> had
spoken of all the vanities of men, at last
hee opposed this <hi>Memorandum,</hi> as a
counterpoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e against them all, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for all these things thou shalt come to
iudgement, Eccles.</hi> 11. As if hee should
say, men would never speake as they
speake, nor doe as they doe, if they did
but thinke that these speeches and
deeds should shortly come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But an hard thing it is for them, who
fare delicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly every day, who glister
like Angels, whom all the world ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
and sues and bowes to, which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3797:51"/>
are called Sacred, Gracious, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Lords, to remember the approach
of Death. They have no leasure to
thinke of it, but chop into the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they bee aware; like a man that
walketh over a field cover'd with snow,
and sees not his way, but while hee
thinks to run on, suddenly falls into a
pit: so they which have all things at
their will, and swim in pleasure, which
as a snow covereth their way, &amp; daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
their sight, while they thinke to
live on and rejoyce still, suddenly rush
upon death, and make shipwrack in the
calme Sea. As it is good therfore for
them to heare they are gods: so it is
meet they remember they are mortall
gods, They shall die like men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.
For when they forget they shal die like
men, they also forget to live and raigne
like gods.</p>
            <p>Had they with <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
their tombes hewed out in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
where they use of solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
it would make them so to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their dayes, that they would apply
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3797:51"/>
their hearts unto Wisedome. <hi>O that
men were wise</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) then would
they consider their latter end, Deutr.</hi> 32. 29.
So that Wisdome brings a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his end, and the consideration of
his end makes him more wise; As, on
the other side, it is noted as a point of
folly in Gods people, that <hi>they minded
not, nor remembred their end, Lament.</hi> 1. 9.
Now, as the remembrance of death
made the Prophet walke more wisely:
so did the remembrance of judgement
after death, make him walke more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly;
as well knowing hee was to
render an account to a higher Iudge,
who could neither bee terrified with
stout lookes, nor ledde with respect of
persons, nor perswaded with eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
nor blinded with gifts; But, as hee was
in greater place then others, so should
his reward be greater, and his Crowne
more glorious, if he did well: but his
punishment greater, and his torment

            <p>The great Maister of morality held
it a great indecency in a Magistrate, to
be seene running in the market place:
because he, who is to moderate others,
should himselfe observe a stayed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and gravity, even in his pase
and gesture, and countenance; much
more in his actions. The Lyon, they
say, is seldome or never seene to runne;
yet is he for courage and wisedome the
King of beasts: and the higher the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
Spheres are in situation, the
slower they are in their proper motion.
It is commonly the fault of youth, by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3797:56"/>
reason of their strong passion and little
experience, to make more haste than
good speed: and therfore it was good
counsell of a Father to his Sonne, <hi>Parce

               </gap>
in the right way, than to ride a-gallop
out of it. And howbeit in the way of
godliness a man cannot make too much
haste, nor come too soone to heaven;
yet it were fit to remember that of our
Prophet, <hi>I will runne the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
when thou shalt have enlarged
my heart, Psal.</hi> 119. 32; there beeing not

            <p>Lastly, the ordinary effects of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
walking, are, the quickning of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
the refreshing of the spirits, the
warming of the blood, and the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the body: In like manner, by
this spirituall walking in the paths of
Gods commandements, is the appetite
of our soul quickned to spiritual things,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3797:56"/>
the spirit comforted and refreshed, our

            <p>Now followes the Rule of his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
which is, the integrity of his hart.
So <hi>Tremelius</hi> renders it, <hi>Ambulabo in
integritate animi mei:</hi> our last Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
reads it, <hi>with a perfect heart.</hi> That
same which hee heere promiseth for
himself, he elsewhere enjoins his Son;
<hi>And thou,</hi> Salomon <hi>my Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowe thou
the God of thy Fathers, and serve him with
a perfect heart, and a willing minde, 1. Chr.</hi>
28. 9. First then hee voweth, that the
Rule of his actions should bee the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of his owne heart; not the fancy of
other mens brains, nor the example of
other mens lives, nor the report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens tongues: which is as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and variable as are the passions of
their mindes; some, speaking out of
fear; some, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lattery; som, of malice;
and some, of faction. The best way
then for a man to examine his actions,
is, To examine his heart; there beeing
no man living that knowes or possibly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3797:57"/>
can knowe thee so well as thou doost
thine owne self. <hi>For, what man knoweth
the things of man, save the spirit of man that

the world acquitte thee, if thine owne

thou art guilty before God: &amp; though
the whole world condemn thee, if thy

guiltless, or therby less guilty. For, as
<hi>whats<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ever is not of faith, is sin, Rom.</hi> 14. 23
(that is, whatsoever is don against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
though good in it selfe, yet to
mee is made sin): so, on the other side,
<hi>if our heart condemn us not, then have wee
confidence towards God, 1. Ioh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> 3. 21. In a

the applause of all men, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Statists, together with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of great Clerks, should give thee
allowance; yet, if thou canst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
thy self of the lawfulnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
attempt it not. For, as it is good for
a man to begin with his owne heart, for
consultation: so is it also, to conclude
with it, for resolution; yet so, as other
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3797:57"/>
good meanes ordained to informe the
conscience (as, advice with discreet
friends, and conference with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if the matter bee of moment, and
the cause difficult) bee not neglected.
Let thine heart then be the <hi>Line</hi> of thy
walking; and the perfection of thine
heart, the <hi>Levell</hi> of that <hi>Line. I will walk
with a perfect heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perfection</hi> implies two things, <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty: Integrity,</hi> that it bee
whole and sound; <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that it bee
single and upright. Sincerity is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to that double heart mentioned by
our Prophet, <hi>Psal. 12. 2, With flattering
lips and with a double heart doo they speak:</hi>
(the Original is, with a hart and a hart)
Integrity, to that divided heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Prophet <hi>Hosea, Their heart is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
cap.</hi> 10. 2; when a part is bestowed
on God, and a part on our owne profit
or pleasure. First then hee promiseth
to walk with a perfect heart, that is, in
the singlenesse and simplicity, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes
and sincerity of his heart, as
God commanded <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:3797:58"/>
Walk before mee, and bee thou perfect;</hi> or,
as the Margent reads it, <hi>upright and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;</hi>
a word borrowed from hony, as
the Grammarians will have it: which,
the purer it is, <hi>sine cerâ,</hi> without wax,
the more pleasant and wholesome it is;
as they likewise draw <hi>simplicity,</hi> which
signifies the same, from a garment, <hi>sine
plicis,</hi> without pleats or foulds. Now,
this <hi>sincerity</hi> or <hi>simplicity</hi> is therfore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>perfection,</hi> because it is the greatest
perfection wee can possibly arrive unto
in this world. For, absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in fulfilling every point of the Law
in that exact manner and degree as is
required, neither doth our Prophet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
neither could he by any means
perform.</p>
            <p>He wel knew, all that God expected,
and himselfe could safely promise, was
but sincerity: without which, many
good services are not accepted; and
with which, many great imperfections
and infirmities are covered, as with a
mantle. How many infirmities escaped
from our Prophet himselfe! his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3797:58"/>
the people, his counterfeiting
madness, his collusion with <hi>Achish,</hi> his
rash anger, and furious swearing, and
vowing the death of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
dealing with good poore <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth:</hi>
these things were sinnes; yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
was a vaile unto them, because it
was not so shaken in these, as in his
murther and adultery. God that tooke
some speciall notice of this last, would
take none at all of the other: <hi>The heart
of David</hi> (saith the Scripture) <hi>vvas up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in all things, save in the matter of Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
1. King.</hi> 15. 5. In like manner, some
of <hi>Asaes</hi> infirmities having been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the holy Ghost, as that the
high places were not taken away; yet
the Conclusion is, <hi>Nevertheless his heart
vvas perfect with the Lord all his dayes.</hi>
Loe, how all his infirmities are covered
with the mantle of sincerity, 1. <hi>King.</hi>
15. 14. Contrariwise, in <hi>Iehu,</hi> wee may
observe, how the holy Ghost, after a
large description of many excellent
things done by him, doth at last drawe
as it were a cross-line, and dash out all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3797:59"/>
spoken before, with this Conclusion,
<hi>But I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Great vertues, not sweetned with
sincerity, are no ornament unto us: &amp;
great infirmities not sowred with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
are no great deformities:
those God acknowledges not, these he
imputes not. The reason is, because
where sincerity is, there in the meanest
workes that are, together with them
the heart is given to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the more a
man gives of his hart to God, the more
acceptable is his worke. The widowes
mite could weigh but little, but her
heart weighed heavy: and so her heart
being put to her mite, gave it weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the greater (but farre more heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less)
largess of the Pharisee. Sincerity is
to our works, as spirit is to our bodies;
which maketh it far better then where
there is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lesh, but less spirit. O
rare and excellent vertue of sincerity!
which can make light drams and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
corns as massie and ponderous, as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3797:59"/>
the huge talents: whereas contrarily,
the want of sincerity maketh talents as
light as feathers. Hypocrisie (such is
the filth of it) imbaseth the purest me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
and turneth very gold, yea preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones, into rust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sincerity by a divine kinde of Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
turneth iron into gold.</p>
            <p>As in the naturall body, to use Saint
<hi>Augustines</hi> comparison, the case of the
sound finger is safer than of the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
eye: the finger indeed is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
small thing, and cannot do such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as the eye, it is not of that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
nimbleness and quicknes, nor can
it guide and direct the whole bodie as
the eye doth; and yet is it better to be a
finger &amp; sound, than to be an eye and
dim or dark, ready to fal out of the soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
And <hi>Chrysostom</hi> sayes well, that
she is a worse woman that in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:3797:60"/>Finally, sincerity as it is of all vertues
the girdle, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. 14. &amp; of all other the
most acceptable to God: so is it to us
the most profitable in all dangers, tryals

it throweth them off as <hi>Paul</hi> did the

good works hee had done, were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his calling, of the highest note,
the restoring of the true worshippe of
God, the purging of the defiled Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Priest-hood: yet hee doth not
comfort himselfe with these so worthy
works; O Lord, thou knowest I have
cleansed thy Sanctuary, erected thy
worship, repaired the decayed wals of
Ierusalem, renewed the glory &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

in any particulars he had done, he
mentions onely the sincerity of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

with a perfect or upright hart: which is

<hi>I will walk with a perfect heart.</hi>

they blessed, because it is commanded,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with

the World, &amp; the Divell, and the
Flesh are content to share with God in
thy heart: but God, like the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will have all or none. The gods of
the Heathen were goods fellows, they
could well enough endure inter-com-communing
and partnership: but the
true God is the jealous God, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
away with halfes or parts. As him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and the light (which of all visible

so is he most delighted with
the Holocaust of an intire and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the division of any member, is the
mayme and griefe of the bodie, but the
division of the hart is the present death
of it: so the division of the affections
of the heart betweene the love of God

and the love of our selves, is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
the death of the soule.</p>
            <p>With what face can we come before

His meaning is (sayes the most learned
Interpreter) <hi>Deum nolle cum exceptione

exceptions and reservations. As his

and affections intirely to be squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Bird bee taken but by the claw, the

Ship is oftner sunk by some little insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

of the waves unto it. Look, then, as
to the sincerity, so to the integrity of
thy heart in Gods service.</p>
            <p>Hee forbiddes us not to love other
things besides himselfe; but wee may
love nothing but for his sake: and so
dooing, wee can love nothing in that
degree wee love him. Above all, let us
beware of the sinnes of our particular
vocation, and of our naturall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of the times and places in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
wee live: for, These, most men make

            <p>To conclude: how-ever the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

so as hee dareth for that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to Gods examination and censure:
<hi>Iudge mee, O Lord: for, I have walked in

in him, the holy Ghost doth him
this honour, that those Kings who tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feared God, and raigned well, are
said <hi>to have walked in the waies of</hi> David
<hi>their Father, 2. Kings</hi> 22. 2; but, those that
raigned ill, because they feared not
God, not to have walked in his waies,
1. <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 3. So that hee is not onely
commended for his sound and single
heart, but is therein proposed as a rule
to succeeding Ages, for the tryall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the straightnes or crookednesse
of his Successors.</p>
            <p>Now, in the last place followes the
<hi>Place</hi> of his Walk: which is, <hi>within his
house;</hi> or, as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> hath it,
<hi>in interiori domus meae,</hi> in the inmost part
of my house. Hee would make a tryall
in the very managing of his Family and
houshould-affaires, of his ability and
sufficiency for the government of the
Kingdom; as the Queen of the South
made a ghess of <hi>Salomons</hi> Wisdome by
the government of his house, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.
Every house-houlder is <hi>parvus Rex,</hi> a
little King in his owne Family: and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3797:63"/>
the greatest Monarch, upon the matter,
is but <hi>magnus Pater-familias,</hi> a great
house-houlder, or a common Father of
the publique Family of the State. As

of a building, as well in a little
frame or modell, as a great: so may a
mans desert and sufficiency, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
of a Kingdome, bee seen and
made knowne in the wel-ordering and
disposing of his private house.</p>
            <p>And, as it is a tryall, so is it also a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to greater matters; it beeing
not safe committing a vessell of burden
to his charge, who never guided a bark
or pinnace; nor to make him Generall
of an Army, who never had experience
of an under-Captains place: But, hee
that first shewes himselfe faithfull in a

how to rule his owne house, how shall he take

within his private walls; his meaning
is, that hee would bee no changeling:
that amongst his houshould-people
(where few beheld him) he would be
the same that hee was abroad, where
many eyes saw him: hee would bee as
godly in his Chamber, as in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3797:64"/>
in his Closet, or Grove, or Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as in the great Congregation: it
beeing indeed the truest signe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
spirit, to practise the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
which he professeth in company;
and of a false hart, to be devout abroad,
and profane at home; an Angell in the
Church, and a Divell in the house:
such as they, who in open place, where
they may have praise of men, will doo
som good; but after they are more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
they discover themselves in their

Hee that is present with them sitting in

which I have seene; specially
considering, that (to speake properly)
a <hi>Word</hi> cannot bee the object of the ey,
but a <hi>Thing.</hi> Well then: one speciall
point of that Wisdom which our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3797:67"/>
had promised in the verse going
before, appeares in not setting these
things of <hi>Belial,</hi> or wicked things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes.</p>
            <p>As wee turne away our eyes from
that, or remove that from our eyes
which we like not: so, what wee most
delight in, wee commonly set before
our eyes, or at least wee fixe and set
our eyes upon that. True it is, that the
eyes of the Lord are sayd to be in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place, beholding the evill and the
good, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 3: yet are they in a special
manner set upon those places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that hee hath a tender care of and
respect unto, and loves in a speciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Such a place was the Land of
Canaan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>A Land which the Lord thy God

                  </gap>areth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are
upon it from the beginning of the yeare, to
the end thereof,</hi> he never took off his eye
from it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 12. Such a person was
<hi>David: I vvill instruct thee and teach thee
in the way that thou shall goe: I vvill guide
thee with mine eye;</hi> or as the Originall,
<hi>Mine eyes shall bee upon thee, Psalme</hi> 32. 8.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3797:67"/>
Such are all those of whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
speakes, <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the
righteous, 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 12: and they are so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them that hee withdrawes not his
eyes from them, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 7. Now then,
as they are alwayes sette before Gods
eyes, whom he loves: so is God alway
set before their eyes who love him. I
have set the Lord alwayes before mee,
<hi>Psalme</hi> 16. 8. Vnto thee lift I up mine
eyes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 123. 1. And as long as hee
thus set his eyes upon God, and God
before his eyes, hee could not well set
any wicked thing before them. Hee
could not at once intend two such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
objects; hee might glance, or
squint upon both: but directly fix his
eyes upon both hee could not. This
made him so confident, <hi>I will set no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thing before mine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A bird may light upon a mans house;
but he may choose whether shee shall
nestle or breed there, or no: And the
Divell or his instruments, may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
a wicked object to a mans sight; but
hee may choose whether he will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3797:68"/>
or imbrace it, or no. So that upon
the matter, for a man to set wicked
things before his eyes, is nothing else,
but to sinne of set purpose, to set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to sinne, or to sell himselfe to sin,
as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21. The best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, God helpe us, are subject to
sinne. For if we say we have no sinne,
we deceive our selves, and the truth is
not in us: yet by the grace of God we
may be kept from presumptuous sins,
that they have no dominion over us,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 13. And though wee doe the
evill which we would not doe, yet wee
endeavour to doe the good which wee
doe not; and we delight in the lawe of
God after the inner man, though wee
feele in our members another law war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and rebelling against the lawe of
our mind, and bringing us into captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to the lawe of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. In such,
sinne ever goes with some unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with some wrastling and striving,
with some remorse of heart and check
of conscience: whereas the unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
sinner sets wicked things before
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3797:68"/>
his eyes, hee seekes out provocations,
and hunts after occasions of sinning, he
goes on with an high hand and a stiffe
neck, and is carried with a swinge, as a
ship under full saile: hee drinkes-in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
as the beast licks up the water, or
the fish catches at the bait: hee cannot
sleep nor rest quietly in his bed, before
hee have done some mischiefe: his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
study is, <hi>to fulfill the desires of the flesh:</hi>
and, <hi>having his conscience seared with an
hot iron, and being past feeling, he gives him
selfe over to vvorke all manner of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that with greediness: hee returnes
to his former sinnes, as the horse rusheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the battell, Ier.</hi> 8. 6. He makes haste, <hi>he
runs to all excess of ryot, I. Pet.</hi> 4. 4. And
being come to this pass, <hi>hee gets him a
brow of brass, a strumpets forehead that
canon blush, Ier.</hi> 3. 3. He declares his sin
like <hi>Sodome,</hi> and hides it not, <hi>Esa.</hi> 3. 9.
And then, <hi>Peccator cum in profundum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit,
contemnit,</hi> when he is thus plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the gulfe of sinne, hee growes
desperate, hee neither feares God, nor

is it taken, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. What harmony

They can never fall-in, or make musick

            <p>The word is, by diverse, diversely

from a roote, that signifies, not to rise

most probable; in as much, as where
wee reade of a sonne or a childe, or a
man of <hi>Belial,</hi> through the Scriptures,
for the most part, it is in regard of some
notorious disobedience, in casting off
the yoake of subiection. Thus the sons
of <hi>Eli</hi> are called the sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12: and the reason is given, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they hearkened not to the voyce of
their Father.</hi> In the tenth of the same

<hi>How shall this man save us? and they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised
him, and brought him no presents.</hi> In

of <hi>Belial, Sheba</hi> the sonne of <hi>Bichri,</hi> that
blew a trumpet, and sayd, <hi>Wee have no
part in David, neither have we inheritance
in the son of Ishi,</hi> Every man to his tents,
O Israel. In the 2. of <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 7. those
who stuck to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> against <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> are tearmed

            <p>Now as there are sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi>
so are there things of <hi>Belial,</hi> of which
we reade, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. And here in this
place, I will set no wicked thing, or
thing of <hi>Belial,</hi> before mine eyes:
whereby may be understood any dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
thing, tending to withdraw us fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
sobriety and godliness, whether it bee
so in its owne nature, or by our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature it be made so to us: as, las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious
spectacles, wanton pictures, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dead or living, or images for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
use, which som good Divines are
of opinion our Prophet heere meant.
Nothing more different from Beliall
than God, than Christ, than a glorified
Saint; and yet than the representation
of God, or of Christ, or of a Saint for
religious use, nothing more a thing of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3797:71"/>
Belial, be it never so curiously wroght,
never so artificially graven or carved,
never so lively coloured, or richly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired:
nay, be it of massie silver &amp; gold,
garnished with jewels and precious
stones; yet beening put to religious use,
it is still a thing of Belial. And the more
divine the person is who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it represents,
and the more artificiall the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the more dishonour it doth him
who is adored in it; and the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snares
him who doth adore by it: and
consequently, it still proves the more a
thing of Beliall.</p>
            <p>Now, the best way for a man to keep
himselfe free from this offence, is, To
keep him free from the society, at least
the domestick and familiar society, the
inward bosom-acquaintance of those,
who think it a main part of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to set such things before their eyes.
The Ark and Dagon will not stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
neither can a Crucifix, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to such an use, and Christ himselfe
well dwell together under the same
roof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:3797:71"/>I read in the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> 16. 7,
that <hi>Shimei</hi> called <hi>David</hi> a man of <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:</hi>
and beeing then guilty to himselfe
of setting a thing of Beliall before his
eyes, in the matter of <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> though
<hi>Abishai</hi> would presently have taken
<hi>Shimei</hi> his head from his shoulders, yet
would not <hi>David</hi> suffer him so much as
to touch a hair of his head: hee took it
as patiently as hee did the reprooving
of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet; though the one
came to gall him, and the other to cure
him. Hee saw the hand of God in it,
that, having set a thing of Belial before
his eyes, one should not be wanting to
tell him that hee was a man of Beliall.
It was malice in <hi>Shimei,</hi> patience in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
justice in God. The malice of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi>
was afterward justly punished, the
patience of <hi>David</hi> rewarded, and the
justice of God ever admired. Nay,
heerein againe appeares the justice of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before mine eyes.</hi> More danger there
is of setting wicked things before this

our Prophet, having prayed GOD to
turn his heart to the keeping of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
immediately addeth, Turne
away mine eyes, O Lord, from regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vanity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 37; as supposing
this later the readiest meanes and best
way for attaining the former. But <hi>Iob</hi>
steppeth yet one degree further, from
a Praier to a Vow, <hi>I have made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with mine eye: why then should I look on
a maid?</hi> 31. 1. And which is more, from
a Vow to an Imprecation. <hi>If mine heart
have walked after mine eye, let me sowe, and
let another eat, yea let my plants be rooted out,
verse</hi> 7. This was the Vow and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation
of this holy man; howbeit
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3797:72"/>
the common practice of men bee that
of <hi>Salomon; Thine eyes shall looke upon
strange women, and thine heart shall speake
lewd things.</hi> I remember, I have read
a Dialogue betwixt the Eye and the

it was,

of pride; looking-glasses being nothing
else but the artificiall eyes of pride, as
our naturall eye is a kinde of living loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glasse,
by which so many staines
and blemishes are not discovered in
the face, as imprinted in the soule: and
lastly, so it is of Idolatry; the Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> in his twentith chapter, stiling the
Idols of Egypt the abomination of
the eyes, twice within the compass of
two verses, ver. 7. 8. Whence it is, in my
iudgement, that among all those idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
nations which worshipped false
gods, and went a-whoring after their
owne in ventions, the greatest part have
ever consented in worshipping the
host of heaven, the Sunne, the Moone
or the Starres, which among all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the eye most admireth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in. Good reason then had our
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3797:75"/>
Saviour, to say, <hi>If thine eye bee evill, all
the body is darke, Mat.</hi> 6. 23: and Saint
<hi>Iohn, 1. Epist.</hi> 2. 16, to make the lust of
the eyes one of those three fountaines
from which all other vices streame.</p>
            <p>The sonn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of men that they were faire: and
then followes that mischiefe which
drew on the flood on the olde world.
The first woman sawe the fruit of the
tree of knowledge, that it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the eye: and from thence issued
that first sinne, the mother of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
which wee both doe and suffer.
Whence it may be, in the Hebrew the
same word signifieth as well an eye, as
a fountaine; to shew that from it, as
from a spring or fountaine, did flowe
both sinne it selfe, the cause of sinne,
and misery, the punishment of both.
And if our first parents were thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by the eye, and thereby recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their bane in the state of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when their appetite was yet subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to reason, and their reason to
God, what can wee promise to our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3797:75"/>
selues, <hi>Qui animas etiam incarnavimut,</hi>
who have made our very spirit a lump
of flesh, prone to entertaine vice; but,
weake God knowes, to resist it? They
are in a manner composed of flax or
tinder, apt to conceiue fire, and to bee
inflamed by the least sparke admitted
by this sense: except it be speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
or quenched by grace.</p>
            <p>Great reason then had our Prophet
to pray, and wee with him, Turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
mine eyes, O Lord, from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vanitie: great reason had hee to
promise and we with him, I will set no
wicked thing before mine eyes: the

of our owne endeavours.</p>

omne odium ex amore nasci necesse est:</hi>
since we hate nothing but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the good wee love, it cannot
bee, but hatred must spring out of love.
Fear ariseth from some danger appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
of losing the thing wee love;
grief, from the sense of the loss of that
wee love; and hatred, from the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of opposition against that wee
love: so that the more our love is, the
more is our fear to lose that wee love,
the more our griefe if wee lose it, and
the more our hatred to that which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
against it.</p>
            <p>Since then our Prophets affection
was such towards God, that his soule
thirsted for him as a dry land where no
water is; that his heart panted after
him, as the Hart brayeth after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-brooks,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3797:77"/>
that his favour was better
to him than life it selfe, and his words
sweeter than hony, more pretious than
thousands of gold and silver; it cannot
bee, but his hatred should answer in
proportion to that which is opposite
to Gods law, &amp; derogatory to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
No mervail then, that hee not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mislikes, or dis-affects, or approoves
not; but detests, abhorres <hi>hates the work
of them that fall away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An hatred there is of <hi>malice,</hi> and an
hatred of <hi>zeal;</hi> the one profane &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the other holy and divine: the one,
as a stinking and poysonsome weed,
shoots up every where through the
field of the world: the other, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
herbe or rare outlandish flowre,
comes up thinne, and that but in a few
mens gardens, neither prospers it long
without much tending and cherishing.
The one is sowen in our hearts by that
<hi>envious man, who hates the light, because his
deeds are evil;</hi> the other, planted by that
good Spirit, <hi>who hates all the workers of
iniquity, Psal.</hi> 5. 5. Of it speaks our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3797:78"/>
               <hi>The world hates mee, because I testifie
of it, that the works thereof are evill:</hi> And
our Psalmist, the type of our Saviour,
<hi>They that hate mee without a cause, are more
in number than the hairs of my head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To hate those that hate us, is heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish;
to hate those that are harmelesse
and innocent, is brutish; but to hate
those that love us, and seek our good by
telling us the truth, that is divelish. <hi>Am
I therefore your enemy, because I tell you the
truth?</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galathians:
And <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Eliah,</hi> Hast thou found
mee, O mine enimy? Yet this enemy
of his it was, that brought him at last to
an outward and seeming repentance at
least, and consequently to the turning
away of Gods wrath in his daies. This
kinde of hatred is one of those three
bad daughters, born of three good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<hi>Contempt</hi> beeing commonly the
birth of Familiarity; <hi>Idleness,</hi> of Peace;
and <hi>Hatred,</hi> of Truth. But, this is not
of kin to the hatred our Prophet heer
speaks of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So far was he from hatred of
the truth, that (I think) hee loved and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3797:78"/>
honoured the Propher <hi>Nathan</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
while he lived, for telling him the
truth, when others flattered him. Once
I am sure, that afterwards he gave him
free accesse into his bed-chamber, and
named him a Commissioner for the
declaring of his Successor:<note place="margin">1 King. 1</note> but the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
here spoken of, is of vice and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
arising fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the love of truth
and vertue: without which, hee that is
hottest in matters of religion, can bee
but luke-warme; and hee that walkes
most upright, must needs halt between
two opinions. This hatred then as it is
commended in private men; so is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in Magistrate; just anger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whetstone of courage, and this
hatred, of justice: which, as one truly
sayes, delights not so much to see men
severely punished, as justice duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted;
that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hates the worke, but
loves the person: therefore saith our
Propher, <hi>I hate the worke of them that
turne aside;</hi> not the persons but <hi>the work,</hi>
that is the object of his hatred, and the
second thing I am to speake of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:3797:79"/>
               <hi>The worke.</hi>] As wee are not to love
the vice for the mans sake, so neither
are wee to hate the man for the vice. It
is proper to God alone, who as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
hath <hi>ius vitae &amp; necis,</hi> an absolute
dominion over all his creatures (dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them at his pleasure) to affect or
reject, to love or hate them, as he will;
his will beeing indeed the measure of
right, and the rule of justice. Vnto <hi>Cain</hi>
and his offering, hee had no respect,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 5. First, hee had no respect to
<hi>Caine,</hi> his person; and then to his work,
his offering: and yet hee did him no
wrong. <hi>Iacob</hi> have I loved, but <hi>Esau</hi>
have I hated: and the Apostle addes,
the children beeing yet unborne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having done any good, or evill.
What shall wee say then, Is there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse
with God? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
<hi>Hath not the Pot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

why hast thou made mee thus?</hi> Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are to conforme our wills to

Gods will, that is, his revealed will (in
as much as wee cannot conforme our
selves to that we know not, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to himselfe) we may therefore
safely and justly hate those, whom God
hath namely and particularly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that hee hates; but, for others, wee

but for the Lyers themselves, and those
that walke in such wayes, wee have no
warrant that I know, to hate them.</p>
            <p>There is a perfect hatred mentioned
by our Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139: which Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> understands to be, when a
man hates the manners, but loves the
man; when hee hates the action, but
loves the person. <hi>False witnesses did rise
up against mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they layd to my charge things
that I knew not,</hi> saith hee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35; there
is their action, that hee hated: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
when they were sick, I put on
sackcloth, and humbled my selfe with
fasting; there's his love to their persons.
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. He praies against the wicked
policie of <hi>Achitophel: O Lord, I pray thee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3797:80"/>
turn the counsel fo Achitophel into foolishnes;</hi>
but against <hi>Achitophel</hi> himselfe, wee

<hi>David</hi> had advanced him to honour,
and hee now sided with those Rebels
that had taken up armes against him. It
is to this purpose good advice of Saint
<hi>Augustine, Hominem Deus fecit, praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorem
ipse se fecit; ama in illo quod De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
fecit, persequere in illo quod ipse sibi fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit;</hi>
God made man upright, but they
have found out many inventions to
make themselves crooked: Love that
in him which God made, but hate that
in him which himselfe made. And in
another place, <hi>Nec propter vitium oder is
hominem, nec ames vitium propter homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
sed oder is vitium, ames hominem.</hi> Many
thinke they may love God, and yet
hate their brother: but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is
bold to put the lye upon such, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.
20; If any man say, I love God, &amp; hates
his brother; he is a lyer. If any man like
not the phrase, let him chalenge him
for it. Others thinke they may hate
their brother, and yet God love them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3797:80"/>
well enough: but them he tels, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hateth his brother is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;
and yee knowe that no murtherer
hath eternall life abiding in him: and if
not eternall life, then not the love of
God, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 15. The object then of
our hatred, must be the worke, not the
man: we must learne
<q>Parcere personis, dicere de vitijs.</q>

His zeale in this case (an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equally compounded of love and

and (as his owne phrase is) ate him up:
which though it were mystically spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Christ, yet is it literally to bee
understood of <hi>David;</hi> and yet withall
his excessive griefe, such that his eyes
poured out rivers of waters, because
men kept not Gods lawe. Thus zeale
kindled a fire within him, and his grief
resolved him into teares; to teach us
that in our heate to Gods cause, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
not to be tenderly affected towards
men, but to joyne pittie with our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness,

which had they done in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of God and religion, against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme,
idolatry, or blasphemy, they
had undoubtedly purchased both the
renown and reward of Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>Now, as our Prophet professeth to
hate the work of al those that set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against God and godliness; so of
those most specially, who <hi>turn aside</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the right path in which they have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
trode, or <hi>fall away</hi> from that truth
which they have formerly professed. It
is true, that where true justifying and
sanctifying grace is once throughly
seated and settled in the hart, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
utterly be rooted out: the degrees
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3797:83"/>
and measure of it may be impaired and
abated, but the habit cannot bee ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the sense and feeling of it may
be interrupted, but the essence &amp; being
cannot be abolisht: the act and exercise
of it may be for a time suspended, but
the character remains indeleble: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>,
being once imprinted upon the soule,
can never afterward bee blotted out or
wiped away; inasmuch as Christ <hi>whom
hee loves, hee loves to the end, Iohn 13. 1. his
gifts &amp; calling being without repentance, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

11. 29. So then, this we must hold for
a sure ground, <hi>Stella cadens non est stella,
cometa fuit:</hi> A starre that falls was never
indeed a star, it was but a blazing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor.
There may be an outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of doctrine, and participation of
the sacraments; nay, more than so, in
regard of the understanding, an inward
inlightning in som measure; and a taste
of the powers of the world to come, in
regard of the affections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: yet all
this but a counterfeit blaze. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
then, if such not onely turne, but
turne aside; not onely fall, but fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3797:84"/>
               <hi>They go out from us, because, though
for a time they were among us;</hi> yet indeed
and in truth, <hi>they were never of us, 1. Iohn</hi>
2. 19: <hi>but, it had been better for them not to
have knowne the way of righteousnes, than
after they have knowne it, to turne from the
holy commandement delivered unto them,</hi>
2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. And better had it beene for
the Church, never to have brought
forth or brought up such grace-lesse
children. These then it is, that <hi>David</hi>
as a Prophet must hate, and as a Prince
must punish; as beeing most injurious
to the truth, most scandalous to the
Church, most dangerous to the State,
and most odious to God: but, above
all, he must take heed that they proove
not infectious to himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall not cleave to mee.</hi> No work of
them that fall away; but chiefly, their
worke of <hi>Aposta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie</hi> and falling away,
That shall not cleave to mee. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is the cause of love; and That, of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
so dissimilitude is the cause of
hatred; and That again, of seperation.
That which wee hate, we suffer not to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3797:84"/>
come, or at least not to abide neer us:
but either wee remove it from us, or
our selves from it; nothing beeing
more hatefull in it self, and in the sight
of God and good men, than to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and imbrace that in our selves, W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
wee professe wee hate in others. <hi>David</hi>
then having professed, that hee hates
the work of them that turne aside, hee
could do no less than promise, it should
not cleave to him. Were their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
never so plausible, their power
or number never so great, their neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by friendship or kinred never so
inward; though Israel play the harlot,
yet let not Iudah offend: though <hi>Saul</hi>
turn aside and fall away, yet that is no
warrant for <hi>David;</hi> nay, rather let <hi>Sauls</hi>
falling away serve to warn <hi>David.</hi> The
one fell away and lost his Kingdome
by it: but the other would not fall
away, though it were to the gaining of
a Kingdom, nay, all the Kingdoms of
the world and the glory of them: they
beeing temporall; but the sting, which
followes upon this defection and finall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3797:85"/>
apostasie, eternall. Witnes that despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
voice of cursed <hi>Iulian:</hi> who, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
his blood in the air, cryed out;
<hi>Vicisti Galilaee, vicisti;</hi> O Galilean, thou
hast overcom.</p>
            <p>Now, the way to keepe us that this
damnable work of apostasie cleave not
to us, is, to keepe us from cleaving to
the Apostates themselves, or suffering
them to adhere or cleave to us; and
withall, to cleave fast to God. This
was <hi>Davids</hi> practice. For the first, <hi>Their
drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor
take up their names within my lips, Psalme</hi>
16. 4. So far was hee from cleaving to
them, or suffering them to cleave to
him. And for the second, <hi>It is good for
mee to hould fast by God, Psal.</hi> 73. 27. And
againe, <hi>I have stuck to thy testimonies, O
Lord, put mee not to shame, Psal.</hi> 119. 31.
This his utter disclaiming of the one,
and sticking close to the other, was it
that made him so bold in another Psal.
<hi>Mine heart is fixed, O God, mine heart is
fixed,</hi> 57. 7; and so confident heer, <hi>It
shall not cleave to mee.</hi> I conclude with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3797:85"/>
the exhortation of the Apostle, Saint
<hi>Paul, Take heed, brethren, lest at any time

            <head>Verse 4. The froward heart shall depart
from me: I will know none evill; or, I will
not knowe a wicked person.</head>
            <p>HEe had promised in the second
verse to walk with a perfect hart:
and heer he promiseth, <hi>A froward heart
shall depart from him.</hi> Now, though that
part of his Vow bee set before this in
place, yet hath this the precedency of
that in order: scales must first fall from
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, before he can see clearly;
and <hi>Naaman</hi> must first be cleansed of
his leprosie, before his flesh com again
as the flesh of a young childe. We must
first deny our selves, before we can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3797:86"/>
Christ; and the heart must first
leave to bee froward, before it beginne
to bee upright: as the distemper of the
body must first bee remooved, before
health can bee restored; and darknesse
first chased away, before the light
break forth.</p>
            <p>In the Verse immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
hee professed hee hated the work
of those that fall away, or lepart from
God. Now, the best way to provide,
that himself might not bee found faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in that which hee hated in others,
was, to strive that a froward heart
should depart from him. For, the more
this frowardnes decreaseth in us, the
neerer wee draw to God; and the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
it sticks unto us, the farther we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from God. True indeed it is, that
it can never utterly depart our soules,
till our soules depart our bodies, and
both body and soule depart this vale of
tears. While the heart lives its naturall
life, it will also live in our hearts: and,
as the heart is among the bodily mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
the first that lives, and the last that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3797:86"/>
dies; so is this amongst all the corrupt
affections of the heart: yet must wee
still labour to mortisie it, that though it
remaine, yet it raigne not in vs; though
it live, yet the strength of it be broken,
and the head of it crushed.</p>
            <p>Againe, in that hee speakes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with a froward heart, hee freely
acknowledges, that though hee were
by grace a man after Gods owne hart;
yet by nature beeing without God as
well as others, hee could not bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this froward heart; neither his
Calling, nor his Crowne could privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him in that Case: unless in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
a King, hee should leaue to
be a man; and being advanced in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
he should shake-off nature: which
being voyde of grace, rather serves to
deprave nature farther, than any way
to correct it.</p>
            <p>Once in this <hi>Psalme</hi> hee promised a
reformation of his eyes, twice of his
heart: therefore a double watch is to
be set over the heart, in regard of any
other member. <hi>Salomon</hi> begins with it,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3797:87"/>
               <hi>Prov. 4. 23, Keepe thy heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi>

all keeping,</hi> as a man would say with
<hi>double diligence: for out of it are the issues
of life.</hi> And from the heart he comes to
the mouth, ver. 24. <hi>Put away from thee

right on;</hi> and from the eyes to the feet,
ver. 26. <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet;</hi> and
from the feet to the hand, ver. 27. <hi>Turn
not to the right hand, nor to the left:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

               </gap>, or disordered, so are the
rest. For, as out of the aboundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh; so the
eyes looke, the feet walke, the hand
moves.</p>
            <p>As the heart is the shop of the vitall
spirits, and they againe the food of the
naturall life: so is it likewise the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of new birth, and That the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our spirituall life. Those sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
in which no heart was found,
were by the Heathen counted omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:3797:87"/>Their conceit therein might bee

            </p>
            <p>Frowardnes is sometimes universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extended to the whole corruption
of the heart: as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 3, The ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

wombe: and so it includes both
<hi>Ieremies</hi> deceitfull heart, 17. 9, <hi>The heart

               </hi>
full of windings and turnings, in regard
of men; and lastly, <hi>foolish,</hi> voyd of all
true knowledge and understanding, in

must oppose a <hi>tender</hi> heart, compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
the miseries of men, relentin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
at the threatnings of God, and blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the consideration of its owne

from all stain, yet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foule blots of

<hi>deceitfull</hi> we must oppose a <hi>simple</hi> heart,

speaking as we thinke, and doing as we

must oppose a <hi>wise</hi> heart; wise I meane
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3797:88"/>
in things appertaining to saluation, and
the mysteries of godliness.</p>
            <p>More specially, frowardness against
God, in holy Scripture, is contracted
either to <hi>stubbornness and rebellion,</hi> in not
submitting our necks to the yoke of
his law; or to <hi>repining and murmuring,</hi> in
not submitting our backs to the rod of
his chastisement. The first is peruers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and obstinacy, and it shewes it
selfe either in preferring the traditions
of men before, or equalling them to
the Oracles of holy Scripture, and the
ordinances of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or which is as
bad, if not worse, in preferring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and desires of our hearts before
the express injunction or inhibition of
Gods commandements: faire preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may be made for the former; but
for the later no colour, no excuse at all.
I will instance onely in the two last
precepts of the first table, because they
immediately concerne the honour of
God. Thou shalt not take my name in
vaine, saith God: if then I speake of
him jestingly or inconsiderately, or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3797:89"/>
sweare by him rashly or falsly, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he commands, and my selfe
practice; Doth not this argue a froward
heart?</p>
            <p>Remember that thou keep holy the
Sabbath day, saith God. If then I
spend it in gaming or idleness, in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
and drunkenness, in chambering
&amp; wantonness, knowing what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and my selfe practice; Doth
not this argue a froward heart? This
froward heart it is, that our Prophet
doth heer promise to put away. And
surely not without great cause; since
hee had learned (no doubt) out of the
26. of <hi>Levit.</hi> ver. 24, <hi>If yee will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
but wil walk stubbornly against me,
I will also vvalke stubbornly against you,
I will punish you yet seuen times: that is, in
the highest degree.</hi> Neither could he be
ignorant or forgetfull of the message
of <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> yet fresh in memory,
To obey is better than sacrifice, and to
hearken than the fat of Rams: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is as the sinne of witch-craft,
and stubbornness as idolatry; <hi>Because
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3797:89"/>
thou hast reiected the word of the Lord, he
hath also reiected thee from beeing King,
1 Sam.</hi> 15. 22. 23. Nay, himselfe had
told vs in another <hi>Psalme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 26</note> speaking of
God, <hi>With the pure thou wilt shew thy
selfe pure, and with the froward thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
shew thy self froward:</hi> or as the Originall
beares it, <hi>Thou wilt wrastle with the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Now, if God come to wrastle
with man, though with the stoutest
of men, the commander of heaven &amp;
earth with dust and ashes, it cannot but
proue <hi>impar congressus,</hi> as the wrastling
of a Giant with a Dwarfe; wee shall
make no match with him: <hi>Hee it is that
looseth the bond of Kings, and powreth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
vpon Princes, if they contemne him,
Iob</hi> 12. As severe as they are towards
their inferiors, if they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
frowardly towards them; so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
is hee to them if they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
frowardly toward him. Let them
alwayes then remember, that
<q>Omne sub regno graviore regnum est:</q>
            </p>
            <p>Every earthly kingdome must yeeld
an account to a higher. And let them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3797:90"/>
deale with God, as they would haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to deale with them: the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
which they expect from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
themselves must first performe
to God. And the more and greater
blessings they have received from him,
the stronger is their obligation of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him: specially considering
that God demands it at our hands, as a
thing not any way beneficiall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(<hi>For, our goodness extendeth not to
him, Psalme</hi> 16. 1) but onely as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to our selves. Neither doth hee
binde vs to any blinde obedience as
the <hi>Padres</hi> doe their novices; nor exacts
at our hands the sacrificing of our sons
and daughters, and the passing of them
through the fire, as the Divels did of
the Heathen: but onely tyes us to his
will revealed in his worde. The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
whereof is no lesse comfortable
for this present life, then necessary for
that which is to come. The first thing
then, and the chiefe, in abandoning
this frowardnesse, is, the submitting of
our necks with all forwardnesse to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3797:90"/>
yoake of Gods lawe; which though it
seeme at first to be burdensome to flesh
and blood, yet that being once maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>His commandements are not grievous,</hi>
1 <hi>Iohn 5. 3. Nay, his yoake is easie, and his
burden light, Mat.</hi> 11. 30.</p>
            <p>The next is the submitting our backs
to the rod of his chastisement; and as
the former required our obedience,
so doth this our patience. For, after we
have by our obedience done the wil of
God, yet even then wee have need of
patience for the finishing of the race
that is set before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. It is a
fair step to perfection &amp; victory, when
a man can say with the Church in the
44. Psalm, <hi>Though all this become upon us,
yet forget we not thee, nor behaue our selues
frowardly in thy covenant.</hi> And with <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi>
the Emperor, when he felt the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of misery,
<hi>Iustus es Domine, &amp; iusta
sunt iudicia tua,</hi> Righteous art thou O
Lord, &amp; upright are thy judgements: &amp;
with that noble Lord of <hi>Plessis,</hi> when
hee had lost his eldest and his only son,
and as I take it, his only childe, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3797:91"/>
of marvelous great hope, <hi>Tacui

I held my peace and opened not my

times, when they feele the hand of

and breake out with <hi>Iob, Let the day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

this assurance, that God loves him;
hee takes every stroke at Gods hand as
a severall pledge of his love, &amp; kisses the

            <p>But I rather fasten upon our vulgar
and last translation, <hi>I will not know a
vvicked person.</hi>] For a Magistrate to
know wicked persons that hee may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them, is a part of his dutie. And
for a private man to know them, that
he may shun their company, is a signe
both of honestie and discretion. Take
away the drosse from the silver,<note place="margin">Pro. 25. 4. 5</note> and
there shal come foorth a vessell for the

all good Magistrates, utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow:
considering the three-fold ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
from thence manifestly incurred
of <hi>Suspicion,</hi> of <hi>Infection,</hi> of <hi>Malediction.</hi>
Of <hi>suspicion</hi> from others, of <hi>infection</hi> in
themselves, of <hi>malediction</hi> and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>The hazard of <hi>Suspicion</hi> from others,
in as much as wee commonly ghesse at
a mans inclination by the disposition of
his servant or company, because (for
the most part) birds of a feather will
together. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 22, the Apostle wils
us <hi>to abstaine from all appearance of evill:</hi>
whereof this surely is one.</p>
            <p>The second hazard is of <hi>Infection;</hi>
such beeing both the corruption of our
nature, and the nature of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that, if the good and bad meet, the
good is rather soiled by the bad, than
the bad any way bettered by the good.

            <p>Hee bound the dead and the living

by the living: the living rather putrefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by reason of the dead. The fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

it, but are made brackish by it. It is
but madnes for a man to presume upon
an <hi>Antidote</hi> in going to the Pest-house,
when hee may keep himselfe from it.
It is indeed the property of oyle, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poured into other liquors, to swim
on the top, and keep it selfe unmixed;
and of the Salamander, to ly in the fire
and not bee burnt: but, this quality is
rare. Even in Paradise, the woman,
whom God himselfe gave to the man,
beeing infected by the Serpent, infects
the man, and that at the first assault: and
shall any man, now beeing shut out of
Pardiase, and stript of those supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
helps and graces wherewith <hi>Adam</hi>
was invested, think himselfe more able
to resist, than hee? No, no: <hi>Evill words
corrupt good manners;</hi> much more a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3797:98"/>
evill conversation. Reiterated
importunity will at length make a
breach upon the soule, though in our
judgement never so throughly fensed:
as the long playing of the Cannon bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the wall, and a continuall drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
pearceth the stone. <hi>Samson</hi> held
out long against <hi>Dalilah;</hi> so did <hi>Salomon</hi>
against his outlandish wives: but, in
the end, neither the wisedome of the
one, nor the strength of the other, could
priviledge or secure them; the grace
of Perseverance (as his Majesty well
inferres thereupon) not being a Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that growes in our garden.</p>
            <p>The third hazard is of <hi>Malediction</hi>
from God. For, as the blessing of God
fals upon a whole society or familie
many times for one mans sake; as it did
upon all that sailed with <hi>Paul</hi> for his
sake, and for <hi>Iosephs</hi> sake upon <hi>

Prophet calles it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 12; <hi>To the

the other side, being abused to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of God, or the hurt of our
neighbour, it defileth the whole body,
and setteth on fire the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This made our Prophet to pray,

Psal.</hi> 141. 3. And to promise in another,

Swearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cursing, Dissembling,
Reviling,</hi> and those two named heer in
my Psalme, <hi>Slandering,</hi> and <hi>Lying:</hi> but
of the two, <hi>Slander</hi> named in my Text,
is the worse, in as much as it includes
a <hi>Lie;</hi> it is a lie <hi>cum additamento<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a lie
and somewhat else. And againe, a lie
though it be in it selfe alwayes naught,
yet doth it not alwayes tend to harme,
but slander doth; it being as the School
hath rightly defined it, <hi>denigratio alienae
famae,</hi> the smutting of a mans good
name. As flatterie daubs white upon
black, so slander sprinkles black upon
white; it is a <hi>false report</hi> (whether it be
by speaking, or by writing and libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
<hi>wounding a man in his good name:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3797:101"/>
false,</hi> either by denying, disguising, les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
concealing, misconstruing things
of good report; or else, in forging, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
aggravating, or uncharitable
spreading things of bad report; which
though they bee true, yet if I spread
them, not knowing them to be true, to
mee tis sinne: nay, though I knowe
them to be true, and blase them abroad
not for any loue to the truth, nor for
respect to justice, nor for the bettering
of the hearer, or the delinquent, but
onely to disgrace the one and incense
the other, I cannot avoide the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

than the other. The stroke of the rod
maketh marks in the flesh, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 28. 17,
but the stroke of the tongue breaketh
the bones.</p>
            <p>Besides, those other instruments
wound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly but one at one stroke,
whereas a slanderous tongue strikes &amp;
wounds no lesse than three at a blowe.
The first and worst blow, hee gives his
owne soule, infecting it with slander,
and making his conscience guilty of a
lie. The second lights on the soule of
him, to whom he brings the false tales;

The third and last stroke, lights on
the reputation of the party slandered:
which though it bee of the three the
least; yet is it a very grievo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a false report, wounding a man <hi>in his
good name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Latines call it <hi>Detractio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a kinde of theft, in that it
stealeth from a mans good name; in
in which sense our Saviour may bee
thought to have called them <hi>theeves,</hi>
whom he whipped out of the Temple;
because by their buying and selling in
it, they robbed God of his honour,
profaning the place consecrated to
his worship. As then the Sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his reason is; first, because restitution
may more easily bee made of goods
than of good name: which, being once

Secondly, because a good name is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer

not onely for civill use in anoynting
their faces and bodies, as well living as

their Kings, Priests, and Prophets. And
this oyntment is it, which in the 30. of

oyle, compounded of oyle olive, and

or the Perfumer: and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
compounded any like to it, or
put any of it upon a stranger, by Gods
ordinance hee was to bee cut off from

costly oyntment, doth <hi>Salomon</hi> prefer

since the one cannot keepe the body

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

            <p>The Proverb is, <hi>Oculus &amp; fama non

with the eye, or with a mans good
name; the least aspersion cannot but
be offensive to either: and a wise man
is as tender &amp; sensible of the least touch
upon the one as the other. He was no

And hee was no foole either in morall

the keeping of a good conscience is
sufficient, if he be clear to God-ward:
but in regard of doing good to men,
specially in publique places, a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation

hee that by slander takes away, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrongs him from whom he takes it,

he is accused, though wrongfully, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his speeches nor his actions can be

so acceptable; and consequently, not
so profitable unto them, as otherwise
they might bee. To which purpose is
that of <hi>Thomas, Auferre alicui famam

that forenamed good Doctour &amp;

weighing these dangerous effects, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
these two verses (as <hi>Possidius</hi> reports
it in his life) to bee written in capitall

            <p>Hee that loves to detract from such

            <p>Another thing, which much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
this vice and the foulenesse of it,
is, that the <hi>Divell</hi> hath his name from
slandering, and a nature nothing dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from his name: hee slanders God
to man, and man againe to God, as his
instruments doo man to man. God hee

accuseth God, to man, of envy: so doth
hee man, to God, of hypocrisie; <hi>Doth</hi>
Iob <hi>serve God for nought? hast thou not

            <p>The Herbalists write of a certaine
Plant, which they call Divels-bit; so
named (as they say) because, beeing of
soveraign use for mankinde, the Divell
is thought (by simple people) of malice
to bite off the root of it, which is found
very small, or none at all. Now, the
root of the union betwixt God &amp; man,
is the love of God to man, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of man back again to God: and this
root I am sure wee may truely call Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels-bit;
not that he can ever bite it off,
but because hee never leaves nibbling

his mouth to that end, whether it
bee simply to disgrace another, or by
his disgrace the more to commend and
justifie himselfe; that, as it is a divine
property, To cover sin, where is hope
of amendment, with the mantle of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
so, To fain a fault where it is not,
or to amplifie and extend it beyond

yet that which makes it worse, is, the

privily slandereth his Neighbour.</hi> In the
largest sense, <hi>Proximus tuus est qui tecum
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3797:109"/>
natus est ex Adams &amp; Eva,</hi> saith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
Hee is thy neighbour, who is
borne of the same race with thee of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Eve.</hi> Thus is it taken in the
ninth and tenth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, <hi>Thou
shalt not bear false witnesse against thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
Thou shalt not coet thy neighbours
house.</hi> And by our Saviour in the tenth
of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel. And I deny not,
but it may thus be understood, and be
as generally extended heer in my text:
Yet because our Prophet heer chiefly
intended the ordering of his houshold,
I thinke this word is heer to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to such as dwell together under
the same roofe, and converse together
in the same family: which is favoured
by <hi>Montanus</hi> his Translation, <hi>Obloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
socio suo,</hi> him that slaundereth <hi>his
fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a bad bird, they say, that defiles
his owne neast: and surely it is a signe
of little grace, when a man slaunders
those that should bee nearest and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
unto him; when <hi>Cham</hi> uncovers
his fathers shame; when <hi>Siba</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3797:109"/>
and false suggestions obtaines his
Masters inheritance, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16; when
the Mistris of the house by slander &amp;
wrongfull accusation shall cause her
servant, her faithfull servant <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to
be cast into prison. It was the blow of
<hi>Bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us</hi> that struck deepest into <hi>Caesar;</hi>
&amp; tis the slander of a pretended friend
that gives the most dangerous wound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such are excellently described by</hi>
Bernard, <hi>in his 24. Sermon upon the</hi>
Cantitles, Detractores autem quodam simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latae
verecundiae fuco, &amp;c. The Slanderers,
under the colour of feined modestie, labour
to shadowe that malice which they cannot
keepe in: you shall see them send forth deep
sighes; and with a kinde of gravitie and
slaiedness, with a sadde look and whining
voyce, to poure forth their slander: which
passeth by so much the more plausibly, as it
is thought by those that heare it, to proceed
not from any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nvious, but a condoling affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I am very sorry <hi>(saith hee)</hi> for
him, because I love him, and have often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
him thereof, but could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
him: the thing was knowne unto me
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3797:110"/>
before, but it should never have been publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by mee; yet now that it is blowen abroad
by others, I cannot denie the truth, indeede
it is so. <hi>Hitherto</hi> Bernard. <hi>And who
would thinke that a contemplative</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
<hi>living within the cloisters of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
shold be so perfect in the tricks
of the Court? And so I come from
the vice to the Censure, from the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
cutting &amp; wounding of others,
to the cutting of him off; Him that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
slandereth his neigbour, him will</hi>
I destroy, <hi>or</hi> cut off.</p>
            <p>He promiseth of other offences, he
would not <hi>suffer them, they should not
dwell within his house,</hi> or <hi>tarry in his sight;</hi>
but of this, like a rotten incurable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when no other remedie will serve
the turne, <hi>off they must.</hi> Hee would not
himselfe raise slanders upon innocents,
that hee might enter upon their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and then cut them off; as <hi>Iezabel</hi>
dealt with <hi>Naboth:</hi> but hee would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
right the innocent, by cutting off
the slanderer.</p>
            <p>Now, a double kinde of <hi>cutting off</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:3797:110"/>
there is; either from favour, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or service, &amp; thats for private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
or from the participation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
exercises with the Church: and
thats for the Magistrate Ecclesiastical;
or from liberty, by banishment; or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly,
if the case so require, from life it
selfe, by inflicting of death; and thats
for the Civill Magistrate: and this case
in the Leviticall Law was onely when
the slander reached to the life of him,
upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was raysed, <hi>Deut. 19. 19. He
that testifies falsely against his brother, yee
shall doe to him as hee thougth to have done
to his brother: eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
hand for hand, life for life.</hi> But for private
men, all the cutting off they can use, is
the shutting of their doores, and the
stopping of their cares against them;
making demonstration, by speech or
countenance, of distasting their base
practice; according to that wholesom
advice of the Apostle, <hi>Ephes. 5. 11, Have
no fellowship with the unfruitfull vvorks of
darkness, but rather reproove them.</hi> And
surely all honest men have reason to do
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3797:111"/>
it, not onely in that they have reason
to conceive, that he who brings a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon another to them, will bee as
readie upon occasion to carry a slander
upon them to another; but withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Salomon</hi> tels vs, that the <hi>wicked
giveth heed to false lippes, and a lyer hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth
to a naughty tongue, Prov.</hi> 17. 4. It
it a shrewd signe that a man is that way
disposed himselfe, when he giveth way
to others without any checke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule.
And besides, it is a conclusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon by the best Divines, <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
detrahentem cui possit resistere, sed ei
placet detractio, eiusdem detractionis reus
est:</hi> Hee that heareth the slaunderer
quietly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he may resist him, so as the
slander seemeth to please him, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comne
guilty of the same offence.
Wherewith that of <hi>Bernard</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
booke <hi>de Consideratione ad Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
accords, <hi>Detrabere aut detrahentem
audire quid horum damnabilius sit non facile
dixerim:</hi> To de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ract, or to listen to the
detraction, which of these two is the
worse I cannot easily define: the one
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3797:111"/>
having, as he addeth, the Divell in his
tongue; the other in his eare. And of
<hi>Isidore,</hi> in his third booke <hi>de Summo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
Non solum ille reus est, qui falsum de
alio profert, sed &amp; is qui citò aurem crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
praebet:</hi> Hee is not onely guilty,
that raises a false report of another, but
hee also who readily listens thereunto.
The ground heerof is taken from the
last verse of the first to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
Not onely they which commit such
things are worthy of death, but they
also that consent vnto them that doe
them. Now consent is either indirect,
when a man resists it not being in his
power; or direct, in advising or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the dooing of it, or in abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it, or delighting in it beeing
done.</p>
            <p>It is the Receiuer that makes the
theefe, and a smiling countenance and
open eare that makes and maintaines
a Slanderer: Whereas on the other
side, <hi>As the North winde driveth away the
raine; so doth a frowning looke the slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
tongue, Pro.</hi> 25. 23. It is like the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3797:112"/>
of a dart, or the shooting of an
arrow against a flint, or peece of brass,
it reflectenth back againe upon the face
of the shooter. <hi>Et discit non libenter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
quod videt non libenter audiri;</hi> Hee
learnes not to speake that willingly,
which hee findes to bee unwillingly
heard. Therefore it is that our Prophet
ioynes both together, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. Who
shall abide in thy tabernacle, or who
shall dwell in thy holy hill? <hi>Hee that
backbiteth not with his tongue, nor receiueth
a false report against his neighbour:</hi> And
so doth the Poet:

            </p>
            <p>Thus farre a Magistrate may &amp; must
goe with private men: but hee must
not stand heer, hee must proceed one
step further, and that is to punishment.
It was none of the worst sayings of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi>
though himselfe none of the
best Emperours, <hi>Princeps qui delatores
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3797:112"/>
non castigat, irritat:</hi> His meaning I take
to bee, not so much of lawfull infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
as wrongfull accusers: <hi>For, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
lips are the delight of Kings, and they
love him that speaketh right. Prov.</hi> 16. 13.
Though they bee the chiefe of men,
yet men they are: and having their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
confined to places, they cannot
see and heare all things themselves.
Many things they must of necessity see
by other mens eyes, and heare by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens eares: Yet requisite it is, that
such as they either imploy, or permit
to be their eyes or ears, should be men
of knowen trust and tryed faithfulness;
&amp; even then too, are they to keep one
eare open for the defence of the party
accused.</p>
            <l>Qui statuit aliquid parte inauditâ alterâ,</l>
            <l>Aequum licet statuerit, haud aquus fuit.</l>
            <p>As it is true, <hi>Si sufficiat negasse, nemo
erit nocens,</hi> If a bare deniall were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
no man would bee guilty: So is
it as true, <hi>Si sufficiat accusasse nemo erit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocens,</hi>
If a bare accusation were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
no man should be innocent. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3797:113"/>
information, or that which the
Lawyers cal <hi>Clamorosa insinuatio,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fame, is enough to give iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to a farther inquiry: but not to
a finall Sentence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Descendam &amp; videbo,</hi> I will goe
downe and see, saith God himselfe, of
<hi>Sodome</hi> it selfe, whether they have done
altogether according to the cry which
is comn unto me. The phrase of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to see, is not so proper to
God, whose eye pearceth thorough
the bowels of all things, as it is a kind
of descending to our capacities, and
for our instruction, specially his depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and vicegerents on earth; who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
somtimes they descend from their
majesty &amp; throne of State, to a familiar
search of truth, themselves will often
be carried on the wrong side, &amp; wrong
others.</p>
            <p>I conclude what I have to say at
this time, with the grave and wise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of the Apostle, <hi>Galat. 5. 15.
If yee bite and devour one another, take
heed yee be not consumed one of another;</hi> I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3797:113"/>
take him specially to be understood of
byting by a slaunderous tongue; of
which our Propher heer, <hi>Hee that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
slandereth his neighbour, him will I
cut off.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div type="sermon">
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:3797:114"/>
            <head>Him that hath an high look and a proud
heart, will I not suffer.</head>
            <p>AFter <hi>Slander,</hi> our Prophet rankes
<hi>Pride</hi> in the next place: and sure
they are so neer of kin, that hee could
not well set them far asunder; <hi>Pride</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commonly both the mother and
the nurse of <hi>Slander.</hi> For, when wee
have once a good conceit of our selves,
we are apt for the slandering of others,
that thereby either our vices may in
some sort bee justified, or our vertues
shine the clearer. I deny not, but <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
(as you have heard it proved in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the former part of this verse)
sometimes ariseth out of malice, and
seeking revenge, or breach of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
sometimes out of covetousnes, in
seeking to gain by it; sometimes out of
ambition, in seeking to rise by it; but,
more often out of pride, in seeking cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to our selves, either by forging false
reports, or by inlarging true, tending to
the discredit of others. Hence is it, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3797:114"/>
the Apostle, in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20, sets <hi>swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>
next to whisperings; the one bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a branch of Pride, as the other is of
<hi>Slander.</hi> And <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the sixt of the
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> ver. 17, couples together hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eyes and a lying tongue; they being
the two first of those seaven which the
Lord hates, and his soule abhors: nay,
our Prophet himself joyns them in one
verse, <hi>Psa. 40. 5, Blessed is the man that hath
set his hope in the Lord, and turned not to
the proud, and such as goe about with lies:</hi>
insinuating, it may bee, that the slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
who goeth about with lies, as a ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
with his pack, is as the broker; and
the proud man, as the marchant or
chapman to whom he vents his wares:
for, as the slanderer is as ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
lies, as to coine them; so is the
proud man as ready to receive sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders,
as to raise them.</p>
            <p>The way, then, to purge the tongue
from <hi>Slander,</hi> is, to keep the heart from
<hi>Pride:</hi> and the best means to free a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
from the one, is, to rid it of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore, our Prophet having
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3797:115"/>
promised, in the former part of this
verse, to cut off him that privily slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his neighbour; heer hee voweth,
not to suffer him that hath an high look
and proud heart; or, as some Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
have it, a proud looke and a high
heart. <hi>Elatumoculis &amp; latum pectore,</hi> sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Musculus: vastum corde,</hi> or <hi>turgid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

corde,</hi> saith <hi>Arias Montanus: tumentem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime,</hi>
saith <hi>Iunius.</hi> The phrases are som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
different, but they all aime at the
same mark, and are all sufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
by the Originall. Wee are,
then, in the first place to consider of
the vice heer censured; It is <hi>Pride,</hi> both
outward in the look, and inward in the
heart. Secondly, of the censure oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
unto it; It is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>not suffering:</hi> so insuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a vice it is. <hi>Him that hath an high
look and proud heart, will I not suffer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had our Prophet said, I will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a proud heart; the question might
have been, How wee should come to
knowe it: hee therefore, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase us of
that doubt, takes the right way to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it by an high look; God having
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3797:115"/>
so both ordained and ordered it, that
our secret thoughts and hidden affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should be manifested to the world
by outward acts. <hi>What man knoweth the
things of man, save the spirit of man which
is in him?</hi> saith the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.
But, there hee speaks of a direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,
of a primary and infallible
knowledge, which is proper to God,
and God alone; in as much as hee it is,
and hee alone that searcheth the heart,
and trieth the reins, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 10. No man,
no divell, no Angell, no created sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
can possibly attaine to that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be by divine dispensation, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
supernaturall. The ordinary
knowledge then which we have of the
heart, is gathered by discourse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
by observation of marks &amp; effects;
as the physician ghesseth of the disease,
by the Symptomes. We judge of the
weather, by the face of the sky; of the
motions of the wheels of a clocke or a
watch, by the pointing of the Index:
wee judge of the motion of the Sunne,
by the progress of the shadow in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3797:116"/>
diall: wee judge of the motion of the
heart, by the beating of the pulse: wee
judge of the fountaine, by the streame
which issues from it: and, lastly, wee
judge of the depth of the foundation,
by the height of the building which is
raised upon it: and as justly may wee
gather the pride of the heart from an
high look. <hi>Iudge not, lest yee bee iudged,</hi>
saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1. And his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Iudge nothing before the time untill
the Lord come, who will lighten things that
are hid in darknes, and make the counsels of
the heart manifest, 1. Cor.</hi> 4. 5. But they
both speak of an uncharitable, unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
peremptory and finall judgement;
not so much touching the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of men what they are, as their
future state what they shall bee.</p>
            <p>This then notwithstanding, as wee
lawfully may and usually doo judge of
the passions of the minde (of feare, of
hope, of griefe, of joy, of hatred, of
love, of anger, of jealousie) by outward
signes: so may wee as lawfully judge of
the vertues or vices of the soul by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3797:116"/>
effects; as it were of the goodnes
of the tree by the fruits, or of the value
of coin by the stamp set upon it. And
more safe it is to judge of vices than of
vertues; in as much as few are so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
wicked, but they desire at least
to appear good. Vertue may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
and that so cunningly, as the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
shall seem to exceed the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
the counterfeit, the truth: but yet
I think was never man so madde as to
counterfeit a vice; wee labour rather
by all means to conceal it: yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it so cunningly, but that it shews
it self at times, as it were in a glasse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our speech, or in our apparell,
or in our gait, or in our countenance,
or in our actions, or in all. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the wise observation of these, is
beyond all the rules that either judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Astrology by casting nativities, or
Physiognomy by inspection of faces,
or Chyromancy by behoulding the
lines of the hand, can afford. Of these
then it may bee truely said,
<q>Qui bene conijciet, vates hic optimus esto.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:3797:117"/>But, amongst all vices, there is none
(onely drunkenness excepted) that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
it self sooner than pride. For the
speech, wee read of a bragging &amp; boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
mouth, a mouth of pride, <hi>Iude</hi> ve.
16: for the gait, wee read of a foot of
pride, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 11: for apparell, of a
crown of pride, <hi>Esay</hi> 28. 1; of a chaine
of pride, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 6. So that pride in the
heart can no more hide it self, than fire
that lies in the bosome, or oyle that is
wrung in the fist. Many that know not
the man, yet point at him as hee walkes
the streets, and say, There goes a proud
fellow: which, men usually pronounce
of no vice beside, but the drunkeard;
because these two chiefely bewray
themselves: and therfore doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Habbacuc</hi> join them both together,
2. verse 5.</p>
            <p>When a man shall see a cloak imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
over with woods, and parks, and
Lordships, and lined within with obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and bands, and statutes; may
wee not justly say, that such a man is so
farre from cloaking his pride, that hee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3797:117"/>
proclaims it in his cloak? It was said of
old, that soft raiment was the weare in
Kings Courts; whereas, now a-daies, it
is so bedaubed with gold and silver, so
loaden with pearle and pretious stone,
as it is hard to judge, whether it more
burden their bodies, or lighten their
purses. The Poet could say of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of his time;
<q>Matrona incedit census induta nepotum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And another:
<q>—Pars minima est ipsa puella sui.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, what would they say? or, rather,
what would they not say, if they lived
in these our daies, and saw that we see;
when, for apparell, a man can see little
or no difference betwixt the Lord and
the Tenant, the Master &amp; the Servant,
the Prince and the Subject?</p>
            <p>But, what a marvellous thing, yea
what a madnes is it, To see a man, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the image of God, &amp;
Lord of all the visible workes of his
hands, to growe proud upon the furres
of beasts; upon silkes, the excrements
of worms; upon gemmes, or gold, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3797:118"/>
silver, somewhat better concocted and
finer part of the earth; or, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
cals it, thick clay? <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 6. Yea,
to growe proud of that which hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
about him, as a prisoner doth his
manacles or fetters, in token of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
our raiment beeing both the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and the badge of the fal of our first
parents, and of our fall in them. Had
they stood in their first integrity, and
wee in them, we should no more have
been ashamed of our nakednes in our
age, than in our infancy: wheras now,
beeing disrobed of originall justice, we
are driven to seek these coverings, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for defence, and partly for hiding
our shame.</p>
            <p>If the clothing of <hi>Salomon</hi> in his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
(who had the rarities of the known
world at his command) were inferiour
to that of the Lilly; why should wee
think the better of our selves for a gay
coat, or a quaint fashion, or a fringed
rose, or a fine feather? All that we can
get by it, is this, that in covering our
bodies, wee discover to the world the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3797:118"/>
humour of our mindes: by proud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
wee disclose a proud heart, but
yet more by a proud looke; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sayes our Prophet, Him that an
high looke and proud heart.</p>
            <p>As we finde a man in what Inne hee
is lodged by the signe: so wee knowe
whether pride have taken up her lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in the heart, by the signe of the
looke. As a wanton looke is a signe of
a lustfull heart, and a sober looke of a
chaste heart, and a sad looke of a heauy
heart, and a cheerfull looke of a merry
heart, and a modest looke of an humble
heart: so is an high looke of a proud
heart. By this, as one truely sayes, a
proud heart is traced unto, as a Deere
or Hare are traced to the place where
they be, by their footing.</p>
            <p>A difference I finde in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
betwixt <hi>Oculus elevatus,</hi> and <hi>elatus
oculis:</hi> the one implies a looke lifted
up to God; the other, lifted up above
our brethren. The former our Prophet
professes <hi>Psal. 121. I vvill lift up mine
eyes unto the mountaines, from vvhence
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3797:119"/>
mine helpe shall come:</hi> and our Saviour
practised it, <hi>Iohn 11. 41. Iesus lift up his
eyes &amp; said, father I thank thee, because thou
hast heard mee:</hi> and so did <hi>Stephen, Acts
7. 55. Being full of the holy Ghost, hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory
of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand
of God.</hi> Now, this kinde of lifting up
the looke, in as much as it serves or
helps to lift up the soule, either in an
holy confidence, or heavenly, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
or both; is not onely lawfull
but commendable, and tis a token of a
lowly minde. But this high superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
looke, this lifting up of the eyes
heer spoken of, is when a man beholds
those that are under him with a scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and disdaining countenance; like
one that lookes downe from an
high Tower, to whom, men walking
under, seeme to be but crowes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of himselfe: and this <hi>elatus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis</hi>
is that doth manifest <hi>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um corde;</hi>
and therefore doth our Prophet joyne
them both together: againe, <hi>Psal. 131. 1.
Lord I am not high minded.</hi> But how
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3797:119"/>
doth that appeare? <hi>I have no proud looks;</hi>
and so doth <hi>Salomon, Pro. 21. 4. An hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
looke and proud heart, which is the light
of the wicked, is sinne.</hi> When a man by
facing, and strouting, and bearing his
head aloft, would have all men that
see him take notice of his noble des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
of his honourable place, of his
great estate, of his comly personage,
or some singular quality, or admirable
excellency that is in him, or hee thinks
to be in himselfe; his hauty looke is an
evident signe, an argument infallible of
his proud heart: and heerein is the
looke more offensive than the heart; in
that, though the pride of the heart bee
more odious to God, yet is the hauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the looke more scandalous to
men. Nay, in the 6. of <hi>Prov.</hi> It is one
&amp; the first of those six &amp; seaven things
which God hateth, and his soule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth;
&amp; therefore will he also with
such severity punish it, as he threatneth
by his Prophet, <hi>The high looke of man shal
be humbled, and the loftinesse of men shall
be abased, and the Lord alone shall be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3797:120"/>
in that day, Esa.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>Thus much of outward pride, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the looke, and the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the pride of the heart by it: we
now come to the proud heart it selfe,
the true cause and fountaine of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
pride; and howsoever outward
pride cannot be without this, yet this
may bee, and sometimes is without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An high looke and proud heart will I not
suffer.</hi> By some it is rendred, <hi>Latum
corde,</hi> a large heart. Now, the heart
may be enlarged, either by knowledge
as <hi>Salomons</hi> was: <hi>God gave him wisedom
and understanding exceeding much, &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudem
cordis, and a large heart, even as
the sand upon the Sea shore. 1. King.</hi> 4. 29.
Or by sanctifying grace, whereof our
Prophet, <hi>Psal. 119. 32. I will run the way
of thy Commandements, when thou shalt
have enlarged my heart:</hi> or by covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whence some render it, <hi>Insatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili
corde;</hi> or by joy, for as sadnesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and drawes it together, so joy
dilates and enlarges it: or lastly, by
pride, not containing it selfe within its
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3797:120"/>
owne bounds; but swelling like the
Sea, and being puft up like the stomack
that is filled with winde. And as the
swelling of the spleene is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for impairing the health &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
of the bodie, and of the sailes for the
overbearing of a little vessell: so this
swelling of the heart is, of all spirituall
diseases, the most da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous to the soule;
whether it arise from the gift of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
blessings, of riches, of beauty,
of birth, of power, of eloquence, of
knowledge; or from an opinion that we
have those vertues in us, which indeed
wee have not; or that we have them in
a greater measure and perfection, than
indeed we have; or that we have them
from our selves and our owne industry,
not from God: or that we have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them from God, but by our owne
merit: or lastly, that by reason of them
wee over-value our selves, and despise
others.</p>
            <p>And herein lies the great danger of
this vice, that it arises out of vertue it
selfe, though not of it selfe, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3797:121"/>
of our corruption; and by that
meanes, the Divell both staines the
worke, and steales away the reward.
It is impossible to have good parts and
not to know it: &amp; a very difficult thing it
is for a man to know so much touching
himself, &amp; not thereupon to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinioned of himselfe: with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
increase of sanctification, if we take
not good heed this creeps-in; &amp; which
is strange, is noted to spring even out
of humility. A secret pride is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
occasioned by not being proud:
and then is it more deformed, than if
it appeared in his own proper colours.
As Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> noted long since, <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
deformior est superbia quae sub quibusda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
humilitatis signis latet:</hi> And as it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
springs out of the life and
flower of vertue: so doth it out of the
ashes of dead vices, the carcases of
mortified sinnes; as wormes doe of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
timber.</p>
            <l>Cum bene pugnaris, cum cuncta subacta
putaris,</l>
            <l>Quae magis infestat vincenda superbia
restat.</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:3797:121"/>It is like the shirt, the first thing wee
put on when we come into the world,
and the last we put off when we go out
of the world. It runnes through all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states:
it infects the Artificer, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
the Lawyer, the Citizen, the
Schollar, the Courtier, the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and hath <hi>Vniversalem quandam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in omnia vitia,</hi> saith the School-man,
an universall kinde of influence
into all vices; in as much as it is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from God, which is the first
essentiall part of all vice. It infected the
Angels in heaven, unto whom that of
the Babylonian King is applyed by the
Antients, <hi>I will ascend into heaven, and
exalt my throne aboue the starres of God: I
will ascent above the height of the clowds,
Esay</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. It infected our first parents
in Paradise. <hi>Primi hominis peccatum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
superbia fuit, qua quoddam spirituale
bonum supra mensuram suae conditionis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petivit.</hi>
The first sinne of the first man,
was pride, by which hee longed for a
certaine spirituall good, above the
reach and capacity of his condition. It
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3797:122"/>
is the conclusion of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and seems
to answer rightly to the Serpents sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
<hi>God doth know that when ye shall
eate thereof, yee shall bee as Gods, knowing
good and evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Pride, by Divines is ranged
among the seaven captaine or capitall
sinnes; so called, because from them
the rest stream, as from their wel-heads.
Nay, by <hi>Gregorie</hi> it is made the Queene
and Mistris of the capitall vices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Ipsa vitiorum Regina superbia,</hi>
saith hee, <hi>cum devictum plenè cor ceperit,
mox illud septem principalibus vitijs quasi
quibusdam suis ducibus devastandum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
ex quibus vitiorum multitudines oriun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi>
Pride the Queen of vices, having
once taken full possession of the heart,
delivers it over to the seaven principall
sinnes, as it were to her chiefe Leaders,
by them to bee laide waste, and from
hence all the following troopes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities
ensue. And so I come from the
Vice to the Censure; <hi>Him that hath an
high looke and proud heart, I will not suffer:</hi>
or as some Translations have it, more
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3797:122"/>
literally therein agreeing with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,
<hi>Ipsum non potero, I cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reasons which chiefly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him not to suffer this vice, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
him partly as hee was a <hi>reasonable
man,</hi> endued with intellectuall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertues; partly as hee was a <hi>member
of the Church,</hi> and the childe of God,
inspired with the spirit of God; partly
as hee was an <hi>housholder,</hi> the father of
children, the master of servants, the
head and governour of a family: and
lastly, in part as hee was a King the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
of a populous and mighty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>First, then as a <hi>reasonable man,</hi> hee
knew there was nothing in man, which
could in reason make him proud.</p>
            <l>Vnde superbit homo? cuius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptio turpis,</l>
            <l>Nasci poena, labor vita, necesse mori.</l>
            <p>Whence should a man grow proud?
whose conception is shamefull, his
birth painefull, his life toylsome, his
death necessary. The dayes of his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
heere on earth are few and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3797:123"/>
and yet even in those few, subject
he is to infinite infirmities in his body,
partly by casualties from without, and
partly, by diseases from within; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
error &amp; ignorance in his mind, to
infinite perversnes &amp; distraction in his
wil: he comes whining into the world,
&amp; departs groaning out of it; he shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
forth as a flower and is cut downe,
he vanisheth as a shadow, &amp; continueth
not; his flesh is but as grasse, the winde
bloweth over it, and it is withered, and
the place therof shall know it no more;
his breath goeth forth, and hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to his earth, and then all his
thoughts perish.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>as a member of the Church
and childe of God,</hi> hee had reason to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
pride. <hi>As a member of the Church,</hi> in
as much as schisms and heresies, sects &amp;
separations, which rent and molest the
Church, spring for the most part out
of a vain affectation of singularity: <hi>as
a member of the Church,</hi> hee knew that
man in his best estate was moulded out
of the dust of the earth; that after the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3797:123"/>
fall, his soule was spotted with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
of sinne; to which, by the daily
adding of infinite actual transgressions,
if God should enter into judgement
with him, hee were not able to answer
one for a thousand.</p>
            <p>Againe, as <hi>Gods deare childe,</hi> hee had
great reason to oppose against those,
who are of all the greatest Rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God. The Prodigall is an enemy
directly to himselfe, indirectly to
God: the Covetous an enemie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to men, indirectly to God:
but the Proud is a direct enemie to
God himselfe. For whereas other sins
arise, some out of infirmitie, some out
of ignorance, some out of a desire of
profit, or pleasure, or honour, or ease,
or revenge; the proud man hath no
cause to be proud, but Pride it selfe,
which saith like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> I will not O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.
<hi>Superbia</hi> (saith <hi>Aquinas) habet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versionem
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Deo, ex hoc ipso quod non vult
Deo &amp; eius regulae subijci:</hi> Pride hath an
aversion from God, even for this very
cause, because it will not be subject to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3797:124"/>
God and his law: and thereupon hee
quotes that of <hi>Boëtius, Omnia alia vitia
fugiunt à Deo, sola superbia se Deo opponit;</hi>
all other vices flie from God, pride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
stands out, and makes head against
him.</p>
            <p>And as pride resists God in a speciall
manner, so God in a speciall manner
resists it; as both Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tels us in
his first Epistle, the fift Chapter, and
fift verse: and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his fourth
chap. and sixt vers. Which he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
to the worlde in punishing this
vice in a speciall manner, by letting a
man fall into other sinnes, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
or curing of Pride. Hee lets a
man fall into in continency, into drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
into murther, into theft, that
so hee may learne to blush at his pride.
The Philosophers of the Gentiles whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they knew God, and yet in the pride
of their heart would not glorifie him
as God, God gave them up to vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
for their punishment: but for
the cure of his blessed Apostle, lest he
should be puffed up with abundance
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3797:124"/>
of revelations, hee sent him the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of Satan to buffet him: which
was either a sinne, or doubtlesse a
strong solicitation to sinne. When the
Israelites were to possesse the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> the inhabitants were not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
driven out; lest the wilde beasts
should devour them: and God hath left
the reliques of Originall sinne in the
best, while we are heer in warfare upon
earth; lest it being utterly vanquished,
we should be made a prey to self-love,
which is a branch of pride; it beeing
either <hi>Amor illicitus propriae excellentiae,</hi>
or <hi>appetitus celsitudinis illicitae:</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
love of our owne worth, or a
longing for an unlawfull height.</p>
            <p>That sinne then must of necessitie be
very odious in the sight of God, which
hee prevents, or scourges, or reformes
with other grievous sinnes: and being
so odious to God, it cannot but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
displeasing to the sons of God. If
God denounce warre against any man,
all the creatures are ready to serve him
in their course: those then that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3797:125"/>
Rebels, the least that we can do
(if we would shew our selves good and
faithfull Subjects) is, To professe that
wee may not, wee must not, we cannot
suffer them; in as much as To lodge a
knowne traitor in our house, or to give
him countenance, or to converse fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
with him, and then to give out
that we carry as sound and loyal a heart
to our Soveraign as the best, is a matter
that rather deserves laughter, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our Prophet had reason
thus to oppose Pride, as hee was the
head of a family. Disobedience in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
towards their parents, stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in servants towards their masters,
envy in brothers one towards another;
name Pride, and you have named the
mother and nurse of them all. The least
thing that is spoken to a man of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
to range him into order, is as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
coales cast upon flax: it presently
sets him on fire. Hee envies his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and scorns to be commanded by
them: his equals hee disdains, &amp; scorns
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3797:125"/>
to converse with them: and for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours,
if hee could, hee would tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
them under feet. Hee commonly
sets-going, in pursuing his vanities and
pleasing his fancy, within lesse than a
quarter, the allowance of a whole year:
then must he with unjust dealing, either
at home or abroad, to the dishonour of
GOD, and the scandall of the house
where hee serves, make up that breach,
and repair those ruines which his owne
proud humour hath caused. I will bee
bould to say it (though it bee not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
held so) that, all things conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
drunkennesse or incontinency, or
theft is more tolerable, and lesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
in a family, than Pride.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, our Prophet had
reason to oppose this vice, as hee was a
King: not onely, because the pride of
great ones must be maintained &amp; born-out
by exaction, extortion, and rapine
from the lower Subject; but because
it never leaves pearching and pushing
forward, till it set it selfe higher than is
meet: whence issue divelish and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3797:126"/>
practices, in ridding such out of
the way, as they think bee likely to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. If <hi>Mordecai</hi> will not bow to
<hi>Haman,</hi> a whole nation must bee rooted
out for it. Finally, <hi>Only by pride man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
contention, Pro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 13. 10: wheresoever
strife goeth, there is pride, at least in
one of the parties contending, if not on
both sides. Sometimes, it stirreth up
men, and imbouldeneth them to offer
wrongs: somtimes, it imbittereth men,
and maketh them weyward against the
right: sometimes, it causeth the one to
be carelesse of dealing according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and the other to be impatient of
bearing any injuries. The best use then
for pride in a Common-wealth, is, To
make work for the jayler or hang-man,
or at least to keep the Lawyer from i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleness.</p>
            <p>The last thing which I will speak of
in the handling of these words, is, that
if <hi>David</hi> would not suffer pride in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
hee would much less allow it in
himselfe. Many gifts indeed hee had,
which were able to puffe up flesh and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3797:126"/>
blood; yet none of them all could
moove him. For <hi>beauty,</hi> hee was of a
lovely countenance, &amp; comely visage;
his <hi>strength</hi> such, as he was able to break
a boaw of steel; his <hi>bouldnes and courage</hi>
such, that hee had the heart of a Lion:
beeing but green in years, but a boy in
a manner, hee encountred and slew a
Bear, a Lion, a Giant of six cubites and
an hand-breath of height. Hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the sheepfolds, and from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Ewes great with yong, and
from thence advanced to feed Gods
people in Iacob, and his inheritance in
Israell. Hee was so <hi>gracious</hi> before his
comming to the Crown, that the soule
of <hi>Ionathan (Sauls</hi> eldest son) was knit
to him: and the very women sang in
their courses, Saul <hi>hath slaine his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
and</hi> David, <hi>his ten thousand.</hi> Hee
<hi>happily escaped</hi> the stratagems and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Counsellers,
and men of warre: hee found <hi>courteous
entertainment</hi> even among the enemies
of God and his nation.</p>
            <p>After hee came to the Crowne, hee
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3797:127"/>
obtained <hi>victories</hi> upon the Iebusites,
the Moabites, the Edomites, the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
the Ammonites, and upon the

of <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> of <hi>Sheba,</hi> of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solom,</hi>
of <hi>Adoniah.</hi> His <hi>Wisdom</hi> was such,
that by Gods assistance hee drave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi>
(who was held in those daies,
for his wisdom, as the Oracle of God)
to hang himself with his owne hands:
his <hi>favour with God</hi> such, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to bee a man after Gods
owne heart: so skilfull was hee in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi>
that hee was stiled the sweet Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Israel; so expert in <hi>Poetry,</hi> that
his Psalms were even then during his
life publiquely sung in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they are at this day; his <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
spirit</hi> such, that he cleerly foresaw
and foretould more particulars of the
Person, the Office &amp; Kingdom of the
Messias (of whom hee was a type, and
from whom Christ was to come) than
any one of the Patriarchs or Prophets
that went before him; his <hi>Power</hi> such,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3797:127"/>
that hee had under his command many
renowned and worthy Leaders, and to
the full number of thirteene hundred
thousand stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men that drew swords;
his <hi>riches</hi> such, that hee left his Son to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

and of brass and iron passing waight; a
matter, were it not for the testimony of
Scripture, beyond beleef.</p>
            <p>Besides all this, his <hi>Patience</hi> was such,
that hee waited Gods leasure many
yeares betwixt the time of his anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and his investing in the Throne;
his thorough &amp; found <hi>Repentance</hi> such,
that tis left as a patern to all succeeding
ages; his <hi>Charity</hi> such, that he prayed
for his enemies; hee caused the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lechite
to be put to death, that gave out
hee had slain <hi>Saul;</hi> and the servants of
<hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> who indeed slew their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Sauls</hi> son; and for the death of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solon</hi>
hee sorely lamented, though his
owne life and state were endangered
by his practices: his <hi>Loyalty</hi> such, that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3797:128"/>
hee spared <hi>Saul</hi> twice, when hee might
have dispatched him and made a way
to his owne advancement. His <hi>Pietie</hi>
such, that hee desired rather to bee a
doore-keeper in the house of God,
than to live at ease in the Kings Palace.
And lastly, a <hi>Promise</hi> was made him,
that his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> should succeed
him, and that his seed should bee esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the throne.</p>
            <p>Were not these strong motives to
puffe up flesh and blood, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
conceited and proud of his owne
worth? Yet heare what himselfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
of his humility, the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of all his other vertues and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
<hi>Psalme 131, I am not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I have no proud lookes, I doo not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
my selfe in great matters which are
too high for mee: but I refraine my soule
and keepe it lowe, like as a childe that is
weaned from his mother, yea my soule is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as a weaned childe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, what was it that kept him so
lowe, notwithstanding his greatnesse,
and so many rare excellencies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3797:128"/>
wherewith he was endowed?
The <hi>first</hi> no doubt was the grace of
God: for, as he gives his grace to the
humble, so it is his grace which makes
them humble. The <hi>second,</hi> was those
Crosses and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lictions, both outward
&amp; inward, wherewith God<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro time to
time had exercised him; <hi>From my youth
upward, thy terrors have I suffered with a
troubled minde.</hi> The <hi>third,</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
both of his naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>I was borne in iniquity, and in sinne
hath my mother conctived mee;</hi> as also of
his actuall transgressions, <hi>They are moe
than the haires of my head, and mine heart
hath failed mee.</hi> The <hi>fourth,</hi> was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of his owne frailty,
<hi>Hee knoweth whereof we are made, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
that we are but dust.</hi> The <hi>fift,</hi>
was the contemplation of Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
the greatest among the sonnes of
men, being lesse in comparison of him,
than the silliest worme that crawles on
the face of the earth, in comparison of
them. The <hi>sixt,</hi> was the often exercising
of himselfe with fasting, with prayer,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3797:129"/>
with divine meditations and holy <hi>soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies,</hi>
with sackcloth and ashes, with
making his teares his drinke, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his bread with weeping. The <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi>
was his studying day and night
in Gods lawe (according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
given to the king, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
20, that his heart might not bee lifted
vp above his brethren) and esteeming
it above the hony and the hony comb,
above gold an silver, yea much fined
gold, and precious stone. The <hi>eightth

that God was privie to all his
thoughts, that hee would reward him
according to his works; that hee was
both the Author, Maintainer, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of whatsoever good, either in his

are made of. Vpon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of mans sociable nature, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths are built,

parishes; and they againe of housholds
and families; and they againe of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and wife, parents and children,
<hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Servants:</hi> of which last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
I am chiefly to speake at this
time.</p>
            <p>Though the name and nature of a
Servant were first brought into the
world by the ungratiousnesse of <hi>Cham,
Gen. 9. 25:</hi> Yet is the impression of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
and subjection so universally
stampt upon the face of Nature, that
it reacheth up to heaven; there being
a greater light to rule the day, and a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
light borrowed from and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the greater, to rule the night.
If wee ascend higher to the Angels,
there are among them principality &amp;
domination: nay, more than so, it
pearceth downe to hell, where wee
reade of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a Prince of Divels.
And experience hath farther observed,
that even among unreasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
this forme is kept; The birds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a naturall instinct subject to the
Eagle, the beasts to the Lion, and the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3797:131"/>
Bees marvailously obeying and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
their Master. But, this truth
shines yet more clearely in man him
himselfe, a little map or module as it
were of the great world; his members
being subject to the head, his body to
the soule, his appetite to reason. And
this principle is so deeply ingraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the conscience of all, that the very
barbarous nations, who retaine any
sparke of civility, willingly subscribe
vnto it.</p>
            <p>Whether then wee looke upward to
heaven, or downeward to hell, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the creatures, or inward to our
selves, we shall every where finde cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
imprinted of superiority and
subjection, command and obedience,
domination and service. To take it then
as granted, to bee a thing not lawfull
onely, but commendable; nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
onely, but as the case now
stands, in a manner necessary; I will
proceed to the unfolding of the words
themselves. And first, of the former
part of the verse, <hi>Mine eyes shall be to the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3797:131"/>
faithfull of the Land, that they may dwell
with mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faithfulnesse in holy Scripture is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in diverse senses: Sometimes for
steadfastnes and assurance of beleefe;
<hi>Put forth thine hand, and put it into my side,
and bee not faithless, but faithfull, Iohn 20.
27:</hi> Somtimes for truth of speech; <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis
est hic sermo,</hi> This is a true &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
saying, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9: Sometimes for
the profession of Christian religion; <hi>If
any faithfull man or faithfull woman have
widowes, let them minister unto them, 1.
Tim. 5. 16:</hi> Sometimes for certainty &amp;
constancy in performing what a man
promiseth; <hi>Let us keep the profession of our
hope without wavering, for hee is faithfull
that hath promised, Heb. 10. 23:</hi> Sometimes
for perseverance in the truth; <hi>Bee thou
faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee
the crown of life, Rev.</hi> 2. 10. And, lastly,
sometimes for a carefull and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
discharge of ones duty in that
place whereto he is called: thus Christ
is said to have been <hi>a mercifull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
high Priest, in things concerning God,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3797:132"/>
Heb.</hi> 2. 17. And <hi>Paul</hi> testifies of <hi>Tychicus,</hi>
that he was <hi>a faithful minister in the Lord,
Ephes.</hi> 6. 21. And in this sense I take this
word specially to bee understood heer
in my Text: <hi>Mine eyes shall be to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the land, that they may dwell with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Art of navigation is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to a Mariner; courage, to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
arithmetick, to a Merchant; ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,
to an Oratour: so is fidelity, to
a Servant. Wee commend a ship, not
so much for the fine shrowds and tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or for the gilding or painting of
it, as for the sayling; and a horse, not
so much for the rich bosses, the trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
&amp; caparisons, as for the running;
and a sword, not so much for the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
or pummell hatcht or inameld, or
for a velvet scabberd imbroidered with
pearl, or set with pretious stone; as for
the temper of the blade and cutting:
so we commend a servant, not so much
for his strength, his nimblenesse, his
comelinesse, his parentage, his bravery
in clothes, or invention of fashions, his
court-like behaviour, or gracefull
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3797:132"/>
speech, his pleasant wit or merry dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
his subtle and crafty fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ches,
his knowledge of foraine States &amp; lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;
as for his fidelity: Any of the
rest, nay all the rest without it, serving
only to make a servant more disposed &amp;
more able too, as well for the plotting
as the acting of villany; wheras fidelity,
having joyned with it but some few of
the rest in a mediocrity, makes him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in a good degree.</p>
            <p>This is the commendation of <hi>Moses,
Heb. 3. 5. Moses verely was faithfull in all
his house, as a servant. And it is required in
Stewards, that a man bee found faithfull,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, whom his Master
hath made Ruler over his house:</hi> They all
thereby implying in my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that faithfulnesse is one of the
Cardinall properties, if not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
required in a good servant. <hi>Servus
fidelis protectio fortis, munitum palatium,
vivus thesaurus,</hi> saide <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> A
faithfull servant is a strong protection,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3797:133"/>
a fenced palace, a living treasure. And
therefore the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> being
enquired where his treasure was, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his finger to his domesticke
servants.</p>
            <p>Now, faithfulness presupposeth
<hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> and shewes it
selfe either in <hi>deeds</hi> or <hi>vvords,</hi> in <hi>actions</hi>
or in <hi>speeches:</hi> In <hi>actions</hi> first, when a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
doth that which te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not so much
to the satisfying of his Masters vain
humour and sensuall appetite (which is
sometimes wanton and lascivious, and
sometimes againe malicious and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
as the advancement and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his true and reall good.
And thus doe I take Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to bee
understood, 1. <hi>Cor. 7. 23. Yee are bought
vvith a price, bee not the servants of men.</hi>
And againe, in the second of <hi>Titus,</hi> the
9. and 10. verses, <hi>Let Servants be subiect
to their Masters, and please them in all
things, not answering again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither pickers,
but that they shew all good faithfulnes</hi> (all
good faithfulnes) <hi>adorning the doctrine
of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> In both
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3797:133"/>
which places (as it seems) he would put
a difference betwixt Christian servants
and the bondslaves of the Heathen:
their Masters having over them <hi>ius v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; necis,</hi> absolute power of life and
death; and they being <hi>instrumenta ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi>
living Engines, not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the justness and equitie of that
which was commanded, as the wil and
pleasure of the Commander; such as
<hi>Tigillinus</hi> and <hi>Petronius</hi> were to <hi>Ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi>
But in these Cases better obey God
than man. The Masters turne is to bee
served <hi>vsquead aras,</hi> as far as honesty
and pietie will give leave; and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Againe, fidelity shewes it selfe in
<hi>deeds,</hi> when the servant preferres his
Masters good before his owne; his
Masters gaine, his ease, his liberty,
his safety before his owne: but as
<hi>Salomon</hi> askes the question, <hi>Pro. 20. 6,
Many men will boast everyone of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but who can finde a faithfull man?</hi> So
may wee justly demand, Where shall
a man finde such a faithfull servant?
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3797:134"/>
Surely he is a pretious jewell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hard to bee found: yet such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
was our Prophet to his Master
<hi>Saul,</hi> who sought him as a flea, or as
one would hunt a Partridge in the
mountaines: yet when <hi>Abishai</hi> would
have nayled him whiles he slept, with
his speare to the earth, <hi>David</hi> would
not suffer him; hee spared his Masters
life, though it were to the indangering
of his owne, when hee might have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
his owne by taking away his:
and therefore, by Gods blessing, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
afterwards found the like affected
to him; <hi>Thou shalt not goe foorth, for thou
art now worth ten thousand of us, 2. Sam.
18.</hi> And againe, <hi>Thou shalt goe no more
out vvith us to battell, lest thou quench the
light of Israel,</hi> 21. of the same booke.</p>
            <p>Fidelity in <hi>words</hi> shewes it self, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in concealing of secrets and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and by laying the finger upon
a mans mouth, and sealing up his lips in
such a case, whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes,
<hi>Prov. 11. 13. Hee that goeth about as a tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer,
discovereth a secret: but hee that is

of a faithfull heart, concealeth a matter.</hi>

any secret poured into his eare, but it
drops out at his tongue; he is in paine
till hee be delivered of it, as a woman

have often drawne secrets even out of
the bosome of those who have beene

of women, and the strength of

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the jewell of a Secrecy unto.</p>
            <p>Besides, fidelity shewes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> selfe in
<hi>words</hi> (if occasion serve, and a man bee
called unto it) in giving such counsell
as hee conceives to be not most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and passable, but most profitable
and wholesome; Such hearty counsell
as <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes of, <hi>Prov. 27. 9. As oyntment
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3797:135"/>
and perfume reioyce the heart: so
doth the sweetnes of a mans friend by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
counsell: and in the multitude of such
Counsellers there is health,</hi> 24. 6. And
therefore one speciall thing which the
Primitive Christians ever mentioned
when they prayed for the Emperor (as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tels us) was
this, that God would send him <hi>Senatum
sidelem,</hi> faithfull Counsellers. And it
seems our Prophet alluded heerunto; in
as much as where our English reads it,
<hi>To dwell with me; Arias Montanus,</hi> rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
word for word, translates it, <hi>Ad
sedendum mecum:</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> a Iew

may sit with me, as it were at Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
and <hi>Iunius</hi> hath this note upon
it, <hi>Bonos consiliarios, mihi adhibebo,</hi> I will
procure me faithfull Counsellers.</p>
            <p>Now as counsell is the life of action
and authority; so is discreet liberty
the life of counsell: which being once
remooved, for mine owne part, I finde
no difference betwixt a friend and a
flatterer, a parasite and a Counseller;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3797:135"/>
such as <hi>Ionadab, Amnons</hi> Counseller &amp;
friend, to whom he no sooner disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his unnaturall affection to his sister
<hi>Tamar,</hi> but <hi>Ionadab</hi> presently findes
out, and shewes him a trick how hee
might compass his desire, and satisfie
his unlawfull lust, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
had hee beene a faithfull Counseller
indeed, hee would have laboured by
all meanes to have reclaimed him from
his mischievous purpose, &amp; have stopt
such a villanie, as afterwards brought
shame to <hi>Tamar,</hi> griefe to <hi>David,</hi> death
to <hi>Amnon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Somewhat better was <hi>Ioab:</hi> who
though hee wickedly gave way to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
cruelty, in making away <hi>Vriah,</hi>
according to the tenor of the letter sent
unto him, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11; Yet afterwards he
did him the office of a faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
when <hi>David</hi> retyred himselfe
unseasonably upon the death of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:
I sweare by the Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou come out, there will not tarry one
man with thee this night, 2. Sam.</hi> 19. 7.
And again, in the 24. of the same book,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3797:136"/>
when the King in the pride of his heart
would needs have his people to bee
numbred, <hi>The Lord thy God,</hi> saith <hi>Ioab,
increase thy people an hundred folde more
than they bee, and that the eyes of my
Lord the King may see it;</hi> but why
doth my Lord the King desire this
thing? Which howbeit at that time
<hi>David</hi> hearkened not unto, yet <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ab</hi>
therein did his part: and I make no
doubt, but the King himself afterward,
when hee felt the hand of God heavie
upon him, wished he had followed that
advice.</p>
            <p>The counsell of a grave and wise
man, who speakes not out of passion or
private respects, but out of a zeale of
the publique good, &amp; of the person of
him to whom hee gives it, should bee
entertained and reverenced as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of God. And though it bee true,
that bookes written in former ages
(which are justly called dead Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers)
be for the most part more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
in regarde that they speake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blushing or feare, to the present
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3797:136"/>
times: Yet as true it is, that Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
(which are or should bee living
bookes) if they bee faithfull, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the more usefull, in regard
they best know the disease, and should
seek out the remedy of the times wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they live.</p>
            <p>It is not alwaies easie &amp; gentle phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
which is the best; neither is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
crossing cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the worst:
desperate is that mans case and past all
cure, whose eare judgeth all to be harsh
that is wholesome; and nothing profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
but what is pleasing. Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
was of another minde, when hee
spake, out of deliberation, <hi>Psal. 141, Let
the righteous smite mee; for that is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit:
and let him reprove mee, and it shall bee
a precious oyle that shall not breake my head.</hi>
And so was <hi>Salomon, Prov. 27. 6. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are the wounds of a friend, but the kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of an enemy are deceitfull.</hi> And it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
proves true, that hee who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
not out of vaine affectation of
singularity, but with discretion and
out of an honest heart, shall commonly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3797:137"/>
finde more favor, certainly more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at the last, than hee who flattereth
with his lips.</p>
            <p>But Counsell is best sought for at
their hands, who either have no part at
all in the cause whereof they instruct;
or else are so far engaged, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are to beare the greatest adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the success of their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
Vpon that counsell which <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi>
Counsellers gave him, are set the
two marks whereby bad counsell is for
ever best discerned; that it was <hi>greene</hi>
for the persons, and <hi>violent</hi> for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <l>Principis est virtus maxima, Nosse suos.</l>
            <p>It is a great part of princely vertue,
to observe the humours of his subjects
in generall, but chiefly of his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
the greatest trust between man &amp;
man, being the trust of giving counsell.
For, in other confidences, men commit
the parts of their life, their lands, their
goods, their childe, their credit, some
particular affaire: but, to such as they
make their Counsellers, they commit
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3797:137"/>
the Whole; by how much the more
they are obliged to all faith and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
Neither need the wisest Princes
think it any diminution to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
or derogation to their sufficiency,
to rely upon Counsell; since the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times doo set forth in figure both
the incorporation and inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of Counsel with Kings, in that
they say, <hi>Iupiter</hi> did marry <hi>Metis,</hi> which
signifieth Counsell: so as soveraignty
or authority is married to Counsell.</p>
            <p>The second condition which our
Prophet proposeth, to bee found in
such as he meant to entertain in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
is, <hi>Walking in a perfect way,</hi> or <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
perfect in the way:</hi> it comes both to
one; and the meaning of it is, The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a godly and religious course, as
hath already been shewed in opening
the sense of the former part of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
verse, <hi>I will doo wisely in the perfect
way;</hi> so heer, <hi>Hee that walketh in a perfect
way, hee shall serve mee.</hi> These two then
must go together, <hi>Faithfulness</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
Piety</hi> and <hi>Fidelity, civill Honesty &amp;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3797:138"/>
Religion:</hi> neither indeed can they bee,
as they should, either thrifty for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or trusty to their masters, who
bee not first religious towards God. It
was the memorable speech of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
father to the great <hi>Constantine,</hi> to
such as forsook their religion, that they
might please and serve him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godliness,</hi> then, is requisite in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
first in regard of <hi>himself,</hi> and then
in regard of his <hi>Master:</hi> in regard of
<hi>himself,</hi> because by that means he is sure
of a reward, either from his master, or
from God, or from both. The generall
promise they have, 1. <hi>Tim. 4. 8, Godliness
is profitable unto all things, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the life present, and of that that is to
come.</hi> But, a more speciall one they have
directed to themselves in particular, in
<hi>Ephes. 6. 8, Knowe ye,</hi> that is, ye servants
(for, unto them hee begins to addresse
his speech in the fift verse) <hi>Knowe yee,
that whatsoever good thing any man doth,
the same hee shall receive of the Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee bee bond or free.</hi> And yet more
expresly in <hi>Colos. 3. 23. 24, Whatsoever yee
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3797:138"/>
doo, doo it heartily as to the Lord, and not to
men; knowing, that of the Lord yee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the reward of the inheritance: for, yee
serve the Lord Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And many times it falles out, that
those, who beeing faithfull and godly,
receive the least reward at their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
hands, receive the greater from
God, and that even in this world by his
gracious blessing. This, <hi>Iacob</hi> found:
hee was so religious towards God, that
though his Master were an Idolater, he
still kept himselfe free from it; and yet
so faithfull was hee to his Master, that,
for the space of twenty yeers, hee was
in his service consumed with heat in
the day, and frost in the night; and if
any of the flocks were either stolne, or
torne by beasts, hee made it good him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he set it not on his Masters accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Yet for all this, could not his Master af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him a good look, much less a good
word: hee changed his wages tenne
times, sought to eat him up, &amp; to raven
all hee could get from him. This was
the reward he had from his Master for
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3797:139"/>
his faithfull service. But now God so
blessed him for his sincerity in religion,
that the very Presents he sent his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Esau</hi> were able to make a rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. And of himself hee professeth
in the same chapter, verse 10, <hi>With my
staff came I over this Iordan, and now have
I gotten two bands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In regard of men, it fared worse with
<hi>Ioseph:</hi> though God prospered his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
house for his sake, neither would
he hearken to the impudent and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his mistresse; yet his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
was disgrace and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they put his feet in the stockes,
and the iron entred into his soule. But
God, in stead of the stocks, set him in
the seat of Iustice; and, in stead of his
fetters, put a chaine of gold about his
neck. I will conclude this point with
the exhortation of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter, Servants,
bee subiect to your Masters with all feare;
not onely to the good and courteous, but also
to the froward: for, this is thank-worthy, if
a man for conscience towards GOD endure
grief, suffering wrongfully, 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:3797:139"/>Secondly, as godliness is requisite in
a servant, in regard of <hi>himself;</hi> so is it in
regard of his <hi>Master.</hi> First, because, if
hee feare his Master and not God, all
that hee doth will bee but eye-service;
hee will certainely intend his Masters
good no further, than hee sees it may
sort with his owne: whereas if God &amp;
the fear of him bee before his eyes, hee
is the same man when his Master is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as if hee were present; hee desires
and endeavours his best advantage, as
much though he were a thousand mile
off, as if hee stood by and lookt on. If
<hi>Gehezi</hi> had thought that his Master had
been so far indued with a propheticall
spirit, that hee could have tould him
what hee did in so great a distance from
him, hee would never have taken such
paines to run after the Syrian Captaine
for a bribe, to the disgrace of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and the undooing of himself. And
if <hi>Iudas</hi> had beleeved our Saviour to
have been God, and consequently that
hee had knowne the thoughts of his
heart, undoubtedly hee would never
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3797:140"/>
have hatched against him such a foule
treason within his breast. It was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that made <hi>Achitophel</hi> to side as a
Rebel with <hi>Absolon,</hi> and to plot against
<hi>his Master David,</hi> and <hi>Ziba</hi> against <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth;</hi>
but worldly respects, and
want of true religion.</p>
            <p>Besides, as ungodliness in the servant
cannot but put the Master in continuall
fear, both of his estate and person: so
it serves to infect as wel the children of
the house, as his fellow-servants; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the other side, the godliness of
one, beeing countenanced and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
therein, serves to shame the lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sort, and to draw-on the well-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
Thus <hi>Daniel,</hi> beeing admitted
into the King of Babylons Court, was
an instrument for the reforming and
converting even of the King <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>
himselfe. And <hi>Ioseph</hi> was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the King of Egypts Court,
that hee might inform his Princes, and
teach his Senatours wisedom, <hi>Psal. 125.
22.</hi> In the second of <hi>Kings</hi> and the fift,
wee read of a poore silly maid, but a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3797:140"/>
Iewesse by Nation (the onely people
of God at that time) who being taken
captive by the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and serving
<hi>Naamans</hi> wife, tolde her Mistris, of
the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> in Samaria; and by
that meanes gave occasion to her Lord
of going thither, and cleansing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the leprosie both of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and his soule.</p>
            <p>Lastly, a godly and religious servant
will ever be praying unto God, to send
a blessing on that worke which he is set
about; as <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant did, <hi>Gen.
24;</hi> and so God prospered his journey,
and the business he was intrusted with
accordingly. All which considered,
great reason had our Prophet to say,
and to double it, to promise and to vow
it, <hi>He that walketh in a perfect way, he shal
serve mee:</hi> He, he.</p>
            <p>Now, because the word heer used,
to <hi>Serve,</hi> in the Originall, signifies a
free and liberall kind of service; it may
well bee thought that our Prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not only the admitting of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and godly servants into his family,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3797:141"/>
but the advancing of such to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
offices, &amp; the placing of them in the
chiefest roome of government under
him. And surely this consideration
and promise was no less (nay, more)
necessarie then the former, in regarde
that the good which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence might
arise is more publique. They that bee
of high calling (if they bee good, and
desire their goodness may spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
and reach unto others) for this
purpose may not un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily bee likened to
great Cisterns or ponds full of cleare
and wholesome water, that might bee
beneficial to many, if there were sound
and sweet pipes to convay it: whereas
on the other side, it yeeldeth no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
at all, if the pipes bee stopt; nay
proves hurtfull, if they bee poysoned
and corrupted. Whereof it commeth
to passe, that even when there be good
Princes, yet things doe still continue
out of frame: as wee see in the dayes
of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> a most excellent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
King, who feared God betimes, &amp;
twice in his dayes reformed religion;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3797:141"/>
his remembrance is as the perfume
made by the Art of the Apothecarie,
and as musick at a banquet of wine;
there was no King before him, either
after him, that like <hi>Iosiah</hi> turned to
God with all his heart, as hee did: yet
were there in his dayes, even in the
time of his raigne, horrible abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
atheisme and contempt of God,
pride in apparell, oppression and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yea much damnable Idolatry, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the good King by his laws
had taken as good order against these
as possibly he could. The cause of all
was, that such as were under him in the
Common-wealth, and in the Church,
did not that which hee willed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to their place; According to
that complaint of <hi>Zophonie, That the
Princes were as roaring Lions, the Iudges
as Wolves in the Evening, which leave not
the bones till the morrow; the Prophets were
light and wicked persons, and the Priests
such as polluted the Sanctuary, and had
wrested the lawe of God to serve their owne
turne:</hi> And so what marvaile though in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3797:142"/>
a rare Kings daies iniquity overflowed
and abounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Esay</hi> in like manner prophecied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
good Kings, <hi>Vzziah</hi> and <hi>Iotham,</hi> and
<hi>Hezekiah:</hi> yet he justly and sorely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines,
how farre all things were even
then out of order, <hi>their silver vvas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
drosse, and their wine mixt with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Cap. 1. 22;</hi> and hee addes the reason
hereof in the verse following, because
their Princes, that is, their chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
under the the King, <hi>vvere rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and companions of theeves, They loved
gifts and followed after rewards, they iudged
not the fatherless, neither did the widowes
cause come before them.</hi> The people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do so sensibly see and feele this,
that <hi>they reioyce vvhen the righteous bee in
authority, Prov. 29. 2;</hi> whereas cleane
contrariwise, they sigh and mourne
when the wicked are set up, and beare
rule; as it followes in the same place.
Thus when <hi>Mordecai</hi> came out from
the King in royall apparell, of blew &amp;
white, and with a great Crowne of
golde, and with a garment of fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3797:142"/>
&amp; purple, the whole citie of <hi>Susan</hi>
rejoiced and was glad, <hi>Ester</hi> 8. 15. The
counsell therfore of <hi>Iethro (Exo. 18. 21.)</hi>
was very good, and not without just
cause approoved of <hi>Moses,</hi> when hee
gave advice, that not onely his higher
Officers, Rulers over thousands and
hundreds, but the inferiours too, over
fifties and tennes, should bee <hi>men of
courage, fearing God, dealing truely and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usnesse.</hi> Their fearing of God
was a meanes for them in good causes
to put on courage; and their hating of
couetousness to deale truely, which in
case they did not, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth
should not onely suffer, but <hi>Moses</hi>
should be sure to hear of it. For though
to private men it bee sufficient, if
them-selves doe no wrong; yet a
Prince must provide that none doe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him or under him; the neglect
hereof being the chief imputation that
was layde to <hi>Galbaes</hi> charge, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him out of the Empire, as being
unworthy of government, <hi>Omnium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu
dignus imperio, nisi imperasset.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:3797:143"/>Hitherto of the Conditions which
our Prophet r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quires in those whom
hee proposed to admit and entertaine
as <hi>Servants</hi> about him, as <hi>Counsellers</hi> to
him, as <hi>Officers</hi> under him: Now for
himselfe, he purposes <hi>his eyes should bee
upon them;</hi> and that, as I take it, first, for
<hi>Choyce,</hi> and secondly for <hi>Vse.</hi> There is
an eye of <hi>Search,</hi> and an eye of <hi>Favour:</hi>
the one is for the seeking and finding
them out, that they may serve; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the countenancing of their
persons, and rewarding of their service.
First then, for the eye of search and
choyce; He would not take them up
at haphazard, nor upon the bare report
and commendation of others, hee
would not presently entertaine them
who most importunately sued or made
the greatest friends, or largest offers;
these being for the most part sure signes
of little desert, and lesse conscience in
the parties themselves, in discharging
the duties of those places they sue for.
Hee that buyeth is thereby shrewdly
provoked, nay, is after a sort openly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3797:143"/>
dispensed withall to sell againe. If hee
have to doo with the treasure, hee will
rob and spoyle; if with justice, he will
take bribes; if with Church affaires,
with matter of warre, or Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it may be hee will goe farther:
Such will make small account to sell a
State, or to deliver up a Kingdome.
Now the King, our Prophet speaketh
of, will for avoyding these mischiefes,
rather become a suter himselfe to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
and able men, for the accepting
and undergoing of such charges as he
knew them fit for: neither would hee
advance any to the highest roomes of
dignity, but such as himselfe by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
had found to bee conscionable
and faithfull in lower places; and if he
could not finde such neare him, hee
would seeke them farther off; his eyes
should runne through the Land from
the one end to the other, for the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them out. <hi>Oculi mei ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ideles
terrae, Mine eyes shall bee to the faithfull of
the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as his eyes were to them for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3797:144"/>
choyce and entertainement: so were
they upon them for encouragement &amp;
reward. <hi>Lord,</hi> saith hee, <hi>who shall dwell
in thy tabernacle,</hi> or <hi>who shall rest upon thy
holy hill?</hi> Among other properties this
is one, <hi>Hee that maketh much of them that
feare the Lord, Psal.</hi> 15. 4. And therefore
in the very next <hi>Psalme</hi> vers. 3, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
that <hi>all his delight was upon the Saints
that are on the earth, and upon such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in vertue.</hi> And againe, in the 119.
36, <hi>I am a companion of all them that feare
thee, and keep thy precepts:</hi> And in speciall
of servants, of Kings and Princes, sayes
<hi>Salomon,</hi> in the 14. of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> at the
last verse, <hi>The pleasure of a King is in a
wise servant, but his wrath shall be toward
him that is lewd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it sufficient to make much
of them by lookes and countenance,
and to feed with good words and faire
promises: but to speake and doe really
for them, as occasion shall serve &amp; they
deserve. <hi>Let thy soule loue a good seruant,
and defraud him not of his liberty, neither
leave him a poore man, Ecclus.</hi> 7. 21. And
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3797:144"/>
the reason is given in the 33. of the same
booke, vers. 29. <hi>If thou have a faithfull
servant, intreate him as thy brother, for
thou hast need of him as of thy selfe.</hi> Such
a Master it seemes <hi>Naaman</hi> was to his
servants: which made them call him
<hi>father; Father, if the Prophet had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thee a great thing, wouldest thou not
have done it?</hi> Such was that Centurion
in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Compare Mat. 8, with Luke 7.</note> who when his servant
was sick, intreated our Savior to come
to him and heale him, calling him by
the same name which signifies a <hi>sonne;</hi>
thereby shewing that good seruants
should be as <hi>sonnes</hi> to their Masters, in
dutifull obedience; and good Masters
againe, as kinde <hi>fathers</hi> in loving affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their servants, as remembring
that themselues have a father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to whom they must one day ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an account of all their actions, and
with him there is no respect of persons.</p>

            <head>Verse 7.
Hee that worketh deceit shall not dwell
within my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.</head>
            <p>OVr Prophet in the fift verse had
promised to banish <hi>Slander</hi> and
<hi>Pride:</hi> heer hee promiseth to take the
like order with <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Lying;</hi> two
vices contrary to those two vertues
which before hee had vowed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<hi>Deceit</hi> beeing opposite to <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>Lying</hi> to <hi>Godliness.</hi> These two
vices are so common and generall, and
yet withall so close and subtile, that he
could not promise utterly to abolish
and extinguish them; but to deale with
them as Physicians doo with pestilent
diseases, to expell them from the vitall
parts: upon discovery, they should not
lodge in the Court, nor remaine in the
Presence. Hee could not alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their entrance and abode there for
a while; deceitfull men beeing as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to cover, as to work their deceit:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3797:145"/>
yet would hee as narrowly as he could
seek them out; and, when he had found
them, cast them out too.</p>
            <p>Indeed the saying is, <hi>Turpius eijcitur,
quàm non admittitur:</hi> It is more shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to cast out a servant, than not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him: But it is as true, <hi>Tutius eijcitur,</hi>
like a raw morsell that sitteth ill in the
stomach, he is more safely cast out than
retained: or, if hee be a Retainer, <hi>non
habitabit,</hi> hee shall not bee in ordinary;
or, if hee bee, hee shall not bee of such
as ly under my roof; or, if hee doo, <hi>non
habitabit in interiori domus meae,</hi> saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias
Montanus,</hi> hee shall have no place in
my privy-chamber, or bed-chamber.</p>
            <p>And for the Lier, hee may chance to
come into my sight, but <hi>non prosperabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
saith <hi>Musculus,</hi> hee shall not build
his neast there: <hi>non firmabitur,</hi> saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias
Montanus,</hi> hee shall take no rooting
there; <hi>non stabilietur,</hi> saith <hi>Iunius,</hi> hee
shall not set up his rest there.</p>
            <p>It was great Wisdom in our Prophet
that hee would not have his house a
mingle-mangle, to consist pel-mel of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3797:146"/>
diverse dispositions, as <hi>Hannibals</hi> army
did of severall nations: hee would not
have his family like a motley cloth, or
a meddly colour; some of his servants
being of one Die, and some of another:
but hee would have all to goe in one
Livery, uniforme and suitable; that so,
all agreeing and according together,
they might all walk, and look, and draw
one way in the service of God &amp; their
Master. For, had hee chosen some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and others profane or idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
some honest and sober, others
swaggerers and unthrifts, some civil &amp;
peaceable, others cut-throats and rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hels;
lastly, some faithfull and godly,
as in the verse next going before; and
some deceitfull and lying, as in this
verse; like fire and water, they would
never have given over striving to expell
and chase away, or to supplant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
one another: so that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
in stead of an orderly and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
service, should have found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but controversie and complaint,
faction and brawl: for, <hi>What fellowship
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3797:146"/>
hath righteousnes with unrighteousnes? what
communion hath light with darknes? what
concord hath Christ with Beliall? what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
hath the temple of God with Idols?
2. Cor.</hi> 6. It was indeed <hi>Machiavels</hi> rule,
<hi>Si vis regnare, divide;</hi> If thou wilt rule
in safety, sowe discord, and set division
betwixt those that are under thee: but
this is a point of the divels policy, hee
never learned it in the school of Christ;
and, for the most part, the practice of
it prooves most dangerous to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto in the generall for so much
as concernes both these vices taken
jointly together; now to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as they ly in order heer in my text:
and first of <hi>working deceit,</hi> and then of
<hi>telling lies.</hi> Deceit is commonly by the
Latines exprest by one of these three
words; <hi>Astutia, Dolus,</hi> or <hi>Fraus:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which, the Schoolmen put this
difference, <hi>Prudentia directè opponitur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stutia,</hi>
To true Wisedome craft or wili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is directly opposed: <hi>executio autem
astutiae est propriè per dolum in verbis, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraudem
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3797:147"/>
fraudem in factis:</hi> but the execution of
craft is properly by cosenage in words,
and by guile in deeds. Wec are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to speake of cosenage in words.
The thing then heere intended, as I
think, is guile in deeds: which howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
it bee now-adaies almost generally
esteemed the essentiall point of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
the proper passion of a Merchant,
and the complement of an absolute
Courtier; yet our Prophet held it so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
as in two severall places he ioins
it in the same verse with bloodthirsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<hi>The Lord will abhorre the bloodthir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and deceitfull man, Psal.</hi> 5. 6. Vpon
which words, saith <hi>Aquinas, Verbo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominand:
denotatur odium irreconciliabile;</hi>
By the word, <hi>Abhorre,</hi> is implied an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
and implacable hatred:
and indeed so it seemes, in as much as
our Prophet tels us again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. and
the last verse, <hi>The bloodthirsty and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men shall not live out half their daies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour, when hee would set
out <hi>Herod</hi> in his colours, cals him a <hi>fox;
Goetell that fox, Luke</hi> 13. 32: and when
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3797:147"/>
hee would commend <hi>Nathanael,</hi> hee
calles him an Israelite, <hi>in whom was no
guile, Iohn</hi> 1. 47. The Divell is in holy
Scripture named a Serpent, not onely
because hee took that shape upon him
when hee deceived our first parents in
Paradise, but because the Serpent was
more subtile than any beast of the field,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. As a Serpent, he is full of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
and turnings, which are called <hi>his
depths, Rev. 2. 24, Neither have knowne
the depths of sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, his deep fetches:
wherupon S. <hi>Paul,</hi> having reproved <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
the Sorcerer, that hee was full of
all subtilty and mischiefe; hee present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
addes, <hi>Thou childe of the divell, and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of all righteousnes, Acts</hi> 13. 10. Now,
as the Divell appeared in the shape of a
Serpent, which is of all beasts the most
subtile and crafty; so did the H. Ghost
in the shape of a Dove, which is of all
birds the most simple and innocent:
and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist tearms our Saviour
a Lamb, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away the sinnes of the world, Iohn</hi> 1. 29.
And again the next day, as hee saw him
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3797:148"/>
walking by, <hi>Behold the Lamb,</hi> or, as the
Original and our last Translation reads
it, <hi>that Lamb of God:</hi> not onely because
he was so prefigured in the sacrifice of
the Paschal Lamb, and foretold by the
Prophets, <hi>Hee was ledde as a sheep to the
slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before the
shearer, so opened hee not his mouth, Esay</hi>
53. 7; but also because hee had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of a Lamb, and those specially
of a native innocency and godly sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;
according to that of the same
Evangelicall Prophet, cited by S. <hi>Peter,
1. 2. 22, Hee did no sin, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
guile found in his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a blockish simplicity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stupidity, arising out of a naturall
defect; When a man deceives not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because hee wants wit to doo it:
and this is no more praise-worthy, than
continency in one that is an Eunuch
by nature, or sobriety in him that hath
no means to exceed. And ther is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
simplicity, when a man hath wit suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;
yet so, as, being corrected and
qualified by grace, hee restrains it from
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3797:148"/>
such mischievous and guilefull plots;
as his naturall corruption would draw
him unto. And this indeed is that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and none but this, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in Scripture, and accepted of
God. <hi>Posse &amp; nolle, nobile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the vice contrary to this, is that
which the Civilians call <hi>dolus malus,</hi> by
them opposed to <hi>bona fides,</hi> and defined
to bee <hi>Machinatio quaedam alterius decipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi
causa, cum aliud agitur, &amp; aliud simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur,</hi>
A device for the deceiving of a
man, where one thing is done, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is dissembled. Whereunto agrees
that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> in the first book of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
where hee approves the reply of
<hi>Aquilius</hi> his familiar friend: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded, <hi>Quid esset dolus,</hi> what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
was; he answers, <hi>Vbialiud est actum,
&amp; aliud simulatum,</hi> where one thing is
practised, and another pretended: And
of <hi>Augustine</hi> in his seaventh Tract up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Iohn,</hi> expounding those words of
Christ, touching <hi>Nathanael, Behold an Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,
in whom is no guile: Tum dolus est,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith hee, <hi>cum aliud agitur, &amp; aliud fingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:3797:149"/>
when one thing appears in the fact,
and another thing is hid in the heart.
Yet even this, if it bee for the good of
some, and the hurt and hinderance of
none, I dare not pronounce to be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
unlawfull. Such a deceit is that
which Nurses use for the stilling of
their children; or Physicians, for the
healing of their Patients. Such did our
Prophet himselfe use, when for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of his life hee fained himself mad,
among the Philistines, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 13.
And hitherto are those words of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
by some referred, <hi>For as much as I was
crafty, I took you by guile, 2. Cor.</hi> 12. 16.</p>
            <p>Nay, though it tend to the outward
hinderance and hurt of some, I cannot
alwaies utterly condemn it. It was by
a cunning sleight, that the Israelites
robbed the Egyptians, that <hi>Ehud</hi> slew
<hi>Eglon,</hi> and <hi>Iehu</hi> Baals priests: yet they
being warranted by Gods counsell, and
excited by his Spirit, what therin they
did was in right justifiable. Nay, more
than so: in a just and honorable warre,
where it is lawfull to kill, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3797:149"/>
by stratagems to deceive.</p>
            <l>Dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit!</l>
            <p>It was the speech indeed of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
yet approoved by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierome</hi> in
his Exposition upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17; but with
this caution, that it be practised <hi>without
the violating of an oath, the breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
or <hi>the making of a lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ich notwithstanding, the world
too well knoweth, and with griefe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it to bee both the doctrine and the
practice of the Church of Rome, that
<hi>Faith plighted to Hereticks is not to bee held.</hi>
Which position while she houlds, I see
not how those whom she accounts He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques
can either with safety and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
or without just fear and manifest
danger, any way rely upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
made with her or her adherents.
Their morall or civill honesty may
chance ty them to the performance of
such oaths: but (I am sure) their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the strongest bond of conscience,
doth not. Nay, if it bee for the good of
their Church, it dispenseth with the
breach, and (which is more) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3797:150"/>
them to break it. It is written by an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
no stranger to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that the Proverb is, <hi>Mercatorum est, non
regum, stare iuramentis,</hi> It is for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts,
not Kings, to stand to their
oathes: but from such <hi>Merchants of mens
soules, Libera nos Domine,</hi> Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us.</p>
            <p>Now, the inconveniences and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
which accompany this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
specially in a servant, are these:
<hi>First,</hi> himself seldome or never thrives
by it; hee enjoyes not the benefit of
that which hee gets by falshod, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that of <hi>Salomon, Proverb. 12. 27.
The deceitfull man rosteth not that which he
tooke in hun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing:</hi> and of our Prophet,
<hi>Psal. 58. 9. Or ever their pots bee made hot
with thornes, so shall indignation vex them
as a thing that is raw.</hi> It shall fare with
them as with hunters, who many times
when they take a prey, yet themselves
taste not of it; or as with meat, which,
the thornes being consumed under the
pot, is left unsodden: and so all their
plottes and enterprises become as the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3797:150"/>
untimely fruit of a woman, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sees the sunne. And if they come
not to publike shame amongst men,
which for the most part they doe (the
vizard of their hypocrisie being pluckt
off) yet God in his due time will not
forget them. According to that of the
Apostle, 1. <hi>Thes. 4. 6, Let no man oppresse
or defraud his brother, for God is the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of all such things.</hi> If a man be so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to oppresse, that the Magistrate wil
not lay holde on him, or so cunning
to defraude that the lawe cannot take
holde of him, then where man and
his lawe cease, there God and his lawe
begin; though they dazle the eyes of
men, yet the eye of God they cannot;
and the lesse they feele at the hands of
men, the heavier shall they feele the
hand of God, either in their states, or
in their bodies, or in their soules, or in
their posterity, or in all. Such a one
may flourish for a while, like a greene
Bay tree; but, <hi>I went by, and loe hee was
gone; I sought him, but his place could no
vvhere bee found. Keepe innocencie then
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3797:151"/>
and take heed to the thing that is right, for
that shall bring a man peace at the last, Psal.</hi>
37. It is the surest, and fairest, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
way to bring him to riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in as much as all men desire to
deale with him whom they repute ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
though themselves bee not such:
but the undoubted way it is to bring
him <hi>Peace,</hi> peace with himselfe, and
peace with his God; without which,
his riches and honour will doe him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
good: Nay, they will in the ende
prove his bane and confusion.</p>
            <p>Another mischiefe, that arises from
the deceitfulness of a Servant, is to his
Master (specially if hee be a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage,
and of eminent note) either by
bringing-in unjust accounts, or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
him to his enemies; who som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
preferre a servant, that they may
thereby worke villany and get intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of secrets; and so it may come
to passe, that under a velvet or silke or
scarlet cloake, a Iesuite or Priest may
be entertained: or lastly, in deceiving
others, by using his Masters name,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3797:151"/>
though without his knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
yet hee cannot but by that means
breed in mens minds an ill conceit, &amp; in
their tongues an il report of his Master.
It very much then imports great men &amp;
Princes, not onely to observe narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such servants as they suspect, but for
examples sake to punish them severely
being detected. Such were some of
them about the good Emperour <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
who by Monopolies and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by projects and perquisites en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enriched
themselves, to the impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
of the estate, and the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring
of their Master: Nay, of him
they made a Monopoly too; who, being
let to know no more then what they
pleased to informe him, was of them
by that meanes even bought and sold.
But <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> tooke another
course with them: who understanding
that <hi>Vercovius</hi> had greatly abused his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
taking much money of diverse
to preferre their sutes, and dooing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for them, hee caused him to bee
hanged up in a chimney as some write,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3797:152"/>
or as others, to bee tied in publique to
a stake, and there to bee stifled with
smoake; an Herauld proclaiming to
the people, <hi>Fumum vendidit, &amp; fumo
pereat,</hi> Smoak he solde, and with smoak
let him perish. And, if it be observed,
the greatest Marchants of smoak have
ever been found to be the greatest sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
of their Masters, <hi>Having mens
persons in admiration because of advantage,
Iude</hi> 16. I have dwelt somewhat the
longer upon this point, because the
Court is generally held the Shop, the
Forge, nay, the Schoole and Theater
of this vice: not without good cause
then doth our Prophet vow, it shall
not dwell with him.</p>
            <p>As in the first place hee excludeth
<hi>working of deceit;</hi> So doth he in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>telling of lies: Hee that telleth lies
shall not tarry in my sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Servum nolle mentiri nova religio est,</l>
            <l>Saith one of the antient Comikes;</l>
            <p>And another,
<q>
                  <l>Is cliens frugi habetur, qui neque leges,</l>
                  <l>neque aequum bonum unquam colit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:3797:152"/>But this is heathenish divinity: or as
it may well bee thought, they rather
spake what men commonly did, then
what they should doe. Once, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
I am sure was of another minde:
though he were an old servant, though
never so usefull and profitable to him,
though never so neare and deare, as his
right hand, or his right eye; yet if hee
fell to lying, away he must; hee would
would bee so farre from shewing him
any favour, that hee should not so
much as enjoy the sight of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>A wonder it is to consider that the
imputation of a lie should bee so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and yet the practice so frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men (specially those who stand
most upon their reputation) the name
so hatefull, and the use so common:
that men should be so tender, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the giving of the lie, as to think
it presently worthie the stabbe or the
chalenge; and yet to be so careless and
unconscionable in the making of it: a
strange kinde of vanity, I say it is, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3797:153"/>
a marvailous repugnancy and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the nature of man, to bee so
hot in the pursuite of the one, and so
colde in the other. Wherefore either
seeme to bee as thou art, or be as thou
wouldst seeme: either have a care and
conscience that thou make not a lie, or
bee content that a man call a Spade a
Spade, a Lier a Lier.</p>
            <p>This vice of all other is so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
spread over the face of the world,
not onely among servants, but all sorts
of men, that what our Prophet spake in
his haste, <hi>I said in mine haste, all men are
Liers, Psalm</hi> 106. 10, that the Apostle
spake advisedly, <hi>Rom. 3. 4, Let God bee
true, and every man a lyer.</hi> But we must
know it is one thing to lie, and another
to make a trade or custome of lying:
one thing to slip into it unawares; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
deliberately to forge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, and which is worse to defend
it, and stand in it being done. The one
may proceed from the common frailty
incident to mankinde; yet not without
some striving against it, and repentance

for it, in such as are sanctified by Gods
spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it: but the later is onely proper to
the unbeleeving and unregenerate.
Therefore sayes our Prophet, not <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens
mendacium,</hi> in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but <hi>mendacia,</hi> in the plurall.</p>
            <p>Now in the handling of this point,
wee may <hi>first</hi> consider the nature, and
diverse kindes of a Lie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the
greatnesse of the offence, how slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
soever we esteeme of it. And <hi>lastly,</hi>
the punishment alwaies due unto it, &amp;
many times inflicted upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Lie</hi> (to speak properly) <hi>is the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of an untruth with an intent to deceive.</hi>
For the clearer unfolding of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
we are to call to mind a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
truth mentioned in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> of <hi>Affection,</hi> of
<hi>Action,</hi> of <hi>Speech.</hi> The truth of <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is opposed to Error, of <hi>Affection</hi> to
Hypocrisie, of <hi>Action</hi> to Dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of <hi>Speech</hi> to Lies or Falshood.
If a man speak that which is false with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an intent to deceive, supposing it to
be a truth, it is a material lie. If he speak
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3797:154"/>
a truth with an intent to deceive, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
hee spake a falshood, it is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
lie: But if hee speake a falshood,
knowing it to be a falshood, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to deceive, this is a full, a flat lie;
it hath the whole essence, the matter &amp;
the forme, the soule and the bodie of
a lie.</p>
            <p>The materiall lie is lyable to the
censure of men, but excusable before
God, at least <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto;</hi>
in as much as it proceeds out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
the tongue agreeing with the
understanding, but the understanding
disagreeing from the thing. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
lie is punishable by God, though
acquitted by men; in as much as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
disagrees from the speech,
though the speech agree with the
thing: but the full lie including both
the matter and the forme, deserves pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
both from God and men; in
as much as in it both the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
disagrees from the speech, and the
speech from the thing. Which ground
being laid, I see not how the most cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3797:154"/>
Sophisters in the world can free
their equivocations, and mentall reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
at leastwise from the formality
of a lie: which is indeed the life of it,
if there may bee life in such a dead
work. For, to grant that the thing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
they speake is true, yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
but they speake it with an intent to
deceive: and then <hi>Linguam ream facit
mens rea,</hi> It is a guilty minde that makes
a guilty tongue; according to that of
<hi>Augustine, Ex animi sui sententia non ex
rerum ipsarum veritate aut falsitate menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
aut non mentiens iudicandus est:</hi> A Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to bee iudged not so much by the
truth and falshood of things, as by the
purpose and intent of his minde.</p>
            <p>It matters not then, whether my lye
be <hi>iocosum</hi> onely for sport and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or <hi>officiosum,</hi> for the pretended
good of some, without the hurt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
or <hi>malitiosum,</hi> out of a mischievous
designe: if it be an untruth uttred with
an intent to deceive, it comes all to one
for the unlawfulnesse of it; howbeit,
the one bee sinfull in a higher degree,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3797:155"/>
more divelish and damnable than the
other: and beeing once unlawfull in it
self, as being a direct breach of the law,
none other respect but onely the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative
power of the Lawgiver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
can possibly make it lawfull. When
<hi>Thespis,</hi> the first stage-player, was asked
if he were not ashamed to utter so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
untruths in so worthy an audience;
hee answered, that hee did it in sport:
but wise <hi>Solon</hi> replied, if wee approve
and commend this sport, we shall finde
it in earnest, in our contracts &amp; affaires.
And even so indeed by just judgement
it befalles a man, who, using to ly in
sport, gets an habite of lying in earnest;
and with his jesting lies raiseth such a
suspicion of him, that, bee he in never
so good earnest, hee cannot bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And for officious lies, since wee
cannot make a lie for God cause, as <hi>Iob</hi>
testifies, 13. 9; much less may we ly for
the behoof of our selves or other men.
<hi>Vse not then to make any manner of lie: for,
the custome thereof is not good, Ecclus.</hi> 7. 13.
No good and honest means are to bee
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3797:155"/>
neglected, which tend to the refreshing
and cheering of their spirits who beare
the burden of the State: yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Hosea</hi> 7. 3, reproves those <hi>that make
the king glad with their wickednesse, and the
Princes with their lies:</hi> neither is it anie
way warrantable <hi>to doo evill, that good
may come thereof, Rom. 3. 8. As righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
then and peace, so truth and charity are
inseparable companions.</hi> And therfore the
Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, puts downe this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other marks of <hi>charity,</hi> that <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth
in the truth,</hi> verse 6.</p>
            <p>And for those examples registred in
holy Scripture of the Mid-wives to
save the male-infants of the Hebrews,
of <hi>Rahab</hi> to save the spies, of <hi>Mich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> and
<hi>Ionathan</hi> to save <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Sauls</hi> fury,
and the like of that kinde, either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
or not discommended; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that we must distinguish betwixt
the deeds of the faithfull, and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dooing them. Their facts in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>David,</hi> the children, the spies,
were commendable, and argued the
fear of God and love of his children:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3797:156"/>
but the manner of putting them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
is neither approoved in holie
Scripture, nor was in it selfe justifiable,
nor is to bee imitated of us; it beeing
no more lawfull to save a mans life by a
lie, than by theft: both which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, in themselves deserve
death eternall. <hi>Et quomodo non perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissimè
dicitur</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine) ut alter
corporaliter vivat, debere alterum spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
mori?</hi> How can it be but a perverse
assertion, to say, That one should incur
the death of the soule, to free another
from that of the body? And not farre
off in another place, <hi>Quanto fortius, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
excellentius dices, Nec prodam, nec men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiar,
ut</hi> Firmus <hi>Episcopus Tagastensis?</hi>
How much more courage and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
doth it shew, for a man to say, I will
neither betray the truth, nor my friend;
as did <hi>Firmus</hi> Bishoppe of Tagastum,
Firmus <hi>nomine, firmior autem re; Firm</hi>
in name, but more firm indeed.</p>
            <p>The truth heerof will the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we consider the greatnes of the
offense, the <hi>second</hi> thing which I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3797:156"/>
in as much as it is <hi>first</hi> directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God himselfe; <hi>secondly,</hi> against
the Scriptures, the Oracles of GOD;
<hi>thirdly,</hi> against nature, the workmanship
of God; and <hi>fourthly,</hi> against civill so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
the ordinance of God. Against
<hi>God</hi> it is both essentially and personally
taken. Against God the Father; <hi>This is
eternall life, that they knowe thee to bee the
onely true God, Iohn</hi> 17. 3: Against God
the Sonne; <hi>I am the way, the truth, and
the life, Iohn</hi> 14. 6: Against God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost; <hi>When hee is comne, who is the
Spirit of truth, he will lead you into all truth,
Iohn</hi> 16. 13. And as God is the Father
of truth; so is the Divell the father of
Lies: when hee speaketh a Lie,
then hee speaketh of his owne; for
hee is a lier, and the father thereof, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
8. 44. No marvell then, that one of
those seven things which the Lord
hates, and his soule abhorres, is a <hi>lying
tongue, Pro.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is against the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
the Oracles of God. And therefore are
they truely called <hi>Verbum veritatis,</hi> the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3797:157"/>
word of truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were indited by the Author
of all truth, or because they contain so
much supernaturall truth as is requisite
for our salvation, but withall because
they excite us to the imbracing &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
of truth. <hi>Cast off lying, and speake
every man truth unto his neighbour, Ephes.
4. 25. Ly not one to another, Col. 3. 9. Lord,
who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle,</hi> saith our
Prophet? <hi>Even he that speaketh the truth
from his heart, Psal.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is against <hi>nature,</hi> the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of God. It is the priviledge
of Mankinde above all Creatures, that
hee is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a creature capable
both of reason and speech: and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was ordained to bee the guide and
directer of our speech; so was our
speech, to be the expounder and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of reason. And therefore the
Grammarians make <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
speech, to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that which
gives light to the notions of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
If, then, wee speak one thing
and think another, if wee expresse one
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3797:157"/>
thing with our lips, and conceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing in our hearts, it is against the
end for which God created speech.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, it is against <hi>Civill
society,</hi> the ordinance of God; a maine
part wherof consisting in Conference,
in Consultation, in Contracts, <hi>Fractavel
leviter imminuta authoritate veritatis,
omnia dubia remanebunt,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine;</hi>
The credit and soverainty of
truth, being never so little crackt, or
the practice of lying never so little cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced,
a man can build upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but all things will bee full of
doubt and distrust. Rightly then saith
the same good Father, <hi>Nunquam errare
tutius existimo, quam cum in amore nimio
veritatis &amp; reiectione nimia falsitatis erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi>
A man cannot lightly erre more
safely, then in too much love of truth,
&amp; hatred of lies. Truth is a salt which
serveth for the seasoning of every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and maketh it favorie both to God
and man: and in the 6. to the <hi>Ephes.</hi> it
is compared to a <hi>girdle,</hi> or a Souldiers
belt, whereby they knit together and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3797:158"/>
close vnto their middle the upper and
lower peeces of their armour. And
these belts, as they were strong, so were
they set with studs, being faire &amp; large.
There is then a double use of them:
one, to keepe the severall peeces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
fast and close together, &amp; to hold
the loynes of a man firm &amp; steddy, that
hee may be able to stand the surer, and
holde out the longer; the other, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ioynts of the armour, that they
might not be seene. The first use was
for strength, the second for ornament:
and thus truth is both an ornament to a
Christian souldier, and also an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
meanes for strength to uphold and
assure him in the day of trial. Therfore
wisely doth <hi>Solomon</hi> advise us, <hi>To buy the
truth, but in no case to sell it, Pro.</hi> 23. 23.</p>
            <p>The last thing which I promised, is
the <hi>punishment:</hi> and that surely cannot
but much aggravate the grievousnesse
of the sinne. It is both the punishment
of other sinnes, and other sinnes the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of it. When God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>Ahab</hi> for his wickedness, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3797:158"/>
the Divell offers himselfe for the
execution of the service; <hi>I will goe and
be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
1. King.</hi> 22. And those that <hi>would
not beleeve and love the truth, he punisheth
with strong delusions that they should beleeue
lies, 2. Thess.</hi> 2. And as it is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of other sinnes, so did hee punish
it with other sinnes in those Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of the Gentiles, who <hi>because they
turned the truth of God into a lie, therefore
God gaue them up unto vile affections, Rom.</hi>
1. 25. And the rule is general, <hi>The mouth
that lieth slayeth the soule, Wis. 1. 11. Thou
shalt destroy them that speake lies, Psal.</hi> 5. 6.
And <hi>Revel. 22. 15, Without shall bee dogs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and enchanters, and whoremongers, and
murtherers, and Idolaters, and whosoever
loveth or maketh lies.</hi> And if God thus
shutte them out of his presence; not
without cause doth our Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>They shall not tarry in his sight.</hi> It is
the prayer of <hi>Salomon, Prov. 30. Remoue
from mee vanity and lies;</hi> and his position
in the 29. of the same book, ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the practice of lies, much more the
doctrine of lies, <hi>Teaching lies through hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
1. Tim.</hi> 4. 2. One effect whereof
is the confident relation of their lying
miracles, and that <hi>Golden Legend</hi> compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a <hi>leaden braine,</hi> and published by

Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> conclusion of his two
Treatises <hi>de mendacio ad Consentium, Aut
cavenda sunt mendacia recte agendo, aut
confitenda sunt poenitendo; non autem, cum
abundent infeliciter viuendo, augenda sunt
&amp; docendo.</hi> Lies are either to be shund
by speaking truth, or to be confest and
bewailed with sorrow; or if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
by ill living, they are not to bee
multiplied by teaching them as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

            <p>OVr Prophet, having in the former
verses of this <hi>Psalme,</hi> vowed the
reformation of his <hi>owne Person,</hi> of his
<hi>housholde Servants,</hi> of his <hi>Counsellers &amp;

both of the <hi>Church</hi> and of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weak,</hi>
of the <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi>
State. In the handling of which words,
I will follow the method proposed in
the Text. The first word is, <hi>In matuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
as <hi>Arias Montanus;</hi> or <hi>Singulis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutinis,</hi>
as <hi>Tremelius</hi> renders it: In the

bee his <hi>mornings</hi> worke; and then his
<hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>perseverance,</hi> in that it
should bee his worke euery morning,
The second thing is, <hi>the worke it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:3797:160"/>
I will destroy, I will cut off;</hi> his meaning
is, when no other remedy will serve
the turne. The third is the <hi>Obiect,</hi> the
persons upon whom this severe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
is to be done; not petty offenders,
much lesse the innocent, but notorious
malefactors: <hi>The vvicked of the Land,
wicked doers.</hi> The fourth is, the <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi>
of his proceeding without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons, <hi>All</hi> the wicked of the
Land, <hi>all</hi> wicked doers; twice repeated,
that we might take notice of it. As he
wold cut off none but notorious male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
so would he as near as he could
cut them <hi>all</hi> off: Neither his heart nor
his eye should pitie, nor his hand spare
any of them. The fift and last is, the
<hi>End</hi> hee proposeth to him selfe of this
worke; <hi>the purging of the Citie of the Lord,</hi>
by which is meant <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> first, for
<hi>Example</hi> to the whole Realme, it being
the <hi>Metropolis</hi> and head Citie of the
kingdome; as also and principally, by
reason the <hi>service of God</hi> and the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of religion</hi> was in a speciall manner
by divine ordinance tyed unto it. First
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3797:160"/>
then of the first, <hi>In matutinis:</hi> wherein
his <hi>diligence</hi> in the carefull performing
of this worke comes first to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>The saying is common, and in some
cases no lesse just, <hi>Odi nimium diligen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es:</hi>
but where the businesse is weighty, and
the fayling dangerous, a man can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be too, diligent. The life of man is
precious, and the preservation of the
State and Church important; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in such a case is not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
but necessary. The search
of truth is hard, specially being disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the colourable shifts of cunning
heads: and in such a case, as it <hi>is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of god to conceal a thing, so it is the Kings
honour to search out a matter, Prov.</hi> 25. 2.
And no time so fit for this search as the
<hi>morning,</hi> when mens wits are freshest,
and their mindes after repose least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted:
Therefore <hi>Iosuah</hi> rose early
in the morning for the discovery of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans
theft,</hi> 7. 16. And besides, the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of wine often makes men after
meales <hi>to forget the lawe, and pervert the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3797:161"/>
iudgement, Pro.</hi> 31. 5. Therefore is there
a woe pronounced against that Land,
whose Princes or chiefe Magistrates
<hi>eate in the morning, Eccles.</hi> 10. 16; that is,
take up that time which is specially al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
for matters of justice, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
and unseasonable eating and
drinking. As then he is cursed that doth
the worke of the Lord negligently: so
is hee blessed that doth it <hi>diligently</hi> and
watchfully, <hi>In matutinis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second thing implyed in this
word, is <hi>speed</hi> and <hi>dispatch:</hi> therefore it
followes in the same place of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ieremy, Cursed bee hee that keepeth
backe his sword from blood, 48. 10;</hi> that
deferreth to doe justice when occasion
and oportunity is offered, when reason
and religion requires it. Delayes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things are not good: but in this
they are starke naught, because by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
great offences many times get ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friends for protection, or meanes
for evasion; according to a saying of
the <hi>Italians, Give mee time, and give mee
life.</hi> Againe, by delay and connivence,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:3797:161"/>
small offences growe great: a little fire
which at first might have beene put
out with a spoonfull of water, being let
to burne, turnes townes and cities into
ashes, and cannot bee quenched with
whole rivers. Punishments are as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
which if they be kept too long,
hazard the Patient, and lose their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
And Magistrates as Physicians,
who must not let a disease go too long,
left by sufferance it proove incurable;
which might haue beene holpen by
timely ministring. Lastly, as by delay
the offender growes bolder, to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indangering and oppressing of the
innocent, the infecting of the good, the
hartening and hardning of the wicked:
So hee that should cut him off, many
times by tract of time growes colder in
his zeale to justice.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Ioab</hi> had received condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

Prov.</hi> 13. 24, is also required of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Common-wealth: <hi>Whose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will not doe the lawe of God and the
King, let iudgement be executed speedily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, Esra,</hi> 7. 26. And the reason hereof
is yeelded by <hi>Salomon, Eccles. 8. 11. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sentence against an evill worke is not
executed speedily, the heart of the sonnes of
men is fully set on mischiefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet is there <hi>not more haste</hi> to be made
<hi>than good speed.</hi> The celestiall spheares,
the higher they are in situation, the
slower are they in their proper moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and the supreame Iudge of the
world useth much forbearance &amp; long
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3797:162"/>
suffering toward sinners, that so by the
riches of his goodnes hee might draw
them to repentance; or because hee
foreseeth, that they will doo some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
good worke to the advancement
of his glory, &amp; the good of his church:
Much like, saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in that golden
Booke of his, <hi>De sera Numinis vindicta,</hi>
as the lawes ordain that a woman, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to death for some hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
bee neverthelesse reprived and
spared, if shee be with childe, untill she
bee delivered: which beeing done, the
Law is executed upon her. As then the
supreme Iudge in heaven inflicts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
on offenders without al pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and with all patience, in due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
place and season: so should his
Vice-gerents on earth, not so much out
of desire of revenge, as zeal of justice;
<hi>For, the wrath of max worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of God, Iames</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>And as hee, which hath no skill in
Physick, cannot with reason controule
a skilfull Physician, because hee draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
blood from his Patient rather to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3797:163"/>
morrow than to day: so neither ought
men to censure the proceedings of
God, whose judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are many times
secret, but alwaies right; having feet
of lead, but hands of iron: and though
hee bee long a-striking, yet he strikes
home at last; <hi>tarditatem gravitate compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat,</hi>
he makes amends for his sloweness
with the waightiness of his blow. Nor,
among men, ought inferiours too farre
to censure the proceedings of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours;
who many times stop the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Iustice, for causes just and
reasonable in themselves, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to us. <hi>The Heaven for height, &amp;
the earth for depth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the heart of the king,
is unsearchable, Pro.</hi> 25. 3.</p>
            <p>The Law enacted by <hi>Theodosius,</hi> at
the instance of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> cannot bee
misliked: that because, being transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with choler, hee had caused many
Innocents of Thessalonica to be put to
the sword; from thenceforth thirtie
daies should passe betwixt the sentence
of death and the execution thereof: in
as much as the guilty, though spared
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:3797:163"/>
for a time, might notwithstanding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
bee executed; but the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
beeing once executed, could not
again bee restored. Yet can it not bee
denied, but upon evident proofe and a
fair triall, so way bee not given to rash
&amp; unadvised anger, for many &amp; waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reasons already touched, it were for
the most part better, that expedition in
punishing great offenses, and cutting
off notorious malefactours, were rather
used, than slacknes.</p>
            <p>Some others there are, who, by this
<hi>Betimes</hi> heer mentioned in my Text,
understand our Prophet as vowing the
execution of Iustice at his first entrance
to the Crowne, in the <hi>morning of his
raign.</hi> Like a cleane soule comming out
of the hands of the Creator, &amp; placed
in a Kingdom left by <hi>Saul,</hi> as in a body
altogether unclean, hee promiseth, not
to draw pollution from it, as the soule
doth from the body; but rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to cleanse it from those foule
impieties wherewith it swarmed: heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
resembling the Sun in the Heavens,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3797:164"/>
which as soon as it riseth, or before it
appear, chaseth the darknes before it,
and is clothed with glory, as with a
robe.</p>
            <p>Heer, reason of State objecteth the
danger of sudden innovation, feare of
the multitude; and I knowe not what
a number of doubts and difficulties it
forecasts: but our Prophet, though
doubtlesse not ignorant of these, yet in
a holy resolution casts them behinde
him; as well knowing, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of humane policy are as uncertain
as the braine wherein they are forged;
beeing perswaded in conscience, and
his heart telling him, The action it self
was good, the throng and thickness of
difficulties should not discourage him,
but rather make him the more stoutly
to plucke up his spirits, and to buckle
himself more roundly to the businesse.
It was a sore task he had in hand, a long
journey hee had to goe; and therefore
hee had need to set forth betime, if hee
meant to arrive at the end thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the night of death should overtake
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:3797:164"/>They were memorable peeces of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
which <hi>Salomon</hi> did, as soon as God
had put the scepter into his hand. <hi>Iehu,</hi>
at his first entrance into the Kingdom,
roots out the house of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the
worship of <hi>Baal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iosiah,</hi> when hee was
now but twelve yeeres old, beganne to
purge Iudah and Ierusalem, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 34;
that men might knowe what they were
to trust unto in the succeeding course
of his government.</p>
            <p>Yet I take not our Prophets meaning
to bee, that the Prince at his <hi>first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi>
should unwisely and without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<hi>destroy</hi> and <hi>cut off;</hi> for so, perhaps,
by seeking to make a way for godliness
and vertue, and to banish impietie and
vice, he might chance to fall into a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
more intolerable tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the present
condition: the remedy might proove
worse than the disease.</p>
            <p>In nature wee see, that such a body
there may bee, in which all the blood
shall bee so corrupted, that, before a
man should find any good blood ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
hee might (if he would use phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3797:165"/>
draw out &amp; take away both the
life and last drop together: in such a
case, when the corruption is so grosse
and infinite, a skilfull Physician will use
<hi>Epicrasis,</hi> as they call it, labouring to
bring the body to a better te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature.
He will draw from it at diverse times
and by diverse means; but yet hee will
take no more but what is needfull to
unburthen nature: which, beeing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
gathereth vigour to it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and evacuateth, by sweating and
other good meanes, the malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
&amp; at length cleanseth the blood
it self: so may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and superfluous humours of the
State, not presently open a vein, lest so
perhappes the spirits depart with the
blood, and the life goe away with the
strength, but by degrees; as hee may
displace corrupt Officers and Iudges,
and substitute better in their roomes:
and by this discretion, and Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon it, he shall see in a short time
a conversion of the body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3797:165"/>
without any subversion
or trouble to it or in it; a new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and yet without any great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
or change.</p>
            <p>The shippe of Delos, so renowned in
antiquity for lasting many years and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
without renewing, whence got it
that fame? but because, as soone as a
plank was in danger or beganne to rot,
they presently provided a new &amp; sound
one in the room thereof: And the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
way to restore a decayed State, is,
To proceed by the same course; but
then there needs <hi>constancy and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
singalis matutinis, morning after
morning every morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not one mornings work: but, as
<hi>Speed</hi> is required for such a work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay, and <hi>Diligence</hi> without remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
so is <hi>Constancy,</hi> without intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is a common saying, that <hi>A new
besome sweepsclean;</hi> but it is a true one,
that <hi>The end crowns the work:</hi> for, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
well and then to give over, or to go
on by starts, and not with a constant
hand, is the next way to draw on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3797:166"/>
which many times proves more
dangerous than the originall sicknesse.
Many, to win applause, or the better to
settle themselves in their regall or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
Thrones, have begunne with
wholesome Lawes, and strict executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them: but, within a while they
have growne weary, either by despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the event would answer their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
or by giving themselves over to
ease and pleasure; and so have lost both
their honour with men, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with God. But, as naturall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
gather strength in moving: so a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
begun aright out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of duty, and a zeal of goodnes,
though it finde some rubs and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at first; yet the farther it wades,
the more easie it findes the passage, and
the means more ready for the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of what it intends.</p>
            <p>Had our King <hi>Henry,</hi> the last of that
name, continued the same course at the
last as at first he began with, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
execution of <hi>Empson &amp; Dudley,</hi> two
caterpillers of the State; he had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3797:166"/>
left more honour to his name, and
happely more treasure in his Coffers.
Had <hi>Nero</hi> held-out the residue of his
government suitably to his first five
years, hee might well have marched in
equall rank with the best Emperours:
but, beginning with an head of gold, &amp;
ending in feet of iron &amp; clay, hee now
stands registred amongst the monsters
of mankinde. It was constancy which
made <hi>Augustus</hi> truely to affirme of
Rome at his death, <hi>Lateritiam inveni,
marmoream reliqui;</hi> I found it Brick, and
left it Marble. It was constancy that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in every corner so many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of honor to the memory of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,</hi>
that the great <hi>Constantine,</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Empire about two hundred
years after, was wont to call him <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam
parietariam,</hi> Pellitory of the wall.
And lastly, constancy it was, and houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on in an upright course to the end,
that made al Iudah and Ierusalem sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to mourn at the funerals of the good
King <hi>Iosiah;</hi> and the singing men and
women continually in succeeding ages
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3797:167"/>
to remember his name in their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
Whereas it is recorded of
some other of that race, who had faire
&amp; glorious beginnings, but clowdy &amp;
durty endings, that they dyed without
being desired of the people: no man so
much as shed a teare at their funerals,
or wished them in beeing againe.</p>
            <p>I come from our Prophets <hi>diligence,
dispatch,</hi> and <hi>perseverance,</hi> to the worke
it selfe; <hi>I will destroy, I will cut off:</hi> where
a question offers it selfe, <hi>Whether it bee
lawfull, or no, to destroy; in what case it is
lawfull,</hi> and <hi>to whom it belongs?</hi> For the
commandement seemes to be generall,
<hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> and so doth the rule,
grounded upon the law of Nature, and
given before the Morall lawe, <hi>Who-so
sheddeth mans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>blood, by man shall his blood
be shed:</hi> and the reason is added; For,
<hi>in the image of God made hee man, Gen.</hi> 9.
6. And to the lawe Naturall and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
is added the Evangelicall, <hi>All that
take the sword shall perish with the sword,
Mat. 26. 52:</hi> Which passages, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the peevishness of Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3797:167"/>
interpretations following the
letter and not the sense, the rinde and
and not the pith, are not to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
without many limitations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.
For the resolution then of
the question, we are to knowe, that in
three cases, which by some are held
unlawfull, it is lawfull to destroy; and
in three other cases, by othersome held
lawfull, is is unlawfull to destroy. It is
lawfull for a man to destroy another,
either <hi>Se defendenda, in defence of his own
person,</hi> or <hi>in a iust and lawfull warre,</hi> or <hi>by
the sword of the publique Magistrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In defence of his owne person, in as
much as charity begins at home: and
being to love our neighbour but as our
selves, the love of our selves is the rule
of the love of our neighbour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
before it in nature; the rule
by which a thing is ruled and ordered,
being ever in nature before that which
is ruled and ordered by it. If then my
person bee violently assaulted, and my
life wrongfully indangered, it is not
onely lawfull but commendable, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3797:168"/>
or take away the assailants life,
for the preservation of mine owne:
but, if I can by any other meanes save
mine owne life without the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of his; though it bee in the worlds
account reputed disgracefull, yet am I
in Christian charity to make choice of
that; which as it teacheth a man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
his owne life before anothers: so
doth it also to preferre another mans
life before mine owne pretended or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
reputation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is lawfull to destroy in
a just and lawfull warre: which is then
presumed so to be, when it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the supreame Magistrate, either
for the revenging of outrages commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or for the repairing of injuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or for the recovering of right
detained, or for defending of our own
countrey or religion, by the enemy
threatned. And though it were to bee
wished, that, among those who joyntly
professe the glorious name of Iesus,
none occasion were offered of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another and spilling of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3797:168"/>
blood, but that they might all
joyne their hearts and hands together
in destroying the professed enemies of
that name: yet as long as covetousness
and ambition are admitted to Counsel,
as long as right is measured by might,
and private respects are made publique
quarrels; as long as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
the eldest sonne of that <hi>Abaddon</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollion,
Revel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which indeed signifies
a <hi>Destroyer,</hi> proudly challenges to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
those words of <hi>Ieremy, 1. 10. I haue
this day set thee over the nations, and over
kingdomes, to root out, to pull downe, and to
destroy,</hi> as <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> expresly doth
in his declaratory Bull against Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, and is
therein not checked, but applauded by
Christian Princes; So long I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such
a wish may well passe for an honest and
religious desire, though in reason it be
never likely to take effect: nay, wee are
sure that the grand Destroyer himselfe
is at last to be destroyed, even by those
Christian Princes whom he imployed
as instruments for the destruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3797:169"/>
               <hi>The ten hornes which thou sawest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the beast, are they that shall hate the
whore, and make her desolate, and naked,
and shall eate her flesh and burne her with
fire, for God hath put into their hearts to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
his will, Revel.</hi> 17. 16. 17. Wee are
then to follow peace with all men; but
none otherwise then as peace is joyned
with holiness: for what peace can there
bee as long as the whoredomes and
witchcrafts of that <hi>Iezabel</hi> remaine yet
in such abundance? War then is to be
preferred to such a Peace, where a
Land may justly complaine,
<q>
                  <l>—Longae pacis patimur mala: Saevior armis,</l>
                  <l>Luxuria incumbit—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The third sort of Lawfull destroying
is, by the sword of the publique Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
in the execution of justice upon
notorious malefactors; for he beareth it
not in vaine, but is the minister of God
to take vengeance upon him that doth
evill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. And of this it is that
our Prophet (being then by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
designed to be his Vice-gerent
on earth) chiefly speakes in this place,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3797:169"/>
               <hi>I will destroy, I will cut off.</hi> And with him
agrees the wise <hi>Salomon, Prov. 20. 26, A
wise King scattereth the wicked, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the wheele over them.</hi> It is not onely
justice but wisedome, sometime to cut
off and destroy: First, that others may
thereby bee admonished to walk more
warily. Thus the disobedient sonne
must bee brought foorth and ston'd to
death, <hi>That all Israel might heare and fear,
Deut.</hi> 21. As the thunderbolt falleth
with the danger of fewe, but with the
feare of all: So <hi>Poena ad paucos, metus
ad omnes:</hi> the terror of publique ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
reacheth farther than the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
for the feare extends to all,
but the punishment to few: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it be true, that the better sort be
directed by love, yet the greater sort
are corrected by feare. A man that
stands by, and sees one that is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
seared, or launced, is therby made
more carefull of his owne health: and
in like manner the beholding a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
to be brought to deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
makes men more wary how they
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3797:170"/>
runne into the like courses. It was a
true saying in the generall of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consull
to <hi>Cyprian</hi> at his martyrdome,
though ill applyed to him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<hi>In sanguine tuo caeteri discent discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam;</hi>
In thy blood the rest will learne
discipline.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the cutting off of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
causeth the good to leade a more
<hi>quiet and peaceable life in godliness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty:</hi>
who if they should be permitted
to live and enjoy their liberty, wee
should neither meet quietly in our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
nor dwell quietly in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
nor walke quietly in our streets, nor
travaile quietly in our wayes, nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
quietly in our fields. In better
tearmes stands that State where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
then where all things are lawful:
and it is no lesse cruelty to spare all,
than to spare none. For, he that spares
one bad, thereby injuries many good:
which gave occasion to the Proverbe,
Foolish pitie marres the Citie; and to
the saying of <hi>Domitius,</hi> that hee had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeme cruell in punishing, than
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3797:170"/>
dissolute in sparing.</p>
            <p>Many, saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> call
that cruelty, when for love of disciplin
the fault committed is revenged by
the punishment of the offender; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Sentence of him that punisheth
satisfieth the lawe, and redoundeth to
the good not onely of them that are
present, but even of them that are yet
unborne. So that severity used in this
case, <hi>Vtilitate publica rependitur,</hi> is payed
home and recompensed with publike
benefit. Yea, but though hee be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
say some, yet is hee a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
man, of an excellent wit, and
good parentage; and is it not pitie to
cast away such a man? To which may
justy be replyed, Is it not more pitie,
that a proper man should undoe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
man, that a witty man should
hurt an honest man, that hee who hath
good parentage should spoile him that
hath good vertues to serve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth?
To cut off such a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
person then by the stroake of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
is not to castaway a man; but to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3797:171"/>
preserve mankinde: and better it is,
<hi>Vt unus pereat quam ut unitas;</hi> that one
single person should suffer, than a whol
Society:
<q>
                  <l>—Truncatur &amp; artus,</l>
                  <l>Vt liceat reliquis securum viuere m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bris.</l>
               </q>

            <p>Thirdly, as by sparing wicked
and wilfull transgressors, the wrath
of God is provoked, and his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
pulled downe vpon a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
So by cutting them off, as by an
acceptable sacrifice his wrath is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and his favour procured. If blood
were shed in the Land, and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
not put to death, the whol Land
was thereby defiled, and made lyable
to Gods displeasure, <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 33. When
<hi>Achan</hi> had stoln the consecrated thing,
the wrath of the Lord was so kindled
against all the Hoast of Israel, that they
could not stand, but were discomfited
before their enemies: but as soone as
<hi>Achan</hi> with those that belonged unto
him were stoned to death, the Lord
turned from his fierce wrath against Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
so that wheras, before, their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3797:171"/>
chased and smote them, now they
atchieved many great and famous vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
<hi>Ios.</hi> 7. So long as the murther
committed by <hi>Saul</hi> upon the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
was unpunished, there was sent a
grievous famine upon the Land of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell
three yeares together: but as soon
as <hi>Sauls</hi> seaven sonnes were hanged at
the motion of the Gibeonites, God
was appeased with the Land.</p>
            <p>Two notable examples to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
we have recorded by <hi>Plutarch:</hi> the
one in the life of <hi>Romulus,</hi> the other of
<hi>Camillus.</hi> When <hi>Romulus</hi> K. of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Tatius</hi> K. of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> after cruell war
had made their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position to governe
the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; <hi>Sabines</hi> joyntly, there fell
a strange kinde of plague and famine in
the Cities of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Laurentum,</hi> for
two murthers committed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
and <hi>Laurentines:</hi> the one by the
kinsmen of <hi>Tatius</hi> upon certaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
of <hi>Laurentum;</hi> which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Tatius</hi> neglected to punish: and the
other by the friends of the saide Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
upon <hi>Tatius</hi> in revenge of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3797:172"/>
the injustice done by his kinsmen, and
suffered by him. Whereupon it being
noted that the plague and famine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
strongly in both Cities, and a
common opinion conceived that it
was a punishment of God upon them
for those murthers committed and
not punished, they resolved to doe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon the offenders: which being
once done, the plague ceased presently
in both places.</p>
            <p>The same Author likewise ascribeth
the Sack of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gaules,</hi> to the
just judgement of God upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
for two injustices done by them:
the first was the unjust banishment of
<hi>Camillus;</hi> the second, the refusall to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
certain Ambassadors of their own,
who beeing sent to treate peaceably
with the <hi>Gaules,</hi> on the behalfe of the
<hi>Clusians,</hi> committed acts of hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, contrary to the lawe of
armes: And when the <hi>Gaules</hi> sent to
<hi>Rome</hi> to demand reparation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
the <hi>Romans</hi> not onely refused to
give them satisfaction; but also made
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:3797:172"/>
made their Ambassadours, who had
done the injurie, Generals of an Army
to assist the <hi>Clusians</hi> against them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the <hi>Foeciales</hi> (officers
ordained by <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the lawfull causes of Peace
and Warre) made great instance to the
Senate, that the Ambassadours might
be punished, lest the penalty of their
fault might otherwise fall upon the
Common-wealth: as indeede it did.
For the <hi>Gaules,</hi> giving battel to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
overthrew them; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
their victory, spoyled and sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, under the conduct &amp;
command of <hi>Brennus,</hi> their chief Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and as some write a <hi>Brittain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein I wish to bee noted, how
grievous a sinne it is in the opinion of
the very <hi>Paynims</hi> themselves, and how
dangerous to the Common-wealth, to
neglect and omit the punishment of
notorious malefactors, whereby the
offences of particular men are made
the sinnes of the whole State, and draw
the wrath and punishment of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:3797:173"/>
the same: And as upon the whole
State, so chiefly upon his person and
posterity to whose place and office it
belongs to see justice done. It is a true
saying, <hi>Iudex damnatur, cum nocens abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Iudge is condemned when
the guilty is absolved; and <hi>Qui non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat
peccare cum potest, iubet:</hi> He that doth
not restrain a man (when it is his duty,
and it lies in his power) doth command
him to sinne. He that saith to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
thou art righteous, him shall the
people curse, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 24. And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, Hee that justifieth the
wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
17. 15. So that whereas they thinke by
this meanes to winne estimation with
men, they make themselves odious
both to God and men. <hi>Saul</hi> was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with the losse of his kingdome,
for not punishing <hi>Agag</hi> with death,
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. And <hi>Ahab,</hi> for sparing <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadab,</hi>
had a sharpe greeting sent him,
1. <hi>King. 20. Because thou hast let goe out of
thine hand a man whom I appointed to die,
thy life shall goe for his life, and thy people for
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3797:173"/>
his people.</hi> And many times wee see by
experience, that a desperate wicked
man, reserved from due punishment,
proves a continuall vexation vnto him
that hath spared him: As, the nations
that inhabited the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not cast out and destroyed by the
Israelites as God had commanded
them, became by his just judgement a

I will earely destroy all the wicked of the

from the Citie of the Lord.</head>
            <p>HItherto of the three kindes of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
destroying, by some phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
and Anabaptisticall spirits held
unlawfull. Now, it remaines, that I
speake of three other unlawfull kindes
of destroying, by some irreligious and
profane spirits held lawfull; whereof,
the first is <hi>selfe homicide,</hi> the destroying
of a mans selfe, the cutting off the
threed of his owne life with his owne
hands. The second is, destroying of
another by <hi>Duel,</hi> in single combate;
whether hee send or accept the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
it matters not. The third, is the
destroying of a subject by the sword,
and at the command of a civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
onely for <hi>reason of State,</hi> or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
respects, without due order of
law, or course of justice.</p>
            <p>First, then of the first; of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3797:174"/>
of a mans destroying himselfe,
whether it bee for the shunning of
shame, or griefe, or misery, or sinne.
Our Prophet himself was often broght
into great distress, marvailous streights
&amp; plunges, both bodily and ghostly, as
may appear by his dolefull complaints
through-out this booke of <hi>Psalmes:</hi>
Yet would hee not destroy himselfe
thereby to bee ridde of them. <hi>Saul,</hi>
who would not destroy <hi>Agag,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
himselfe: but <hi>David</hi> vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to destroy the wicked; himselfe
hee would not destroy. <hi>Paul,</hi> though
he had fightings without, and terrors
within, and desires to bee dissolved;
yet dissolve himselfe, or hasten his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
hee would not. <hi>Iob,</hi> though
scourged with unmatchable chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet he would not moove from
his station without his Generalls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he would not change himselfe,
but <hi>patiently wait all the dayes of his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time, untill his changing came,</hi> 14. 14.</p>
            <p>It was a worthy speech which <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>

in a cave, where they lay hid after

            <p>The second kinde of unlawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying,
by too many held lawfull, is
the killing of another in <hi>Duel:</hi> not such
as our Prophet himself undertook with
<hi>Goliah</hi> the Philistine, by publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from the State, and for the publike
good of the State; but when men for
private revenge, &amp; righting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
or pretended wrongs, either
send or accept a chalenge for single
combate, all the Sope and Niter in the
world cannot wash away the guilt of
blood from this practice: whatsoever
men pretend heerin, either for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of man-hood, or the putting-by the
imputation of cowardise, or for the
maintenance of reputation, it cannot
excuse in this case. And howsoever the
world applaud it many times with
tearms of worth, of gallantry, of brave
spiritednes, and the like; yet is it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
no better than murder in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
and disloyalty to the civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
by wresting the sword out of
his hand, and taking his office from
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3797:176"/>
him. Sin then against God is more to
bee feared, than shame amongst men;
and true Christianity to bee preferred
before the opinion of such fool-hardy
courage.</p>
            <p>Think not, I read a Lecture of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
since true valour consists not in
quarrelling &amp; brabbling for private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
or in stabbing for a word of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
but in maintenance of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in preserving thy alleageance to
thy Prince, in safe-garding thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Hee may well bee reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Martyrs, who upon conscience
and knowledge engageth himself upon
these occasions.</p>
            <p>Was <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> a coward in the
repute of the Heathen, when, receiving
a chalenge from <hi>Anthony,</hi> he returned
him this answer; that, if <hi>Anthony</hi> had a
disposition to dy, or were weary of his
life, there were waies enow else to
death besides that? The chalenge was
rejected, and yet his honour untainted.</p>
            <p>I will shut up this point with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
speech of <hi>Bernards</hi> concerning
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3797:176"/>
unjust fightings; and in that number I
esteem these: <hi>If in thy fighting thou hast a
minde to kill another man, and then art slain
fighting, thou diest a murtherer: if thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
and kill the other, thou livest a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
Whether then thou live or dy, beest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
or Conquerer, it is not good to bee a
murtherer.</hi> So that the conclusion is,
that, which way soever it fall out, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is before God. Miserable for a
man to bee slaine, and so to goe to his
reckoning while hee is malitiously la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to take away anothers life: as
miserable, if hee kill, to bee continually
haunted with the guilt of blood. All
the fame and commendation of doing
it upon fair tearms, cannot countervail
that vexation.</p>
            <p>I have the rather touched this point,
for that it is one of the evils of our
times; many scarce accounting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
men, till they have made a braul,
and (like the Youngsters of Helketh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazzurim)
sheathed their swords in
their fellowes bowels: whereby the
Land is becomne a very <hi>Acheldama,</hi> a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3797:177"/>
Field of blood. The more are wee to
blesse God, who hath put it in the mind
of our <hi>David,</hi> not any way to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
these Cutters, but to range them
among those <hi>wicked</hi> ones whom hee
hath vowed to destroy and cut off.</p>
            <p>The third kinde of unlawful destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by some held lawfull, is the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off of a Subject by the sword, or at
the command of the civill Magistrate,
for <hi>politick or private respects,</hi> without
just cause and due desert. Almightie
God, who out of the earth moulded
man, and breathed into him the spirit
of life, might (as an absolute Lord of
life and death) take that breath againe
from him, &amp; turn him into dust, or into
nothing, at his pleasure: but his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
on earth have no such transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
power; their commission beeing
confined to the rules of justice and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
the observation whereof is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the fairest and safest course
they can take. <hi>Vriah</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
yet when the King had cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caused him to bee placed by <hi>Ioab</hi> in
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3797:177"/>
the forefront of the battell, and upon a
sudden retreit to fall by the sword of
the Ammonite; in sense of this unjust
act hee afterwards cries out, <hi>Deliver me
from blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d-guiltiness, O God. Naboth</hi> was
<hi>Ahabs</hi> Subject: yet, because Letters
were written in the Kings Name, and
his Seal was set to them for the putting
of <hi>Naboth</hi> to death, the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> is
bid to charge him with the murther;
<hi>Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?</hi>
Neither doth <hi>Ahab</hi> plead his power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Naboth,</hi> or <hi>Naboths</hi> subjection unto
him; but, by humbling of himselfe,
seems to acknowledge his guiltiness.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that makes a man
to bee more accounted of amongst all
men, than, beeing accountable to no
man for his actions, so to carry himself
(specially in the destroying and cutting
off of men) as if he were ready to yeeld
account of his proceedings to all men.
There is nothing that wins more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affection, and inward both revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and obedience, than when a man may

in the 24. of the same booke. <hi>Manasses</hi>
was dead and rotten long before this
time, yet wee see God had not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that sinne; but the whole Land
smarted in the third generation after
him. So likewise <hi>Ioash</hi> most unkindly
caused <hi>Zachariah</hi> the sonne of good <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada</hi>
to be stoned to death, because he
reproved him for his Idolatry. But see
what followed. When the yeare was
out, the Hoast of <hi>Aram</hi> came uppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and they came against <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and destroyed all the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:3797:179"/>
Princes of the people, and sent all the
spoyle of them to the King of <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:</hi>
though the army of <hi>Aram</hi> came
with a small company of men, yet the
Lord delivered a very great army into
their hands. After this, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was smitten with great diseases,
and at last his owne servants conspired
against him, and slew him in his bed.
And the reason of all these fearefull
judgements is given there by the holy
Ghost, <hi>For the blood of the children of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada
the Priest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is memorable, that which <hi>Procopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
an Historian reports, touching <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorick</hi>

both noble and innocent persons, the
guilt of that horrible fact cleaving
close to him, hee had a strong imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the head of a certaine fish
which was set upon his table, was the
head of <hi>Symmachus,</hi> gaping and yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon him: The very conceite
whereof struck him into such a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fit, as was the beginning of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3797:180"/>
sickness, upon which he short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
died.</p>
            <p>Now, as hee vowes to destroy the
wicked, and none but them: so doth
he <hi>all</hi> them; my fourth generall part,
<hi>His indifferent and unpartiall proceeding,</hi> I
will destroy <hi>all,</hi> I will cut off <hi>all.</hi> Not
that he thought it possible to root out

            <p>The magistrate herein is to imitate

            <p>It is reported by a late Traveller,
that in <hi>Zant</hi> over the place of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where all causes both Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and Civill are decided, there are
these two Latine verses written on the
wall, in letters of gold:
<q>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:3797:181"/>

            <p>This place hateth wickedness, loveth
peace, punisheth offences, preserveth
the lawes, honoureth the good; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that there should be no partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
used, but every man should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
withall according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.</p>
            <p>To which purpose, was that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
speech of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth of that name; who when his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
son, the Prince, was by the L. chief
Iustice, for some great misdemeanors,
commanded and committed to prison,
hee thanked God that hee had both a
sonne of that obedience, and a judge of
such unpartiall and undanted courage.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was as much to blame,
who when hee commended a friend
of his to the Iudge, hee mooved him
that if his cause were good, hee would
absolve him for justice sake; if not, at
his motion: but howsoever the world
went, absolved hee must be bee; an ill

example of dangerous consequence, in
him who was to be a paterne of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

               </gap> and last point I proposed, is
the <hi>End</hi> our Prophet proposeth to him
selfe of this great work heer vowed, It
is the <hi>purging of the Citie of the Lord:</hi>
whereby is meant <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> First, for
example to the whole Realme, it being
the <hi>Metropolis</hi> and head Citie of the
Kingdome, as also and principally by
reason the service of God, and the
exercise of religion, was in a speciall
mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r by divine ordinance tied unto
it: in which regard he cals it the <hi>Citie of
the Lord,</hi> as the Evangelist doth the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Citie, Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>This Citie was so large, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ed
of foure quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one of
them by walles divided from another.
The first and highest was mount Sion:
in it was the <hi>Citie of David,</hi> called by
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osephus</hi> the superiour Citie, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
strong in regard of the naturall
situation thereof. The <hi>second</hi> was
called <hi>the Daughter of Sion,</hi> because it
seemed to come out as it were of the
bosome of the other; and in this was
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3797:182"/>
mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> whereupon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
stood: This Citie was compassed
with a stronge wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, wherein stood
threescore Towres. The <hi>third</hi> was
beautified with many ample streets, &amp;
faire buildings, compassed with a wall
wherein were fourteen Towers. The
<hi>fourth</hi> was inhabited by all sorts of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers,
compassed with the third wall
which was twenty five cubits high, and
had in it fourescore and tenne strong
Towers. So populous withall it was,
that during the siege of the <hi>Romans</hi> in
the space of five monthes there were
slaine and died, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> there present
reports it, to the number of eleven
hundred thousand. Now, albeit in our
Prophets dayes this Citie was not yet
brought to this perfection, yet was it
then very spacious and populous: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which greatness of the
place and disordred multitude of the
inhabitants, yet by Gods helpe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
the reformation.</p>
            <p>It is a thing which we ought to bear
away: for, it meeteth with the idle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ess
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3797:183"/>
and litherness of many, who imagine
that it is impossible to reforme a great
City: yea, if it bee but a little market-town,
it is impossible (say they) that all
should bee well there. Yea, this excuse
is pretended by such as have but small
families in comparison: and so, under
a colour of this impossibility to reform
all, they doo almost just nothing; no,
not so much as the lawes put into their
hands, and command them to do. Yet
these men have but as it were <hi>a posterne
gate</hi> in Ierusalem to keep: what thinke
you would they doo, if they had the
charge of so great and large a City?
True it is, let Officers doo their best,
there will be much disorder: what wil
it bee then when they doo little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
in respect of any care to weed
out sinne? but rather bolster it out, take
part with leud companions, give them
countenance, speak and write for them,
yea keep them company; men fitte ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee overseen and guided conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
by others, than to bee in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to see or guide any. But let such as
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3797:183"/>
bee in office doo their duty, executing
the good lawes put into their hands by
higher authority, and then not doubt
of the impossibility of reforming abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in their lesser charges; seeing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
trusting upon the help of God, is
so confident touching this great &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
City. Let them but put-to their
endeavours, and they shall finde such
success in the advancement of godlines
and suppressing of impiety, many times
even beyond hope and expectation, as
they wil see cause to rejoice in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of their dutie, and to praise
God for his blessing upon it.</p>
            <p>Again: <hi>David,</hi> vowing to reforme
this City, meaneth not to stay there,
but to proceed to the cleansing &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the whole Land. This no doubt
hee might think, that if Ierusalem were
reformed, it would be a great light and
direction to the whole Kingdome: as
wee see how it falleth out; lesser pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <l>Above maiori discit ar are minor.</l>
            <p>A great towne or a great house well
ordered may fitly bee compared to a

yeeldeth much good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the neighbours: if they bee ill
ordered, they bee like great dunghills,
noysome and contagious to such as
dwell about. A great towne or a great

much good to the Countrey: but, if
they bee naught and sinfull, the poison
of them is strong, and the infection da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
            <p>It is then a work worthy a King, to
beginne the reformation of his State,
with purging the head-city of his
Kingdome: where, by reason of the
confluence of forren nations &amp; all sorts
of people, vice must needs abound; but
specially, because head-cities (for the
most part) by Monopolies, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and Corporations, and I knowe

themselves the whole treasure of the
Land: and if the blood should all bee
drawn from the other members to the
head, it would both diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per the head,
and starve the members. The head-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then is so to bee respected, that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
cities and towns bee not neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but an indifferent hand to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to them al, lest one in time swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the other, as the greater fishes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the lesser.</p>
            <p>The last thing wee are to observe, is,
that hee would begin his reformation
in the City of the Lord. <hi>Of the Lord.</hi>
His meaning is, with matter of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it beeing therefore called the City
of the Lord, because, as hee had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
the Land of Canaan out of all the
world to bee the portion of his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so out of all Canaan hee chose Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
to place his Name and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
there (the Temple beeing not yet
built) and in the Tabernacle the Arke
of the Covenant; a speciall sacrament
of his presence. This, our Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
yet more cleerely in another

Psalm, 122. 9, <hi>Because of the house of the

                  </gap>o thee good.</hi>
Among other main and waighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
then pertaining to the Princes
charge, the care of GOD's truth and
Church must bee the chiefest. For,
should the bodies, goods and credits
of men bee preserved; and the honour
and glory of GOD bee neglected?
Should earthly ease bee so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
and heavenly bliss so little in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire?
Feare wee the ruine of all things,
where injuries and violences by men
are not repressed by the princes sword;
and doubt wee no danger where idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
heresie, ath e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sm and blasphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, goe unpunished? Is Gods
hand shortned, that hee cannot strike?
or his will altered, that hee will honour
those that dishonour him, and blesse
them that hate him?</p>
            <p>It is a Romish errour, repugnant to
the word of God, and to the examples
of the best Kings and Monarchs before
and since Christ, to restraine Princes
from protecting and promoting the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3797:185"/>
true worship of GOD within their
Realms. Neither hath the man of sin
more grosly betraid his pride and rage
in any thing, than in abasing the honor,
and abusing the power, and impugning
this right of Princes, by making them
his Bailiffs and Sergeants to attend and
accomplish his will, and not meddle
with supporting the truth, or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Church farther than hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth;
that, whiles they command their
subjects bodies, hee might command
their soules, the better half: which,
commanding the body, wil quickly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion draw that after it; as reason
shewes, and experience teacheth.</p>
            <p>It is rightly observed, that, after the
Bishop of Rome had once fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed
the Imperiall power, there was
never since Emperour of strength, or
Pope of vertue: so they lost both by it.
And indeed, as the blood, if it fall any
way out of the veins too much, there is
some danger; but, if it fall into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>extra vasa,</hi> there is more danger, for
it will corrupt and putresie: so was it
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3797:186"/>
with the supreme authority of Princes,
when they suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red it to fall into the
Clergy, as it were <hi>extra vasa:</hi> but their
Scepters and Thrones, allowed them
by God, are sufficient proofs that they
may and must make lawes and execute
judgement, as well for <hi>godliness</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi>
(which by the Apostles rule are
within the compass and charge of their
Commission) as for <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
God hath given them two hands,
to be <hi>Custodes utriusque tabulae;</hi> Vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of both the tables: from observing
this, no man may drawe them; since
for neglecting this, no man shall excuse
them.</p>
            <p>They must not be careful in humane
things, and carel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse in divine: God
ought to be served and honoured by
them, that is, by their Princely power
and care, as much afore men, as his
truth and glory excelleth the peace and
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lfare of men. It wanteth many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of a Christian government to
look to the keeping of things that must
perish, and to leave the soules of men
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3797:186"/>
as an open prey to impiety and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And if Princes provide not this
for their Subjects, peace, and traffique,
and such like makes no better provision
for them, then is made for Oxen in
good pasture; nay, not so good. For
an Oxe hath therein all hee needeth;
but a man without this left altogether
unprovided in his farre nobler and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part.</p>
            <p>And as Princes without this Care
provide not well for their people: so
they provide but ill for themselves, in
as much as they can have no certaine
assurance of the loyalty and allegeance
of their subjects without it; since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can cast a sure knot on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the firme binding of it, but the
true knowledge and feare of God. So
that where Princes advance the good
of Gods house, they establish the good
of their owne all in one.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is to be observed, that in all
the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
beginne with this observation, as
with a thing worthy to be chronicled

which was right in the sight of the

I spare to cite places: but it is the

made obeisance to the King, and the
King hearkened unto them, and they
left the house of the Lord God of their
