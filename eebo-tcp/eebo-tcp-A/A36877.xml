            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:100919:5"/>
likewiſe, and now Preſent them both to your view. You will not I ſuppoſe think this publication unſeaſonable, if you conſider the growth of Popery in <hi>England,</hi> which is ſo great, that it is now become the Mode to turn Papiſt. Of the dangerous cenſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereof, how ſenſible his Majeſty, and his two Houſes of Parliament are, we may gueſs, by the late addreſs for putting a ſtop to this growth, and his Majeſties Gracious Proclamation to that end. What the Principles of the Romaniſts are in reference to heretical (that is Proteſtant) Princes and Governours, and what their Practices have
<pb facs="tcp:100919:5"/>
been, I need not mention, they are ſufficiently known to the world. But becauſe they talk much of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to King <hi>Charls</hi> the Firſt, of ever Bleſſed Memory; during our unnatural inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine War (which I think is, the only inſtance they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) they muſt give me leave to ſay, that it was not their Principles that made them Loyal. I am ſure their Holy Father and their Church teach them otherwiſe, and <note n="a" place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> in his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt Papiſts and Quakers.</note> an eminent Peer of this Realm, thinks he hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the neceſſity, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt made them, choſe the Kings Party; and if ſo, they have great cauſe to boaſt of
<pb facs="tcp:100919:6"/>
their Loyalty. As for the Articles of their Faith made at <hi>Trent,</hi> if you will take the pains to examine them by the rule of God's Word, perhaps you will find that they have as much reaſon to brag of their Creed as of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. As for the Papal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though it be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eccleſiaſtical, yet (the Court having ſwallowed the Church) you will find it meerly, or chiefly Political. Laſtly, if you examine their worthy Diſcipline and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, compared with the Lives and Hereſies of their Popes and Clergy, you will, I ſuppoſe, without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty conclude, that they
<pb facs="tcp:100919:6"/>
have as little cauſe to be proud of their Popes Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline, Worſhip, Church and Churchmen, as of their Creed or Loyalty. As for their Monks, you will know what they are, when you have peruſed this little Book; So that <hi>I</hi> ſhall only adde, that if Piety conſiſts in wild, impertinent, abſurd, and ridiculous actions, they are the greateſt Saints that ever lived upon earth, and in the next rank Mountebanks, Morrice-Dancers, Jack-Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Bedlams, and ſuch like deſerve to be placed. In a word, whether the terms of Rebel, Traytor, Heretick and Phanatick, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
<pb facs="tcp:100919:7"/>
do ſo confidently and liberally beſtow on all ſorts of people that are not of their own gang; may not with as much juſtice be retorted on themſelves, even by the moſt extravagant Sectary; is left to the deciſion of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent impartial Reader.</p>

                  <p>SOme new Gueſts being come to this Town, who are rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of modeſty, and ſincerity, common civility requires that we ſhould preſent them with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which may prove uſeful and ſerviceable to them. Now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of a fitter Preſent, for perſons of a ſublime profeſſion, and extraordinary ſanctity, then to preſent them with a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Original, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, and progreſs of their vertues. For although Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> in his book againſt my Three Sermons, calls me Fool, Cheat, and an Impoſtor, yet the Rule of Charity requires us to render good for evil. Beſides, we muſt not judge of perſons by one ſingle action: neither muſt we under pretence, that this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father hath his fits of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conceal his vertues; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that <hi>Capucin-</hi>like goodneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:100919:8"/>
his, when in his Sermon at the Gallows, to comfort a Whore who was to be executed; he calls her ſiſter; and why might he not call whores his ſiſters, ſeeing venerable <hi>Francis,</hi> the Patron of the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins,</hi> called the Magpies, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppers, and Swallows his ſiſters? With the like Prudence he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts this poor condemned perſon, whoſe name was <hi>Margaret,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend her Soul to St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> which is a Saint that never was in the world, and is placed in Heaven without having ever been upon Earth. After which proofs of his rare wit, he condemns us all to Hell, to keep him company. Wherefore he will not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſuppoſe, if an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo charitable an office, I addreſs to him this ſmall Treatiſe, wherein he will ſee the Original of his Order, and the illuſtrious actions of the <hi>Capucins,</hi> whoſe perfections the Apoſtles could not attain unto. The Reader will
<pb facs="tcp:100919:8"/>
here find very pleaſant extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances and Follies more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a Saint of (the word <hi>Saint</hi> having changed its ſignification in this bleſſed age:) For now adays if a man would attain unto a Seraphique, and ſupereminent ſanctity, he muſt firſt be out of his wits.</p>
                  <p>The enſuing Narrative would afford ſufficient ſubject for laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did it not afford much more ſubject for ſorrow and compaſſion. For a man cannot ſee without great grief, the Chriſtian Religion quite disfigured, and poor people fed with empty ſhews in ſtead of true and holy doctrines.</p>
                  <p>The God of mercy take pity on ſo many poor people ſo groſly abuſed; and ſtir up his zeal, and wonted compaſſions to deliver ſo many Souls enſnared by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit holineſs: to whom the Holy Scriptures are a book alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown, and ſealed with more then ſeven ſeals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100919:9"/>
My deſign in this Treatiſe is not to offend theſe Fathers, but to inſtruct them, and to ſhew them how far diſtant they are from true holineſs, alſo to demonſtrate to them, that in aſpiring to a degree of glory above <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and other ſuch petty Saints, who never did works of ſupererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they take the courſe to come behind the meaneſt: and that ſome crimes are more tolerable then their ſanctity. The Lord open their eyes, that they may ſee it is a dangerous thing to mock him, and that they have to do with a terrible Judge, who cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who ſearcheth the heart, and from whom nothing is hid.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Monks</hi> do generally profeſs works of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation, that is, to do more good works, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than thoſe which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100919:10"/>
in his Law; that is, they profeſs to do works more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then to love, and ſerve God with all their heart, and with all their ſtrength; for it is that which God commands in his Law. Therefore they ſerve God with more than all their ſtrength; they are more vertuous than God would have them to be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that by their profeſſion of auſterity, and ſevere Diſcipline, they do more ſatisfactory works, and ſuffer more puniſhment than their ſins deſerve, and that the overplus ſerves for others. For the Pope gathers this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus into the Church-treaſury, and diſtributes it to people by his indulgencies.</p>
                        <p>By theſe works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Monks</hi> pretend to attain unto a ſupereminent degree of celeſtial glory, far above thoſe ſmall Saints who contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to fulfil the Law of God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100919:10"/>

                        <p>THere are four ſorts of Begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fryars, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Minors</hi> (called in <hi>France, Cordeliers)</hi> the Preachers (who are alſo called <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and <hi>Dominicans)</hi> the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and the <hi>Auguſtines.</hi> They bind themſelves by vow to three things. They vow poverty, ſo that they poſſeſs nothing in particular, although they abound in common. Alſo they vow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Marry. This they call the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100919:11"/>
vow of Chaſtity, as if there could be no chaſtity in a married eſtate. The third vow, is the vow of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, whereby they oblige themſelves (not to keep the Laws of God, but) moſt exactly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Rule of that Saint who is their Patron, and the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Order, and to obey the commands of the Guardian, or Superiour of their Convent, and to obey the General of their Order, and above all the Pope.</p>
                        <p>The Jeſuits beg not, and reject the auſterities of the <hi>Minors,</hi> and will not be called <hi>Monks.</hi> They are well ſhod, warmly clad, and <note place="margin">

And they that are called Fathers (who are the chief of their Colledg) have their Table furniſhed with the choiceſt meats. They labour with very great induſtry to gather wealth, although <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> their Founder, did beg. They vow never to marry. But their chief vow, and which they obſerve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100919:11"/>
moſt ſtrictly, is the vow of blind obedience, whereby they are obliged to obey their Superiour in all that is commanded, without enquiring whether the thing be good, or evil: for they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have it pre-ſuppoſed that the thing is good. This obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath coſt many Kings and Princes their lives, particularly, that excellent Prince, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to the Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> who was killed at <hi>Delft</hi> by <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar Gerard</hi> of the <hi>Franck</hi> County, excited thereunto by the Jeſuits of <hi>Treves.</hi> His proceſs and examination are to be ſeen at <hi>Delft</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They ſay indeed, that we muſt do nothing contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God; but they permit not thoſe who are commanded by the Superiour, to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his command be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the commands of God. For (as Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the third, in the

Bull which <hi>Ribadenera</hi> inſerts in the life of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſaith) <hi>Chriſtum in Praepoſito praeſentem, agnoſcant. They acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be preſent in the perſon of the Superior.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Capucins</hi> are more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for they oblige themſelves to obey their Superior in all things except ſin. For example; if the Superior ſhould commend a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucin</hi> to plant Cole-worts with the leaves downward, and the root upward, or to lick up the ſpittle of another <hi>Capucin,</hi> or to plant a ſtraw, and to water it until it grows, the <hi>Monk</hi> is bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey theſe commands, ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being moſt proper to try the obedience of the <hi>Minors.</hi>

                        <p>EAch Order of the begging <hi>Monks</hi> hath ſome Priviledges and Prerogatives to render it commendable. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> have this priviledge above the other Orders, that they remain in Purgatory but until the next <hi>Saturday</hi> after their death.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Antonin,</hi> who hath written the life of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Preaching Fryars, tells us, that St. <hi>Dominick</hi> being once in a trance, ſaw the Heavens open, and a multitude of <hi>Monks</hi> in celeſtial glory, but ſaw not one of his own Order amongſt them, whereupon this bleſſed Saint wept bitterly.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100919:13"/>
hid under the <hi>Virgin Maries</hi> Coats.</p>
                        <p>Not one of any other Order ever had this honour.

                        <p>But the moſt memorable Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, is that which (as the <hi>Roſary</hi> of <hi>Bernardin</hi> ſaith) St. <hi>Francis</hi> obtained for the Church of <hi>Sancta Maria Angelorum,</hi> called <hi>Portian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> in the City of <hi>Aſſiſe (viz.)</hi> that all they who ſhall go into

                        <p>It is obſervable, that in the Maſs of the ſaid St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula,</hi> which is celebrated on the ſecond of <hi>April;</hi> the Prieſts reads aloud this verſe of the Goſpel: <hi>Quod uni ex Minimis feciſtis, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi feciſtis.

                        <p>THE <hi>Capucins</hi> go bare-foot, and bare-legg'd, only they wear Sandals, or Apoſtolical ſhooes, which are nothing elſe but ſoles of ſhooes ſo tyed over the feet, that the feet appear. They wear only a Gown and a ſharp pointed hood: the other ſorts of Fryars <hi>Minors</hi> wear a round hood in form of a Child's Biggin.</p>
                        <p>They wear no ſhirts, only they have drawers, which they let down when they whip themſelves. To wear two garments, or to have ſtockings and ſhooes, or to be girt with a leather girdle, and not with a cord, is counted a mortal ſin. And yet the Legends of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> written by Saint

                           <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> St. <hi>Antonine,</hi> and <hi>Jacobus de Voraigne,</hi> ſay that St. <hi>Francis</hi> did ſometimes wear ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſhooes, and was girt with a leather girdle.</p>
                        <p>In this Cord the <hi>Capucins</hi> knit great knots for an Ornament. All this is done in Humility, and there is great merit in it.</p>
                        <p>They never put off their cloths, except it be to take the vermine out of them, or to patch them. Yea, they will in Humility put patches on a new garment. Their garments conſiſts of three pieces, in honour of the Trinity: To be clad in the habit does as much good as Baptiſm: I have ſeen in the Houſes of Princes, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of quality, little Children of ſix or ſeven years old clad in <hi>Capucins</hi> Habit. Mothers do this, to imprint on their Children hearts a love and reverence to the Order of St. <hi>Francis.</hi> If a <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin</hi> ſhould die without his Cord, he would be eſteemed to have

                        <p>It is alſo a mortal ſin for a <hi>Monk</hi> to have in particular, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Superior's knowledge, any thing worth above thirty pence: and if he ſhould die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revealing it to the Superiour,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100919:18"/>
he is deprived of Eccleſiaſtical burial. You may ſee this in the Declarations of the Rule.</p>
                        <p>They are not permitted to be God-fathers, nor to preſent a child to Baptiſm: this they account ſcandalous, and St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Rule forbids it.</p>
                        <p>It is an ordinary cuſtom among the <hi>Capucins,</hi> to ſend to women in travel, little pieces of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s wood, or to cauſe them to ſwallow the powder of it in ſome holy water, to facilitate their delivery. This St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s wood, is the wood of a great Oak, which was once the ſtaff which he uſed when he walked abroad. This ſtaff (out of reverence) he would not carry into the Church, but pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into the ground at the Church-door, it took root, and became a great tree.</p>
                        <p>In the Choire of the <hi>Capucins</hi> Churches, there ſtands a veſſel full of ſand, or lime, into which they ſpit. Divers <hi>Capucins</hi> who have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100919:19"/>
left the Order, and have been eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, do aſſure me that they have ſeen ſome <hi>Capucins</hi> lick up the ſpittle, which (through heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs) hath faln beſide the veſſel, and in mortification to ſwallow it. This is accounted a great vertue. They have alſo ſeen the Superior command ſome Monks to lick up the ſpittle of the reſt, in Humility and Mortification.</p>
                        <p>It is a frequent cuſtom among the <hi>Capucins,</hi> to prick themſelves; and with their blood to ſign vows to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and to carry the papers whereon theſe vows are written, about with them. This is taken for grand devotion.</p>
                        <p>They lie in their cloaths upon boards, and a little ſtraw, over which there is a linnen-cloth ſpread, and nailed to the boards.</p>
                        <p>They make three Lents: two by neceſſity of precept, and the third by voluntary devotion. This St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Rule teacheth them. Alſo they faſt twelve days

                        <p>They never go out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, without asking leave of the Superior on their knees.</p>
                        <p>The young <hi>Monks</hi> dare not ſpeak to the elder, but on their knees; and when they have ſpoken they make a very low bow.</p>

                        <p>Their Conſtitutions forbid them to ſhave themſelves; but they are permitted to trim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Sciſſars. And they dare not keep a Razor in their Convents, except it be to ſcarifie their ſhoulders after the uſe of Cupping-glaſſes.</p>
                        <p>By the ſame Conſtitutions they are forbidden the uſe of Spices; and to beg Eggs, and Cheeſe.</p>

In the Winter they whip themſelves, at half an hour paſt five in the evening, for fear of too great a cold in the night. They whip themſelves <note place="margin">

                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100919:22"/>
This diſcipline is very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for many times you ſhall ſee the place all bloody: and in great Convents where there are 60. or 80. <hi>Capucins;</hi> there is ſuch a noiſe of Monks ſinging with open mouth, and making their whips clack, that you would think the houſe were falling. This whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is a juſt action, for theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſerve it well.</p>
                        <p>In the holy week they uſe this diſcipline every day; but they redouble it on <hi>Good-Friday;</hi> for on that day, inſtead of one <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere,</hi> they ſing three; and the whipping continues all the while.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi>Vigiles</hi> of the feaſts of our Lady, and of the other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn feaſts; and on ever <hi>Friday</hi> of the month of <hi>March,</hi> they whip themſelves in the Dining-room before dinner. But this whipping laſts no longer, than while they are ſinging of one <hi>Miſerere;</hi> which is the 51 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which ends in <hi>vitulos:</hi> Hence comes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100919:22"/>
to be whipt from <hi>Miſerere</hi> unto <hi>vitulos.</hi> This whipping, which is milder, and ſhorter then at other times; is exerciſed on the ſhoulders only, and not on the buttocks.</p>
                        <p>This being ended, they eat bread and pottage upon their knees, in honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Their night whippings are exerciſed on their buttocks; but the day whippings on the ſhoulders only.</p>
                        <p>In the morning theſe poor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins</hi> go abroad to beg, with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved buttocks, and embroidered backs, carrying a Wallet on the ſhoulder.

                        <p>THE Penances of the <hi>Capucins</hi> for puniſhing a fault, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Dining-room; which place ſerves alſo for a Chapter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
                        <p>In this place, before dinner, the <hi>Monks,</hi> on their knees, wait for the Superior, or Guardian; who being come, the moſt ancient of thoſe who are to receive Penance, puts off his Garment from his ſhoulders, claſps his hands, and holds down his head, as low as his knees; accuſing himſelf of ſins committed againſt the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They do not accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for want of a firm affiance in the promiſes of the Goſpel: but ordinarily thoſe things which the penitent confeſſeth, are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; for, he confeſſeth either that he hath talked too loud, or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100919:23"/>
walked too faſt, or gaz'd about too much; or hath ſcratcht him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf while he was at prayers, or hath broken an earthen pot, or the like. This confeſſion they call <hi>the fault.</hi> Then come the reſt, and make ſuch another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                        <p>As theſe confeſſions are abſurd, ſo are the Penances impoſed by the Superior on the penitent as ridiculous. He that is accuſed in the Chapter-houſe, to have broken ſilence, is condemned to take a ſhort ſtaff in his mouth, and to hold it betwixt his teeth until the Superior ſay to him, <hi>It is enough.</hi> In <hi>Italian,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Baſta.</hi> Sometimes they have a long pole, which five or ſix of them hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their teeth, and ſo walk up and down with it while the others are at dinner, who muſt take heed that they do not laugh.</p>
                        <p>If any one hath whipt himſelf too gently, he is condemned to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100919:24"/>
whip himſelf publickly upon the ſhoulders with a Fox-tail in the preſence of thoſe that are at dinner.</p>
                        <p>If any one hath talked too much, he is condemned to draw a Croſs on the ground with his tongue.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes for a Penance, they make a Monk eat with a Cat in the ſame diſh. And others are made to ſuck a flint dipt in vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                        <p>Others riſe from their knees to drink, and as often as they drink, they ſay to their brethren who are at dinner, before they drink; <hi>Brother, pray to God for poor brother</hi> Linotte, <hi>or for brother</hi> Tribouleus, <hi>or for poor brother</hi> Griboville, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take ridiculous names in humility, to render themſelves contemptible. After this, they drink by permiſſion, with very great modeſty.</p>
                        <p>If any one be accuſed of being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100919:24"/>
too ſpruce and finical, a bucket of water is brought him to view himſelf in, or they preſent him with the backſide of a kettle for a looking-glaſs.</p>
                        <p>They who have ſlept at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are made to lie down in the preſence of thoſe that are at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to ſnore, as if they were aſleep.</p>
                        <p>If any one breaks a cup, or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or a frying-pan, he is made to carry it about hanging on his neck for a Penance.</p>

                        <p>DIvers <hi>Capucins</hi> who have left the Convent, have confeſſed to me, that although they were accounted the moſt zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, yet they had much ado to forbear laughing at ſome extravagant actions, in which the <hi>Capucins</hi> place holineſs.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things following are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To view themſelves in a Fryingpan. To make a croſs with the tongue in the aſhes. To comb the beard with a rake. To chop off the beard on a block with a hatchet. To ſtand upon one leg in the midſt of the Dining-room. To kiſs the feet of all thoſe who are at dinner. To make a Monk dance before them all. To make him fence. To blind-fold him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100919:25"/>
with a dirty clout. To go about up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all four like a beaſt. To carry about on the head a basket like a head-piece. To put upon the noſe a pair of ſpectacles made of felt. To ride about upon a ſtick like a child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdeſt Penance of all is; when the Superior commands a Monk, who having filled his belly, leaves ſome part of his dinner behind him, to eat it up all; ſo that he muſt break his belly in humility and mortification.</p>
                        <p>In the life of St. <hi>Felix de Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> (an Alms-begger at <hi>Rome,</hi> Canonized by the Pope, about 16 or 17 years ago) this is put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his vertuous actions, that being at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the ſtreet, he met <hi>Philip de Neri;</hi> Founder of the Prieſts of the Oratory, and made him drink off his bottle; and that <hi>Philip,</hi> in requital, put his hat on <hi>Felix</hi> his head: Whereupon the Children in the ſtreet cryed out, <hi>Fra Felice a un capello.</hi> Thus
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100919:26"/>
did theſe Saints by a great ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, mutually communicate their holineſs to each other.</p>
                        <p>In the Chronicles of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Order, it is recorded, that Fryar <hi>Juniperus,</hi> (who is Canonized for a Saint) boiled a Hen with her guts, feathers and all. And that being in a certain Caſtle, he left his dung in the bed where he lay. Another Fryar <hi>Minor,</hi> named <hi>Jacobo,</hi> in humility, leapt into a houſe of office.</p>

                           <hi>Francis</hi>'s habit is accounted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptiſm.

To be a Fryar <hi>Minor,</hi> that is, to be <hi>the least,</hi> and yet to be an Archangel, are things alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inconſiſtent. Beſides the nature of their vow is to do works of Supererogation: but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do no ſuch works, for they content themſelves with obeying the commands of God.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who ſay the <hi>Capucins</hi> are called Angels, becauſe they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Angels, in that they marry not, nor receive money, do great wrong to the Order of theſe Monks; for by the ſame reaſon they may be ſaid to imitate the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100919:27"/>
Devils, becauſe they neither mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor poſſeſs wealth any more than the Angels.</p>
                        <p>It is a mockery to ſay, that they are called Angels and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, becauſe they take the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Seraphins for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and Protectors: For by the ſame reaſon a married woman, who hath taken the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for her Patroneſs, may be called the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> And he who takes God for his Protector, may be called God. But ſith the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins</hi> have St. <hi>Francis</hi> for their Protector, who is (as they ſay) of the Order of the <hi>Seraphins,</hi> and exalted above the eight Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Angels; what need have they to take the Angels for their Patrons? Beſides, they who chuſe Angels, or Saints for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, chuſe one certain Angel, or Saint for their Patron; and not the Angels and Saints in general.</p>

                        <p>WHen a <hi>Capucin</hi> will enter into Order, after the year of probation, he is admitted to make the vow, which is done in the preſence of the Superior, and his brethren, in theſe terms:

                        </head>
                        <p>DIvers things are remarkable in this vow, which being rightly underſtood, we ſhall find, that many abuſes yea, impieties, are therein covered with the cloak of Religion.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, this vow is made to God the Father, to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Saints, and to the Superior of the Convent, without making any mention at all of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, he who makes this vow to Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pre-ſuppoſeth that thoſe Saints do ſee him; and that they know the intention of his heart. This is contrary to the Holy Scripture, <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>This vow is repugnant to all the examples contained in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, wherein there is no vow made to creatures, but to God only; as God himſelf commands, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 14. <hi>Offer unto God thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and pay thy vows unto the moſt High.</hi> Here Sacrifices and vows are linked together, as things equally due unto God. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds, that we muſt offer Sacrifices to God only. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But that in the holy Scripture not one example is to be found of vows made to Saints. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> freely confeſſeth in his Book, <hi>De cultu Sanctorum,</hi> Chapter 9. in theſe words; <hi>When the Holy Scriptures were written, the cuſtom of making vows to Saints was not begun.</hi> The ſame Jeſuit, in the ſame Chapter ſaith, that <hi>a vow is an action of Religion due to God only; even as ſwearing, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing are; as appears by the Holy</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100919:29"/>
                           <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Theſe are his own words. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> the <note place="margin">

The ſame ſaith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> in the afore-mentioned Chapter. <hi>A vow belongs not to the Saints, but only as they are Gods by participation. But we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Saints who raign with Chriſt are ſuch,</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 2. ſaith, in his Epiſtle to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Leo, viz.)</hi> that <hi>all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Weſt, own</hi> St, Peter <hi>for a God upon Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100919:29"/>
But theſe Doctors conſider not, that if a vow be a worſhip of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> and due to God only; and that if we make vows to Saints, becauſe they are Gods by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; it follows that we give to Saints the worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> by participation.</p>
                        <p>Alſo they conſider not, that by the ſame reaſon it may be ſaid, that the Superiour, or Guardian, who receives this vow, is God too by participation. For when the Fryar <hi>Minor</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>I vow unto God, and to the Virgin, and to the Saints;</hi> he adds, <hi>and to you my Father;</hi> vowing to the Guardian in the ſame terms in which he vows to the Saints, and to God. This needs not ſeem ſtrange; for in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Prieſts are called Gods and Creators of their Creator, having a Divine power, yea, a power over Jeſus Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Beſte,</hi> a famous Preacher, in his book of the Prieſtly-Office, Chap. 3. ſaith,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100919:30"/>
                           <hi>The Prieſt-hood and the Deity have I know not what of common, and are almoſt of an equal Grandeur, for they have the ſame power.</hi> Item. <hi>Seeing that the Prieſt-hood is equal to the Deity, and that all Prieſts are are Gods, therefore it far exceeds the Kingly Office; and Prieſts are much more than Kings.</hi> And a little after he ſaith, that <hi>God obeys the Prieſts as often as they pronounce the words of conſecration.</hi> A Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boniſt named <hi>Petrus Aurelius,</hi> hath lately written a book with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and by the authority of the Colledge of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> which refutes a Treatiſe of the Jeſuits, entituled, <hi>Spongia;</hi> and in the 75 page this <hi>Aurelius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Data eſt Sacerdotibus poteſtas Chriſtum, hoc eſt Deum ipſum producendi,</hi> that is, <hi>A power is given to Prieſts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Chriſt, that is to ſay God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> He adds, that <hi>the power of the Prieſts hath in it a certain emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the eternal operations, whereby the Divine perſons are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</hi>

                           <hi>and day are defiled with filthy and diſhoneſt touches.</hi> Wherefore you muſt not wonder, if a Monk that is admitted into the Order, make a vow to the Superiour, who is a Prieſt; and gives him that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which belongs to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Latria,</hi> ſeeing the Prieſts are called Gods, and Creators of their Creator, and that they have a power over Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>To theſe teſtimonies of the Doctors of the Romiſh Church who ſay, that a vow belongs to the worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> and ought to be made to God only; we muſt add the teſtimony of that Jeſuit, <hi>Cardinal Tolet.</hi> in Book 4. Of the inſtitution of Prieſts, Chapter 17. <hi>A vow is a promiſe made to God by a deliberate purpoſe and will.</hi> By theſe things it appears, that a vow made to Saints, or to a Superiour of a Convent, is pure Idolatry; for thereby that honour which is due to God only, is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the creature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100919:31"/>
Our adverſaries cannot eſcape by ſaying, that in vowing to Saints they vow mediatley to God; for the worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> ought not to be given to the creature either mediately, or immediately. In all worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves to God directly. The Monk that makes this vow, addreſſeth himſelf to God direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſaying, <hi>I vow to Almighty God,</hi> &amp;c. Having thus addreſſed himſelf to God directly; what need is there that he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards addreſs himſelf to him me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and by oblique ways? It is certain, that he who ſays to his Superior, or Guardian, <hi>I vow to you my Father,</hi> ſpeaks not to God, and by theſe words vows not to God. Conſider the words of this vow, and you ſhall find, that a Monk who is admitted into the order, ſpeaks to God, to the Saints, and to his Superior in the ſame terms, and vows no two different manners.</p>

                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100919:32"/>
But when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth that the cuſtom of making Vows to Saints, was not begun when the holy Scriptures were written, he ſhould have mentioned the time when it began, and not have cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reader with falſe allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as his uſual manner is. For he alledgeth theſe words of <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> in his 13. book of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal preparation, Chap. 7. <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſouldiers of true Piety as the friends of God; we come to their Monuments, and make Vows to them;</hi> Which paſſage is falſe, and altogether forged.</p>
                        <p>He alſo alledgeth <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his 8. Book againſt the Greeks, which book is falſly attributed to <hi>Theodoret.</hi> In one point <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> beſides his error, diſcovers his ignorance in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, in not knowing that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have no proper word to expreſs the Word <hi>Vow:</hi> And the Latine Interpreter, to whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> truſts, hath falſly tranſlated <hi>Voto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

                           <hi>rei dona perſolvunt;</hi> Which words are not in the Greek Text of the book attributed to <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is in honour of the Pope, that the Monks vow to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not to St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>James:</hi> for they make the two former the Founders of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The things to which this Monk obligeth himſelf, are poverty, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and obedience. Of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. As for chaſtity, the Jeſuit <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> in his Aphoriſms upon the word <hi>votum,</hi> ſaith, tha <hi>the vow of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is not a vow of chaſtity, and that the Biſhop can diſpence with it:</hi> Whereupon we demand, whether a Monk or a Prieſt that commits fornication, doth not violate the vow of Chaſtity, and whether by this Vow he doth not oblige him-himſelf not to commit fornication. If he doth not oblige himſelf to it, he ſhews that he will not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100919:33"/>
by vow to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Aclultery:</hi> But by this vow he only obligeth himſelf to abſtain from a thing which God permits, and not from that which he forbids. But if this Monk by vowing chaſtity, doth vow not to commit fornication, it is evident that by committing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, he violates his vow, and and beſides he tranſgreſſeth the command of God, which obligeth us much more than any voluntary vow. So that he commits two evils, <hi>(viz.)</hi> He breaks his vow, and violates the Law of God. Why then, when a Monk or Prieſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for fear of violating the Law of God, by committing fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is he accounted to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a greater ſin, than when he commits fornication? Why then is not a Prieſt that commits forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, made irregular, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Prieſt-hood; but if he marries, is preſently degraded,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100919:33"/>
yea, and declared puniſhable with death? To this they anſwer, that it is becauſe he hath broken his vow, and yet he remains unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ceaſeth not to ſing Maſs for all that. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God do not bind ſo ſtrongly, as voluntary vows do, which are made without; yea, contrary to the word of God, which ſaith, <hi>If they cannot contain, let them Marry.</hi> And <hi>to avoid Fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.</p>
                        <p>But that a Prieſt who commits Fornication, yea hath divers Concubines, is not thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred irregular, and incapable of the Prieſthood; not only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews (examples of this being numberleſs) but we have alſo the determination of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. Thereupon in the firſt Book of the <hi>Decretals,</hi> in the twelfth Title, in the Chapter <hi>Quia circa,</hi> His words are theſe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100919:34"/>
                           <hi>Thou deſireſt to be inſtructed by the Apoſtolick See, Whether Prieſts that have divers Concubines, ought to be counted bigamous. To which we think fit to anſwer, that ſeeing they have not incurr'd the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of bigamy; thou mayeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with their exceeding of the Prieſtly Office, they being ſtained only with ſimple fornication.</hi> But for marrying of one wife, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtles Rule, a Prieſt is degraded, yea puniſhed with <note place="margin">Navarr. <hi>in caput ad inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> 23. <hi>queſt.</hi> 2. <hi>De defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one proximi</hi>
                           </note> death.</p>
                        <p>But, which is much more, one that is a notorious <hi>Sodomite,</hi> is not made irregular, but may ſing Maſs for all that: as <hi>Navarre,</hi> the moſt knowing of all the Canoniſts, and the Popes Penitentiary teacheth: <hi>A man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth not incur ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, but for the caſes ſpecified in the Law, of which number</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy <hi>is none.</hi> And this he proves by the Authority of Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> And he adds, that in <hi>Italy, (which is more troubled with this.</hi>
                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100919:34"/>
                           <hi>evil, than it ſhould be) they demand no diſpenſation for it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In fine, how binding ſoever the vow of not marrying may be, yet the Pope can diſpence with it, and may permit a man to marry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his vow. <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> in the ſame place ſaith, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops may alſo diſpence with this vow, and permit a man to marry.</p>
                        <p>Methinks alſo to vow to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> never to marry, is to preten'd to be wiſer than he; for he was a married man. It is juſt as if one ſhould ſay to him, <hi>I do vow to thee not to follow thy example. I do promiſe to be wiſer and holier then thou.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is evident, that he who burns with filthy luſts, and yet vows never to marry, does like a ſick perſon that ſays to God, <hi>Lord, I am ſick, but I promiſe thee that I will not make uſe of the remedies which thou offereſt me, and haſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in thy word, for I will be wiſer than thou.</hi>

                        <p>IF there be Superſtition and impiety in this Vow, whereby a Monk vows to the Creature, and obligeth himſelf to things which God commands not; yea, to things which he forbids: there is no leſs in the Anſwer, which the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or Guardian makes him, ſaying;
<q>And I, if thou keep this vow, do promiſe thee, in Gods name, life Eternal.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words duely conſidered, will make a man tremble; For one that is neither ſent, nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the King, comes to a man, and ſays, <hi>I have order from the King to promiſe you ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, if you do ſuch a thing;</hi> is a Cheat, and a perfidious perſon, and deſerves to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100919:35"/>
becauſe he ſpeaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order, and without being ſent by the King. But the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, who makes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the new Monk in God's name; cannot ſhew his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Warrant from God for the making of this promiſe. He abuſeth the poor Monk, by making him believe that he is ſent by God to make him this promiſe in Gods name, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That if he lives in beggery, if he never marries, and if he be obedient to the Guardian of his Convent, he ſhall have Eternal life. For, theſe three things, are things which God commands not in his Word, and to which he hath made no Promiſe; yea, theſe are obſervations whereby God is more often offended then ſerved: Theſe are things which a Heathen, or Hypocrite may do. But to ſerve God according to his Word, and to believe in Jeſus Chriſt as he is propoſed to

us in the Goſpel; are things to which God hath promiſed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and cannot be done by any, but by thoſe that are the true Children of God: Theſe are things, for which the Superiour ſhould ſay, (not I promiſe thee, but) God promiſeth thee Eternal life. For a man ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that which he cannot give.</p>

There are <hi>Mahometan</hi> Monks called <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> who live very auſterely, and do even roaſt their bodies
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100919:37"/>
upon the hot ſcalding ſands; and with buckles and rings of Iron, make themſelves incapable for generation.

adds, That when theſe Prieſts had done whipping themſelves, they went about a begging, and one gave them a piece of Money, another Wine, another Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Alms they put into Wallets.

The Apoſtles, and their Diſciples, did not live ſo: In a ſimple and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary habit, and manner of life, they lived ſoberly, and laboured in the work which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them.

                        </head>
                        <p>WE may eaſily know what to think of the Abſtinences Whippings, and Humilities of the <hi>Capucins, (viz.)</hi> that in the midſt of their Auſterities they diſcover their pride. And of this I'le give you ſome examples.</p>
                        <p>Before the <hi>Capucins</hi> begin their Lents (for they have three Lents) they feaſt and make merry for a whole week; during which time, there is no frolick or jovial act, which they omit. Some of them ſing Songs of good fellowſhip, others ſing Amorous, or Love-Songs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100919:38"/>
others ſhew <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> tricks: others ſtand upon their heads, or act the Tumbler or Juggler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In fine, every one doth ſuch things as he had learned before he was a Monk.</p>
                        <p>In great Towns there be few <hi>Capucins</hi> but have their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly devout women who furniſh them with all ſorts of dainties, as Sweet-meats, Comfits, Gellies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that ſome <hi>Capucins</hi> have more choice of dainties in their Cells, then Ladies have in their Cloſets.</p>
                        <p>When a <hi>Capucin</hi> comes from abroad, warm linnen clothes are put on his body, his feet are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſweet herbs; and when they are wiped with warm Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, every one comes and kiſſeth them.</p>
                        <p>Many of the old Monks, who are called <hi>Fathers of Importance,</hi> are ſo careful of their health, that they have a cook for themſelves in particular (who is always a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100919:39"/>
Monk) a Grom of the Chamber, and an Apothecary, who follow them from Convent to Convent. You ſhall ſee very few of theſe Fathers of importance ſick, but they are very impatient if they want but the leaſt trifle, and then all the Town is ranſackt from one end to the other, to find what they would have. The Nuns furniſh them with Sweet-meats, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with rare broths and gellies, the Gentlemen of the Country with wild-fowl, the Merchants and other Townſmen with Shambles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat; and the wine which they ordinarily drink, is the beſt that is to be had. Thoſe <hi>Capucins,</hi> who to ſave their Souls, have left the Order; do proteſt they have learned of us how to faſt; and that when they were <hi>Capucins,</hi> they fed more highly, and lived more pleaſantly, and plentifully.</p>
                        <p>In great Convents of <hi>Capucins,</hi> ſuch as are at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Roven,</hi> a moſt furious ambition and envy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100919:39"/>
diſcovers it ſelf: For, to obtain the leaſt preferment in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and to ſupplant their compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors, they have their creatures, who cry them up every where, and rail on thoſe that aſpire to the ſame Office; whence great diſorders do oftentimes ariſe; for Princes do more patienly bear contempts and injuries then the <hi>Capucins.</hi> And at the Tables of Dukes, Marqueſſes, and Earls, the <hi>Capucins</hi> ſuffer themſelves to be placed at the upper end.</p>
                        <p>Their pride appears in this, that they profeſs works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is to ſay, better works then God commands; ſo that God may ſay to a <hi>Capucin, I would not have thee ſo holy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame ſpirit of pride appears in their calling themſelves <hi>Angels, Arch-Angels, Spirits, Seraphins,</hi> and <hi>Cherubins.</hi> It appears alſo by the unworthy ſubmiſſions which the principal <hi>Capucins</hi> require of the inferiour, who never ſpeak to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100919:40"/>
the Superiors, but on their knees; which Superiors command them very baſe things, as to lick up the others ſpittle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It cannot be ſaid, that they wear a barbarous and extravagant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in humility and mortification; For, he that will ſubdue his Fleſh, may do it as well under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon habit; he may under a uſual habit wear a hair-ſhirt, and may whip himſelf ſecretly as often as he pleaſeth, and without any ones knowledge: But this wild habit, differing from that of other men, ſerves only to be look'd upon, and admired; for people gaze upon and admire nothing but what is extraordinary.</p>
                        <p>To this we may add, that he who makes profeſſion of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and humility in his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould not be vain in his diſcourſes, nor too wantonly nice and delicate in his words, for fear of his belying his Profeſſion by his Language.</p>

I ſpeak this becauſe of Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a <hi>Capucin;</hi> who in his new Book ſhews, that he hath made a great proviſion of Elegancies. As when he calls St. <hi>John, The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of Love to the Son of God.</hi> And of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that it is Love's Maſter-piece.</hi> And ſpeaking to us, he ſaith, That <hi>when God ſhall have brought us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Wine-cellar, there to taſte the exceſs of his love, we ſhall not find it ſo difficult to believe; That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did eat himſelf, and that together with Chriſt's body the Devil entred into Judas.</hi> With the like grace, ſuppoſing the words of St. <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, too weak and impertinent, as they are ſet down in the eighth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he introduceth him ſpeaking thus: Sir, <hi>will it pleaſe you that I preſume to ask you a queſtion, with all due reſpect?</hi> To which he makes the Eunuch anſwer with the like civility, <hi>I pray oblige me ſo much as to come into this Coach.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Recollects,</hi> on the other ſide, maintained, and do ſo ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they are not inferiour to the <hi>Capucins</hi> in holineſs, and perfection; and that it is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the <hi>Capucins,</hi> if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Recollect</hi> be taken for a

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100919:44"/>
relinquiſh all, then acquieſce in this ſentence. Wherefore yet to this day, in deſpight of the Pope, they wear their hood of the ſame length as before. Of this hood, as of the reſt of the habit of the Regular Monks, it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that it is not lawful for a Monk to make the leaſt change, no more then in the colours of the Maſs; For it is not lawful to ſing Maſs in a red habit, on thoſe days on which it is appointed to be ſung in a green habit; nor to be ſung in a black habit, on thoſe days on which it is appointed to to be ſung in a violet habit: The rules in this caſe are very ſtrict, and are placed at the beginning of <note place="margin">Pag. 328.</note> the Maſs-book.</p>
                        <p>But Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> wrongs us in his new book, by endeavouring to prove that the like things are done amongſt us, objecting againſt me, that I wear a Ruff, and that as there are Maſſes in Green, Violet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo it may be ſaid,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100919:44"/>
amongſt us there are Sermons in a Ruff, and Sermons in a Band, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in a Gown, and Sermons in a Cloak: for this <hi>Minor</hi> Fryar knows well enough, that we have no rules to oblige us to wear a Ruff or a Band, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath inviolable laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Maſſes in green, red, and violet.

and an admirer of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. ſaith, that the ſaid Saint <hi>Francis</hi> preſented himſelf to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. ſitting in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, <note place="margin">Pag. 237.</note> and gave him his Rule in writing, intreating him to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize it by his approbation: but Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> taking notice of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s bad cloaths, his dirty and contemptible countenance, his long beard, and the black hair of his eye-brows hanging down over his eyes, deſpiſed him, and ſaid to him, <hi>Go brother, and wallow in the dirt with the Swine, for thou art more like them, than like a man.</hi> Which words, as ſoon as <hi>Francis</hi> heard, he bowed himſelf very low, and in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Holineſs, went and wallowed with Swine in a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; wherein he tumbled ſo long, that he was covered with dirt, from head to foot; and in this pickle he came again, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to the Pope, ſaying,

This <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> placeth amongſt

This is that Saint <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> to whom the <hi>Capucin Joſeph</hi> would have us give credit, and would have us believe that deſcription of Saint <hi>Francis</hi>'s life, which he gives us.

                        <p>Saint <hi>Francis</hi> his Father was named <hi>Peter Bernardo,</hi> A Citizen of <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Spolete</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        </p>

Saint <hi>Francis</hi>'s name, when he was young, was <hi>John Bernardo,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">This Life, written by St. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure,</hi> you may find in <hi>Surius,</hi> in the month of <hi>October,</hi> p. 30.</note> but he changed his name, and would be called <hi>Francis,</hi> becauſe he ſpake <hi>French</hi> when he was moved by the Holy Ghoſt to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the praiſes of God; as <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi> tells us, in the life of St. <hi>Francis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When he was but young, and a Lay-perſon, he demonſtrated a grand Humility, even to the kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Lepers: and one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting from his horſe to kiſs a Leper, it was revealed unto him, that this Leper was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His fellow-Citizens ſeeing him a greaſie and dirty fellow, and that he did wild and extravagant actions, judged him to be out of his wits; and running after him, threw ſtones at him, and covered him all over with dirt. Which when his Father ſaw, he fetcht him home, and kept him ſhut up a long time, whipping him cruelly, as mad folk are whipt for their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100919:48"/>
cure. But his Mother taking pity on him, did, in the abſence of her Husband, ſet him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                        <p>When his Father returned home, he brought him before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and made him diſclaim his right of Inheritance: To which <hi>Francis</hi> very willingly conſented; yea, pulling off his Breeches, and the reſt of his cloaths, he made himſelf ſtark naked, being (as St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith) drunk with the Holy Ghoſt. Then he ſaid to his Father, <hi>Hitherto I have called thee my Father; but henceforward I will ſay, Our Father which art in Heaven. Antonine</hi> reports the ſame in the Life of St. <hi>Francis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Being thus naked, he went into a Spittle where Lepers were kept, and tended them, kiſſing their feet, and wiping and kiſſing their ſores with an admirable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as Saint <hi>Bonaventure</hi> tells us.</p>
                        <p>In thoſe days St <hi>Francis</hi> wore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100919:49"/>
ſhooes, and walked with a ſtaff, and girded himſelf with a leather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girdle: But afterwards, judging this equipage exceſſive, and too delicate, he left his ſhooes and his ſtaff, and in humility girded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Cord.</p>
                        <p>Being tempted with unchaſte deſires, he plunged himſelf over head and ears in a ditch full of ice. And one day, the Devil having breathed on him, he felt the fire of carnal luſt kindled within him: Whereupon this bleſſed Saint ſtript himſelf ſtark naked, and whipt himſelf terribly with his Cord, ſaying, <hi>Eja ſrater aſine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet te manere, &amp; ſic ſubire flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum;</hi> that is, <hi>Go to, Brother Aſs, thou muſt ſtay and be whipt thus. Antonine</hi> and <hi>Jacobus de Voragine</hi> report the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The hard ground was his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bed, and a ſtone his pillow. But one day, by reaſon of a pain in his head, taking a feather-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and repoſing himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100919:49"/>
the Devil got into it, and extremely troubled his brain, and diſturbed his devotion: At which St. <hi>Francis</hi> being incenſed, took hold of the pillow, and threw away both it and the Devil.</p>
                        <p>Finding that his carnal concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence continued, he ran to his garden, and gathering a great heap of ſnow, he plunged himſelf in it over head and ears, ſtark naked, as Saint <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith. But Saint <hi>Antonine</hi> ſaith, that he plunged himſelf in it only ſo high as his privities. Then he made ſeven ſnow-balls, ſaying of one, <hi>This is my Mother;</hi> and of another, <hi>This is my Daughter,</hi> &amp;c. whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Devil went away very much aſhamed.</p>
                        <p>He preſented his Rule to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third; who for a while rejected it, and ſome of the Cardinals oppoſed it, ſaying, That it propoſed novelties, and things impoſſible to be done: But at laſt, St. <hi>Francis</hi> wallowing in the mire
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100919:50"/>
with Swine, as aforeſaid, obtained his requeſt.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes he had a mind to hear himſelf reviled; and to this purpoſe he once ſaid to a Monk, <note place="margin">

St. <hi>Antonine</hi> ſaith, that a Monk went before
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100919:50"/>
him, crying aloud, <hi>Friends behold this Glutton, this eater of Pullets fleſh, which he hath eaten ſecretly without our knowledge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Devils whipt him ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, that they left him half-dead. <note place="margin">

                        <p>The ſame <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, that a certain, holy, and devout man, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 40.</note> being once in St. <hi>Francis</hi> company, fell into a trance, and ſaw in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven divers ſeats, amongſt which he ſaw one more Magnificently adorned then the reſt, glittering with pretious ſtones, and very glorious: And as this holy man was wondering for whom this ſeat was prepared, a voice came to him from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This</hi>
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:100919:55"/>
                           <hi>was the ſeat of one of the lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels, and is kept for the moſt humble</hi> Francis.</p>
                        <p>The Legend ſaith the ſame: and we have already ſeen, that this was the ſeat of one of the Apoſtate Seraphins; and that by this exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the moſt humble <hi>Francis</hi> is placed above the Archangels, and above the Cherubins, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently above all the Saints, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who is called the Queen of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>All that have written the life, and actions of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> ſay, That about two years before his death, God intending to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the humility and merits of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> ſent a Seraphin to him; which lying upon him croſs-wiſe, imprinted on his hands and feet the marks of the wounds of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>After his death, there was a great ſtir and conteſt about theſe marks: Some laughed at it, and ſaid, that if St. <hi>Francis</hi> had really
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100919:55"/>
received from God the marks of the wounds of Jeſus Chriſt, every one muſt needs have ſeen them, during the ſpace of thoſe two years, ſeeing he went with his feet naked, and wore no gloves; but that none ever ſaw them, ſave one Fryar, named <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſaw them but once, and that by chance too. <note place="margin">Antonin. Tit. 24. Cap. 2. Sect. 8. Solus hoc frater Elias caſu utcunque proſpicere meruit.</note> They ſaid alſo, that the miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, ſerved to ſome good purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to cure diſeaſes, to give eaſe and deliverance to the afflicted, to raiſe the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that the marks of theſe wounds do no cure at all, and are good for nothing. That it is not credible that God would imprint theſe marks on a mortal body, which was ſoon after to putrifie, by which putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction theſe marks had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced. Moreover, that although theſe marks had been really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed; yet it is a thing which the Devil, or men may eaſily coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. That the Apoſtles, who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100919:56"/>
had more worth in them then St. <hi>Francis,</hi> never had theſe marks.</p>
                        <p>But the Pope interpoſed, and in recompence of the ſervices which brother <hi>Francis</hi> had done him, (for he was a great defender of the Popes) Canonized him, and put him in the Catalogue of the the Saints.

                              <hi>Antonin. Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.</note> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Moreover, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally cite, and adjourn thoſe who had maliciouſly defaced the marks of the Image of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which was at <hi>Gennes,</hi> in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100919:56"/>

                        <p>About twenty ſix years ſince, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fourth, ſent Bulls to all the Churches under the Papal juriſdiction, certifying <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Antonin: Pag.</hi> 720.</note> the truth of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s marks (though divers, who were hard of belief, laughed at it:) ſince which time, the memory of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s marks is ſacred in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which (as <hi>Antonine</hi> ſaith) obſerves the Feaſt of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s marks; which honour is not done to the marks of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I conſider theſe things, I cannot enough wonder at the blindneſs of thoſe that give credit to things ſo full of abſurdities and impoſtures: It ſeems as if the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of St. <hi>Francis</hi> had invented them on purpoſe to diſhonour and mock him; for no man, who hath any common ſenſe left him, will do ſuch things as are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to St. <hi>Francis;</hi> who play'd the mad-man, that he might be counted a Saint; and, as much as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100919:57"/>
in him lay, kept himſelf from the uſual and ordinary actions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that he might be admired, <hi>viz.</hi> To draw roaſted fleſh through the aſhes; to wallow in the dirt with Swine; to tumble in the Snow; to give inſtruction to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and to call them his brethren and Siſters, are things which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done by a man that is in his right ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>And herein we muſt admire the juſt effects of Gods diſpleaſure, who hath revenged the contempt of his Word contained in the Holy Scriptures; for in thoſe days, and in the following Ages, the the Holy Scripture was a Book ſealed, and altogether unknown to the people: Nothing was then talked of, but Images, lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Croiſades, Indulgencies, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of Reliques, and the power of the Pope was then at the height, and abſurd and feigned Legends were the ordinary ſubject of Sermons. Wherefore God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100919:57"/>
provoked, ſtrook the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the ſpirit of giddineſs, and with a horrible blindneſs, which grew thicker and thicker, until God took the Candle of his Word from under the Buſhel, and expoſed to view the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>

                        <p>WHoſoever ſhall rightly conſider the actions of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> ſhall under the Cloak of Humility diſcover an unparallel'd pride.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of the Legend written by <hi>Jacobus de Voraigne,</hi> it is reported, That <hi>Francis</hi> being priſoner with divers other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he only was merry, and all the reſt were ſad. And being
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100919:58"/>
asked what was the cauſe of his mirth, he anſwered; <hi>Ideo me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultare noveritis, quia adhuc ſanctus per totum ſeculum adorabar,</hi> that is, <hi>Know, that I rejoyce, becauſe I ſhall be adored for a Saint throughout the World.</hi> To deſire to be adored is the higheſt degree of pride: None of the Apoſtles deſired this honour. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who was a man fearing God, knew that there is but one God, which he continually invoked; he knew well enough that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Creator of the world: but being ſeized with reverence, he would have given him ſome infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour adoration; for which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked him, ſaying, <hi>Stand up, I my ſelf alſo am a man, Act.</hi> 10. 26. St. <hi>John</hi> ſeized with fear, would have adored the Angel that talked with him, as you may ſee in the one and twentieth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> But the Angel rebuked him, ſaying, <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-ſervant;</hi>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:100919:58"/>
                           <hi>worſhip God.</hi> He knew well enough that this Angel was not God; for the ſame Angel had told him ſo before, in Chap 19. of the ſame Book. Is it not therefore an impious folly, for a man to live the life of a beggar, that he may be adored after his death?</p>
                        <p>The Rule of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which ſpeaks with an abſolute authority, demonſtrates the pride of him that compoſed it. For who gave bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis,</hi> (who was of the meaneſt of the people, and without any charge either Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical or Civil) power to compoſe Laws different from the laws of God, and to make ordinances which oblige men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of damnation? Who gave him power to command with abſolute authority? For ſee how he ſpeaks in his Rule. <hi>Per obedientiam injungo Miniſtris; I enjoyn Miniſters by their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And he concludes his Rule with theſe words, <hi>That it is not</hi>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:100919:59"/>
                           <hi>lawful for any man to infringe this Rule, or by raſh boldneſs to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it. That if any one ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make ſuch an attempt, let him know, that he ſhall incur the diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and of the Bleſſed Apoſtles,</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul.</p>
                        <p>I demand how we can be aſſured that God would have us, upon pain of incurring his diſpleaſure, entirely obſerve <hi>Francis</hi> his Rule, and that God would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with a <hi>Minor</hi> Fryar, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Cord, ſhould gird him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a leather-girdle, or ſhould receive money, or would not wear patcht clothes, or would wear a ſhirt, or ſhould (whether he be a <hi>Capucin</hi> or a Lay <hi>Cordelier)</hi> ſay leſs then ſeventy ſix <hi>Paters</hi> in one day? What can be ſaid more againſt Murtherers, Adulterers, and Blaſphemers, than to ſay, that they incur the indignation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? Hath not weak and ſinful man enough to do to obey
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100919:59"/>
the commands of God, without having heavy burthens impoſed on him in things unneceſſary, and which God requires not, and then to be made believe, that he who doth in the leaſt tranſgreſs theſe laws, invented by man, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the indignation of God?</p>
                        <p>It is obſervable, that many of thoſe who are rigid obſervers of thoſe humane laws, and oblige others to be ſo too, do very eaſily diſpence with the Laws of God; and are far from loving God with all their hearts, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as themſelves.</p>
                        <p>But Superſtition prevails more than Religion. And hence it is, that in the Convents of Monks, there are envies, factions, and continual emulations, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices.</p>
                        <p>But how did this <hi>Francis</hi> know, that a Monk who obſerves not his Rule, incurs the indignation of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul?</hi> Had he ſpoken with them? Did they declare
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100919:60"/>
and promiſe that they would be avengers and enemies to all thoſe that ſhould contemn the Rule of the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars? We have the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of thoſe excellent Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which (without compariſon) are better then Saint <hi>Francis</hi>'s Rule, and yet they do not declare themſelves avengers of the contempt of their doctrines.</p>
                        <p>They do not ſay, that he who ſhall violate their precepts, ſhall incur their indignation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears, that this venerable <hi>Francis</hi> aſſumes an authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Apoſtles, whom he would oblige to be angry for his ſake, and to undertake his quarrel. But it is not credible, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who enjoy celeſtial glory, will concern themſelves for the obſervation of the rules of Monks, eſpecially ſeeing they themſelves were no Monks, and that their lives were as much unlike the lives of the <hi>Capucins,</hi> as Heaven is diſtant from Earth; Alſo becauſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100919:60"/>
there were no Convents of Monks in the Apoſtles days, nor in many ages after.</p>
                        <p>Methinks it is enough to have <hi>God</hi> our enemy: If a man incurs the indignation of God, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of theſe two Apoſtles will not render him the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. In vain therefore doth <hi>Francis,</hi> after he hath denounced againſt the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars, who ſhall diſobey his Rule, the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, threaten them with the indignation of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who are pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (though without proof, and contrary to the word of God) to know the heart, and to ſee all that is done here below.</p>
                        <p>Alſo we would fain know, why <hi>Francis</hi> threatens the Monks with the indignation of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> only? And why not with the indignation of St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>James?</hi> but perhaps he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they have leſs credit in Heaven, or that they are leſs cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="104" facs="tcp:100919:61"/>
It is very obſervable, that <hi>Francis</hi> compoſed his Rule (wherein he gives laws, and commandeth with authority) when he was but a Lay man, and a private perſon, and a long time before the Pope approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: And although he was of the meaneſt rank of people, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any office or dignity, yet he ſpeaks magiſterially.</p>
                        <p>To the Rule of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> is added his Teſtament, wherein he ſpeaks with full power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſaying, <hi>Firmiter volo quod fratres laborent de laboritio, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio firmiter fratribus per obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>I do ſtrictly charge, and do firmly, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely command the Fryars by their obedience, &amp;c.</hi> He pre-ſuppoſeth, that obedience is due to him, and that his commands ought to be firm and inviolable.

                           <q>
                              <hi>The Rule and Life of the</hi> Minor <hi>Fryars, is as follows,</hi> viz. <hi>to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Holy Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in theſe things,</hi> viz. <hi>in living Obediently, Chaſtly, and without Poverty.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words are very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for they do not oblige the Monks to acknowledge <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> to be the eternal Son of God, and the Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the world, not to be charitable and liberal to the poor, nor to be at peace with their neighbours, nor to do to others what they would have done to themſelves, nor diligently to read the Holy Scripture, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100919:62"/>
which are things expreſly cantained in the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and recommended by the Apoſtles: But this Rule obligeth the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars, to obſerve the Goſpel in things which the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> commands not; for you cannot find, that the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbids any one to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; on the contrary, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by the mouth of his Apoſtle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thoſe who cannot contain, to marry, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> forbids us not to poſſeſs any thing in particular, nor doth he command us to live in beggary by the ſweat of other mens brows. He commands not to make a Vow of Obedience to a Guardian, or Abbot, or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of a Monaſtery; for in the days of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> there were no ſuch people, nor in many Ages after. Can there be a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt mockery, then to oblige men by Vow to obey the Goſpel in ſuch things whereof the Goſpel
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100919:62"/>
makes not the leaſt mention, and ſome whereof are contrary to the Goſpel?</p>
                        <p>But if theſe things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Goſpel, (as this Rule falſly pre-ſuppoſeth) why then doth the Pope diſpence with this Vow, by permitting Monks to marry? However, he ſeldom gives this permiſſion, except to perſons of great Quality.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Chapter of the ſame Rule, you ſhall find theſe words:
<q>Let thoſe who are received Monks, have a Cloak with a Hood, and (if they will) another without a Hood. Alſo, let thoſe wear ſhooes, who are conſtrained by neceſſity ſo to do. Likewiſe, let all the Fryars wear poor and baſe cloaths, which they may patch with pieces of ſack-cloth, and ſuch other ſtuff, and ſhall have the bleſſing of God with it.</q>

                        <p>Muſt not that man be out of his wits, who thinks, that the patching of old cloaths can bring down the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100919:63"/>
bleſſing of God upon any one? And ſeeing the <hi>Capucins</hi> cloaths are of woollen-cloth, St. <hi>Francis</hi> did very improperly ordain, that they ſhould be patched with ſack-cloth.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame Chapter of this Rule, mention is made of three Lents, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lent before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> another from <hi>All Saints</hi> day, till <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> and the other from the day of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> till the Lent before <hi>Easter.</hi> So that there are five Months of Lent: The two firſt are neceſſarily enjoyned, but the third is left to every ones liberty.</p>
                        <p>In this ſame Chapter, the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars are forbidden to ride on Horſe-back, except in caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity. Alſo they are commanded, when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any houſe, to eat whatſoever is ſet before them. By this Rule, they may eat fleſh in Lent.</p>
                        <p>They are likewiſe forbidden, in the ſame Chapter, to receive
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100919:63"/>
money, either perſonally, or by Proxie: For Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> hath already told us, that to have a Bag, and Money, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles had, is an action of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: but St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who had neither Bag nor Money, attained unto greater perfection.</p>
                        <p>In the fifth Chapter of the ſame Rule, <hi>Francis</hi> commands his Monks to labour with their hands, if they are able: But in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſpeaks more preciſely; for he ſaith, that he himſelf did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with his hands; and he adds,
<q>I do likewiſe expreſly command all the other Monks to labour.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Command is not obſerved now a days; for the <hi>Capucins</hi> and <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who underſtand a Trade, had rather live in idle beggery by other mens labour: And thus they daily break their Vow, and tranſgreſs their Rule.</p>
                        <p>But above all, are remarkable the words of the Tenth Chapter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100919:64"/>
of this Rule, which are theſe;
<q>Let not the Fryars trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to teach thoſe to read, who cannot read; but above all things let them deſire the Spirit of God.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Francis</hi> ſays this, becauſe ſome Monks are very ignorant, and cannot read. Some ſuch there are now adays, but not ſo many as there were in St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s time; whoſe opinion it is, That no body needs trouble himſelf to teach them to read, that ſo they may be inſtructed in the Holy Scriptures; he had rather they ſhould remain ignorant: Only he would have them deſire the Holy Ghoſt; not conſidering, that God gives this Spirit to thoſe who are inſtructed in his Word: For, to deſire the Holy Spirit, and yet to neglect the ordinary means, whereby the Holy Spirit works in the hearts of men, is to ſhut the door againſt him, while we deſire him; it is juſt as if a man ſhould deſire to have a Bell rung, without having the Clapper of it moved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:100919:64"/>
Theſe are the Commands of <hi>Francis,</hi> who is exalted above the Cherubins that ſtand before the Throne of God; to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Commands, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Life Eternal; and by the tranſgreſſion of them, a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs the indignation of God; and of the Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> but not of St. <hi>Philip</hi> and St. <hi>Luke.</hi> Moreover, here are better and more excellent things propoſed, then thoſe which God commands in his Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Works of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation, which merit a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent degree of Glory, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary ſort of Saints, who contented themſelves with doing what God commands.</p>
                        <p>To this Rule are added the Conſtitutions of the Order; (whereof I have already ſpoken) which the <hi>Capucins</hi> obſerve more exactly, and with greater obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then they do the Law of God, and Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>

                        <p>WE have heard before, that St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, That Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had not any ſcience acquired by ſtudy; but that he had received the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. Whether this be true or not, will appear by the paſſages of Scripture, which <hi>Francis</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in his Rule.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Chapter, he ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbids the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Order, but will have them continue in it as long as they live: And that they ought ſo to do, he proves by a paſſage of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in his Ninth Chapter, Verſe 62. where <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for</hi>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:100919:65"/>

Our Lord ſpeaks not of him who hath vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never to marry, and to wear no ſhirt, and to live by begging, and to obſerve humane Rules and Traditions, which enſnare men in unclean luſts, and which are given to God for better works then thoſe commanded in his Law, as if man would make him a debtor. In a word, to forſake the the ſervice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to tranſgreſs the Rule of <hi>Francis,</hi> is, in his opinion, one and the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>In the Ninth Chapter of the ſame Rule, St. <hi>Francis</hi> commands the Monks to be brief in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,

                        <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Of Poverty, and Riches.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FRancis</hi> made profeſſion to be a great lover of Poverty, and commonly called it his Miſtreſs. In his Rule he ſpeaks thus to his Monks; <hi>It is this ſublimity of moſt loſty poverty (my dear brethren) which makes you heirs, and Kings of the Kingdom of Heaven, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts you in vertues, who are poor in ſubſtance:</hi> And thereupon he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to poſſeſs any thing of all that is under the Sun.</p>
                        <p>He himſelf put this Rule in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For having a competent eſtate, he left it all: yea, he left his breeches, and the reſt of his clothes, and went about ſtark naked.</p>
                        <p>As for Poverty in general, many take delight in praiſing it; yea, thoſe very perſons who ſhun it; And to extol it, they ſay that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100919:67"/>
Jeſus Chriſt was poor: but that ſerves rather to ſhew that pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an evil; for Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to bear our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and to ſuſtain our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in the 45. Chapter of his Book <hi>of the Monks,</hi> ſaith, that Jeſus Chirſt was a beggar. To the titles of the Son of God, the Redeemer, the Word, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father, nothing was wanting to compleat his praiſes, but to call him begger: But a man cannot properly be ſaid to be a begger for living by the help and aſſiſtance of another.</p>
                        <p>We may judge of the nature of riches, and poverty of this, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is infinitely rich, and that the Devil is the pooreſt of all creatures. Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, that it is better to give, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; intimating thereby, that it is better for a man to give what he hath, then to ask what he hath not; For he that gives, imitates
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100919:67"/>
God, who gives always, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives never. Liberality is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways better then indigence: It is more commendable to give, than to receive an Alms. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he that blames riches as evil in their own nature, blames God, who is the Author of them, and diſtributes them as it pleaſeth him. God oftentimes exhorts his people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to piety, by the promiſes of temporal good things. And <hi>Solomon</hi> asking of him Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only, he gave him riches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo without parallel. Saint <hi>James</hi> indeed ſaith, <hi>that God hath choſen the poor;</hi> but he adds, <hi>that are rich in Faith.</hi> For the happineſs of theſe Poor conſiſts not in their being poor, but in their being rich in Faith. Thus muſt we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what Jeſus Chriſt ſaith in the ſixth Chapter of St. <hi>Luke, Bleſſed be ye poor.</hi> For that which makes a poor man happy, is not his poverty, but the manner of ſupporting his poverty. There
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100919:68"/>
be rich men that are very vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and poor men that are very wicked, whom poverty excites to Theft, Murther, Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore <hi>Agur,</hi> in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of God, not to ſend him po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. The Soul of poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> is carried by Angels into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of rich <hi>Abraham.</hi> So that the poor and rich are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to teach us, that rich as well as poor are received into the Kingdom of God, if they fear and ſerve him according to his word.</p>
                        <p>It is true indeed, that riches do corrupt many, and ſerve only to puff them up with pride, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their luſts, and to divert their hearts from truſting in God, to truſt in their riches. And this is the reaſon why Jeſus Chriſt ſaith it is hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God: But this evil proceeds not from riches, but from thoſe that abuſe them, into whoſe lap riches falling
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100919:68"/>
are corrupted, as a Crown is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed that falls into a puddle, and in whoſe hands the goods of this world are like a ſword in the hands of a mad-man. We muſt not believe that Jeſus Chriſt in the 16th. Chapter of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> calls riches <hi>unrighteous,</hi> becauſe there is any unrighteouſneſs in the poſſeſſion of them, or becauſe they are gotten by unrighteous means, but becauſe they are either provocations, or inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs, to thoſe that are deſtitute of the fear of God.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Of the vow of Poverty, and of idle begging: Alſo of works, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of ſupererogation.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THere are two ſorts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: one which God ſends, and another to which men do vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily devote themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods ſending it unto them. The former is an affliction, the other is a direct profeſſion, which ſome chuſe, as ſuppoſing it of great merit, and a work of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation. There be ſome poor, whom God hath reduced to a low eſtate, wherein they get a ſlender livelihood by the labour of their hands: who, if they be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their conditions, and by ſerving God with a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, do aſpire to better riches, <hi>viz,</hi> the Heavenly, they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and beloved of God, and truly rich. There be others,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100919:69"/>
whom God bereaves of their eſtates for the profeſſion of the Goſpel, who, although they have not purpoſely drawn poverty on themſelves, yet, if they bear this yoke patiently and joyfully, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming it an honour to bear the Croſs of Chriſt, their Poverty may be ſaid to be voluntary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they voluntarily follow the call of God. Of theſe Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks in the ninth Chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> who have left Father, Mother, Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Lands for his ſake; God having reduced them to ſuch a neceſſity, that they cannot keep their eſtates without forſaking the profeſſion of the Goſpel. In this caſe, we muſt lay down our very lives to ſave our Souls; and muſt be prodigal of our eſtate to be nigardly of our ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>But there is an affected poverty, which ſome embrace by vow, and without any neceſſity, or God's obliging of them thereunto; who
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100919:70"/>
may keep their eſtates with a good conſcience, but yet had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave them to live by other men's eſtates, and had rather beg than work. This poverty is a yoke which God impoſeth not on them, but they impoſe it on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They bear not Chriſt's Croſs, but their own. They leave the exerciſe of charity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of humility and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It may be ſaid, that they they are like the fowls of the Air, for they ſow not, neither do they reap, and yet their Father the Pope, feeds them plentifully: for we ſee, that thoſe who have vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Poverty, are fat and plump; and though they are poor in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet are they rich in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. They get more by begging, then the common people do by working. Many turn Monks in ſpight, or to ſhake off the yoke of their parents, or in a Melancholy and deſperate humour, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud their creditors, who preſs hard
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100919:70"/>
upon them; or becauſe they will not take pains to work, or have not wherewith to ſubſiſt at home. They turn beggers, that they may not be poor. They are poor by vow, for fear of being ſo by neceſſity. Wherefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks very gracefully, when he ſaith, That to theſe begging <note place="margin">Lib de Monachis cap. 46. ſ. ſecunda.</note> Monks belongs that ſaying of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in the Nineteenth Chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuplum accipiet, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>He ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit eternal life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But when our adverſaries call begging a work of ſupererogation, they do thereby acknowledge, that God commands it not. The Prophets, and the Apoſtles never vowed poverty, neither were they beggars. Thoſe of them who were poor, were not ſo by vow, but by neceſſity, which God <note place="margin">Joh. 21. 3.</note> impoſed on them. The Apoſtles <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 27.</note> had their Fiſhing Veſſels after our <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 16.</note>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:100919:71"/>
Lords Reſurrection; And St. <hi>John</hi> had his houſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> received with thankfulneſs the relief which the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent him: Being at <hi>Corinth,</hi> he got his living by making of Tents, chuſing rather to work, then to beg; For he well knew, that begging is a ſhameful thing, and that it makes men both idle and impudent. He that leaves his own eſtate, to eat ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans bread, hath no reaſon to ſay to God, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi> For God might anſwer him, <hi>I gave thee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to buy bread, but thou haſt deſpiſed it; And now by thy beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, thou takeſt from them that are really poor, thoſe Alms which are due to them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſo far is begging from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a work of ſupererogation, and better then what God commands in his Law, that, on the contrary, <note place="margin">Omnino non erit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiens &amp; mendicus inter vos.</note> God will have us prevent it as much as we can, ſaying in <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 15. verſe 4. <hi>To the end that</hi>
                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100919:71"/>
                           <hi>there may be no poor among you.</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifies a <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           </note> and the Vulgar Tranſlation ſo renders it. Not that it is a ſin to beg, when a man hath no other way of ſubſiſtence: But God commands the rich ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the poor, that they may not be conſtrained to beg.</p>
                        <p>The Scripture often ſpeaks of begging as an evil, and a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, a curſe. In the 37. <hi>Pſalm, David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi> And in 109 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he makes this impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Let his Children be Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and beg.</hi> He ſpeaks indeed of involuntary poverty; but there is no likelihood, that that which is a curſe to ſome, can be a bleſſing to others; and that which to one is a grievous affliction, can be to another a holy Profeſſion.</p>
                        <p>As for examples, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen the deſcription which

                        <p>Examine Antiquity, and try if you can find ſo much as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Monks that made beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a Profeſſion. There was no no ſuch thing as a Profeſſion of beggary; for above twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after the Nativity of our Lord. <hi>Camus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi> who is yet living, hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a great book <hi>of the labours of Monks;</hi> in the Preface whereof you ſhall find theſe words; <hi>The ulcer of idleneſs is crept into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, under the name of holy and meritorious beggary.</hi> His whole book is employed to prove that Monks ſhould be obliged to labour with their hands, eſpecially thoſe that do not Preach, nor have

any other painful employment in the Church: ſo far is he from placing beggary amongſt thoſe pieces of perfection, whereby God is made a debtor to man. And this Prelate's book bears in its front the Approbation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the faculty of <hi>Theologie at Paris.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath written a book, <hi>De opere Monachorum,</hi> wherein he obligeth them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teacheth the ſame, in <hi>the Hereſie of the Maſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> where, he ſaith, that in all the Monaſteries of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Monks did labour with their hands, even as Bees do labour to make honey and wax. In thoſe days the Monks were poor Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, living in deſerts, labouring with their hands to get their liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and carrying their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip to the neighbouring Towns to ſell, bought bread with the money: They did not beg the approbation of their Rule from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100919:73"/>
were not ſubject to him: In a word, they were not at all like the Monks now adays. The ſame <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> in the ſame book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns thoſe that live an idle life, and making a profeſſion of beging, get their bread at rich mens tables.</p>
                        <p>But to compleat their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the mendicant Fryars make begging a work of ſupererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, better than what <hi>God</hi> commands in his Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, better than to love <hi>God</hi> with all our hearts, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves. <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to ſerve him with all our ſtrength, ſo that the Monks ſerve <hi>God</hi> with more than all their ſtrength, which is impoſſible. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Samuel, David, &amp;c.</hi> never did works of ſupererogation. The perfection of the Angels conſiſts in obeying <hi>God,</hi> and not in doing more than he commands. Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came into the world only to do the will of his Father, and not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100919:73"/>
to do more then his will. Ask the moſt devout <hi>Capucin,</hi> if he never commits ſin; and he will tell you, that he is a poor linner: How do theſe things agree? they do not that which <hi>God</hi> commands, and yet will do more then he commands! They fail in neceſſary things, and yet ſtrive to do things unneceſſary, and which God requires not! They do not what they ought, and do what they ought not! They are more holy than God would have them to be!</p>
                        <p>That man is crack-braind, who exerciſeth liberality when he hath not wherewith to pay his debts; If this be ſo in reference to men, how much more in reference to God? It is an extream pride, to endeavour to give God overplus, and more then we owe him.</p>
                        <p>In a word, I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Monks, when they do works of ſupererogation, do the will of God, or their own will.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100919:74"/>
If they do the will of God, they are obliged thereunto, and do what they ought: But if, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better things then thoſe which God commands, they do their own will; it follows that their will is better than the will of God.</p>
                        <p>Out of this ſame ſhop of pride, come thoſe ſuperabundant ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereby the Monks would make us believe, that they ſuffer more puniſhment, and do more penance, then their ſins deſerve, and that the Pope gathers this overplus into his Treaſury, and diſtributes it by his Indulgences as payment for the ſins of others. The Monks believe, that by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, by faſting and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare-foot, they expiate the ſins of others; Wherefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Bell. lib. 1. de Indul. r. 4. ſ. ſex.</note> ſaith, that the Saints are, in ſome ſenſe, our Redeemers. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends of Saint <hi>Antonine,</hi> ſay, that Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> a grand emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the holineſs of St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:100919:74"/>
laſht himſelf three times a day with an iron chain, <hi>viz.</hi> Once for his own ſins, which were very ſmall, once for the ſins of the living, and once for the ſins of thoſe Souls which are in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, who (no doubt) received much eaſe thereby. And it is this ſame Saint, that once had mercy on the Devil: For the Devil having transformed himſelf into a Sparrow, and Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> catching him, contented himſelf only with pulling off the feathers from his head, whereas it was in his power to have wrung off his neck.</p>
                        <p>By theſe things God is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: For ſuch things are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, which if a man ſhould do, he would be accounted either wicked, or mad. For, what Judge would not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unjuſt, or out of his wits, who ſhould let a malefactor go, becauſe his neighbour hath whipt himſelf for him? But things which are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100919:75"/>
ridiculous in civil ſociety, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed good in Religion; as if a man muſt loſe common ſenſe to augment piety.</p>
                        <p>All this abuſe proceeds from this, <hi>viz.</hi> that men, utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the knowledge of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures (which are to them a book ſealed, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) ſeek other ſatisfactions, and other payments for ſin, then the death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. For ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied Gods juſtice, to what purpoſe are other ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions preſented to him? Is not this to accuſe God of injuſtice, to pretend that he takes two pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for one debt, when the firſt is ſufficient? Is it not to diſhonour that moſt perfect ſatisfaction, which Jeſus Chriſt hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for us, to joyn it with the whipings and auſterities of Monks, which is juſt as if a man ſhould mingle coals and diamonds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VI.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100919:75"/>
in his Extravagant <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nigenitus,</hi> ſaith, that the merits of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of the other Saints, do help to compleat the treaſure of the benefits of Jeſus Chriſt; giving us to underſtand, that the benefits of Jeſus Chriſt make but bare meaſure; but that the addition of the Saints merits makes heaped meaſure, and is an addition to the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. And for this reaſon, the Prieſt in the Maſs prays for ſalvation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Saints interceſſion, but alſo through their merits.</p>
                        <p>The Lord God take pity on ſo many poor people involved in ſo many abuſes, and diſcover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of thoſe, who being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves notorious ſinners, do yet by a proud humility think to expiate the ſins of others.</p>

The ſame Author in the 109. page, hath theſe words:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt, Pope</hi> Clement <hi>the Fourth hath granted to thoſe men, who on their Death-beds ſhall deſire to be clad in the Habit of</hi> St. Francis <hi>his Order; and to thoſe women who ſhall deſire to be clad in the Habit of of</hi> St. Clare, <hi>and to be buried in it, the pardon of the third part of their ſins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This ſame Indulgence was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by Pope</hi> Nicholas <hi>the Third, and by Pope</hi> Urban <hi>the Fifth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moreover, Pope</hi> Leo, <hi>the Tenth, confirming the ſaid Conceſſions, adds by way of overplus, That they who ſhould die in this Habit of</hi> St. Francis, <hi>or St.</hi> Clare, <hi>and ſhould be buried therein, ſhould have a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Indulgence for all their ſins.</hi>

                           <hi>(Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>the Fifth) he hath granted to thoſe of the Fraternity, who ſhall on ſuch days rehearſe the ſeven Penitentiary Pſalms, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of one Soul out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Indulgence granted (as the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars ſay) by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and confirmed by the Pope at <hi>Noſtre Dame des Anges,</hi> called <hi>Portiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula;</hi> the Roſary of <hi>Bernardin,</hi> and the aforeſaid book of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences of the Cord, and the Chronicle of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> ſay, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> would not have the Pope's Bull for confirmation of the ſaid Indulgence: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have the glorious Virgin, and Jeſus Chriſt for Notaries, and the Angels for Witneſſes.</hi> This Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is to be had on the ſecond day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> whereby every one who hath been confeſſed, and is contrite, and ſhall then go into the Church of <hi>Noſtre Dame des</hi>
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100919:78"/>
                           <hi>Anges,</hi> ſhall obtain a plenty a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary abſolution both of ſin, and puniſhment. If this ſame perſon ſhould go into any other Church, with the like or greater contrition he ſhould not have the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. It is worth our notice, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> obtained this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> by preſenting him with three red Roſes in the Winter.</p>
                        <p>But Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, who was a <hi>Cordelier,</hi> hath abundantly heaped up Indulgences, plenary, more plenary, and moſt plenary, (as they Phraſe it) on the Order of the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars, and upon the Fraternity of St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Cord.</p>
                        <p>But of all theſe Indulgences, of three or four hundred thouſand years, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> make little reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, and have never much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves about procuring any of them from the Pope; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming their own Order, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though barren in pardons, and Indulgences, better then that of the <hi>Minor</hi> Fryars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:100919:79"/>
However, in one reſpect the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and <hi>Capucins</hi> ſurpaſs the Jeſuits, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in that St. <hi>Francis</hi> was Canonized by the Pope im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his death, without the leaſt difficulty: But as for <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius Loyola,</hi> the Founder and Patron of the Jeſuits, who dyed, <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 1556. the Jeſuits were above ſeventy years ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Pope, that he might be put into the number of the Saints; and at laſt, with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, obtained his Canonization, ſeventy years after his death. So long did the ſanctity of <hi>Ignatius</hi> hang in ſuſpence; which, no doubt, was the cauſe of great trouble, and perplexity to him. However this future Saint, during all this waiting, received ſome conſolation; For, ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Canonization he was Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, which is a fore-runner of Canonization.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:100919:79"/>
At laſt the Pope having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more clear and certain proofs of the holineſs of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> put him into the Catalogue of the Saints, and ordained that he ſhould be invoked in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which had not been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful during thoſe ſeventy years that paſt betwixt <hi>Ignatius</hi> his death and Canonization.</p>
                        <p>But as in the Chappels, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> you ſhall ſee few Images of St. <hi>Francss;</hi> ſo in the Convents, and Churches of the <hi>Capucins,</hi> it is a very rare thing to ſee the image of St. <hi>Ignatius:</hi> For the <hi>Capucins</hi> believe, that St. <hi>Francis</hi> hath more credit in the Court of Heaven, and that he is exalted above the <hi>Cherubins.</hi>

and women, gather wealth on all hands; and if you would give a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> his right name, you muſt call him <hi>Omnis homo.</hi> However, the <hi>Capucin</hi>'s have gained the eſteem of the people, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the other Monks in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and auſterity.</p>
                        <p>Their day begins at midnight, a little before which time, he that warns them to riſe, goes the round by their <hi>chamber doors</hi> with a kind of Cymbal, which they call a <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas,</hi> being like thoſe Inſtruments of Wood, with which thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion are called to their Churches three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Easter,</hi> when the Bells are ſilent.</p>
                        <p>At this noiſe the ſleeping Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars rouſe, rub their ears, ſhake off their fleas, and go into the Choire to ſing <hi>Matines.</hi> They that would be diſpenſed with, need only ſay to this officer, <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am indiſpoſed, paſs on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> When <hi>Matines</hi> are ended,

having invoked all the Saints in Paradiſe, both Males and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; they begin to whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the manner mentioned in the 8th Chapter of the <hi>Capucin.</hi> Many make more noiſe then they have hurt, others ſtrike againſt the benches to ſpare their but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks; and all this while they ſing with open mouth the 51 <hi>Pſalm, Have mercy on this poor Sinner,</hi> &amp;c. There be ſome that make themſelves bleed in good earneſt, and with much whipping harden the leather of their but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, like that of a Poſtillion's Coat; for theſe poor people think they ſhall go to Heaven the ſooner for their much whiping themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The whips which they uſe, are called <hi>Diſciplines;</hi> ſome are made of ſmall iron chains, and ſome of ſmall cords full of knots; at the end of which ſome of them put iron rowels.

Chriſt; and ſome of ſeven to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſeven mortal ſins.</p>
                        <p>After theſe skirmiſhes, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour bleſſeth them all, and then they diſpoſe themſelves to make that Prayer which they call men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and that they may recollect themſelves the better, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are ſhut. Many of them make it, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; <note n="b" place="margin">They fall aſleep.</note> 
                           <hi>Simon ſleepeſt thou?</hi> This Prayer muſt continue an hour, and then they go to a great fire; about which they make a thouſand frisks, and cut as many capers. Some turn their back to the fire, others their ſide. Some draw their Hoods over their face, others put a Handkerchief o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their eyes; and all this while they rehearſe in two Choirs the office of the Virgin for thoſe that gave them the wood.</p>
                        <p>When they are well warmed, they go to ſleep till ſix a clock in Winter, and five in Summer: a little before the clock ſtrikes, they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100919:84"/>
are awakened by the ſtrokes of a club on their chamber-doors, and then they return into the Choire to ſing <note n="c" place="margin">Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>

                        <p>After theſe ſpiritual exerciſes, they betake themſelves to corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ones. The Cooks prepare in the Kitchen, the Gardners go to work in the Garden.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100919:84"/>
waiting for the Superiour.</p>

                           <hi>Mundays, Wedneſdays,</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> having kiſt the ground, they attend on their knees the coming of the Superiour, who having likewiſe kiſt the ground, turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the reſt. Then the eldeſt of them puts off his cloak in reſpect, claſps his hands, hangs down his head on his knees, and ſays, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicite, Father I confeſs my fault, I am an unhappy wretch, I have broken a Platter;</hi> another ſays, <hi>I am worſe then a Devil, I have broken a Cup;</hi> another, <hi>I am a block-head, I was like to have burnt the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</hi> Such things as theſe they confeſs, as Mr. <hi>du Moulin</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <note place="margin">Vide du Moulin.</note> in the 8th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Capucin.</hi>

                        <p>To theſe childiſh confeſſions, are enjoyned on the very ſame place, Penances ſutably ridiculous, to which I adde theſe following.</p>
                        <p>They make him that hath Sung too low in the Choir, to put the Coverlet of his bed on his back,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100919:85"/>
like a Cope, and a ſtaff in his hand like the Chanter of the Chapter; and as he walks along by the Tables, he ſings the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat</hi> with falſe notes.</p>
                        <p>If any one be too ſpruce or fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, (as many affect to be; witneſs he that cauſed ſuch hairs of his eye-brows and beard, as he called ſupernumerary, to be pluckt out; for he cut his hairs by tale, and his beard by the rule or compaſs) they make him kiſs the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hangers, or the bottom of a Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Divers go to him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement him, calling him <hi>Sir;</hi> and then (to make him handſom and brave) they load him with Diſh-clouts, and flap him on the Chaps with a wet cloth, as you would do to a Jack-pudding.</p>
                        <p>I have known a Maſter of the Novices to enjoyn a Novice, as a penance, to ſing a merry Song, called <hi>Madelonnette.</hi> Another hath commanded them all to paſs over the belly of one that lay flat
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100919:85"/>
on his back; and every one as he paſſed over him, ſaid, <hi>Burſt, burſt thou proud Cockscomb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another, who cauſed a Novice to be whipt in the Garden, in the ſight of Women and Maids, that lookt over the wall; being told of it, replyed, <note n="f" place="margin">They would fain ſee the Females whipt.</note> 
                           <hi>What care we though the Females ſee our ſhoulders, ſith we give them good example.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a very rude and uncivil penance, when a poor <hi>Capucin</hi> hath emptied his pot of Wine at Table; the Superiour commands another to be brought him. For this is to publiſh his infirmity <note n="g" place="margin">It is a ſign he loves good wine.</note> and what that is, the reſt are able to gueſs by the greatneſs of his thirſt.</p>
                        <p>If any one brags of his gentili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or talks in Courtly terms, or walks loftily, three perſons are appointed to follow him as he walks up and down, whilſt the reſt are at Table; and two Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiers march before him with Pick-Axes on their ſhoulders,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100919:86"/>
crying, <hi>Room, Room, for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If any one makes a noiſe as he walks, he is tyed hand and foot like a Calf that is carried to Market, and lies ſo upon the place till dinner be ended; or elſe he is made gallop up and down the room upon all four like a beaſt.</p>
                        <p>Going one day to a certain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, I went into the Dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, and in the place where they do penance, I ſaw one buſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to bite an Apple, which hung from the roof by a thred; and asking what that poor Fryar had done, I was told that he had eaten his Pottage too hot, and that this Apple was given him to ſtay his ſtomack while his broth did cool.</p>
                        <p>Another for breaking ſilence, was made to hold a dead mans bone in his mouth, for the ſpace of an hour at the Church door, to be ſeen by thoſe that went in.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100919:86"/>
A certain poor Fryar that was one of the Servants, coming one day very hot out of the Kitchen, preſently takes off his pot of wine; which the Superiour obſerving, made him ſhew the bottom of his empty pot, and to ſay aloud, <hi>Brethren, I pray do me the favour to fetch my Drawers for my pot, for you ſee it ſhows its breech.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When any one hath ſpoken too inſolently to his fellow, he is made to go bare-foot, bare-headed, with his hands claſpt, and a great rope about his neck; and falling on his knees, he kiſſeth the feet of all the reſt, ſaying, <hi>Brethren pray to God for a poor Toad.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He that hath too ſtately a gate, is made to walk up and down, whilſt the reſt are at dinner, with his arms a Kembow, a Basket on his head, and a lath by his ſide, made like a Sword; ſaying to them all, one after another; <hi>Brother what doſt thou think? am I not very brave?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100919:87"/>
I have known a Superiour ſo uncivil, as to command a young Novice who ſmelt to his bread, to dine on the ſeat of a Privy.</p>
                        <p>And now we are ſpeaking of Novices; it is a rent which they pay every <hi>Friday,</hi> before they ſit down at Table, to whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whilſt the 51 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is ſung, and to ſpeak to no body but on their knees, nor to riſe again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have kiſs'd the ground.</p>
                        <p>When theſe follies are ended, and having all dined, the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour gives a ſignal by ſtriking with his knife on a goblet. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they all riſe, and take away, and (having given thanks) go to the Altar, where every one ſays three <hi>Paters</hi> for thoſe who gave them their Dinner; after which they walk in the garden.</p>
                        <p>About Two of the Clock, the Keeper of the Veſtry (or Sexton) ſtrikes ſive times on the broken Pick-Axe; this is called Silence, at the ſound whereof they all go
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100919:87"/>
to ſleep for an hour; and this is called the preparation for the mental prayer, which in Summer they make at noon.</p>
                        <p>At Two of the Clock they ſing Veſpers; at which time, moſt commonly, there are many vacant places, for ſome are walking in the Garden, others making viſits in the Town, others a begging; and it is a great chance if ſome be not abſent.</p>
                        <p>At Four a Clock they ring the <note n="h" place="margin">The laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> 
                           <hi>Completorium,</hi> after which, they make about forty Prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and then they make again the mental pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for an hour.</p>
                        <p>In the Winter they whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoon as this Prayer is ended, inſtead of doing it in the night, to avoid the ſeverity of the cold.</p>
                        <p>One of the greateſt Earls in <hi>France,</hi> being once, by chance in a Monaſtery, and hearing the great noiſe they made, thought
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100919:88"/>
the Heavens were falling, and receiving withall a laſh on the chaps with a whip, cryed out for help; which at that time put a ſtop to their exerciſe.</p>
                        <p>One of them being wont to whip himſelf too ſeverely, the Superiour cauſed his <hi>Diſcipline</hi> (which is a kind of whip) to be taken from him. But this good Fryer loved whipping ſo well, that he went and preſented his buttocks to his companions, and begging ſome laſhes of them, he ſaid, <hi>Brother do me the kindneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>They go out from thence mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to Supper (which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted with Penances, as their dinner is) and then they go to diſcourſe by a good fire. Some tell the news of the Town, others read Gazetts; and every man takes the liberty to talk, except the Superiour (from the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſpark of fire falling on his foot) commands them to ſay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100919:88"/>
ſome Prayers for the Souls in Purgatory.</p>
                        <p>About Seven a Clock, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt of them go to examine their Conſciences before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; after which the Superiour ſings ſome Prayers; which being ended, they all ſtretch out their arms croſs-wiſe, and ſay <hi>Five Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> then one of them kiſſing his hand, preſenteth him with the bruſh dipt in Holy-water, which he ſprinkles on their heads, to waſh away their Venial ſins. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this every one kiſſeth the ground, and ſays, <hi>Benedicite,</hi> and ſo they go to lye down until the Alarm calls them to Matines.</p>

                        <p>IT is a lamentable thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whither Superſtition leads theſe poor Souls, that take not the precepts of the Goſpel for the rule of their devotion.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome <hi>Capucins</hi> that think they do God very good ſervice by whipping themſelves every day, as ſoon as they awake; and that if they whip themſelves before the Communion, it is a good preparation thereunto.</p>
                        <p>I have read in the memorials of one of their Generals, that a certain <hi>Capucin,</hi> named <hi>Amboine Corſe,</hi> wore a Coat of Maile next his body, and girt it ſo cloſe, that his fleſh came thorow it; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it was incorporated into his skin; alſo that this ſame man did wear Drawers of Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100919:89"/>
and that (the length of them being half cut) entred into his <note place="margin">Hairs.</note> fleſh; and at laſt he came to ſuch a degree of Superſtition, that he would eat but five raw Beans a day in Summer, and five Chace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts in Winter, and drank no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Water. His deſign (ſays the General) was to try how far humane nature could go in ſuffering (he might have ſaid, in tempting God.)</p>
                        <p>Some of them lye on the bare Boards, with a Faggot for their Pillow, and ſleep with a Croſs in their hand.</p>
                        <p>A certain <hi>Capucin</hi> that was wont to ſtretch out his arms (Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) two hours every day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick and weak, would not let fall his languiſhing arms; and asking him to what purpoſe that Devotion ſerved, he anſwered me, that he did it in imitation of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That he was Crucified with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have known ſome that would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100919:90"/>
bow a hundred times every day before an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and at each time kiſs the feet of the Image.</p>
                        <p>Some gather Flowers and make Noſegays, wherein they put but five ſorts of flowers, in honour of the five letters of the name <hi>Maria.</hi> I have ſeen certain of them having a Noſegay of Gilliflowers in their hand, preſent it to the noſe of an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and kneeling down ſaid, <hi>I ſalute thee, Mary;</hi> and repeated it ſixty three times, in honour of the ſixty three years, which they ſay the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> lived upon Earth.</p>
                        <p>I have known ſome go four Leagues faſting, to preſent the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with a Crown of flowers, which they put on the head of her Image.</p>
                        <p>Another pricking himſelf, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a vow to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with his blood; and as he turned about, ſeeing a great gobbet of rotten flegm, which ſome body had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100919:90"/>
newly ſpit, he lickt it up in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſaid Virgin.</p>
                        <p>One of their Stewards were wont to preſent Fruit to the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, with ſublime intentions, <hi>viz.</hi> Sometimes he would preſent a ſlice of a Melon to each of them, in honour of the Deity; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two in honour of the two Natures of Chriſt. Sometimes three Apples in honour of the three Perſons; ſometimes four Pears in honour of the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts; ſeven Apricocks in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to the ſeven mortal ſins; eight Figs in favour of the eight Beatitudes; nine Apples in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the nine Choire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; ten Chaſenuts in thinking on the ten Commandments; and oftentimes twelve in memory of the twelve Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>I have known ſome carry about with them their ſins, written in a skin of Parchment; which they ſowed to the inſide of their cloths, juſt againſt the heart; and this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100919:91"/>
they did in imitation of <hi>David,</hi> who ſaith in the 51 <hi>Pſalm, My ſin is ever before me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another had the reputation of a Saint for whipping himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night, and for whipping the ſteps of the Altar; with intention to whip the ſhooes of the little Jeſus.</p>
                        <p>Fryar <hi>Jacopon</hi> had the inwards of an Oxe hanging in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; wherein the worms bred, and he uſed to bite it ſometimes to mortifie his appetite.</p>
                        <p>Some think it a great piece of Devotion to ſleep upon a dead mans skull; others to whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a handful of Nettles; another is admired in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of their Order, for ſitting on one end of a plank, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down with a Child on the other end, in the midſt of the Town, and continuing ſo to do, until the Magiſtrates came and ſaluted him for a Saint.</p>
                        <p>I knew one ſo fervent, that in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100919:91"/>
zeal to the Goſpel, which makes mention of Eunuchs, <hi>that made themſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of God;</hi> acted the part of a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion on himſelf; and the pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried on a Trencher to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing periours Chamber, he ordered that the two brethren ſhould be buried in the Church-yard, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the reſurrection. This poor fool was within a hands breadth of death; falling down in a ſwound at the foot of the block, on which he had gelt himſelf.</p>
                        <p>I knew another, who to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his humours, rolled his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks on burning coals.</p>
                        <p>This was reputed ſanctity by ſome, but folly by the Gardiner; becauſe the Coleworts were uſed to cure the bladders which he had on his breech.</p>
                        <p>I have known ſome ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that they would have thought themſelves in the eſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if they had read but ſix lines of the Goſpel of Saint <hi>John,</hi>

                        <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The Habits of the</hi> Capucins.</head>
                        <p>THE Habit of the <hi>Capucins</hi> conſiſteth in three things, <hi>viz.</hi> in that great exteriour habit which is ſeen in little drawers, which they call <hi>Murandes;</hi> and in the cord which muſt be of hair, or flax, and muſt have three knots. The firſt knot ſignifies Chaſtity, the ſecond Poverty, and that which beateth on their feet, ſignifies Obedience. If any one to ſhorten his cord, makes a fourth knot, they call it blame and ſelf-will.</p>
                        <p>The Cloak and Sandales are not of the eſſence of their Habit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they wear them but by the Popes diſpenſation.</p>
                        <p>The rule of the <hi>Capucins</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to wear another Habit underneath, but that hath no Hood. It reacheth to the neck
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100919:93"/>
only; and he that wears it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wear a Cloak. This ſort of Habit is called <hi>Tunica;</hi> it is made of a ſoft and gentle cloth, and he that ſhould wear it with a Hood, and ſhould not leave off his Cloak, would be cenſured guilty of a mortal ſin.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon there aroſe, one day a great diſpute amongſt them, whether this <hi>Tunica,</hi> with a Hood, might be worn without ſin. To this anſwer was made, that for the avoiding of ſin, it ſhould be ſown at the neck and end of the Sleeves to the other Habit; and then it would be but one Habit: A reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution both ſubtil and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which draws a Soul out of Hell with a needle full of threed.</p>
                        <p>Divers of them wear large nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins on their back and ſtomach, and you may eaſily perceive it by looking at their neck. But they that do this ſhould alſo put Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins on the out-ſide of their cloths, in imitation of St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100919:93"/>
who having put a Foxes skin with inſide his clothes to warm his ſtomach; cauſed another to be ſown on the out-ſide, that he might not be thought an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen ſome of the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins</hi> cloaks made of the liſts of cloth, and their cloaths made of little ſhreds ſowed together; but they that wore them were prouder than a <hi>Spaniard</hi> with his Cloak.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The Begging of the</hi> Capucins.</head>
                        <p>IN ſome Monaſteries in <hi>France,</hi> there are 120 <hi>Monks,</hi> and in many other 80. and 60. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of theſe Monaſteries (in reference both to back and belly, with neceſſaries as well for the Church, as Offices of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) amount to above 35000,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100919:94"/>
or 40000 livers yearly. So that you muſt conclude their Wallet would be very large, if what is put into it were ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray ſo great an expence. But ſee how they order their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                        <p>The chief of the Town give them weekly ſome twenty pounds of fleſh, ſome twelve pounds, ſome more, ſome leſs, which they give theſe <note n="*" place="margin">Beggars.</note> 
                           <hi>Queſtors</hi> order to take of their Butchers. And you may gueſs what quantity of fleſh is brought into each Monaſtery in a week, there being very few perſons of note who do not give them ſome.</p>
                        <p>On <hi>Saturdays,</hi> moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may ſee at ſeveral times of the day, Butchers going to the Monaſtery, laden with meat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out each others knowledge; and ſometimes the Kitchen is ſo full, that it would ſerve to furniſh a Butchers ſtall.</p>
                        <p>To theſe Alms <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100919:94"/>
added pecuniary Alms, given by the Nobility and Gentry of the Country. The <hi>Capucins</hi> dare not make uſe of theſe pecuniary Alms, until the intention of the donor be fully declared.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Queſtor</hi> who takes a pride in furniſhing the Kitchen well, takes with him ſome crafty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to receive this money, who when they receive it, cauſe the <hi>donor</hi> to ſay, that it is to feed the poor Fryars; for if the <hi>donor</hi> had only ſaid in general it is for the neceſſities of the Monaſtery, that money could not have been made uſe of for the Kitchen. Hence it comes to paſs, that the money which comes from the Country, and that which is given for Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Sermons, and other exerciſes, is employed moſt commonly for the refreſhment of the poor Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; for the Benefactors cauſe thoſe very words to be uſed to thoſe to whom the Alms is given, which the parties themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100919:95"/>
There is ſuch an abundance of bread given to ſome Monaſteries, that they cannot uſe it all, but the <hi>Queſtor</hi> knows how to work a kind of miracle, ſo that nothing is loſt: For when any one of thoſe that are wont to give bread, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to give his Alms, the <hi>Queſtor</hi> begins to bleſs God for the care he hath of the poor Fryars, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſies, by his refuſal, that he hath no need of it at preſent. Then he is asked what it is that he wants. He dares not ſay he wants fleſh, for their Conſtitutions forbid them to ask fleſh in its proper ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, except it be for the Sick: But he declares that the moſt part give them Bread; and that man lives not by Bread only, and gives ſo many hints, that at laſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, knowing his meaning, gives him fleſh.</p>
                        <p>The Bread which they take of the Baker is of the fineſt ſort, and ſometimes it ſo much abounds, that I have ſeen (beſides what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100919:95"/>
was uſed) above 160 dozen of Bread remaining in a Monaſtery at the years end.</p>
                        <p>In the time of Vintage they beg Wine; they receive it by bottles at the houſe, and buy it at Fairs by the Cask with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary Alms. That which is given to the <hi>Queſtor</hi> in bottles, they caſt into a Tun with ripe Grapes and old Wine to make it ſtrong. It is true that the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours have forbidden any more than two or three Casks to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Cellar of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery at a time, for fear of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting an offence againſt pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but when that is drunk, they cauſe more to be brought in, which is kept for a reſerve by ſome good friend to the Monaſtery.</p>
                        <p>They beg Wool at the time of of Sheep-ſhearing; and that they may get the more, they ſend out four Troops of <hi>Capucins,</hi> who traverſe the whole Country. That Sheep is very cunning that can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100919:96"/>
eſcape without leaving ſome of its locks behind it: So that ſome Monaſteries have 1200 <hi>l.</hi> of Wool yearly; others 800 <hi>l.</hi> and in ſome Monaſteries they make cloth.</p>
                        <p>They beg Butter at the ſame time; and to get the more, they ſend Beaſts laden with empty pots, ſome greater, ſome leſs, of which every one takes according to their devotion; and when they are full, lead them back to the Monaſtery, whither hath been brought ſome years, 4 or 5000 <hi>l.</hi> according to the goodneſs of the ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>Some Monaſteries have liberty to cut Wood in the Kings For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and the Gentry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſupply them, if they want more: But they go a ſhorter way to work; for on the firſt great cold, when it Snows or Hails much, they ſend ſome abroad to beg Wood, with a Cart attending them. They go bare as high as the knees, and there is no body
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100919:96"/>
but contributes ſomething, when he ſees their legs bare and red with cold. This way only fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them with Wood enough for the whole year.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Beggars ſpare no body. If any one makes Linnen, they have their ſhare. If a Cow or an Oxe be killed in Harveſt, the skin is appointed to make Sandales for the <hi>Capucins.</hi> The <hi>Chandlers</hi> give them Candles, the <hi>Druguiſts</hi> Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At Fairs they go from ſhop to ſhop, and there are few (beſides thoſe that ſell Whiſtles, and Puppets) but give them part of what they ſell. He that ſhould ſee the <hi>Queſtors</hi> private Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, would find there more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation then in the beſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Boats. There is in ſome Monaſteries greater ſtore of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries Wares, than in any ſhop in the Town, alſo I have ſeen divers Cart-loads of all ſorts of Chymical Veſſels and Engines.</p>
                        <p>He that ſhould curiouſly ſurvey
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100919:97"/>
the Monaſteries of theſe good Fathers, would find ſome of them worth above 100000 Crowns, and ſome of them above 120000. and I have told you how you may gueſs at their ways of getting ſo much. So that I dare aſſure you not one of them hath found the Philoſophers Stone, though many have taken great pains in ſeeking it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes they make a very remarkable begging, <hi>viz.</hi> of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Coats and Gowns, to cloath their Altars. I have ſeen in divers places Gentlewomens Damask Coats ſerve to cover Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who (they ſay) is in the Sacrament. But it is a very uncivil charity to uncover the back-ſides of Women, to cover Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. V. <hi>The Viſitations of their Provincials.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IT is the duty of Provincials to viſit the Monaſteries of their Provinces at leaſt once a year. The Provincial gives notice eight days before his arrival at any Monaſtery. At his entrance the Porter gives an extraordinary Signal to aſſemble all the Fryars in the room, where the common fire is kept, whither the Prelate goes. Being ſure every one kiſſeth his hand kneeling, and ſome kiſs his feet; and then having kiſt the ground in his preſence, they prepare to treat him.</p>
                        <p>The Officers having their Sleeves turned up to the elbow, begin with his ſhoulders, which they rub with warm linnen cloths. If he ſweats, they rub him over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, and then apply two large warm napkins to his body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100919:98"/>
After this they waſh his feet with Roſes, and other ſweet flowers and herbs; and when they are well ſoakt, they wipe them with warm Napkins, which are employed about him by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. They that waſh his feet do it bare-headed on their knees; and when they have done, each of them kiſſeth one of his feet, and hold them until the reſt of the Fryars have kiſt them; then they conduct him to the fire whilſt they do the like (though ſomewhat more ſlightly) to his two companions.</p>
                        <p>The Steward is there attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preſents him with Bread and Wine; and having warmed himſelf, he is conducted to a Chamber, where he lies down on a bed. Perfumes of divers ſorts are there ſmoaking, heaps of flowers lye on the table, or on the flowr, and great Noſe-gays recreate his eyes, and ſo we leave him to repoſe himſelf for a while.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100919:98"/>
When he hath taken his reſt for an hour, they bring up his meat; if they have any good bit, it is for the Father Provincial. I have counted ſometimes a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen diſhes before him, and three bottles of Wine, each of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſort. His companions are ſerved with as many diſhes; for each of them eats apart, though they ſit at the ſame Table. The ſecond courſe is not omitted; Cakes, Tarts, and Cream, are ſerved up one after the other. They end their Meals with Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their Stomach.</p>
                        <p>Having ended his repaſt, he takes a walk with the Superiour of the Monaſtery; who on this occaſion, gives either good or bad characters of his Subjects, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the condition of his affairs, and the order which he pretends is eſtabliſhed in his Monaſtery.</p>
                        <p>The next day the Provincial cauſeth five blows to be given
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100919:99"/>
on the broken Pick-Axe, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Fryars in the Dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room; where, being arrived, he ſignifies the occaſion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in a kind of Sermon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to Abſtinence, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and Auſterity of life; and appoints to every one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, a time of coming to him at his Chamber. And this they call the Viſitation.</p>
                        <p>The Viſitation is thus; They all go one after the other, and carry to the Provincial their whole equipage, <hi>viz.</hi> Whip, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary, Rule, Chaplet, Croſs, Reliques, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being come to the door of the Chamber, they take off their Cloaks, and go in bare-foot. As ſoon as they enter, they kiſs the ground, and ſtay there bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed on their knees, whilſt this Prelate lies ſtretcht on a Couch, or ſits leaning on a Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He examines him that enters; firſt, concerning his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100919:99"/>
buſineſſes, and then concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affairs of the Monaſtery. Whereupon letting looſe their nature, they accuſe each other with much paſſion. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial writes all down in his Table-book, and having made the ſign of the Croſs with his thumb, on the forehead of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, he diſmiſſeth him for that time.</p>
                        <p>When they have all, thus made, their appearance, he aſſigns a convenient hour to return to the Dining-room to make his Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. His Text is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſutable to the complaints he hath received; which he ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grevates and exhorts them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; and having ended his diſcourſe, he ſays aloud, <hi>Confeſs your faults.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At which words they all leave their places, and putting off their Cloaks, fall on their knees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing themſelves as before. Then he repreſents to each one his faults in particular, and enjoyns them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100919:100"/>
Penances. Some he enjoyns to whip themſelves thrice, ſome twice, and ſome once. Such a one is to faſt three <hi>Fridays</hi> with bread and water; and another to kiſs the feet of all the Fryars. All that are Prieſts, he enjoyns to ſay a Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Clerks to ſay a Chaplet of our Lady at his intention.</p>
                        <p>If any one hath offended in a reſerved caſe, he muſt declare it to the Provincial; if any one hath committed an extraordinary crime, he is caſt into Priſon by way of Proviſion, until a decree paſs againſt him in the next Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſſembly.</p>
                        <p>Having all thus accuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and received their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they ſay their <hi>Conſiteor.</hi> After which, this Prelate puts on his Spectacles, takes a Book in his hand, and pronounceth with a loud voice (by the power, which he ſaith, he hath received from the Pope) the remiſſion of all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100919:100"/>
caſes reſerved; and not reſerved of all cenſures, excommunications, ſuſpentions, interducts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he diſpoſeth himſelf for his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; after which, he departs for another Monaſtery. This is the important employment of this great Father throughout the year, ſome few days excepted in the depth of Winter.</p>
                        <p>At his departure from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, they all attend him on their knees at the gate, where, at his coming, they preſent him with the Holy water; which he ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles on their faces; and then having all kiſt the ground, he bids them farewel.</p>
                        <p>This Prelate hath commonly two companions, whereof one ſerves him as a Secretary (but is called his fellow Counſellour) the other carries his Baggage; and this hath four Pouches or Pockets in this Cloak, and one in each Sleeve; wherein he carries the Provincials Records with ſome
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100919:101"/>
pieces of fine <hi>Serge</hi> to be applyed to his body, if he ſhould be cold; and fine <hi>Linnen</hi> to wipe him, if he ſhould ſweat; ſome Ten bottles of Wine (whereof one of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine) to prevent Faintneſs; and ſome Bread; and roaſted Fowls, which are given him to fortifie him in his journey.</p>
                        <p>A certain Provincial being once in the Country on a Feſtival day, had the devotion to ſay Maſs, and the Fryar hath carried the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, laying down his Cloak, partly out of reverence, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eaſe himſelf. Whilſt he was thus communicating (as they do every Holiday) a Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound-bitch drew a roaſted leg of Mutton out of one of the Pockets, and carried it away in her mouth, throw the middeſt of the people; who till then never knew that the <hi>Capucins</hi> had made a Cupboard of his Cloak. I leave you to judge whether this poor
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100919:101"/>
Fryar did not communicate with diſtraction.</p>

                        <p>THE moſt perfect man upon earth is ſubject to failings; and ſin deſerves puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: wherefore theſe good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (beſides the afore-mentioned Penances) have their Priſons like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to chaſtiſe Delinquents.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Priſons are of two ſorts, ſome are high, and ſome low. The high Priſons are Chambers with Grated windows, and pad-lockt-doors, not differing from other Chambers.</p>
                        <p>The low Priſons are 'twixt four ſtrong walls, garniſhed with pieces of wood; the light comes in, only through a high ſmall grated window, out of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100919:102"/>
reach. All their houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff is a Straw-bed, and a Straw-cover for the Privy.</p>
                        <p>Some are there five years, ſome four, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their crime. But ſuch Priſons moſt commonly ſerve only for thoſe that run away from the Monaſtery, whom they call Apoſtates; whether they return voluntarily, or are taken by force.</p>
                        <p>Some years ſince they took a poor wretch that had run away from the Monaſtery; and having bound him, they put him naked into a bundle made of Straw; and were carrying him from <hi>Picardy</hi> to <hi>Paris;</hi> but he eſcaped at <hi>Amiens,</hi> and ran into a Court of guard, where having taken him, they again put him into Priſon, where he fell diſtracted, and ſo dyed.</p>
                        <p>I knew one condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Impriſonment; he had a chain about his middle, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles on his hands. He had no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100919:102"/>
other bed, than the block to which he was chained; neither had he any food, ſave bread and water thrice a week; but the truth is, his crime deſerved death.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Priſoners come not out till the time be expired; they hear Maſs through a hole at the door, and never ſpeak without leave; they communicate at a little window. The knife which is given them at their meals is broken: they have no other Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the floor, except they will eat on the ſeat of the Privy. They have no Hood to their Habit, but are allowed ſuch a one to cover their head, as the people of <hi>Bearn</hi> wear; and for a Girdle, a very weak liſt of cloth, for fear, leaſt if they had their cord, ſome inconvenience might happen.</p>
                        <p>To theſe Impriſonments, ſome other Penances are added, <hi>viz.</hi> Some are let out <hi>Fridays</hi> to whip themſelves publickly; others have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100919:103"/>
their bread and drink by meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any one ſtrikes his Gaoler, they ſtrip him, and whip him with a witneſs.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Priſons ſerve not only for Criminals, but alſo for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Perſons, who are whipt often to bring them to their ſenſes. On a certain time, one of theſe Mad Men being got out of his Dungeon, went ſtrait to the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, where one was to Preach; and ſitting with his naked breech on the edge of the Pulpit, threw himſelf down; and falling on a Gentlewoman, had like to have broken her neck. This hapned upon one of their moſt ſolemn Feſtival days.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>The Recreations of the</hi> Capucins.</head>
                        <p>THere is no cord but will break, if it continues too long ſtretcht; and therefore theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers let themſelves looſe thrice a year, to prepare for the auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Lent.</p>
                        <p>Before any Lent begins (for they have three or four in the year) they have eight days at each time, which they call days of Recreation. This Recreation begins with good cheer, their table being better furniſht than at other times. Veal and Mutton are then too hard to be digeſted; Turkies, Capons, Hares, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, Pullets, Pigeons, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, Larks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are there to be found according to the ſeaſon. I have often ſeen a Pullet, a Pye, a Tart, and ſome Sugar'd Fritters at each mans Trencher. On Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100919:104"/>
they have Oyſters in the ſhell to whet their Stomachs, nor is there any lack of the beſt Wines. Sometimes they have had ſuch exceſs of Proviſion, that they have been forced to throw away many Plates of it, to fatten the root of a Tree, inſtead of giving it to the Poor; for this Charity would be accounted ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous amongſt them; and would make thoſe that ſhould hear of it, think they had too much plenty, and conſequently it would make their Benefactors hold their hands.</p>
                        <p>In theſe days there is no read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every one talks freely at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they drink one to another; they break jeſts round the Table; they have their Marrow-bones, make <hi>Salmigondies</hi> dreſs the Hares head <hi>A la mode;</hi> they drink <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculum,</hi> and ſometimes have a merry Song with it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes after their Meals, they act the <hi>Jack-Pudding,</hi> ſhew
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100919:104"/>
                           <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> and <hi>Judgling Tricks;</hi> and do all the reſt mentioned by Mr. <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> in his 15 Chapter; To which I add, that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſguiſe themſelves like Court-beggers, acting all ſorts of poſtures. Sometimes ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are turned into Tragedies; but they that act them being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the next day, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and publick Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall not mention parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but leave them in the rank of ſins pardoned.</p>
                        <p>After theſe Divertiſements, the Signal is given for the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace, and then they omit nothing which they can invent to make themſelves merry, <hi>viz.</hi> Ther's your Choire of Muſick, and the moſt delicate Court-airs Sung. Here they are Playing at Draughts, and Cheſs; at another place they are Fencing. Some play at Hop-Frog, ſome ſhew Tumblers-Tricks; ſome go a Mumming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they that are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100919:105"/>
of a cold conſtitution, ſit by the fire chearing their hearts with good Wine. In a word, there is not ſo much noiſe in any Tavern in <hi>France,</hi> as in theſe Monaſteries, at ſuch times of Recreation.</p>
                        <p>It is obſervable, that on <hi>All-Saints</hi> day, when the <hi>Vigiles</hi> for the dead are over, whilſt others are every where weeping; and cauſe the Bells to be Rung, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be made for their Deceaſed Kinsfolk. The <hi>Capucins</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in theſe Recreations, ſo that, who can imagine they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrine of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory?</p>
                        <p>In their Recreations on <hi>Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-eve</hi> (which they call the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany)</hi> they divide a Cake, and he to whoſe lot the Bean falls, is King. His quality makes him ſit by the Superiour; and then he is crowned with a Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Crown, which they put on the top of his Hood. After that he creates his ſeveral Officers, not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100919:105"/>
omiting his Fool; and every time he drinks, they ſing muſically, <hi>the King drinks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Leagues are ſometimes made againſt theſe Kings, which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their State and the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery. Sometimes their moſt generous Souldiers have been up to the ears in Fire; witneſs, that brisk Lay-Fryar, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to throw a Squib over a door, let fall his Candle into a diſh of powder that he had in his hand, which ſinged his Beard and his Chops, and made him in this burning heat, leap into the Fountain, crying out with open mouth, <hi>Sancte Fælix ora pro nobis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this Prayer did not keep his face from being plaiſter'd up for above a fortnight, in ſuch ſort, he could not breath but through a reed, or quill.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not mention their Dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100919:106"/>
with Songs, (as the Song <hi>(My little Brown Miſtreſs you kill me, &amp;c.</hi> ſeeing they are prohibited; but ſome Balls are not diſliked, when any lovers of Balls are in the Monaſtery.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall content my ſelf with what hath been ſaid, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the ſecret practices of the <hi>Capucins;</hi> and I have not done this with a deſign to offend them, but only to put a ſtop to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe that would make them paſs for Angels, and not for Men. However, I declare that of all the Monks of the Romiſh Church, theſe are the moſt honeſt and civil, and of the beſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now if their zeal deſerves reproach, 'tis becauſe it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge. If they exceed in their Recreations, 'tis becauſe they have them but ſeldom, and therefore they ſtudy to make uſe of their time of mirth, whilſt they have it. I pray God illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100919:106"/>
their minds with his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (by bringing them out of that darkneſs, into which their birth, and the opinion of their imaginary Holineſs hath plagued them) and tranſlate them into his marvelous light.</p>
