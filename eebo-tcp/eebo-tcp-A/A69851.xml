         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wherein you may diſcern a Diſcovery of a

goe forth from us, in rejecting the ſtroake of the
pure judgements of God, through the working

which he hath made all (that hath kept their habitations in the powerfull
life of the firſt Love) to ſtand as Saviours upon Mount Sion, to gather the
ſcattered of Iſrael, and to bring again the diſperſed of Jacob: And this

his praiſe and glory, and the comfort of his heritage for ever: therefore do
they ſhine as the Stars in the firmament of heaven, in turning many ſouls
to righteouſneſſe, in which they enter into the heavenly habitation of the
moſt high God; where it is known, the Lord to be one, and his name one, &amp;
there alone ſtands the union of all the flock of the Companions, who have
been truly baptized and buried with Chriſt in his death, where we could not
cover our naked ſouls with a Fig-leaf garment of our own works, or with
any ſelf-created geſture, or poſture of the outward man, but in true obedience

in eternall unity bear our teſtimony to all the world in the light of his
Covenant, ſitting and feeding together at his Table, cloathed with the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Garment, where there never was, nor ever ſhall be any rent, but eternal

ſearch your own hearts with the light, and in it know your own eſtates,

demonſtrating to you in full aſſurance, that you walk with him, in true
ſelf-deniall, according to your meaſures in uprightneſſe of heart with all the
flock of the Companions, as before written, then will the Lord give you a
ſound and perfect judgement, to weigh and try all ſpirits, and taſt the

upon any, what ever they pretend, but in that which tries and weighs your

they are on that comes amongſt you in this day, wherein many comes forth
with us as to the owning of the truth in their judgements, and regulates
the outward man in ſome outward geſtures like to the children of the truth;
and ſome have felt the ſtroak of the judgement of the Lord, which hath

bring their gift to the Altar, in the humble meek ſpirit which gathers into

pretend zeale and obedience to God, in what they doe; they being gone
from the light, they neither regard the glory of God, nor the good of his
people; for all that they now doe, is wrought in a ſelf-ſerving ſpirit, where
they enter into, the myſterious working of the deceit of their hearts, to ſet
up, and cover themſelves with a voluntary humility, and feigned love, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
all the eloquent and inticing words of mans wiſedome, with which

God hath raiſed up to keep their habitation, and to ſtand unmovable upon

wicked proceedings, and to lay them open, that they be ſuch as intrude into
a Miniſtry, and runs when God never ſent them, therefore they doe not
profit the people at all, for they go not in at the Door, which is the light to
be led in conformity to Chriſt in his ſuffering and Death, ſo come they to
be ignorant of the ſaving gathering word of eternal life, becauſe they in
ſelf-ſtrivings climb up over the true judgement of God, and in pride and
fleſhly wiſedome pretends to enjoyments of high things, in a ſelf-boaſting

Myſtery of Iniquity (as before written) it cannot live but in ſingularity

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39448:3"/>
to have drawn &amp; ſeparated him from that ſpirit which gave forth the paper
that propagated the keeping on the Hat in prayer, and reflected judgment
upon thoſe that called upon the name of the Lord with their heads unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
but after much counſelling of him in tender love, to have ſtopt that
paper from going abroad; but he would not be ſeparated from that ſpirit
that gave it forth. Then I cleared my conſcience in the word of the Lord,
which now (in my freedome in God) I declare to the children of Sion, what
the eternal judgement was, that did ariſe in my heart, in words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<hi>John,</hi> if thou propagate what thou haſt written in this paper, thou wilt
wound more hearts, and cauſe more trouble of ſpirit amongſt the tender
hearted people of the Lord, then when the temptation entred dear <hi>J. N.</hi>
who deeply ſuffered, but the Lord reſtored him again by true repentance:
And as to my particular, it is not my nature to be found ſtriving with thee,
or any upon the earth; but having declared the truth to thee, I will return
to my reſt in the Lord, and let every birth live the length of its day, and
time manifeſt what is born of God; for that ſpirit that ſtands up in ſelf-ſtriving,
will weary it ſelf, and die, and end in the earth. And this will
certainly come to paſſe upon all that doth not diligently wait in the light,
to judge the out-goings of their minds, and to be led in true ſelf-denial,
which is the footſteps, where the flocks of the Companions delights to
walk, every one ſerving one another in love, ſeeking to reſtore one another
with the ſpirit of love and meekneſſe, forth of what any have done, through
the violence of temptation or weakneſſe.</p>
            <p>Oh! dear friends, feel the yearning bowels of the Lord through me to
you all, in which I beſeech you, that what hath come ſo paſſe in this day of
great tryal, and hour of temptation, you may all (in dear love to the Lord
of life) return to his light, to feel his power reſtoring into a true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
with him to walk, in true ſelf denial, where you will feel his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
filling your hearts, and binding you up in eternal unity of the Spirit
and bond of peace; every one forgetting all things that is behind, and not
anyone ſtand up in ſelf ſtriving, but in the tender brotherly love informing
the Judgements of one another in the light and power of the endleſſe life,
and in it ſubmit to the low eſtate of one another, ſerving one another in
love, which is the waſhing one anothers feet, and here is Chriſt and his
Diſciples in eternal unity, and powerful Dominion, againſt whom, every
tongue lifted up ſhall fall in Judgement, and every weapon formed ſhall
not proſper, but come to naught, for the Mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall

which truely buryes ſelfe in the death, and hath raiſed you up, and ſent
you forth in the reſurrection and power of the endleſſe life, which ſeeketh
not any thing, but to glorifie the Lord in all your travails, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
where ever the Lord calls you.</p>

whoſe care and burdens, labours and travels is known to the Lord and
your reward is with him for ever; Dear Brethren, though great be the
wrath that withſtands the work of our God, which wrath worketh openly
and myſteriouſly to lay burdens upon the innocent, and to adde affliction
unto the afflicted. In the word of the Lord that arriſeth in my heart, I
declare they ſhall but weary themſelves, and all their hopes ſhall fail them,
and their expectations ſhall come to nought, who wait for evil concerning
you who love the Lord better then your lives, and delights to wait to feel
his power at all times, leading and ordering in the limits and bonds of the
ſpirit of the Lord, &amp;c. I know there is of you my brethren, that need not
be written unto in lines of this nature, but to all who hath, or may have
their mouthes opened in the true motion of the Spirit of God, and hath
