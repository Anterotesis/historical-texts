            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>March</hi> 15.1654.</date> by Col.<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nton Crokes</hi> Troop of Horſe.</head>
            <head type="sub">And the true ſtate of the pretended Articles of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Penruddock,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>Penruddock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Grove,</hi> with the Commander in Chief and others, had taken up their Quarters at the Falcon Inne, and about ten a clock at night the Collonel poſſeſſed the Town with his Forces, and divided his Souldiers to ſeverall ſtations, and with a party aflaulted the Falcon Inne, where for a time a hot diſpute was made, from the Houſe, but at length they ſallyed forth and skumiſhed, and cryed Quarter, and ſome were hurt, and Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> was taken priſoner, and others endeavoured to eſcape, and afterwards Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> upon ſearch in the houſe was taken Priſoner, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Priſoner to the Guard, the Collonel all this while not ſpeaking with them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, the Col. being buſie in reducing the Forces in the <hi>George</hi> Inne, word being brought unto him, that Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Col. ſent for him from the Guard, and told him that hee heard that hee was a Commander, and wiſhed him to uſe his power with them in the <hi>George,</hi> to yeeld without effuſion of any more blood, telling him, that if they would yeeld, hee would give them Quarter, and intercede to the Protector for their lives.</p>
            <p>And ſoon after, the Collonel and Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> went to the <hi>George</hi> Inne, where all that Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> could ſay or do, prevailed nothing, they within reviling him, telling him hee had betrayed them, and ſaid that they abhorred his motion, and fired upon him for a farewell.</p>
            <p>The Col. afterwards proceeded by force to the reducement of the Inne, and ſent to the Mayor of the Town for his aſſiſtance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try the utmoſt extremity by fire and Sword: And all things were prepared and ready for execution, and they from the houſe diſcharged a volley of ſhot, which did ſome execution, Mr. Mayor being ſhot in the buttocks, and went home. And this was all that came upon Mr. <hi>Penruddocks</hi> endeavours.</p>
            <p>After ſome farther procedure, made by the Col. They in the <hi>George</hi> Inne being reduced to all extremity, they in the Inne deſired a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and that granted, they deſired Life, Liberty and Eſtate, and to keep their monies. The Col. anſwered, that thoſe conditions were Paramount his power, but that if they would immediately yeeld themſelves priſoners, and come forth in the ſtreet, he would ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to the Protector, that they ſhould not bee injured by any power under Heaven, either in Life, Liberty or Eſtate. Here were the only conditions, and made with thoſe in the <hi>George</hi> Inne only, nothing at all relating to Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> or Mr. <hi>Grove,</hi> who were priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners long before.</p>
            <p>Hereupon 5. perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wake,</hi> two of the Mr. <hi>Colliers,</hi> and two others came out of the <hi>George</hi> to the Col. and undertooke that 28. men horſe and armes would immediately follow them, and ſo many in the <hi>George</hi> ſhould be delivered up; and the Col. appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of his own men to take an account of the men at the door the 5. perſons only came forth, the reſt came not to the Col. to the door, but took an opportunity, and eſcaped out at the back doores: or hid themſelves in hay mowes or other places.</p>
            <p>The Collonel thus abuſed, and ſo free of all treaty; and yet conceiving and finding thoſe 5. perſons to bee men of worth and valour, would not take any advantage againſt them; but continued his reſolution to intercede to the Protector for them, which hee did as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually as hee could, and ſaved their Lives and Eſtates, although they were condemned unto death, the Col. uſing his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have had them ſet at Liberty alſo, but could not prevail, although his Importunities were great and many on their behalf, as is evident and known.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> heard of this ſucceſs at the <hi>George</hi> Inne, and that the Collonel had promiſed to intercede for the Lives of thoſe 5. Gentlemen: Hee told the Col. that hee ought to be included, becauſe hee had uſed his endeavour to reduce them, although it took no effect. The Col. replied, that there were no Articles given, only a promiſe to intercede for thoſe 5 perſons, and that as for the reſt in the Inne after the ſaid 5 perſons came out, they would not ſtay the reſult, but had made their eſcape, and left the ſaid 5 perſons to mercy.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> inſiſted ſtill, to have had formal Articles made in writing, for his own advantage, after hee was a Priſoner, never pretending to any before, or to any afterwards, but for uſing his endeavour to perſwade the ſaid ſurrender, which took no effect. And yet the Col. uſed all the means hee could to have ſaved his Life alſo as a Gent. of great hopes and fortune. But could never bee drawne by him to betray his truſt, though tempted with 500. <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. then with a 1000. <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. then with his whole Eſtate, too mean conſiderations to weigh down truth and honeſty.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been by ſome alleaged, that the Collonel ſhould ſay, to ſome of the Priſoners, that if their General <hi>Wagſtaffe</hi> had been there, hee ſhould have been uſed as they were, but that now hee was likely to fare worſe. It was ſpoken only to this purpoſe, that had hee been with them, hee ſhould have had air Quarter as a ſouldier, but being eſcaped, hee might bee abuſed, or miſcarry by other hands.</p>
            <p>And whereas alſo it hath been reported, that the Protector ſhould ſay; that had the Col. gave Articles, hee would have allowed them; The Protector never ſaid any ſuch thing to the Col. but on the contrary, wrote under his hand, that hee would not ſpare Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> upon any conſideration whatſoever, But a ful diſcovery of the whole deſign.</p>
            <p>Theſe things the Col. can make appear, by the intercourſe of Letters betwixt the Protector, Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> and himſelf, and by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient witneſſes, and Appeals to the Honorable Lords, whether theſe Interloquatory paſſages in <hi>furore belli,</hi> and dark night, can in the leaſt amount to Articles, or whether upon theſe ſurmiſes, the Col. ought in the leaſt to bee clouded or blemiſhed; Hee proteſting in the ſight of God, that he never ſigned or ſealed any Articles whatſoever, or ever made any promiſe, than as to thoſe 5. perſons as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p rend="indent">A more full and exact account of all that paſſed, hee hopes ſhortly to preſent to the view of the world, for the full cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his injured innocence, if hee may bee ſo permitted to do.</p>
