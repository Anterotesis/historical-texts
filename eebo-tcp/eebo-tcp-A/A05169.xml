            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>PSAL. 74. 22.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>Arise, O God <hi>(plead or)</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thine own Cause: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how the foolish man <hi>(repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth or)</hi> blasphemeth thee daily.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>THis Psalme</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the waste that was made vpon the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Temple</hi> that was in it. And these goe together. For when did any Man see a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> or a great <hi>Citie</hi> wasted, and the <hi>Mother Church</hi> left stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in beauty? sure I think neuer. For <hi>Enemies</hi> when they haue possessed a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3026:3"/>
seldome thinke themselues <hi>Masters</hi> of their owne possessions, till they haue (as they thinke) plucked that God out of his House, which defended the citty. As you may see in that bragge of the Heathen in <note n="*" place="margin">In Octau. Indaeorum Deum suisse Rom. numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus vna cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gente Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuum.</note> 
               <hi>Minu. Foelix.</hi> And so 'twas heere. <hi>The Enemies roared in the Citty, and displayed their Banners, verse 5.</hi> And then <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> by and by followes <hi>the defiling of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Place. Downe goes the carued worke with Axes and Hammers, and Fire on the rest, verse 6.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A prophanation vpon the <hi>Temple,</hi> and vpon all the <hi>Rights of Religion</hi> there was. All agree vpon that. But it was yet but in <hi>Prophecie,</hi> not come. And the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned which liued after, and looked backe vpon the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the <hi>accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it, are not agreed. For some say, the <hi>Text</hi> refers to the first great desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Nebuchadonozor;</hi> some, to the last by <hi>Titus:</hi> some, to that which came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi> and some indefinitly to <hi>all.</hi> The best is you cannot referre the <hi>Text</hi> amisse. For ineuery of


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3026:3"/>
these, the <hi>Cittie</hi> and the <hi>Temple;</hi> the <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> were threatned alike. And I for my part see no great reason yet, why the <hi>Prophet</hi> should not meane <hi>all,</hi> since certaine it is both State and Church did suffer in <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalme</hi> as in the <hi>Letter</hi> it lookes backe vpon the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> so in the <hi>Figure</hi> it lookes forward vpon the whole course of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> entertained in any <hi>State:</hi> For if the <hi>State</hi> come to suffer 'tis madnesse to thinke the <hi>Church</hi> can be free. And therefore this Psalme certainely was penned to be <hi>Documentum perpetuum</hi> an euerlasting document to the Church of Christ, to labour and pray for the safety of the <hi>State;</hi> Because if any violence threaten the Kingdome with <hi>Wast,</hi> it must needs at once threaten the Church with both <hi>Prophanation</hi> and <hi>Persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well: This danger is vsually threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before it come. And so 'twas heere. But vpon that threatning what remedy


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3026:4"/>
hath the <hi>State?</hi> What? why <hi>wisely</hi> to fore-see, <hi>carefully</hi> to prouide against, and <hi>vnanimously</hi> and <hi>stoutly</hi> to resist the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence and the violence of the <hi>Enemie.</hi> And to this work euery <hi>Subject</hi> is bound by all <hi>Law,</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Nations,</hi> to put hand, and meanes, life and liuely-hood. But what remedy hath the <hi>Church?</hi> What? Why a <hi>Remedy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all this. <hi>Maiora arma</hi> as Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hom. 14. in Ep. ad Hebr.</note> calls them, greater, sharper wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. For <hi>fore-sight,</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> and <hi>vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,</hi> and <hi>courage,</hi> sometimes come all too short. For all these may dwell in greater proportion in the <hi>Enemies Camp.</hi> Whither goes the <hi>Church</hi> then? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Why doubtlesse to God. For when all things else faile, <hi>The helpe that is done vpon Earth, hee doth it himselfe, verse 13.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To God; and to God by Prayer. That's the <hi>Church way.</hi> And the Church way is <hi>Via Regia</hi> the Kings way (as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan:</hi> calls it). <hi>The Prophet</hi> heere is all <note place="margin">Haeres. 59.</note> vpon this way. For heere in the <hi>Psalme</hi>


               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3026:4"/>
is a Noyse of Enemies comming. There's a Prophecy what they will doe if they get the better. What doth the <hi>Church?</hi> Doth shee stay till the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be come? No sure. 'Tis no <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> in the <hi>State;</hi> 'Tis no <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> to doe so. No: nor did the Church so heere. <hi>But shee called to minde what strange things God had done of old for his Seruants, verse 14.</hi> Vpon that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> shee grounds her confidence; That vpon the same <hi>Repentance,</hi> she shall haue the like <hi>deliuer ance.</hi> And vpon this Faith and hope shee repents and prayes, <hi>verse 20.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Text</hi> is the conclusion of this Prayer: And it hath two parts. The one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is the <hi>Inuocation,</hi> That God would bestur himselfe. <hi>Arise O God.</hi> The other is what the <hi>Prophet</hi> would haue him doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when hee is <hi>Risen:</hi> And they are two things which he doth expresly desire of him. The one is that he would pleade and maintaine his owne cause. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that hee would remember how the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>


               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3026:5"/>
foolish man reproaches, or blasphemes him daily. <hi>Arise O God, maintaine thine owne cause: Remember how the foolish man blasphemeth thee daily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> it selfe is all as it begins <hi>a Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must needs fit the work of the day; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For that <hi>Proclaimes</hi> for <hi>Prayer.</hi> No time is or can be vnfit to call vpon God; But <hi>such Times as this</hi> are necessary. And there cannot more well bee said, <hi>then such Times as this.</hi> The <hi>Prophet Dauid</hi> where he points out opportunity for <hi>Prayer</hi> goes not so farre. <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, so will I heare thee, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15.</note> 
               <hi>thou shalt glorifie me, Psal.</hi> 50. There 'twas but the <hi>day of Trouble.</hi> But <hi>these Times,</hi> might I bee bold to put them vnder their iust character, for difficulties both at home, and abroad, are more then the <hi>day of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, beside that they haue made vp a long <hi>Day of Trouble</hi> alreadie: <hi>These Times</hi> are the very concurse of <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Danger.</hi> The <hi>Clowdes</hi> haue threatned

from heauen now many daies together, to destroy a hopefull and a plentifull <hi>Haruest in the Day of Possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> As the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> speakes, <hi>Esay</hi> 17. The <hi>Pestilence</hi> as <note place="margin">Esa. 17. 11.</note> if it were angry that God had driuen it out of <hi>this great Cittie of the Kingdome,</hi> wastes and destroyes farre and neere in other places of it. The <hi>Sword</hi> of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Enemie threatens to make way for it selfe: And if it enter, 'tis worse then <hi>Famin</hi> and the <hi>Pestilence.</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> calls it a <hi>Rasor, Esay</hi> 7. But such as is red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <note place="margin">Esa. 7. 20.</note> to cut the <hi>Throat,</hi> then shaue the <hi>Beard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can yee tell where to sue out reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against these, but at God? Perhaps you may think vpon <hi>second and subordinate Helpes;</hi> And 'tis fit yee should: For these are simply necessary too. And 'tis Gods great blessing vpon the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that to meete with the <hi>Distractions of the Time,</hi> hee hath placed ouer vs in the <hi>Throne, a wise, a stout, a vigilant, and a most prouident King.</hi> Well: But can you alwaies haue these <hi>second helpes</hi> at hand?


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3026:6"/>
Can you alwaies by them effect your end? Haue you them ready at this time? Haue you the Sinewes that moue them? Tis well if you haue. But I doubt 'tis a great part of the sorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the time that you haue not. And howsoeuer, haue, or haue not, there is a <hi>commanding power</hi> both ouer you and these. And therefore this is a time for <hi>Humiliation vnder that power,</hi> that hee which <hi>giues Grace to the Humble, would resist the Pride of our Enemies: S. Iaco.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">S. Iacob. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I need not presse this any further. <hi>The necessity of these Times</hi> speakes out. Tis past <hi>whispering</hi> now that this is <hi>a day of Trouble. Of Trouble:</hi> therefore it ought to be a day <hi>of Prayer,</hi> humble and deuout prayer, which may <hi>Out-Cry</hi> our sinnes to God. And as it ought to be, so <hi>Authority</hi> in a most religious hand commands it. And a powerfull <hi>Edict</hi> hath made that duty publique, which else perhaps would haue beene, as much neglected in the priuate, as the <hi>time it selfe</hi> and the <hi>danger</hi> both haue beene.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3026:6"/>
Will ye say: vvee see by the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that God is angry vvith vs? vvill ye adde to this? If he be angry, he vvill not succour vs; no nor regard the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are made for succour? Well, suppose this: yet <hi>Prayer</hi> is necessarie, and the ready way to bring God into the <hi>Battell</hi> on our side. Will ye see how? First, God giues <hi>Grace:</hi> In the strength of <hi>Grace</hi> do you <hi>repent,</hi> and God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue angrie.

The <hi>Prayer</hi> is <hi>Exurge Deus,</hi> Arise, O God.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Baall</hi> had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long and were not heard, <hi>Elias</hi> bid them cry lowder: Their God was <hi>asleep,</hi> and must be awaked, ere he could help them. 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. <hi>Asleepe:</hi> Yes, <hi>dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe.</hi>

            <p>Why but then, if the God of <hi>Israell</hi> doth neither flumber nor sleepe; why doth the <hi>Prophet</hi> call vpon him to arise, and take care of the People? VVhy?

So that while the <hi>Prophet</hi> praies, that God would arise; heer's no signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any <hi>slumber</hi> in God: But tis to to teach vs, that God sometimes in his prouidence ouer vs, is <hi>Dormienti fimilis,</hi> like to a man that sleepes.

Now the <hi>Prophet</hi> pray'd heere in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the name of the <hi>Church</hi> &amp; of the <hi>State.</hi> And the manner of the Praier tells me, both were in danger, great danger: as they must euer bee when God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his mercie, as heere he did. For, Nisi Dominus, <hi>except the Lord keepe the Citie, the watch-man waketh but in vaine, Psal.</hi> 127.

'tis time to call, that God would bee found of vs, and <hi>Arise to succour vs.</hi>

               <hi>sleepe.</hi> And 'tis in vaine for vs to make anie addresse to God, if <hi>Christ</hi> be a sleep and not with vs. For, <hi>the well-pleasing of God is in him, not in vs,</hi> S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.

            <p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:3026:10"/>
Well: wee are safe enough at <hi>Sea</hi> and at <hi>Land,</hi> if wee can but get God to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
               <hi>Arise</hi> on our part. But how shall we be able to do it? How? why neuer dream, (for it is a <hi>Dreame</hi> indeed, and a fond one too) that ye can euer be able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods Grace, to make God yours. But knowe that he hath Grace for you, and giues it, and he is halfe yours alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Hee will <hi>Arise</hi> and bee all yours, if you pray in Graee. But here two things are especially to be taken heed of, if we will haue our <hi>Fasting</hi> and our <hi>Prayers</hi> preuaile. And I doubt we are guiltie of both: and haue taken heed of neither.</p>
            <p>The one is <hi>Pride:</hi> and the worst of it <hi>Rising against God.</hi> For, wee must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not looke that God should <hi>Arise</hi> to helpe vs, if wee <hi>arise</hi> to oppose and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie him. And marke the phrase of Scripture. <hi>God resists the proud, S. Iac.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">S. Iacob. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Resists:</hi> therefore that time which wee would haue God spend to defend vs, our <hi>Pride</hi> forces him to vse to <hi>Resist</hi> vs. And certainely <hi>Rising against God,</hi> and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3026:10"/>
raising our sinnes with vs, euen aboue Mercy, were it possible, is not the way to make God <hi>Arise for vs</hi> but against vs. If we will haue God <hi>Arise, wee must fall lowe on our face before his Footstoole, for hee is Holy, Psal.</hi> 99. And humble our selues as wee haue begun this day, that <note place="margin">Psal. 99. 5.</note> hee which is all <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> may be as <hi>willing,</hi> as we know him <hi>able</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs.</p>
            <p>The other is <hi>Security.</hi> And the worst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> kinde of that too <hi>Security</hi> in and vnder danger. For wee must not looke that God should <hi>Arise</hi> and take care of vs, if wee will sleepe on in <hi>Security,</hi> without care of our selues. And no destruction <hi>so suddaine as that which comes when secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity sings Peace and Safety,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. Nay, <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 3.</note> which is worse, the Apostle there tells vs, that in the time of <hi>security</hi> God threatens it shall come. So <hi>Security</hi> is both a meanes to bring danger, and a disinabling to resist it. And therefore if you will haue God <hi>Arise,</hi> you must <hi>arise</hi> too. <hi>Arise</hi> in soule by deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Arise</hi>

            <p>I know 'tis hard to make you <hi>confesse</hi> that you haue been or are, either <hi>secure</hi> amongst men, or <hi>proud</hi> against God. And I am sorry 'tis so. For the very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of <hi>confession</hi> makes mee doubt you are guilty of both, and so continue. For he was <hi>a wise Man,</hi> that gaue this reason why a man doth not <hi>confesse</hi> his faults, namely, <hi>Quia etiam nunc in illis est;</hi> because he continues in them still. And <note place="margin">Sen.

But if after all this you doe not yet see you haue binne in a dreame, I must craue leaue to thinke you are <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>asleepe</hi> still. Let vs therefore <hi>confesse</hi> and amend these and all our other sins, that haue made God

stand a loose from vs, and then God will <hi>Arise</hi> before we can call him vp.</p>
            <p>This for the <hi>Inuocation.</hi> The second <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> generall part of the <hi>Text</hi> is, What the <hi>Prophet</hi> would haue God doe when he is <hi>Risen.</hi> And they are two things.</p>
            <p>The first is, that God when hee is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> risen <hi>would pleade and maintaine his owne cause.</hi> In which the circumstances are many and important.</p>
            <p>And first I finde acknowledged here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by <hi>the Prophet,</hi> that God hath a <hi>cause</hi> in hand; not alwaies the same, but still a cause; and a cause in continuall agitation among the Sonnes of Men. So 'tis alwaies <hi>Terme</hi> with God; some <hi>cause</hi> still, and a trying. And yet the opinion which some of the <hi>Heathen</hi> had, that God could not worke in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence <note place="margin">Min. Foel. in Octau.</note> ouer vs, but he must be vnquiet and troubled in himselfe, is as weake as false. Christ tels vs otherwise, <hi>S. Ioh. 5.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. Ioh. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, &amp; I worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>(as the Schoole obserues)</hi> though he <note place="margin">Tho. sup. q. 88. A. 1.</note> ceased the Seauenth day from the <hi>work</hi>


               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:3026:12"/>
of the generall Creation of the kinds of things; yet there is another <hi>worke</hi> from which he ceased not. That worke is <hi>in gubernatione Creaturarum,</hi> in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and gouernement of the world. But this <hi>worke of God</hi> is questioned too. For many things in the workes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, many Men, yea and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the best, are a great deale to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with.</p>
            <p>For instance. They would faine know why many wicked Men prosper in the world; And why many vertuous Men suffer? This secret hath exercised the world in all Ages, and the Church euer since it had a being. It put such a stresse vpon the <hi>Prophet,</hi> that it crushed these words out of him. <hi>It is in vaine that I haue clensed my heart and washed my hands in Innocency, Psal. 73. In vaine;</hi> No, <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 12.</note> God forbid. And the <hi>Prophet</hi> corrects his passion after, <hi>verse 16.</hi> In the meane <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> time, heer's the cause of God at triall; And men apt to quarrell that for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice,</hi> which is not <hi>against the Rule,</hi>


               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:3026:12"/>

            </p>
            <p>Againe; They would faine know all the secrets of <hi>Predestination.</hi> But 'tis one of Gods <hi>foundations:</hi> And such a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> as hee hath set a <hi>Seale</hi> vpon it, <hi>2 Tim. 2. The Lord knowes who are his.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> 'Tis very dangerous breaking vp of <hi>Seales,</hi> especially Gods. The <hi>indorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is enough for vs, and very plaine to be read. It followes. <hi>And let euery Man that calls on the name of Christ, depart from Iniquity.</hi> If he doe not that, hee is not Christ's; Let him talke of Predestination while he will. And in these and all other causes of God try them where you will, and how you can; <hi>Dauid</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> agree vpon it: He will be Iustified in his sayings and cleare and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when hee is Iudged, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. &amp; <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Well: <hi>Gods cause</hi> is at triall: But what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> cause of his is it, that's particularly meant in this place? For, if it bee <hi>Gods,</hi>


               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:3026:13"/>
'tis worth the knowing what ere it bee. And no cause of his can be heere, but Men owe it, as well as him, some duty. And therefore necessary to be knowne, that due may be performed vnto it.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Cause of God</hi> meant heere though it bee proposed, as <hi>Causa vna,</hi> one cause, yet 'tis very large, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends many particulars vnder it. Some <hi>directly</hi> concerne God, and some only by <hi>reflex.</hi> But God is so tender of his Iustice and his Honor, that nothing can so much as <hi>touch</hi> vpon him, but 'tis <hi>Gods cause</hi> presently: <hi>In as much as yee haue done it, or not done it, to one of these little ones, you haue done it, or not done it to mee,</hi> S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.

               <hi>Church,</hi> but he would haue <hi>no God.</hi> Nor <hi>rent</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> into <hi>Sects,</hi> but hee would haue <hi>many Gods.</hi> Nor make the <hi>Church base,</hi> but he would <hi>plucke GOD as lowe,</hi> Were God as much in his power as the Church is. And therefore the <hi>Churches Cause,</hi> is <hi>Gods Cause.</hi> And as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells vs, when by <hi>Stephen</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <note place="margin">Lib. 7. Hist. cap. 32.</note> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the state of that Church was much hazarded; it, and the meanes of it, were mightily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by God himselfe.

            </p>
            <p>Now this euer holds true, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Church <hi>suffers</hi> for the name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi> And therefore if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> will haue <hi>their cause Gods,</hi> the <hi>State</hi> must looke their <hi>procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> be iust, and the <hi>Church</hi> must looke their <hi>Deuotions &amp; Actions</hi> be pious.

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: 'Tis <hi>Gods cause,</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> against himselfe, when <hi>Iniustice</hi> that he will not, or <hi>weakenesse</hi> that hee cannot, <hi>Arise</hi> and <hi>Helpe,</hi> are most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, nay <hi>blasphemously</hi> cast vpon him.

               <hi>case</hi> after Christ. For while he raged against the Christians, hee turn'd the contumely vpon God: And charg'd omnipotence with weakenesse. So you see the <hi>Cause of God</hi> what it is, and withall that it is <hi>many</hi> and but <hi>one.</hi> Many in the <hi>circumference</hi> of his creatures, which fill vp the <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Church:</hi> and yet but one in the point of that <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible Center</hi> which is <hi>himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, we haue found <hi>Gods cause</hi> as 'tis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> tumbled vpon the earth: But what is it the <hi>Prophet</hi> would haue God doe to it? What? Why that followes. <hi>Iudica. Pleade</hi> it, <hi>Iudge</hi> it, <hi>Maintaine</hi> it Lord. For the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>State;</hi> For thy <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Seruice;</hi> For thy <hi>selfe</hi> and thine <hi>honours</hi> sake. Thou hast made their cause thine owne, therefore maintaine it, as thou doest thine owne.</p>
            <p>Now this God is neuer wanting to doe, nor neuer will be. So far as <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> make the cause <hi>his,</hi> hee will <hi>Pleade</hi> it first, and <hi>Maintaine</hi> it after. But yet hee doth not this alwaies with a


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3026:16"/>
Iudgement that is visible to vs. Nor with such a one as will make enemies confesse that <hi>Gods maintenance</hi> is on our <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> part. And therefore as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> thinks, these words are not only a <hi>Prayer,</hi> that God would <hi>Arise, and maintaine his cause:</hi> but that he would so plead it, that hee would make the Iustice and Right of it appeare to Enemies and Opposers; and the maintenance euident to friends and defenders of it. So, <hi>maintaine thy Cause,</hi> is as much in effect, as make the world know 'tis thine, and thou wilt maintain it. That from Gods maintenance, the cause may haue safety: And from our hope of maintenance, we may receiue Comfort.</p>
            <p>Why, but why should God <hi>pleade, iudge,</hi> and <hi>maintaine his owne Cause?</hi> Is the Prayer of the <hi>Prophet</hi> iust? Yes no question. For, the <hi>Cause of God</hi> is euer iust, and therefore ought euer to bee <hi>maintained.</hi> Nor is it any partialitie in God to his <hi>owne Cause,</hi> that hee comes to <hi>iudge</hi> it. But he is forced, as it were,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3026:16"/>
to the maintenance of it himselfe, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because some men <hi>will not,</hi> and some men <hi>cannot defend his Cause.</hi> And partly, because it must be iudged at some <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall.</hi> Now there lye many <hi>Appeales</hi> in the cause of God. And all Appeale is to a superiour Court. The highest is Gods. Therefore when <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie</hi> hath done what it can to Gods cause, if his Seruants doe but <hi>Appeale,</hi> as they euer doe; The Cause must in the end reuolue to God himselfe, who alone hath no superiour. Yet his very Enemies need not feare. For he vvill so <hi>plead</hi> and <hi>iudge</hi> his <hi>owne Cause,</hi> that their <hi>owne Consciences</hi> shall tell them his Iudgement's right.</p>
            <p>Now one thing vvhich laies a kinde of Necessitie vpon God to maintaine his own cause, is as I told you, that some Men <hi>will not,</hi> and some men <hi>cannot</hi> maintaine it. I find both these touched in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, they that vvill not. For these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vvords, <hi>Arise, O God, and maintaine thine</hi>


               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3026:17"/>
               <hi>owne Cause,</hi> are a grieuous taxe vpon all them to whom God hath giuen means &amp; ability, yet will not stir to succour his cause. For'tis as if he had said, Men vvil not maintaine thy cause: If thou vvilt haue it defended thou must doe it thy selfe. The <hi>Iewes</hi> it seemes vvere now very guilty of this, else the <hi>Prophet</hi> vvould neuer haue runne vvith that earnestnesse to God. He vvould haue prayed to God had Men bin neuer so vvilling; yes, God forbid else; but had they done their duty, the extremity had not beene fear'd. And marke and tremble at the curse of God which vvas called for vpon some of that People for this sinne, <hi>Iudg 5. Curse yee Meroz, (saith</hi>

And certainely 'tis a great and a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous errour in <hi>any People</hi> as well as in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> and in any age of the world as well as in that; to fast, and pray, and call vpon God to <hi>Arise</hi> and <hi>Maintaine his cause</hi> and their owne ioyn'd vvith it; if in the meane time they vvill put nor hand nor purse to maintaine either <hi>their owne, or Gods.</hi> Their owne in the <hi>State;</hi> Or Gods in the <hi>Church.</hi> These Men perhaps are of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his minde <note place="margin">Tacit.

            <p>Secondly: They that cannot. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>


               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3026:18"/>
these vvords, <hi>Arise, O God, Maintaine thine owne cause,</hi> imply disability in Man, as vvell as malice. For 'tis as if hee had said; Men <hi>cannot</hi> at all times maintaine thy cause. If thou vvilt haue it defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, thou must doe it thy selfe. And this is true of the <hi>strongest</hi> of the Sonnes of Men, if they bee left to themselues. But this, though it puts vs in more feare, yet it makes vs not halfe so guilty. For <hi>Guilt</hi> followes malice more then Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. And our <hi>weakenesse</hi> and <hi>disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is such, that we are not able to hold it vp against so many and great Enemies, <hi>as the cause of God bath.</hi> This was the case of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> He durst not trust to himselfe, and his owne strength against the Hoste of <hi>Assiria.</hi> Therefore to his Prayers he went, 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19. <hi>O Lord our</hi>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:3026:18"/>
But what <hi>Enemies</hi> had the cause of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God then, or hath it at this day, that such earnest prayers vvere then, and are now made, that God would <hi>Arise and maintaine it?</hi> Doe you aske vvhat <hi>Enemies?</hi> I'le tell you; Perhaps I shall not be able to tell you all. But what my <hi>Text</hi> tells me, I'le shew you. First, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Text</hi> tells me, the <hi>Enemies</hi> that came vp against Gods cause were <hi>fierce,</hi> &amp; had got some hope of <hi>Aduantage;</hi> Implyed in this, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were faine to call for maintenance, and supply against them. Next the <hi>Text</hi> tells mee, these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Enemies</hi> were thought too <hi>cunning</hi> &amp; too <hi>strong</hi> for <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom the defence of <hi>Gods Cause</hi> was then committed: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this, that they were faine to flie to <hi>God,</hi> and call him in to his <hi>owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> A signe, that all seconds were too weak. Thirdly, the <hi>Enemies</hi> were <hi>many,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and not like to be <hi>beaten</hi> or <hi>mastered at once.</hi> And that's expressed, <hi>ver. 20. A</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> 
               <hi>multitude of Enemies.</hi> And last of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they vvere as <hi>cruell,</hi> as <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi>


               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:3026:19"/>
For so vvee read, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Where <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> they are called <hi>Roaring Enemies.</hi> A name vvhich euer had some affinitie with the <hi>Diuell,</hi> 1. S. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. So in all <note place="margin">1 S. Pet. 5. 8.</note> likelihood nothing remain'd but to get God to be absent, and then they might easily swallow his <hi>People</hi> and his <hi>Cause</hi> together. To preuent this was the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> praier, and so it is ours this day. For so the <hi>Psalme</hi> begins: <hi>O God</hi> (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how thy cause is streitned) <hi>Wherefore art thou absent from vs so long?</hi> And it ends at <hi>Arise and maintaine thy Cause</hi> against them.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> Praier <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is very considerable too, and a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the Church of Christ. The <hi>Prayer</hi> is, that <hi>God would Arise, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his Cause.</hi> The first thing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet aimes at is the <hi>Cause;</hi> the equity &amp; right that belongs to it, not the respect it had to <hi>Persons.</hi> And this out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is the vvay of <hi>Iustice, to honour the person for the Cause, not to esteeme the cause for the person.</hi> Now men for the most


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3026:19"/>
part goe a crosse way to this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vvhen they vvill come into the way of lustice I cannot tell. For vsually all businesse is sided into parties. 'Tis no matter for the <hi>Cause,</hi> let who will <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> that simply for it selfe. If it make for vs and our party, so farre vvee vvill <hi>maintaine</hi> it; else be it <hi>Gods cause</hi> or whose it vvill, vvhether it sinke or swimme, it shall not trouble vs. And I doubt as the <hi>practise</hi> of too many men is, so is their <hi>Prayer.</hi> For the <hi>Faction</hi> and the <hi>Party</hi> all; not the <hi>cause,</hi> either as 'tis <hi>Gods,</hi> the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> or the <hi>States.</hi> And <hi>parties</hi> are euer <hi>priuate</hi> ends. The <hi>Cause</hi> as 'tis Gods, the Churches, or the Kingdoms is euer common. Euer fit to be made the Obiect of our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this aduantage may heere be had. If euer you may safely preferre the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> before the <hi>cause,</hi> and yet be iust, you may doe it heere. <hi>God</hi> before his <hi>owne cause.</hi> And the Reason is, because God as he can neuer tender an vniust cause to his People, so is he <hi>Iustice</hi> it selfe: And


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3026:20"/>
euer Iuster then any cause of his that is without him. Therefore whatsoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, <hi>Arise, O God, and maintaine thy selfe, and thine owne cause.</hi> Maintaine it euen from <hi>heauen,</hi> ther's no great trust to the <hi>Earth: for that is full of darkenesse and cruell habitations, verse</hi> 21. <note place="margin">Verse 21.</note>

As a <hi>Prophet</hi> he foresaw the danger, and as a <hi>King</hi> he went on directly to the highest remedy. And though <hi>Kings</hi> now are not <hi>Prophets,</hi> yet 'tis a great blessing vpon any Kingdome to haue the King a <hi>Seer</hi> so farre as is possible. To haue him with both eyes open.

this day, I say againe, <hi>Aboue other Nations;</hi> if vve can see our blessing, and be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

            <p>Let not your hearts be troubled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare, <hi>S. Ioh.</hi> 14. Here are two <hi>Kings</hi>

            <p>And men of all sorts, as vvell as <hi>vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Enemies,</hi> had need bee watchfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this sin. For a man may quickly be vvithin the borders of it, before hee be aware; especially, if he be bold and busie vvith the <hi>Cause of God,</hi> as it is reserued and secret in himselfe. For since all <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie</hi> is a <hi>Derogation</hi> of some <hi>Excellencie</hi> chiefly in <hi>God:</hi> the <hi>Schoole</hi> collects and <note place="margin">Tho. 2. 2. q. 13.

But these Enemies, it seems, stuck at no degree of <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> Spared God himselfe no more then his Cause. And vvhat reason can this State or Church haue, to thinke these Enemies, or their like, that spared not God nor his


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3026:22"/>
Cause, vvill if they haue power enough, spare them or theirs.</p>
            <p>But I pray, vvho or vvhat manner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>Enemy</hi> vvas it, that made thus bold vvith God? Who? vvhy, my <hi>Text</hi> answers that too. <hi>Sculous fuit,</hi> it vvas the foolish Man: And you may know so much by his boldnesse. We find, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. There <note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1.</note> was a <hi>Foole</hi> that <hi>blasphemed God.</hi> But 'twas in his heart. Out of his mouth hee durst not let it goe: not once. And this <hi>Foole</hi> was in the same feare at first. For his <hi>Blasphemie kept in his heart, verse 9.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> But now hee was growne impudent, it <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> brake out at his Lippes: For as <hi>S.

            <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> no question knew these Enemies what they were, and that they had other names beside <hi>Fooles.</hi> But hee fits them with their <hi>Name of Merit:</hi> That they deserued, that he giues them. I told you these Enemies vvere cunning, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Enemies.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> pray'd against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as vve doe now against ours. <hi>O my God make them as a wheele, Psal.</hi> 83. And see <note place="margin">Psal. 83. 13.</note> in what a wheele they are: The worst that euer moued. For their <hi>Blasphemy</hi> carries their Wisedome round into <hi>Folly.</hi> And their <hi>Folly</hi> turnes their malice round in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heigher degrees of <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> Thus is this Enemy no sooner a <hi>Blasphemer</hi> but a <hi>Foole:</hi> And no sooner a <hi>Foole,</hi> but a greater <hi>Blasphemer.</hi> So <hi>Blasphemy</hi> is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> vvith <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Ther's the vvheele, both in the sinne, and the punishment.</p>
            <p>And I pray obserue: These <hi>Enemies</hi> that beset Gods Cause at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> vvere a <hi>Nation.</hi> And so some reade heere; Not the <hi>Foolish man,</hi> but the <hi>Foolish People.</hi> And a powerfull Nation they were, were

they <hi>Babilonians, Syrians,</hi> or <hi>Romanes.</hi> And one of them they were. And yet you see the <hi>Prophet</hi> giues them, no other, no better name, then <hi>Foole,</hi> when they violently persecute Gods Cause. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they deserue it. And this Sinne is as able to <hi>Foole</hi> a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Man.</hi> Nay the holy Ghost heere speakes of them as of <hi>one Man.</hi> As if <hi>Blasphemie</hi> could change a whole <hi>Nation</hi> into <hi>one Foole.</hi> And surely, 'tis no hard thing with <hi>God to make the wisedome of the</hi> whole <hi>world Foolishnesse,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. And 'tis <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 20.</note> as easie with him, to confound the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a whole Nation, as of one <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophell.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And see I beseech you how their sins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> continue: Once <hi>a Foole</hi> in this kinde, and an <hi>Enemy</hi> to Gods Cause, and a <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of his Person euer after, without a great deale of mercy. And this is noted in the circumstance <hi>Tota Die,</hi> and <hi>Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> Daily, and all the day long at this <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> And 'tis vsuall this with <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; All the day:</hi> For their Studdie is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it. And <hi>euery day:</hi> For these Enemies were the same in <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> The day of their <hi>preparation:</hi> The day of their <hi>Fight;</hi> &amp; the day of their <hi>Victory.</hi> And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> obserues that this <hi>Blasphemy</hi> grew in the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> continuance. And either it derided God in his Seruants, or it menaced men for seruing God How it flatter'd it self there while against both Man and God, is thus far apparant in the <hi>Text:</hi> That they neuer durst haue bin daily <hi>Blasphemers</hi> against God, if they had not bin <hi>Opinators</hi> at least, that God could neuer haue <hi>maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> &amp; made good his cause against them.</p>
            <p>It is too much to see the cause of God <hi>opposed:</hi> To heare the Name of GOD <hi>Blasphemed,</hi> were it but once: But <hi>all the day long, and euery day</hi> is a Tentation all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most vnsupportable to Christian and religious hearts. Yet this wee must bee Inur'd to heare against <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> himselfe, if wee take not better course then hitherto wee haue done to keepe out the <hi>Enemy</hi> and his <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against this 'twas time for the <hi>Prophet,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>


               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:3026:24"/>
and 'tis time for vs to pray. The <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of an Enemie is a very vrgent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to make Men pray. And the Prayer of the <hi>Prophet</hi> heere, <hi>that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Blasphemer,</hi> was very feruent. For he beginnes this Prayer, at <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Rebuke of the Enemy, verse</hi> 20. And <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> hee ends his Prayer with <hi>Remember the Blasphemy of this Foole, v. 23. Remember and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> 
               <hi>forget it not, verse 24.</hi> This was the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's</hi> Zeale for Gods Cause, and you <note place="margin">Verse 24.</note> may learne by it, that <hi>cold Prayers</hi> are not they which remoue the <hi>Blasphemy</hi> of Enemies. <hi>The Prayers indeed of but one righteous Man doth much, but 'tis when they are feruent, S. Iaco. 5.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. Iaco. 5. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But you vvill say: What needs all this calling vpon God to <hi>Remember?</hi> Is it possible he should forget? not possible <note place="margin">S. Hierom in Thren. 5.</note> certainly. But then as before: Though God <hi>cannot sleepe:</hi> Yet to awaken not him but our poore vnderstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him the Praier was, <hi>Arise, O God.</hi> So heere, though God <hi>cannot forget,</hi> yet because in his prouidence, he somtimes


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3026:25"/>
carries himselfe to our sense and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, <hi>Ad modum obliuiscentis,</hi> as if hee did forget; and threatens that hee will forget; <hi>Obliuione obliuiscar eorum,</hi> Ose. 1. <note place="margin">Ose 1. 6.</note> Forgetting, I will forget them. Therfore heere againe the Prayer runnes after the manner of men: <hi>Arise, O Lord, yes, and Remember too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, but since heer's <hi>Enmity</hi> against the Cause of God, and <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against himselfe, why doth the Prophet aske no more of God, but that he would <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> this? Why? why certainly'tis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there's aboundantly enough of that. He knew if God did <hi>Remember,</hi> he would <hi>punish?</hi> And (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> obserues) <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>hee therefore Remembers, that hee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found in Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeede in Gods Language to <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Remember,</hi> is many times to punish: and <hi>not to Remember,</hi> is to <hi>forgiue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Innocen. 3. <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> L. 2. Mist. Miss. c. 6.</note> sinne. <hi>If thou Lord shouldest be extreame to marke and obserue;</hi> that is, to punish, <hi>What is done amisse, Psal.</hi> 130. And the <note place="margin">Psal. 130. 3.</note> Church hath learn'd not only to speake,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3026:25"/>
but to pray of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> For so the Church praies in the <hi>Letanie:</hi> Not, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish not, but <hi>Remember not Lord our Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Prophets</hi> Praier was home enough, <hi>Remember Lord:</hi> Yes, do but that, and we either haue, or shall haue <hi>enough</hi> and our enemies too. We, I hope of deliuerance and preseruation, and they of punishment.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue heard the <hi>Prophets</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and I hope made your owne, that <hi>God would Arise</hi> and bestir himself. And what he desired God would do, both for State and Church when he was Risen. That is; That hee would <hi>pleade and maintaine his owne Cause.</hi> And <hi>Remember,</hi> that is, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, in his owne time <hi>the Blasphemy of all them, that reproach or detract from it or him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing yet remaines and 'tis fit to be thought vpon this day, euerie daie, all the day long. And that is, what it is that makes God a <hi>Protector</hi> of any <hi>King,</hi> any <hi>State,</hi> any <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> against either in bred or forraine Enemies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Fox</hi> at home and the <hi>Lion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3026:26"/>
And that certainly is; for the <hi>State</hi> to goe on with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi> And for the <hi>Church</hi> to labour <hi>Deuotion</hi> as much at least, if not more then <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> For else Gods cause and ours may be two. And then God may <hi>Arise, and maintaine his owne,</hi> but leaue vs to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> to the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> to the <hi>Sword,</hi> to any other <hi>Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The onely way to make God <hi>Arise</hi> as soone as euer we call: Nay, to preuent our call and come in to helpe before we pray, is, for both King and People, State and Church, to <hi>weaue</hi> their Cause and Gods together. To <hi>incorporate</hi> them so, that no cunning of the <hi>Diuel</hi> may be able to separate them. For then the benefit is apparant. God cannot <hi>Arise and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his owne cause,</hi> but he must <hi>maintaine ours</hi> too: because 'tis <hi>one</hi> with his. And his owne (doubt you not) he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, against the proudest Enemie that can come against it. And certainly the greatest hope and confidence of Gods Assistance to any Nation, to anie Man,


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3026:26"/>
that can preceed deliuerance itself, is to make their <hi>Cause all one with Gods.</hi> And that is done by <hi>vpholding</hi> his, and <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> theirs.</p>
            <p>Our safety then is when our cause is <hi>one</hi> with Gods: Our danger when they <hi>differ.</hi> But what is it that puts the <hi>difference</hi> betweene them? What? why that which put the first Enmity betweene God and Man, <hi>Sinne.</hi> And therefore if wee will quit the Enmity and bee made friends, the onely vvay to reconcile vs with God, and our Cause vvith his, is by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> to banish <hi>Sin.</hi> The sooner this is done, the sooner we are safe: vvhich cannot be till <hi>our Cause be one with Gods: One,</hi> and yet vvhen 'tis one the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is still vvith Gods Cause, vve must not suffer ours to step on before him.</p>
            <p>For <hi>our Cause</hi> as 'tis <hi>spirituall</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our soules, if it be neuer so good, neuer so close ioyned vvith Gods, yet God's is to haue the <hi>precedence.</hi> For be ours neuer so good, I must begge of your <hi>humility</hi> to Remember, that Gods Grace


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3026:27"/>
did both preuent and follow, to make it so. And therefore we are to put his cause first, and to pray chiefly for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that which gaue worth to ours.</p>
            <p>And for our cause as 'tis <hi>tempor all</hi> and concernes this life onely, Our safety, life, and liuely-hood; <hi>Gods cause</hi> is to haue the <hi>precedence</hi> of that much more. <hi>Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Brethren and Sisters, Life and all, must be accounted as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Gods Cause, S. Luke</hi> 14. And it hath euer been a signe that the Soule of a Man <note place="margin">S. Luke 14. 26.</note> goes right: That a vvhole People keepe vpon Gods path; <hi>when they seeke first the Kingdome of GOD and the righteousnesse thereof, and leaue God to minister and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the rest, S. Mat.</hi> 6. When they are <note place="margin">S. Mat. 6. 33.</note> more tenderly affected to the Cause of God, and more sensible of the Reproach or Blasphemy of his Name, then of any calamities, that might or malice can bring vpon their persons.</p>
            <p>And yet our giuing Gods Cause the <hi>precedence,</hi> in our <hi>loue</hi> to it, and our <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> for it, is no exclusion of our <hi>own Cause:</hi>


               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:3026:27"/>
Nay, the <hi>preferring</hi> of Gods before our owne, And the making of our owne <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to Gods, Is the way to make God as iealous of our safety <hi>from all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,</hi> as he is to vindicate his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>from Reproach and Blasphemy.</hi> And therefore though the <hi>Prophet</hi> heere (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> obserues) doth not say <hi>Arise,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>O God, and maintaine Causam meam,</hi> my cause, but thine owne. Yet the same God that will haue vs <hi>preferre</hi> his cause, will haue vs <hi>pray</hi> for our owne like wise. And so the <hi>Prophet</hi> did: For though he be heere all for Gods cause; yet vvee haue hime very earnest for his <hi>owne</hi> too. <hi>Pleade thou my cause O Lord with them that striue with me, and fight thou against them,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 15. 31. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that fight against me, Psal.</hi> 35. And <hi>defend my cause, O God, against the vngodly People,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 43. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 43. 1. Well then: <hi>Thy cause</hi> O God; and <hi>my Cause</hi> O God. But the Rule of Practise goes heere; Gods cause must <hi>leade,</hi> that ours may <hi>follow</hi> it, vnder the protection of God.</p>
            <p>As we haue therefore now begun, so


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3026:28"/>
let vs <hi>pray</hi> on as the Prophet did. That God euen our Gracious Father will bee no longer like vnto one that sleepes: That hee will <hi>Arise,</hi> and <hi>blow</hi> ouer these feares from vs. 'Tis but his <hi>Breath,</hi> and he can drie the <hi>Cloudes,</hi> that they drop not Rottennesse vpon our Haruest. 'Tis but his <hi>Breath,</hi> and he can cleere the <hi>Ayre</hi> of <hi>Infection,</hi> as well all ouer the Kingdome, as he hath, beyond admiration, done it in our chiefe City. And 'tis but the same <hi>Breath,</hi> and he can shake our <hi>Enemies</hi> to peeces in the Sea.</p>
            <p>That God being <hi>Arisen</hi> and come neere in prouidence, will <hi>pleade</hi> first, and after <hi>maintaine his owne Cause.</hi> His owne in the hand of the <hi>King:</hi> His owne in the heart of the <hi>Church:</hi> And his owne in the <hi>Holinesse</hi> of his <hi>Name.</hi> That he will giue this <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> and euery Member of both such <hi>grace,</hi> that our <hi>cause</hi> may bee his, and his <hi>Maintenance</hi> ours. That he wil <hi>remember</hi> and that's enough, that if <hi>his Cause</hi> bee ours, <hi>our Enemies</hi> are his. That we may so order our liues by


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3026:28"/>
his Grace, that if these or any <hi>Enemies</hi> will <hi>Blaspheme,</hi> it may not bee <hi>Him</hi> for our sinnes, but <hi>Vs</hi> for his seruice. That our Enemies and his, how-wise soeuer in other things, yet in their plots and practises against vs may be written in the <hi>Text-Letters FOOLES.</hi> That we, being preserued from them and all other <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity,</hi> may take warning in time to mend our liues, and so heereafter liue to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and serue him, that the world may see he hath beene <hi>mercifull,</hi> and wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be <hi>Thankfull.</hi> That after the <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his and our Cause</hi> heere, we may in our seuerall times be receiued vp to him in <hi>Glory,</hi> Through <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Lord: To whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</p>
