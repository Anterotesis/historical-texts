            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To all the moſt Illuſtrious Archbiſhops and Reverend Biſhops of Ireland, but more particularly to thoſe of the Province of <hi>Dublin</hi> their Honourable Lords, <hi>David</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſory, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Fernes, Roſſ of Kildare,</hi> and <hi>Mathew</hi> Vicar Apoſtolicall of <hi>Laghlein.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt Illustrious Lords and Reverend Biſhops, the Prieſts of Dublin make their complaint before you, That the most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Archbiſhop of Dublin, <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> without alledging any cauſe against them, onely for his will, and at his pleaſure uſeth to exile and baniſh Priests out of his Dioceſe. And they proteſt that in ſo doing he exerciſeth a tyrannie over the Clergy, contrary unto the Canons of Holy Church, and the Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moſt Illustrious Lords and Reverend Fathers in Christ, the aforeſaid Priests doe make their complaint, that the ſame moſt Illustrious Archbiſhop of Dublin, <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> though humbly ſought unto, and deſired, doth refuſe to doe them Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in their cauſes, neither yet will he permit the Cleargy to follow their actions meerely civill before the Magistrate, contrary unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived custome of this Kingdome, from the first conuerſion of the Nation. And they proteſt that in ſo doing, he exerciſeth a tyranny over the Clergy, contrary vnto the Canons of the Church, and the Lawes and ſtatutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Moſt Illuſtrious Lords, and R. Fathers in Christ, the aforeſaid Priests doe make their complaint, Tbat the ſame moſt Illuſtrious Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> in inflicting his Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, obſerveth no Canonicall proceeding at all, omitting not onely the ſolemnities of the Law, but thoſe things alſo that are neceſſary and eſſentiall in all proceedings thereof, namely <hi>citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>proofe</hi> of cauſes. And they proteſt that in ſo doing, he exerciſeth a tyranny over the Clergy, contrary unto the Canons of holy Church, and the Lawes and ſtatutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moſt Illuſtrious Lords, and R. Fathers in Chriſt, the aforeſaid Prieſts doe complaine, that the ſame most Illustrious Archbiſhop, <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> refuſed to heare all proofes againſt the Regulars in the matter of the eleven propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Paris,</hi> which teſtimonyes or proofes two venerable Prieſts preſented unto him the 15. day of November, in the yeere of our Lord 1631. in Dublin. And moreover the aforeſaid Prieſts doe profeſſe, that the ſame Illustrious Archbiſhop is a favourer and a Patron of certaine new, &amp; never heard of Hereſies, publiſhed by the Fryars of his Order, and others: of the which Hereſies, or rather Blaſphemies, being advertiſed by a petition, he utterly refuſed to heare the Accuſers and Witneſſes. And they proteſt that in ſo doing he exerciſeth a tyranny in the Church of God, contrary unto the Canons of holy Church, and the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Moſt Illustrious Lords and Rev. Fathers in Christ, the aforeſaid Prieſts doe complaine, that the ſame moſt Illuſtrious Archbiſhop <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> did not ſuppreſſe, extinguiſh or corrupt (according as the Canons of the Church and the Lawes of Princes doe commaund) a certaine infamous Libell, made, printed and publiſhed under the falſe and faigned name of <hi>Edmund Utſulan,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the good name, fame and reputation of certaine venerable Prieſts of the Clergy, who in the ſame aforeſaid Libell are expreſſely and by name mentioned: but on the contrary the aforeſaid Archbiſhop reades, commends, publiſheth, and defends the ſame, to their irreparable diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and infamy, by whoſe example alſo others eſpecially of the Regulars of this Kingdome are incited, provoked, and animated to doe the like. And they proteſt that in ſo doing, he exerciſeth a tyranny over the Clergy, contrary to the Canons of holy Church, and the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Most Illuſtrious Lords and Reverend Fathers in Chriſt, the aforeſaid Preiſts doe complaine, that the ſame moſt Illuſtrious Archbiſhop of Dublin, <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> being given to vnderſtand by way of petition, in the behalfe of the Clergy of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin, That a certaine Pariſh Prieſt by name <hi>Patrick Brangan,</hi> with his aſſiſtant <hi>Iames Quin,</hi> but a few moneths agoe, thorough extreme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence had loſt the bleſſed Sacrament conſecrated in many hoſtes, and that without hope of recovery. Our aforeſaid Archbiſhop making ſmall or no account of ſo great a ſacriledge, permit notwithſtanding the aforeſaid Prieſts, whereof the one is most unlearned, the other Lunaticke, to execute all Eccleſiasticall functions, by whoſe miniſtery he dayly expoſeth the Sacraments of the Church to prophanation, and abuſe. And in ſo doing they proteſt that he offends againſt the divine Majeſty, and the ſacred Canons of the Church. They profeſſe alſo that in theſe aforeſaid exceſſes he hath the Regulars his Counſellours, ayders and abettours, eſpecially one <hi>Iohn Preſton,</hi> a Friar of his Order, a moſt ſeditious and a turbulent fellow, to the ruine of the Clergy, and diſturbance of the Christian Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Moſt Illuſtrious Lords, and R. Fathers in Chriſt, the aforeſaid Prieſts doe complaine, that the ſame moſt Illuſtrious Archbiſhop of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin, <hi>Tho. Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> doth make Pariſh Prieſts, yong men, unlearned, and unbred. Others famous for their learning, gravity and vertue being neglected. And more it is to be lamented for, that ſuch are the times &amp; ſtate of things, as if we had <hi>Auguſtines, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſies,</hi> and <hi>Hieromes,</hi> it were meet to preferre them unto the pastorall office (others omitted.) But what may we expect of this our Prelat? who hath ordinarily in his mouth: To what end ſhould Pariſh Prieſts be learned? or preachers? foraſmuch as theſe matters belong unto Regulars. Moreover the aforeſaid Prieſts doe complaine, that the most Illuſtrious Archbiſhop <hi>Thomas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming unto his Prelature, found within the walls of Dublin five Pariſh Prieſts, men of learning, ripe yeares, and uncorrupt converſation, in place of whom, either taken away by death or exile, he hath placed onely two, &amp; ſuch as we are not willing to ſpeake of what condition: ſo as it ſeemes he deſireth nothing more, then by this oppreſsion and extirpation of the Clergy, a more eaſie and compendious way may be made unto thoſe armies of Monkes, and begging Friars, who in this Kingdome (obſerving no Regular diſcipline) doe labour to create a Monarchy unto themſelves, as already they have done under this Biſhop, to the deſtruction of the Church, the impoveriſhing of the Inhabitants, and no ſmall detriment to the Common-wealth. And they protest that in ſo doing, he exerciſeth a tyranny over the Clergy, contrary unto the Canons of holy Church, and the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Most Illuſtrious Lords and R. Fathers in Chriſt, The aforeſaid Prieſts doe complaine, That the Illuſtrious Archbiſhop of Dublin <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> is accustomed to anſwer the Clergy complaining of their grievances unto him: If I doe you wrong, you may goe to Rome to complaine. In the meane time reporting himſelfe to be ſo powerfull in the Court of Rome, that he feares no Adverſary. And of this that R. Prieſt Fa. <hi>Patrick Cahil,</hi> Doctor of Divinity had experience, who for a yeare treating of his injuries and grievances done unto him by the Archbiſhop of Dublin, could by no meanes prevaile once to be admitted unto the preſence and audience of the moſt eminent Cardinall <hi>Ludoviſius,</hi> Vice-Chancellour of Rome: which Cardinall notwithſtanding is given by his Holineſse unto the Iriſh as the onely Patron and Protectour of the Iriſh Nation. Theſe things we may remember with griefe, but amend them we cannot. But wee profeſse before Almighty God, his Holineſſe, and all faithfull people, that this is nothing elſe but to tyrannize over the Clergy, to the diſhonour of the Church, and no ſmaell contempt of the See Apostolicke.</p>
            <p>For which and other cauſes beſides to be alledged, and in their due time and place to be proved againſt the above-named Archbiſhop <hi>Tho. Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> we the aforeſaid Prieſts, and hereafter to be named, doe ſet before your eyes moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Lords theſe our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as meet &amp; honorable witneſſes of this our deed, writing, and publique inſtrument, and as farre as is poſſible and lawfull for us by the Canons of holy Church, declining the Iuriſdiction of our aforeſaid Ordinary by this our preſent writing: and from this time forth wee appeale unto the See Apoſtolique, from all Eccleſiaſticall cenſures hereafter to be inflicted upon us by the ſame Illuſtrious Archbiſhop <hi>Tho. Flemming,</hi> of the order of S. <hi>Francis.</hi> And in the meane time providing for our innocencie and ſafety (to the example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Athanaſius)</hi> we doe invocate the aide of the Secular arme for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedy, againſt the aforeſaid Illuſtrious Archbiſhop <hi>Tho. Flemming,</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and all Regulars of what order ſoever, as well Monks as begging Friars, Abbettours, Counſellors and participants with him in the premiſſes, as violatours and contemners of all Lawes divine and humane, and men by the law excommunicate. Humbly beſeeching your Lordſhips in the bowels of the Crucified, that you would be pleaſed to intimate with as much ſpeed as may be, this our proteſtation and appeale unto the See Apoſtolicke. And the God of peace and love long preſerve your R. Lordſhips in ſafety.</p>
