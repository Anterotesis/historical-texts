            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

an Act made about 320. years since, of like tenor in

was as proper to your name, whence these also were
the fitter to offer you: Enough, other particulars

though there were divers <hi>Referendarii,</hi> as 14. then 8. then

these singular examples of Kings Sealing in the
<hi>Saxons</hi> times, it's most certain it was not a thing common
then; neither could any in the Chancellorship be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Although we admit those before mentioned for
true, which may well be doubted, in regard of the frequent
fraud and ignorance in committing it, which in the elder
times possess'd the Church-men. But for the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Seal,
that was without scruple certain, and thence may we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
derive the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi>

took it from him, and committed it to one <hi>Godfrey</hi> a

sayes the Story) <hi>ad Cancellarium spectantibus, Episcopo

Norman</hi> a Lawyer had it: and from him it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and committed to <hi>Richard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Evesham,</hi> who
kept it three years, and then resigned it in 26 <hi>H.</hi> 3. The
Chancellor and Keeper (of right) <hi>Nevill</hi> was afterward
reconciled to the King, and dyed 28 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>In the Acts of Parliament of which year, one is,<note place="margin">Vide etiam Cart. 17 H. 3. pro eodem Episcopo de eisdem Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiis pro termino vitae suae.</note> That
the Keeper of the Seal should be alwayes the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and that all things sealed otherwise should be voyd.
The words are, <hi>Si aliqua interveniente occasione Dominus
Rex abstulerit Sigillum suum à Cancellario, quicquid fuerit
interim sigillatum, irritum habeatur &amp; inane, Deinde Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellario
fiat restitutio.</hi> And it appears otherwise that they
alwayes took it unjustly done, if the Chancellorship and
Keepership were not in one: By Reason whereof, before
that, in a Charter of King <hi>John</hi>'s yet extant in some
hands, of the Moderation of the Fees of the Seal, no
person is spoken of but the Chancellor and his under
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62809:7"/>
Officers; as if it could not have been but that who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the Seal, the same should only bee Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</p>
               <p>According to that the Chancellorship and Keepership
were joyned in all the Chancellors under <hi>Henry</hi> the 3
and <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. most of which being made Bishops,
resigned their Seal and Office, although afterward under
the succeeding Kings sometimes the Seal was committed
to others hands upon some requiring occasions; and some
Lord Keepers were created in later times before Sir
<hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> in whose time that Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
was made.</p>
