            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The conſideration and reſpect of ſo notable a vertue, did firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the dint of his wrath, and from thoſe three began to relent, and ſhew mercie to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inhabitants of the ſaid towne. <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Prince of <hi>Epirus,</hi> following one of his ſoldiers, with purpoſe to kill him, who by all means of humilitie, &amp; ſubmiſſe entreatie, had firſt aſſaied to pacifie him, in ſuch an vnavoidable extremity, reſolved at laſt, reſolutely to encounter him with his ſword in his hand.

ther of theſe waies might eaſily perſwade me: for I am much inclined to mercie, and affected to mildneſſe. So it is, that in mine opinion, I ſhould more naturally ſtoop vnto compaſſion, than bend to eſtimation. Yet is pitie held a vicious paſſion among the Stoickes. They would have vs aide the afflicted, but not to faint, and coſuffer with them. Theſe examples ſeeme fitteſt for mee, forſomuch as theſe mindes are ſeene to be aſſaulted and environed by theſe two meanes, in vndauntedly ſuffering the one, and ſtooping vnder the other. It may peraduentvre be ſaid, that to yeelde ones heart vnto commiſeration, is an effect of facilitie, tenderneſſe, and meekeneſſe: whence it proceedeth, that the weakeſt natures, as of women, children, and the vulgar ſort are more ſubject vnto it. But (having contemned teares and wailings) to yeeld vnto the onely reverence of the ſacred Image of vertue, is the effect of a couragious and imployable minde, holding a maſculine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant vigor, in honour and affection. Notwithſtanding amazement and admiration may in leſſe generous mindes worke the like effect. Witneſſe the Thebanes, who having accuſed and indited their captaines, as of a capitall crime, forſomuch as they had continued their charge, beyond the time preſcribed them, abſolved and quit <hi>Pelopidas</hi> of all puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſubmiſſiuely yeelded vnder the burden of ſuch objections, and to ſave himſelfe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed no other meanes, but ſuing-requeſts, and demiſſe entreaties; where on the contrary, <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> boldely relating the exploits atchieved by him, and with a fierce and arrogant manner, vpbraiding the people with them, had not the heart ſo much as to take their lots into his hands, but went his way, and was freely abſolved: the aſſembly much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtoutneſſe of his courage. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder, after long-lingering and extreame difficulties, having taken the Citie of <hi>Reggio,</hi> and in it the Captaine <hi>Phyton</hi> (a worthy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man) who had ſo obſtinately defended the ſame, would needes ſhew a tragicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of revenge.

And with a cheerefull and bold countenance went on ſtill, lowdly recounting the honourable and glorious cauſe of his death, which was, that hee would never conſent to yeeld his Countrie into the handes of a cruell tyrant, menacing him with an imminent puniſhment of the Gods. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> plainely reading in his Souldiers lookes, that in liew of animating them with braving his conquered enemie, they in contempt of him, and skorne of his triumph, ſeemed by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment of ſo rare a vertue, to be mooved with compaſſion, and enclined to mutinie, yea, and to free <hi>Phy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Surely, man is a wonderfull, vain, diuerſe, and wavering ſubject: it is very hard to ground any directly-conſtant and vniforme judgement vpon him. Behold <hi>Pompey</hi> who freely pardoned all the Citie of the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> againſt which hee was grievouſly enraged, for the love of the magnanimitie, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the exceeding vertue of <hi>Zeno,</hi> one of their fellow-citizens, who tooke the publike fault wholy vpon himſelfe, and deſired no other favor, but alone to beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; whereas <hi>Syllaes</hi> hoſte having vſed the like vertue in the Citie of <hi>Perugia,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing, neither for himſelfe, nor for others. And directly againſt my firſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the hardieſt amongſt men, and ſo gracious to the vanquiſhed, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, after many ſtrange difficulties, forcing the Citie of <hi>Gaza,</hi> encountred by chaunce with <hi>Betis,</hi> that commanded therein, of whoſe valour (during the ſiege) hee had felt woonderfull and ſtrange exploites, beeing then alone, forſaken of all his followers, his armes all-broken, all-beſmeared with blood and wounds, <q>fighting amongſt a number of Macedonians, who pell-mell laid ſtill vpon him; provoked by ſo deere a victorie (for among other miſhappes hee had newly received two hurts in his body) ſaid thus vnto him;</q>

This might well be compared to that which one of our Princes was lately ſeene to doe, who being at <hi>Trent,</hi> and receiving newes of his elder brothers death; but ſuch a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as on him lay all the burthen and honour of his houſe; and ſhortly after tidings of his yonger brothers deceaſe, who was his ſecond hope; and having with an vnmatched coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and exemplar conſtancie endured theſe two affronts; it fortuned not long after, that one of his ſervants dying, he by this latter accident ſuffered himſelfe to be ſo far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, that quitting and forgetting his former reſolution, he ſo abandoned himſelfe to all maner of ſorrow and griefe, that ſome argued, only this laſt miſchance had toucht him to the quicke: but verily the reaſon was, that being otherwiſe full, and over plunged in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the leaſt ſurcharge brake the bounds and barres of patience. The like might (I ſay) be judged of our ſtorie, were it not it followeth, that <hi>Cambiſes</hi> inquiring of <hi>Pſamneticus,</hi> why he was nothing diſtempered at the misfortune of his ſonne and daughter, he did ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently beare the diſaſter of his friend: <hi>It is,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>Becauſe this laſt diſpleaſure may be manifeſted by weeping, whereas the two former exceede by much, all meanes and compaſſe to bee expreſſed by teares.</hi> The invention of that ancient Painter might happily fitte this purpoſe, who in the ſacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> being to repreſent the griefe of the by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

As if you grant follie what it deſireth, it will no-whit be ſatisfied; ſo is wiſedome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which is preſent, and never diſpleaſed with it ſelfe. <hi>Epicurus</hi> doth diſpenſe with his age touching the foreſight and care of what ſhall inſue. Amongſt the lawes that regard the deceaſed, that which ties the actions of Princes to be examined when they are dead, ſeemes to me verie ſolide. They are companions, if not maſters of the lawes: That which juſtice could not work on their heads, it is reaſon it effect vpon their reputation, and goods of their ſucceſſors: things wee many times preferre before our lives. It is a cuſtome brings many ſingular commodities vnto nations that obſerve it, and to be deſired of all good Princes: who have cauſe to complaine that the memorie of the wicked is vſed as theirs. Wee owe a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12117:9"/>
like obedience and ſubjection to all Kings; for it reſpects their office: but eſtimation and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wee owe it only to their vertue. If they be unworthie, wee are to endure them pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, to conceale their vices, and to aid their indifferent actions with our commendations, as long as their authoritie hath need of our aſſiſtance, and that ought to be aſcribed unto poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike order. But our commerce with them being ended, there is no reaſon we ſhould refuſe the unfolding of our felt wrongs vnto juſtice and our libertie. And ſpecially to refuſe good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the glory to have reverently and faithfully ſerved a maſter, whoſe imperfections were ſo well knowne unto them: exempting poſteritie from ſo profitable an example. And ſuch as for the reſpect of ſome private benefite or intereſt do wickedly imbrace the memorie of an vnwoorthie Prince, doe particular juſtice at the charge of publike juſtice. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſpeaketh truely, where he ſaith, that the ſpeech of men brought up under a royaltie is ever full of vaine oſtentations, and falſe witneſſes: every man indifferently extolling the king, to the furtheſt ſtraine of valour and Soveraigne greatneſſe. The magnanimitie of thoſe two Souldiers, may bee reproved, one of which being demaunded of <hi>Nero,</hi> why he hated him, anſwered him to his teeth; I loved thee whileſt thou waſt worthie of love, but ſince thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cameſt a parricide, a fir-brand, a juglar, a player, and a Coach-man, I hate thee, as thou deſerveſt. The other being asked, wherefore he ſought to kill him; anſwered, Becauſe I find no other courſe to hinder thy unceſſant outrages and impious deedes. But can any man, that hath his ſenſes about him, juſtly reproove the publike and generall teſtimonies, that ſince his death, have bin given, and ſo ſnall be for ever, both againſt him and all ſuch like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, of his tyrannicall and wicked demeanors? I am ſorie that in ſo ſacred a pollicie as the Lacedemonian was, ſo fained and fond a ceremonie at the death of their kings was ever deviſed and brought in uſe. All their confederates and neighbours, all the ſlave-Heotes, men and women pell-mell, for a teſtimonie of their griefe and ſorrow did mangle and gaſh their foreheads; and in their out-cries, and lamentations, exclaimed, that their deceaſed king, howſoever he had lived, was and had bin the beſt Prince that ever they had, aſcribing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commendations due unto deſert, and to the laſt and latter ranke, what belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt merite. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that hath an oare in every water, and medleth with all things, makes a queſtion, about <hi>Solons</hi> ſpeech, who ſaith, that no man can truely be counted happy before his death, Whether he that lived and died according to his wiſh may be named hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Whether his renowne be good or ill, and whether his poſteritie be miſerable or no. Whileſt we ſtirre and remove, we tranſport our ſelves by preoccupation whereſoever we liſt: But no ſooner are we out of being, but we have no communication at all with that which is.

Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in like matters, by the lawes of <hi>Greece,</hi> he that required a dead bodie of his enemies, with intent to burie the ſame, renounced the victory, and might no more erect any trophie of it: and he who was ſo required, purchaſed the title of honour and gaine. So did <hi>Nicias</hi>

looſe the advantage he had clearely gained of the Corinthians; and contrariwiſe, <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> aſſured that, he doubtfully had gotten of the Boetians. Theſe actions might be deemed ſtrange, if in all ages it were not a common-received opinion, not only to extend the care of our ſelves, beyond this life, but alſo to believe, that heavenly favours to often accompanie vs vnto our grave, and continue in our poſteritie. Whereof there are ſo many examples (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our moderne a part) that I need not wade farre into it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt king of <hi>England,</hi> in the long warres he had with <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having by triall found how greatly his preſence advantaged the ſucceſſe of his affaires, and how he was ever victorious in any enterpriſe he vndertooke in his owne perſon; when he died, bound his ſonne by ſolemne oth, that being dead he ſhould cauſe his body to be boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vntill the fleſh fell from the bones, which he ſhould cauſe to be enterred, and carefully keeping the bones, ever carrie them about him, whenſoever he ſhould happen to have wars with the Scots: As if deſtenie had fatally annexed the victorie vnto his limmes. <hi>Iohn Ziſca;</hi> who for the defenſe of <hi>Wickliffs</hi> opinions ſo much troubled the ſtate of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that after his death his body ſhould be flead, and a drum made of his skin, to be carried and ſounded in all the wars againſt his enemies: deeming the ſound of it would be a meanes to continue the advantages, which in his former warres he had obtained of them. Certaine Indians did likewiſe carry the bones of one of their Captaines in the skirmiſhes they had with the Spaniards, in regard of the good ſucceſſe he had, whileſt he lived, had againſt them: And other nations of that new-found world, do likewiſe carrie the bodies of ſuch worthie and fortunate men with them, as have died in their battels, to ſerve them in ſtead of good fortune and encouragement. The firſt examples reſerve nothing elſe in their tombes, but the reputation acquired by their former atchievements: but theſe will alſo adjoine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the power of working. The act of Captaine <hi>Bayart</hi> is of better compoſition, who perceiving himſelfe deadly wounded by a ſhot received in his body, being by his men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to come off and retire himſelfe from out the throng, anſwered, he would not now ſo neere his end, begin to turne his face from his enemie: and having ſtowtly foughten ſo long as he could ſtand, feeling himſelfe to faint and ſtagger from his horſe, commanded his ſteward to lay him againſt a tree, but in ſuch ſort, that he might die with his face toward the enemie; as indeed he did. I may not omit this other example, as remarkeable for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as any of the precedent. The Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> great grand-father to <hi>Phillip,</hi> now King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was a Prince highly endowed with many notable qualities, and amongſt others with a well-nigh matchleſſe beautie and comelineſſe of body; but with other cuſtomes of his, he had this one much contrarie to other Princes, who to diſpatch their waightieſt affaires make often their cloſe ſtoole, their regale Throne or Councel-chamber, which was, that he would not permit any groome of his chamber (were he never ſo neere about him) to ſee him in his inner-chamber, who if he had occaſion but to make water, wold as nicely and as religiouſly withdraw himſelfe as any maiden, and never ſuffer ſo much as a Phyſitian, much leſſe any other whatſoever, to ſee thoſe privie parts that all in modeſtie ſeeke to keepe ſecret and vnſeene. My ſelfe, that am ſo broad-mouthed and laviſh in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, am notwithſtanding naturally touched with that baſhfulneſſe. And vnleſſe it be by the motion of neceſſitie or of voluptuouſneſſe, I never willingly imparted thoſe actions and parts (which cuſtome willeth to be concealed) to the view of any creature. I endure more compulſion, then I deeme befitting a man, eſpecially of my profeſſion. But he grew to ſuch ſuperſtition, that by expreſſe words in his laſt will and teſtament, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that being dead, he ſhould have linnen-ſlops put about them. He ſhould by codicile have anexed vnto it, that he who ſhould put them on, might have his eies hood-winckt. The inſtruction which <hi>Cyrus</hi> giveth his children, that neither they nor any other ſhould either ſee or touch his body, after the breath were once out of it; I aſcribe it unto ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of devotion in him. For both his hiſtorian and himſelfe, amongſt many other notable qualities they are endued with, have throughout all the courſe of their life ſeemed to have a ſingular reſpect and awfull reverence vnto religion. That ſtorie diſpleaſed me very much, which a noble man told me of a kinſman of mine (a man very famous &amp; well knowne both in peace and warre) which is, that dying verie aged in his court, being much tormented with extreame pangs of the ſtone, he with an earneſt and vnwearied care, emploied all his laſt houres, to diſpoſe the honor and ceremonie of his funerals, and ſummoned all the nobilitie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12117:10"/>
that came to viſit him to give him aſſured promiſe to be as aſſiſtants, and to convay him to his laſt reſting place. To the very ſame Prince, who was with him at his laſt gaſp, he made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie earneſt ſute, he would command all his houſhold to wait vpon him at his interrement, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing many reaſons, and all eaging divers examples, to prove that it was a thing very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and fitting a man of his qualitie: which aſſured promiſe when he had obtained, &amp; had at his pleaſure marſhalled the order how they ſhould march, he ſeemed quietly and contentedly to yeeld vp the ghoſt. I have ſeldome ſeene a vanitie continue ſo long. This other curioſitie meere oppoſite vnto it (which to prove I need not labor for home-examples) ſeemeth in my opinion coſin-german to this that is, when one is ever readie to breathe his laſt, carefully and paſſionately to endevor, how to reduce the convoy of his obſequies vnto ſome particular &amp; vnwonted parcimonie, to one ſervant and to one lanterne: I heare the humor and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</hi> commended, who expreſly forbade his heires to vſe thoſe ceremonies about his interrement, which in ſuch caſes were formerly accuſtomed: Is it tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and frugalitie, to avoid charge and voluptuouſnes, the vſe and knowledge of which is inperceptable vnto vs? Lo here an eaſie reformation and of ſmall coſt. Were it requiſite to appoint any, I would be of opinion, that as well in that, as in all other actions of mans life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſhould referre the rule of it to the qualitie of his fortune. And the Philoſopher <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> did wiſely appoint his friends to place his body, where they ſhould thinke it fitteſt and for the beſt: and for his obſequies, they ſhould neither be ſuperfluous and over-coſtly, nor baſe and ſparing. For my part, I would wholy relie on cuſtome, which ſhould diſpoſe this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and would yeeld my ſelfe to the diſcretion of the firſt or next, <q>into whoſe hands I might chance to fall. <hi>Totus hic locus eſt contemnendus in nobis, non negligendus in noſtris. All this matter ſhould be deſpiſed of vs, but not neglected of ours.</hi> And religiouſly ſaid a holy man: <hi>Curatio funeris,</hi>

Happy they that can rejoyce and gratifie their ſenſes with inſenſibilitie, and live by their death! A little thing would make me conceive an inexpiable hatred againſt all popular domination; although it ſeeme moſt naturall and juſt vnto me: when I call to minde that inhumane injuſtice of the Athenians, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further triall or remiſſion, yea without ſuffering them ſo much as to reply or anſwere for themſelves, condemned thoſe noble and worthy captaines, that returned victoriouſly from the ſea-battell, which they (neere the Iles <hi>Arginuſae</hi>) had gained of the Lacedemonians; the moſt conteſted, bloudie, and greateſt fight the Graecians ever obtained by ſea with their owne forces: forſomuch as after the victorie, they had rather followed thoſe occaſions, which the law of warre preſented vnto them, for their availe, than to their prejudice ſtaid to gather and burie their dead men. And the ſucceſſe of <hi>Diomedon</hi> makes their ruthleſſe execution more hatefull, who beeing a man of notable and exemplar vertue, both militarie and politike, and of them ſo cruelly condemned; after he had heard the bloudie ſentence, advauncing himſelfe forward to ſpeake, having fit opportunitie and plauſible audience; he, I ſay, in ſtead of excuſing himſelfe, or endevouring to juſtifie his cauſe, or to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the evident iniquitie of ſo cruell a doome, expreſſed but a care of the Iudges preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, earneſtly beſeeching the Gods to turne that judgement to their good, praying that for want of not ſatisfying the vowes, which he and his companions had vowed in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and thankſgiving for ſo famous a victorie, and honourable fortune, they might not draw the wrath and revenge of the Gods vpon them, declaring what their vowes were. And without more words, or vrging further reaſons, couragiouſly addreſſed himſelfe to his execution. But fortune ſome yeares after puniſhed him alike, and made him taſte of the very ſame ſauce. For <hi>Chabrias,</hi> Captaine Generall of their ſea-fleet, having afterward obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a famous victorie of <hi>Pollis,</hi> Admirall of <hi>Sparta,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Naxos,</hi> loſt abſolutely the benefit of it, and only contented with the day (a matter of great conſequence for their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) fearing to incurre the miſchiefe of this example, and to ſave a few dead carcaſſes of his friends, that floated vp and downe the ſea, gave leaſure to an infinite number of his

                        <p>THE common ſaying is, that <hi>Death acquits vs of all our bondes.</hi> I know ſome that have taken it in another ſence. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, King of <hi>England</hi> made a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Philip</hi> ſonne to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, or to give him a more honorable title, father to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, that the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould deliver into his hands, the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> his mortall enemie, who was fled out of <hi>England,</hi> and ſaved himſelfe in the Low countries, alwaies provided the King ſhould attempt nothing againſt the Dukes life; which promiſe notwithſtanding, being neere his end, he expreſly by will and teſtament commanded his ſucceeding-ſonne, that immediately after his deceaſe, he ſhould cauſe him to be put to death. In the late tragedie, which the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> preſented vs withall at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> on the Earles of <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Egmond,</hi> were many remarkeable things, and woorthie to be noted: and amongſt others, that the ſaid Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> vpon whoſe faithfull word and aſſurance, the Earle of <hi>Horne</hi> was come in &amp; yeelded himſelfe to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> required verie inſtantly to be firſt put to death, to the end his death might acquit and free him of the word and bond, which he ought and was engaged for, to the ſaide Earle of <hi>Horne.</hi> It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that death hath no whit diſcharged the former of his worde giuen, and that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

without dying, was quit of it. We cannot be tied beyond our ſtrength, and meanes. The reaſon is, becauſe the effects and executions, are not any way in our power, and except our will, nothing is truely in our power: on it onely are all the rules of mans dutie grounded and eſtabliſhed by neceſſitie. And therefore Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> deeming his minde and will indebted to his promiſe, howbeit the power to effect it, lay not in his hands, was no doubt cleerely abſolved of his debt and dutie, although he had ſurvived the Count <hi>Horne.</hi> But the King of <hi>England</hi> failing of his word by his intention, cannot be excuſed, though hee delaide the execution of his diſloyaltie vntill after his death. No more then <hi>Herodotus</hi> his Maſon who during his naturall life, having faithfully kept the ſecret of his Maſter the King of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypts treaſure when he died, diſcovered the ſame vnto his children. I have in my daies ſeene many convicted by their owne conſcience, for detaining other mens goods, yet by their laſt will and teſtament to diſpoſe themſelves, after their deceaſe to make ſatisfaction. This is nothing to the purpoſe. Neither to take time for a matter ſo vrgent, nor with ſo ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or ſhew of feeling, to goe about to eſtabliſh an injurie. They are indebted ſomewhat more. And by how much more they pay incommodiouſly and chargeably, ſo much the more juſt and meritorious is their ſatisfaction. Penitence ought to charge, yet doe they worſe, who reſerve the revealing of ſome heinous conceit or affection towards their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to their laſt will and affection, having whileſt they lived ever kept it ſecret. And ſeeme to have little regard of their owne honour, by provoking the partie offended againſt their owne memory, and leſſe of their conſcience, ſince they could never for the reſpect of death cancell their ill-grudging affection, and in extending life beyond theirs. Oh wicked and vngodly judges, which referre the judgement of a cauſe to ſuch time as they have no more knowledge of cauſes! I will as neere as I can prevent, that my death reveale or vtter any thing, my life hath not firſt publikely ſpoken.</p>

                        <p>THere is no man living, whom it may leſſe beſeeme to ſpeake of memorie, than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for to ſay truth, I have none at all: and am fully perſwaded that no-mans can-be ſo weake and forgetfull as mine. All other parts are in me common and vile, but touching me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, I thinke to carrie the priſe from all-other, that have it weakeſt, nay and to gaine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of it, beſides the naturall want I endure (for truely conſidering the neceſſitie of it, <hi>Plato</hi> hath reaſon to name it <hi>A great and mighty Goddeſſe</hi>) In my countrie, if a man will imply that one hath no ſenſe, he will ſay, ſuch a one hath no memorie: and when I complaine of mine, they reprove me &amp; will not beleeve me, as if I accuſed my-ſelfe to be mad &amp; ſenceleſſe. They make no difference betweene memorie &amp; wit; which is an empairing of my market: But they doe me wrong, for contrariwiſe, it is commonly ſeene by experience, that excellent memories do rather accompany weake judgements. Moreover they wrong me in this (who can do nothing ſo well as to be a perfect friend) that the ſame words which accuſe my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, repreſent ingratitude. From my affection they take hold of my memorie, &amp; of a naturall defect, they infer a want of judgement or conſcience. Some wil ſay, he hath forgotten this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, or requeſt, or that promiſe, he is not mindfull of his old friends, he never remembred to ſay, or doe, or conceale this or that, for my ſake. Verily I may eaſily forget, but to neglect the charge my friend hath committed to my truſt, I never do it. Let them beare with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and not conclude it to be a kind of malice; which is ſo contrarie an enemie to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. Yet am I ſomewhat comforted. Firſt, becauſe it is an evill, from which I have chieflie drawne the reaſon to correct a worſe miſchiefe, that would eaſily have growen vpon me: that is to ſay, ambition; which defect is intolerable in them that meddlewith wordly negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For as divers like examples of natures progreſſe, ſay, ſhe hath happily ſtrengthned other faculties in me, according as it hath growne weaker and weaker in me, and I ſhould eaſily lay downe and wire-draw my minde and judgement, upon other mens traces, without exerciſing their proper forces, if by the benefit of memorie, forren inventions &amp; ſtrange opinions were preſent with me. That my ſpeech is thereby ſhorter: For the Magazin of Memorie, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure more ſtored with matter, than is the ſtore-houſe of Invention. Had it held out with me, I had ere this wearied all my friends with pratling: the ſubjects rouzing the meane facultie I have to manage and imploy them, ſtrengthning and wreſting my diſcourſes. It is pitie; I have aſſaied by the trial of ſom of my private friends: according as their memory hath miniſtred them a whole and perfect matter, who recoile their narration ſo farre-backe, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12117:14"/>
ſtuff-it with ſo many vaine circumſtances, that if the ſtory be good, they ſmoother the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it: if bad, you muſt needs either curſe the good fortune of their memorie, or blame the misfortune of their judgement. And it is no eaſie matter, being in the midſt of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere of a diſcourſe, to ſtop cunningly, to make a ſudden period, and to cut-it-off. And there is nothing whereby the cleane ſtrength of a horſe is more knowne, than to make a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and cleane ſtop. Among the skilfull I ſee ſome, that ſtrive, but can not ſtay their race. Whileſt they labour to finde the point to ſtop their courſe, they ſtagger and falter, as men that faint through weakeneſſe. Above all, old men are dangerous, who have onely the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of things paſt left them, and have loſt the remembrance of their repetitions. I have heard ſome very pleaſant reports become moſt irkeſome and tedious in the mouth of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lord, forſomuch as all the by-ſtanders had many times beene cloyed with them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, (as ſaid an ancient Writer) that, <hi>I doe not ſo much remember iniuries receiued.</hi> I had need have a prompter as <hi>Darius</hi> had, who not to forget the wrong he had received of the Athenians, whenſoever he ſate downe at his table, cauſed a page to ſing unto him, <hi>Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the</hi> Athenians, and that the places or bookes which I read-over, <q>do ever ſmile upon me, with ſome new noveltie. It is not without reaſon, menſay, that <hi>he who hath not a good and readie memorie, ſhould never meddle with telling of lies, and feare to become a liar.</hi>
                           </q> I am not ignorant how the Grammarians make a difference betweene ſpeaking vntrue and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſay that to ſpeake vntruly, is to ſpeake that which is falſe, but was reputed true; and that the definition of the Latin word, <hi>mentiri,</hi> whence the French word, <hi>mentir,</hi> is derived, which in Engliſh is to lie, implieth and meaneth to go againſt ones conſcience: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it concerneth onely thoſe, who ſpeake contrary to that which they know, of whom I ſpeake. Now theſe, either invent, ſeale, ſtampe and all, or elſe they diſguiſe and change a true ground. When they diſguiſe or change, if they be often put to the repetition of one thing, it is hard for them to keepe ſtill in one path, and very ſtrange if they loſe not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: becauſe the thing, as it is, having firſt taken vp her ſtand in the memory, and there by the way of knowledge and witting, imprinted it-ſelfe, it were hard it ſhould not repreſent itſelfe to the imagination, diſplacing and ſupplanting falſhood, which therein can have no ſuch footing, or ſetled faſtneſſe: and that the circumſtances of the firſt learning, ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into the minde, ſhould not cauſe it to diſperſe the remembrance of all falſe or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardizing parts gotten together. Where they altogether invent, forſomuch as there is no certaine impreſſion, to front their falſhood, they ſeeme to have ſo much the leſſer feare to miſtake or forget themſelves, which alſo notwithſtanding being an airie bodie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hold-faſt may eaſily eſcape the memorie, except it be well aſſured: whereof I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (to my no ſmall pleaſure) ſeene the experience, at the coſt of thoſe, who profeſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to frame their ſpeech, but as beſt ſhall fit the affaires they negotiate, and as beſt ſhall pleaſe the great men they ſpeake vnto. For the circumſtances to which they will ſubject their credit and conſcience, being ſubject to many changes, their ſpeech muſt likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifie and change with them, whence it followeth that of one ſelfe-ſame ſubject they ſpeak diverſly, as now yellow, now gray, to one man thus, and thus to another. And if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture theſe kind of men hoard-up their ſo contrarie inſtructions, what becomes of this goodly arte? Who beſides, often moſt fooliſhly forget themſelves, and runne at randon: For, what memorie ſhall ſuffice them, to remember ſo many different formes they have framed to one ſame ſubject? I have in my daies ſeene divers that have envied the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this woorthy kind of wiſedome, who perceive not, that if there be a reputation, <q>there can be no effect. Verily, lying is an ill and deteſtablevice. Nothing makes vs men, &amp; no other meanes, keeps vs bound one to another, but our word; knew we but the horror and waight of it, we would with fire and ſword purſue and hate the ſame, and more juſtly than any other crime.</q> I ſee all men generally buſied (and that verie improperly) to puniſh certaine innocent errours in children, which have neither impreſſion nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and chaſtice and vex them for raſh and fond actions. Onely lying, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſſe ſomewhat more, are the faults whoſe birth and progreſſe I would have ſeverely puniſhed and cut off; for they grow and encreaſe with them: and if the tongue have once gotten this ill habit, good Lord how hard, nay how impoſſible it is to make her leave it? whereby it enſueth, that we ſee many very honeſt men in other matters, to be ſubject and enthralled to that fault.

                        <p>So doe we ſee that in the gift of eloquence, ſome have ſuch a facility and promptitude, and that which we call vtterance, ſo eaſie and at command, that at all aſſaies, and vpon everie occaſion, they are ready and provided; and others more ſlow, never ſpeake any thing except much laboured and premeditated. As Ladies and daintie Dames are taught rules to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and bodily exerciſes, according to the advantage of what they have faireſt about them. If I were to give the like counſel, in thoſe two different advantages of eloquence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Preachers and pleading lawiers of our age ſeeme to make profeſſion; the ſlowe ſpeaker in mine opinion ſhould be the better preacher, and the other the better lawier. For ſomuch as charge of the firſt allowes-him as much leiſure as he pleaſeth to prepare him-ſelfe; moreover his cariere continueth ſtill in one kinde without interruption: whereas the Lawyers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions vrging him ſtill vpon any accident to be ready to enter the liſts: and the vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted replies &amp; anſwers of his advers partie, do often divert him from his purpoſe, where he is enforced to take a new courſe. Yet is-it, that at the laſt enter-view which was at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, our King, it hapned cleane-contrarie, where Monſieur <hi>Poyet,</hi> a man of chiefe reputation &amp; all daies of his life brought vp to plead at the bar, whoſe charge being to make an Oration before the Pope, and having long time before premeditated and con'd the ſame by roat, yea, &amp; as ſome report, brought it with him ready-penned from <hi>Paris;</hi> the very ſame day it ſhould have beene pronounced; the Pope ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting he might happily ſpeake ſomething, might offend the other Princes Ambaſſadors, that were about him, ſent the argument, which he at that time and place thought fitteſt to be treated of, to the king, but by fortune cleane contrarie to that which <hi>Poyet,</hi> had ſo much ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died for: So that his Oration was altogether fruſtrate, and he muſt preſently frame another. But he perceiving himſelfe vnable for-it, the Cardinall <hi>Bellay</hi> was faineto ſupply his place and take that charge vpon him. The Lawyers charge is much harder than the Preachers: (yet in mine opinion) ſhall we find more paſſable Lawyers then commendable Preachers at leaſt in <hi>France.</hi> It ſeemeth to be more proper to the mind, to have her operation ready &amp; ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and more incident to the judgement, to have it ſlow and conſiderate. But who remaineth mute, if he have no leiſure to prepare himſelfe, and he likewiſe to whom leiſure giveth no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſay better, are both in one ſelfe degree of ſtrangeneſſe. It is reported that <hi>Seuerus Caſſius</hi> ſpake better extempore, and without premeditation. That he was more beholding to fortune, then to his diligence; that to be interrupted in his ſpeech redounded to his profit: &amp; that his adverſaries feared to vrge-him, leſt his ſudden anger ſhould redouble his eloquence. I know this condition of nature by experience, which can-not abide a vehement and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous premeditation: except it hold a free, a voluntarie, and ſelfe-pleaſing courſe, it can never come to a good end. We commonly ſay of ſome compoſitions, that they ſmell of the oile, &amp; of the lampe, by reaſon of a certaine harſhneſſe, and rudeneſſe, which long plodding labour imprints in them that be much elaborated. But beſides the care of well-doing, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the minde, over-ſtretched to her enterpriſe, doth breake and impeach the-ſame; even as it hapneth vnto water, which being cloſely pent-in, through it's owne violence and abundance, can not finde iſſue at an open gullet. In this condition of nature, whereof I now ſpeake, this alſo is ioyned vnto it, that it deſireth not to be pricked forward by theſe ſtrong paſſions, as the anger of <hi>Caſſius</hi> (for that motion would be over-rude) it ought not to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſhaken, but yeeldingly ſolicited: it deſireth to be rouzed and prickt forward by ſtrange occaſions, both preſent and caſuall. If it goe all-alone, it doth but languiſh and loyter behinde: agitation is her life and grace. I cannot well containe my ſelfe in mine owne poſſeſſion and diſpoſition, chaunce hath more intereſt in it than my ſelfe; occaſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, yea the change of my voice, drawes more from my minde than I can finde therein, when by my ſelfe I ſecond and endevor to employ the ſame. My words likewiſe are better
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12117:15"/>
than my writings, if choiſe may be had in ſo woorthleſſe things. This alſo hapneth vnto me, that where I ſeeke my ſelfe, I finde not my ſelfe: and I finde my ſelfe more by chaunce, than by the ſearch of mine owne judgement. I ſhall perhaps have caſt-foorth ſome ſuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in writing, happily dull and harſh for another, but ſinooth and curious for my ſelfe. Let vs leave all theſe complements and quaintneſſe. That is ſpoken by everie man, according to his owne ſtrength. I have ſo loſt it, that I wot not what I would have ſaid, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have ſometimes found it before me. Had I alwaies a razor about me, where that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, I ſhould cleane raze my ſelfe out. Fortune may at ſome other time make the light thereof appeare brighter vnto me, than that of mid-day, and will make mee woonder at mine owne faltring or ſticking in the myre.</p>

                        <p>This ſo famous arte of divination of the Tuskanes grew thus. A husband-man digging very deepe into the ground, with his plough-ſhare, ſaw <hi>Tages,</hi> a demy-God appeare out of it, with an infantine face, yet fraught with an aged-like wiſedome. All men ranne to ſee-him, and both his words and knowledge were for many ages-after remembred, and collected, containing the principles and meanes of this arte. An of-ſpring ſutable to her progreſſe. I would rather direct affaires by the chance of dice, then by ſuch frivolous dreames. And truely in all common-wealthes, men have ever aſcribed much authoritie vnto lot. <hi>Plate</hi> in the policie which he imagineth by diſcretion, aſcribeth the deciding of many important effects vnto it, and amongſt other things would have marriages betweene the good to be contrived by lot. And giveth ſo large priviledges vnto this caſuall election, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the children proceeding from them to be brought vp in the countrie; and thoſe borne of the bad to be baniſhed and ſent abroad.

ſhall by fortune happen, whileſt he is growing, to ſhew ſome good hope of him-ſelfe, that he may be revoked and ſent-for backe, and ſuch amongſt the firſt as ſhall in their youth give ſmall hope of future good to be baniſhed. I ſee ſome that ſtudie, plod, and gloſſe their Almanackes, and in all accidents alleage their authoritie. A man were as good to ſay, they muſt needs ſpeake truth and lies. <q>Quis eſt enim qui totum diem iaculans, non aliquando con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineet?<note place="margin">Cic. diu. lib. 2.</note> For who is he that ſhooting all day, ſometimes hits not the white? <hi>I thinke not the better of them,</hi>
                           </q> though what they ſay proove ſometimes true. It were more certaine, if there were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a rule or a truth to lie ever. Seeing no man recordeth their fables, becauſe they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and infinit; and their praedictions are made to be of credit, becauſe they are rare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and prodigious. So anſwered <hi>Diagoras</hi> ſurnamed the Atheiſt (being in <hi>Samothrace</hi>) to him, who in ſhewing him divers vowes and offrings hanging in the Temple, brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſuch as had eſcaped ſhipwracke, ſaid thus vnto him: <hi>You that thinke the Gods to have no care of humane things, what ſay you by ſo many men ſaved by their grace and helpe? Thus is it done,</hi> anſwered he: <hi>Thoſe which were drowned farre exceeding their number, are not here ſet-forth. Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>That amongst all other Philoſophers that have avowed &amp; acknowledged the Gods, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Xenophanes, the Colophonian hath gone about to root out all maner of divination.</hi> It is ſo much the leſſe to bewondred at, if at any time we have ſeene ſome of our Princes mindes to their great damage, relie vpon ſuch like vanities. I would to God, I had with mine owne eies ſeene thoſe two wonders, mentioned in the booke of <hi>Ioachin</hi> the Abbat of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who foretold all the Popes that ſhould enſue, together with their names and ſhapes: And that of <hi>Leo</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who fore-ſpake all the Emperors and Patriarkes of <hi>Greece.</hi> This have I ſeene with mine owne eies, that in publike confuſions, men amazed at their owne fortune, give themſelves head-long, as it were to all maner of ſuperſtition, to ſearch in heaven the cauſes and ancient threats of their ill-lucke; and in my time are ſo ſtrangely ſucceſſefull therein, as they have perſwaded me, that it is an ammuſing of ſharpe and idle wits, that ſuch as are inured to this ſubtletie, by folding and vnfolding them, may in all other writings be capable to finde out what they ſeeke-after. But above all, their darke, ambiguous, fantaſticall, and propheticall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſh, mends the matter much, to which their authors never give a plaine ſenſe, that poſterity may apply what meaning and conſtruction it ſhall pleaſe vnto it. The <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Socrates</hi> was peradventure a certaine impulſion or will, which without the advice of his diſcourſe preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelfe vnto him. In a minde ſo well purified, and by continuall exerciſe of wiſedome and vertue ſo wel prepared, as his was, it is likely, his inclinations (though raſh and inconſiderate) were ever of great moment, and woorthie to be followed. Every man feeleth in himſelfe ſome image of ſuch agitations, of a prompt, vehement and caſuall opinion. It is in me to give them ſome authoritie, that affoord ſo little to our wiſedome. And I have had ſome, equally weake in reaſon, and violent in perſwaſion and diſſwaſion (which was more ordinarie to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>) by which I have ſo happily and ſo profitably ſuffred my ſelfe to be tranſported, as they might perhaps be thought to containe ſome matter of divine inſpiration.</p>

By which meanes they gained the victorie. Touching the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, it is reported, that when <hi>Darius</hi> went to ſubdue them, he ſent their King many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull ſpeeches, for ſo much as hee ever ſaw him retire and giue ground before him, and to avoide the maine battell. To whom <hi>Indathirſez</hi> (for ſo was his name) anſwered, that, <hi>They did it not for feare of him, nor any other man living, but that it was the faſhion of his nation to march thus: as having neither cities, nor houſes, nor manured land to defend, or to feare their enemies ſhould reape any commoditie by them.</hi> But if hee had ſo great a deſire to feede on them, he might draw neerer to view the place of their ancient Sepulchers, and there hee ſhould meete with whom to ſpeake his belly-full. Notwithſtanding when a man is once within reach of cannon-ſhot, and as it were point-blancke before them, as the fortune of warre doth diverſe times bring men unto, it ill beſeemeth a reſolute minde to ſtart-aſide, or be daunted, at the threat of a ſhot, becauſe by the violence and ſuddenneſſe thereof wee deeme it inevitable: and there are ſome, who by lifting up of a hand, or ſtooping their head, have ſometimes given their fellowes cauſe of laughter: yet have we ſeene, that in the voyage, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth made againſt us in <hi>Provence,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto,</hi> being gone out to ſurvay the citie of <hi>Arles,</hi> and ſhewne himſelfe out of a winde-mill, vnder colour of which he was come ſomewhat neere the Towne, he was diſcovered by the Lord of <hi>Bonevall,</hi> and the Seneſhall of <hi>Agenois,</hi> who were walking upon the Theatre <hi>Aux arenes</hi> (ſo called in French becauſe it is full of ſand) who ſhewing him to the Lord of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> Commiſſarie of the Artillerie, he mounted a culvérin ſo levell, that had not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis perceived the fire, and ſo ſtarted aſide, it was conſtantly affirmed, hee had beene ſhot through the body. Likewiſe not many yeeres before, <hi>Lorence</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> Duke of <hi>

But to ſay truth, I will never thinke theſe motions were made with diſcourſe, for what judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can you give of an aime, either high or low in a matter ſo ſudden? It may rather be thought that fortune favoured their feare: and which an other time might as well bee a meane to make them fall into the cannons-mouth, as to avoid the ſame. I cannot chuſe, if the cracke of a musket doe ſuddenly ſtreeke mine eares, in a place where I leaſt looke for it, but I muſt needs ſtart at-it: which I have ſeene happen to men of better ſort than my ſelfe. Nor doe the Stoickes meane, that the Soule of their wiſeſt man in any ſort reſiſt the firſt viſions and ſudden fantaſies, that ſurpriſe the ſame: but rather conſent that, as it were unto a naturall ſubjection, he yeelds and ſhrinks unto the loud clattering and roare of heaven, or of ſome violent downefall; for example-ſake, unto paleneſſe, and contraction. So likewiſe in other paſſions, alwaies provided, his opinion remaines ſafe and whole, and the ſituation of his reaſon, admit no tainting or alteration whatſoever: and hee no whit conſent to his fright and ſufferance. Touching the firſt part; the ſame hapneth to him, that is not wiſe, but farre otherwiſe concerning the ſecond. For the impreſſion of paſſions doth not remaine ſuperficiall in him: but rather penetrates even into the ſecret of reaſon, infecting and corrupting the ſame.

                        <p>THere is no ſubject ſo vaine, that deſerveth not a place in this rapſodie. It were a notable diſcourteſie vnto our common rules, both towards an equall, but more toward a great perſon, not to meete with you in your houſe, if he have once warned you that he will come: And <hi>Margaret</hi> Queene of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was woont to ſay to this purpoſe, <hi>That it was a kinde of incivilitie in a gentleman, to depart from his houſe, as the faſhion is, to meete with him that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him, how worthy ſoever he be: and that it more agreeth with civilitie and reſpect, to ſtay for him at home, and there to entertaine him: except it were for feare the ſtranger ſhould miſſe his way: and that it ſuffioeth to companie and waite vpon him, when he is going away againe.</hi> As for me, I oftentimes forget both theſe vaine offices; as one that endevoureth to aboliſh all maner of ceremonies in my houſe. Some will bee offended at it, what can I doe withall? I had rather offend a ſtranger once, then my ſelfe everie day; for it were a continuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. To what end doe men avoid the ſervitude of Courts, and entertaine the ſame in their owne houſes? Moreover it is a common rule in all aſſemblies, that hee who is the meaner man, commeth firſt to the place appointed, forſomuch as it belongs to the better man to be ſtaid-for, and waited vpon by the other. Nevertheleſſe we ſaw that at the enterview, prepared at <hi>Merceilles</hi> betweene Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh, and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France,</hi> the King having appointed all neceſſatie preparations, went him-ſelfe out of the Towne, and gave the Pope two or three dayes-leaſure, to make his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into it, and to refreſh himſelfe, before he would come to meete him there. Likewiſe at the meeting of the ſaid Pope with the Emperour at <hi>Bologna,</hi> the Emperour gave the Pope advantage and leaſure to be firſt there, and afterward came himſelfe. It is (ſay they) an ordinarie ceremonie at enterparlies betweene ſuch Princes, that the better man ſhould ever come firſt to the place appointed; yea before him in whoſe countrey the aſſembly is: and they take it in this ſence, that it is, becauſe this complement ſhould teſtifie, he is the better man, whom the meaner goeth to ſeeke, and that hee ſueth vnto him. Not only ech countrey, but every Citie, yea and every vocation hath his owne particular decorum. I have every carefully beene brought vp in mine infancie, and have lived in verie good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, becauſe I would not be ignorant of the good maners of our countrey of <hi>France,</hi> and I am perſwaded I might keepe a ſcoole of them.

I have often ſeene men proove vnmanerly by too much maners, and importunate by over-much curteſie. The knowledge of entertainment is otherwiſe a profitable knowledge. It is, as grace and beautie are, the reconciler of the firſt accoaſtings of ſociety and familiarity: and by conſequence, it openeth the entrance to inſtruct vs by the example of others, and to exploit and produce our example, if it have any inſtructing or communicable thing in it.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Have heretofore heard a Prince, who was a very great Captaine, hold opinion, that a ſouldier might not for cowardiſe of heart be condemned to death: who ſitting at his table heard report of the Lord of <hi>Veruins</hi> ſentence, who for yeelding vp of <hi>Bollein,</hi> was doomed to looſe his head. Verily there is reaſon a man ſhould make a difference betweene faultes proceeding from our weakeneſſe, and thoſe that grow from our malice. For in the latter we are directly bandied againſt the rules of reaſon, which nature hath imprinted in vs; and in the former it ſeemeth, we may call the ſame nature, as a warrant, becauſe it hath left-vs in ſuch imperfection and defect. So as divers nations have judged, that no man ſhould blame vs for any thing we doe againſt our conſcience. And the opinion of thoſe which condemne heretikes and miſcreants vnto capitall puniſhments, is partly grounded vpon this rule: and the ſame which eſtabliſheth, that a Iudge or an advocate may not be called to account for any matter committed in their charge through overſight or ignorance. But touching cowardiſe, it is certain, the common faſhion is, to puniſh the ſame with ignominie and ſhame. And ſome hold that this rule was firſt put in practiſe by the Law-giver <hi>Charondas,</hi> and that before him the lawes of <hi>Greece</hi> were woont to puniſh thoſe with death, who for feare did runne away from a Battell: where he onely ordained, that for three daies together, clad in womens attire, they ſhould be made to ſit in the market-place: hoping yet to have ſome ſervice at their hands, and by meanes of this reproch, they might recover their courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

                        <p>It appeareth alſo that the Romane lawes did in former times puniſh ſuch as had runaway, by death. For <hi>Animianus Marcellinus</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperor condemned tenne of his Souldiers, who in a charge againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> had but turned their backes from it; firſt to be degraded, &amp; then to ſuffer death, as he ſaith according to the ancient lawes, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, condemneth others for a like fault, vnder the enſigne of bag and baggage to be kept amongſt the common priſoners. The ſharp puniſhment of the Romanes againſt thoſe Souldiers that eſcaped from <hi>Cannae:</hi> and in the ſame warre, againſt thoſe that accompanied <hi>Ca.

Thus muſt a man indevor to induce the Architect, the Painter, the Shoomaker to ſpeake of their owne trade, and ſo of the reſt, everie man in his vocation. And to this purpoſe am I wont, in reading of hiſtories (which is the ſubject of moſt men) to conſider who are the writers: If they be ſuch as profeſſe nothing but bare learning, the chiefe thing I learne in them, is their ſtile, and language: if Phiſitians: I believe them in whatſoever they ſhall report concerning the temperateneſſe of the aire, the health and complexion of Princes, or of hurts and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: If Lawiers, we ſhould obſerve the controverſies of rights, titles, and pretenſes of lawes and cuſtomes, the eſtabliſhments of policies, and ſuch like things: If Divines, we may note the affaires of the Church, the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, diſpenſations, caſes of conſcience, and marriages: If Courtiers, maners, complements, ceremonies, and entertainements: if Warriors, what belongs vnto their charge, but chiefly the managing and conduct of the atchievements or exploits wherein they have bin themſelves in perſon: If Ambaſſadors, the negotiations, intelligences, practiſes, pollicies, and maner how to direct, complot, and conduct them. And therefore, what in an other Writer I ſhould peradventure have curſorie paſſed over, I have with ſome adviſedneſſe conſidered and marked the ſame in the hiſtorie of the Lord of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gey,</hi> a man moſt expert, and intelligent in ſuch matters: which is, that after he had exactly ſet downe and declared thoſe glorious, and farre-fetcht remonſtrances of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth made in the conſiſtorie of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the preſence of the Biſhop of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Velly,</hi> our Ambaſſadors; wherein he entermixed many bitter and outragious words againſt vs; and amongſt others, that if his Captaines and Souldiers were not of much more faithfulneſſe, and ſufficiencie in the arte of warre, then our Kings, he would forthwith tie a rope about his neck, and go aske him mercie: whereof hee ſeemed to believe ſome thing: for afterward whileſt he lived, he chanced twice or thrice to vtter the verie ſame words. Moreover, that he had challenged the king to fight with him, man to man in his ſhirt, with Rapier and Dagger in a boat. The ſaid Lord of <hi>Langey,</hi> following his ſtorie, addeth that the ſaid Ambaſſadors making a diſpatch of what had paſſed vnto the king, diſſembled the chiefeſt part vnto him, yea and concealed the two precedent articles from him. Now me thought it very ſtrange, that it ſhould lie in the power of an Ambaſſadour to diſpence with any point, concerning the advertiſements he ſhould give vnto his Maſter, namely of ſuch conſequence, comming from ſuch a perſon, and ſpoken in ſo great an aſſembly, whereas me ſeemed it ſhould have beene the office of a truſtie ſervant, truely and exactly to ſet downe things as they were, and in what manner they had ſucceeded: to the end the libertie of diſpoſing, judging and chuſing, might wholie lie in the maſter.

Howſoever it were, I would be loath to be ſo vſed in mine owne ſmall and particular buſines, we do ſo willingly vpon every ſlight occaſion and pretence neglect and forgo commandement, and are ſo farre from obeying, that we rather vſurp a kind of maſterie, and free power: every man doth ſo naturally aſpire vnto libertie and authoritie, that no profit ought to be ſo deare vnto a ſuperiour, proceeding from thoſe that ſerve him, as their ſimple and naturall obedience. Whoſoever obeieth by diſcretion, and not by ſubjection, corrupteth and abuſeth the office of commanding. And <hi>P.

In one of the encounters that <hi>Germanicus</hi> had with the Germanes, two mightie troupes were at one inſtant ſo frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with feare, that both betooke themſelves to their heeles, and ranne away two contrary waies, the one right to that place whence the other fled. It ſometimes addeth wings vnto our heeles, as vnto the firſt named, and other times it takes the vſe of feete from vs: as we may reade if <hi>Theophilus</hi> the Emperour, who in a battell he loſt againſt the Agarenes, was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12117:20"/>
ſo amazed and aſtonied, that he could not reſolve to ſcape away by flight: <hi>adeò pavor etiam auxilia formidat: Feare is ſo afraide even of that ſhould help.</hi> Vntill ſuch time as <hi>Manuel,</hi> one of the chiefe leaders in his armie, having rouzed and ſhaken him, as it were out of a dead ſleepe, ſaid vnto him, <hi>Sir, if you will not preſently follow me, I will ſurely kill you, for better were it you ſhould looſe your life, than being taken priſoner, looſe your Empire and all.</hi> Then doth ſhe ſhew the vtmoſt of her power, when for her own ſervice, ſhe caſts vs off vnto valour, which it hath exacted from our duty and honor. In the firſt ſet battell, the Romans loſt againſt <hi>Hanibal,</hi> vnder the Conſul <hi>Sempronius,</hi> a troupe of wel-nigh tenne thouſand footemen, was ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with feare, that ſeeing no other way to take, nor by what other courſe to give their baſenes free paſſage, they headlong bent their flight toward the thickeſt and ſtrongeſt ſquadron of their enemies, which with ſuch furie it rowted and brake through, as it diſranked, and ſlew a great number of the Carthaginians: purchaſing a reprochfull and diſgracefull flight, at the ſame rate it might have gained a moſt glorious victorie. It is feare I ſtand moſt in feare of. For, in ſharpneſſe it ſurmounteth all other accidents. What affection can be more violent and juſt than that of <hi>Pompeyes</hi> friends, who in his owne ſhip were ſpectators of that horrible maſſacre? yet is it, that the feare of the Aegyptian ſailes, which began to approach them, did in ſuch ſort daunt and skare them, that ſome have noted, they only buſied themſelves to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the marriners, to make what ſpeed they could, and by maine ſtrength of oares to ſave themſelves, vntill ſuch time, as being arived at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and that they were free from feare, they had leaſure to bethinke themſelves, of their late loſſe, and give their plaints and teares free paſſage, which this other ſtronger paſſion had ſuſpended and hindred.</p>

                           <hi>CIcero</hi> ſaith, that to <hi>Philoſophie is no other thing, than for a man to prepare himſelfe to death:</hi> which is the reaſon, that ſtudie and contemplation doth in ſome ſort withdraw our ſoule from vs, and ſeverally employ it from the body, which is a kind of apprentiſage and reſemblance of death; or elſe it is, that all the wiſedome and diſcourſe of the world, doth in the end reſolve vpon this point, to teach vs, not to feare to die. Truely either reaſon mockes vs, or it only aimeth at our contentment, and in fine, bends all her trauell to make vs live wel, and as the holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>at our eaſe.</hi> All the opinions of the world conclude, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is our end, how be it they take divers meanes vnto, and for it, elſe would men reject them at their firſt comming. For; who would giue eare vnto him, that for it's end would eſtabliſh our paine and diſturbance? The diſſentions of philoſophicall ſects in this caſe, are verball: <hi>Tranſcurramus ſolertiſſimas nugas: Let vs runne over ſuch over-fine fooleries, and ſubtill trifles.</hi> There is more wilfulneſſe and wrangling among them, than pertaines to a ſacred profeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what perſon a man vndertakes to act, he doth ever therewithall perſonate his owne. Although they ſay, that in vertue it ſelfe, the laſt ſcope of our aime is voluptuouſnes. It pleaſeth me to importune their eares ſtill with this word, which ſo much offends their hearing: And if it imply any chiefe pleaſure or exceeding contentments, it is rather due to the aſſiſtance of vertue, than to any other ſupply, voluptuouſnes being more ſtrong, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowie; ſturdie, and manly, is but more ſeriouſly voluptuous. And we ſhould give it the name of pleaſure, more favorable, ſweeter, and more naturall; and not terme it vigor, from which it hath his denomination. Should this baſer ſenſuality deſerue this faire name, it ſhould be by competencie, and not by privilege. I finde it leſſe voide of incommodities and croſſes, than vertue. And beſides that, her taſte is more fleeting, momentarie, and fading, ſhe hath her faſts, her eves, and her travels, and both ſweate and blood. Furthermore ſhe hath perticularly ſo many wounding paſſions and of ſo ſeverall ſorts, and ſo filthie and lothſome a ſocietie wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon her, that ſhee is equivalent to penitencie. Wee are in the wrong, to thinke her incommodities ſerve her as a provocation, &amp; ſeaſoning to her ſweetnes, as in nature one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie is vivified by another contrarie: and to ſay, when we come to vertue, that like ſucceſſes and difficulties over-whelme it, and yeeld it auſtere and inacceſſible. Where as much more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12117:21"/>
properly then vnto voluptuouſnes, they ennobled, ſharpen, animate, and raiſe that divine and perfect pleaſure, which it mediates and procureth vs. Truly he is verie vnworthie her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that counter-ballanceth her coſt to his fruit, and knowes neither the graces nor vſe of it. Thoſe who go about to inſtruct vs; how her purſuite is very hard and laborious, and her joviſance well pleaſing and delightfull: what elſe tell they vs, but that ſhee is ever vnpleaſant and irkſome? For, what humane meane did ever attaine vnto an abſolute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of it? The perfecteſt have beene content but to aſpire and approach her, without ever poſſeſſing her. But they are deceived; ſeeing that of all the pleaſures we know, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute of them is pleaſant. The enterpriſe is perceived by the qualitie of the thing, which it hath regard vnto: for it is a good portion of the effect, and conſubſtantiall. That happines and felicitie, which ſhineth in vertue, repleniſheth her approaches and appurtenances, even vnto the firſt entrance and vtmoſt barre. Now of all the benefits of vertue, the contempt of death is the chiefeſt, a meane that furniſheth our life with an eaſe-full tranquillitie, and giues vs a pure and amiable taſte of it: without which every other voluptuouſnes is extinguiſhed. Loe, here the reaſons why all rules encounter and agree with this article. And albeit they all leade vs with a common accord to deſpiſe griefe, povertie, and other accidentall croſſes, to which mans life is ſubject, it is not with an equall care: as well becauſe accidents are not of ſuch a neceſſitie, for moſt men paſſe their whole life without feeling any want or povertie, and other-ſome without feeling any griefe or ſicknes, as <hi>Xenophilus</hi> the muſitian, who lived a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixe yeares in perfect and continuall health: as alſo if the worſt happen, death may at all times, and whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe vs, cut off all other inconveniences, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

And becauſe mention is made of it in mens wils and teſtaments, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you there is none will ſet his hand to them, till the Phyſitian have given his laſt doome, and vtterly forſaken him. And God knowes, being then betweene ſuch paine and feare, with what ſound judgement they indure him. For ſo much as this ſillable ſounded ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantly in their eares, and this voice ſeemed ſo ill-boding and vnluckie, the Romans had learned to allay and dilate the ſame by a Periphraſis. In liew of ſaying, he is dead, or he hath ended his daies, they would ſay, he hath lived. So it be life, be it paſt or no, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: from whom we have borowed our phraſes <hi>quondam, alias, or late ſuch a one.</hi> It may happily be, as the common ſaying is, the time we live, is worth the mony we pay for it. I was borne betweene eleven of the clocke and noone, the laſt of Februarie 1533. according to our computation, the yeare beginning the firſt of Ianuarie. It is but a fortnight ſince I was 39. yeares old. I want at leaſt as much more. If in the mean time I ſhould trouble my thoughts with a matter ſo farre from me, it were but folly. But what? we ſee both young and olde to leave their life after one ſelfe-ſame condition. No man departs otherwiſe from it, than if he but now came to it, ſeeing there is no man ſo crazed, bedrell, or decrepite, ſo long as he remembers <hi>Met huſalem,</hi> but thinkes he may yet live twentie yeares. Moreover, ſeely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as thou art, who hath limited the end of thy daies? Happily thou preſumeſt vpon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians reports. Rather conſider the effect and experience. By the common courſe of things, long ſince thou liveſt by extraordinarie favour. Thou haſt alreadie over-paſt the ordinarie tearmes of common life: And to prove it, remember but thy acquaintances and tell me how many more of them have died before they came to thy age, than have either attained or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the ſame: yea and of thoſe that through renoune have ennobled their life, if thou but regiſter them, I will lay a wager, I will finde more that have died before they came to five and thirty yeares, than after. It is conſonant with reaſon and pietie, to take example by the humanity of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who ended his humane life at three and thirtie yeares.

It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, we ſhould not apprehend or feele ſome motions or ſtartings at ſuch imaginations at the firſt, and comming ſodainely vpon vs: but doubtleſſe, he that ſhall manage and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon them with an impartiall eye, they will aſſuredly, in tract of time, become familiar to him: Otherwiſe for my part, I ſhould be in continuall feare and agonie; for no man did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore diſtruſt his life, nor make leſſe account of his continuance: Neither can health, which hitherto I have ſo long enjoied, and which ſo ſeldome hath bin crazed, lengthen my hopes, nor any ſickneſſe ſhorten them of it. At every minute me thinkes I make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. And I vnceſſantly record vnto my ſelfe, that whatſoever may be done another day, may be effected this day. Truely hazards and dangers do little or nothing approach vs at our end: And if we conſider, how many more there remaine, beſides this accident, which in number more than millions ſeeme to threaten vs, and hang over vs; we ſhall find, that be we ſound or ſicke, luſtie or weake, at ſea or at land, abroad or at home, fighting or at reſt, <q>in the middeſt of a battell or in our beds, ſhe is ever alike neere vnto vs. <hi>Nemo altero fragilior est, nemo in craſtinum ſui certior.

                           </q> Whatſoever I have to do before death, all leaſure to end the ſame, ſeemeth ſhort vnto me, yea were it but of one houre. Some body, not long ſince turning over my writing tables, found by chance a memoriall of ſomething I would have done after my death: I told him (as indeed it was true,) that being but a mile from my houſe, and in perfect health and luſtie, I had made haſt to write it, becauſe I could not aſſure my ſelfe I ſhould ever come home in ſafety; As one that am ever hatching of mine owne thoughts, and place them in my ſelfe: I am ever prepared about that which I may be: nor can death (come when ſhe pleaſe) put me in mind of any new thing. A man ſhould ever, as much as in him lieth, be ready boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take his journey, and above all things, looke he have then nothing to do but with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

And there is nothing I deſire more to be informed of, than of the death of men: that is to ſay, what words, what countenance, and what face they ſhew at their death; and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of hiſtories, which I ſo attentively obſerve. It appeareth by the ſhuffling and hudling vp of my examples, I affect no ſubject ſo particularly as this. Were I a compoſer of bookes, I would keepe a regiſter, commented of the diverſe deaths, which in teaching men to die, ſhould after teach them to live. <hi>Dicearcus</hi> made one of that title, but of an other and leſſe profitable end. Some man will ſay to me, the effect exceedes the thought ſo farre, that there is no fence ſo ſure, or cunning ſo certaine, but a man ſhall either looſe or forget,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12117:24"/>
if he come once to that point; let them ſay what they liſt: to premeditate on it, giveth no doubt a great advantage: and is it nothing, at the leaſt to go eſo farre without diſmay or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, or without an ague? There belongs more to it: Nature herſelfe lends her hand, and gives vs courage. If it be a ſhort and violent death, we have no leaſure to feare it; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I perceive that according as I engage my ſelfe in ſickneſſe, I do naturally fall into ſome diſdaine and contempt of life. I find that I have more ado to diſgeſt this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſhall die when I am in health, than I have, when I am troubled with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: forſomuch as I have no more ſuch faſt hold on the commodities of life, whereof I begin to looſe the vſe and pleaſure, and view death in the face with a leſſe vndanted looke, which makes me hope, that the further I go from that, and the neerer I approch to this, ſo much more eaſily do I enter in compoſition, for their exchange, Even as I have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many other occurrences, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> affirmed, that often ſomethings ſeeme grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being farre from vs, than if they be neere at hand: I have found that being in perfect health, I have much more beene frighted with ſickneſſe, than when I have felt it. The jollitie wherein I live, the pleaſure and the ſtrength, make the other ſeeme ſo diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable from that, that by imagination I amplifie theſe commodities by one moitie, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them much more heauie and burthenſome, then I feele them when I have them vpon my ſhoulders. The ſame I hope will happen to me of death. Conſider we by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mutations, and daily declinations, which we ſuffer, how Nature deprives vs of the night of our loſſe and empairing: what hath an aged man left him of his youths vigor, and of his forepaſt life?</p>

                        <p>Our religion hath had no ſurer humane foundation, then the contempt of life. Diſcourſe of reaſon doth not onely call and ſummon vs vnto it. For why ſhould we feare to looſe a thing, which being loſt, cannot be moaned? but alſo, ſince we are threatned by ſo many kinds of death, there is no more inconvenience to feare them all, than to endure one: what matter is it when it commeth, ſince it is vnavoidable? <hi>Socrates</hi> anſwered one that told him, The thirty Tyrants have condemned thee to death; <hi>And Nature them,</hi> ſaid he. What fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it to carke and care ſo much, at that inſtant and paſſage from all exemption of paine and care? As our birth brought vs the birth of all things, ſo ſhall our death the end of all things. Therefore is it as great follie to weepe, we ſhall not live a hundred yeeres hence, as to waile we lived not a hundred yeeres agoe. <hi>Death is the beginning of another life.</hi> So wept we, and ſo much did it coſt vs to enter into this life; and ſo did we ſpoile vs of our ancient vaile in entring into it. Nothing can be grievous that is but once. Is it reaſon ſo long to feare, a thing of ſo ſhort time? Long life or ſhort life is made all one by death. For long or ſhort is not in things that are no more. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, there are certaine litle beaſts alongſt the river <hi>Hyſpanis,</hi> that live but one day; ſhe which dies at 8. a clocke in the morning, dies in her youth, &amp; ſhe that dies at 5. in the afternoon, dies in her decrepitude, who of vs doth not laugh, when we ſhall ſee this ſhort moment of continuance to be had in conſideration of good or ill fortune? The moſt &amp; the leaſt in ours, if we compare it with eternitie, or equall it to the laſting of mountaines, rivers, ſtars, and trees, or any other living creature, is no leſſe ridiculous. But nature compels vs to it. <hi>Depart</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>out of this world, even as you came into it. The ſame way you came from death, to life returne without paſſion or amazement, from life to death: your death is but a peece of the worlds order, and but a parcell of the worlds life.</hi>

Why doeſt thou complaine of me and of deſtinie? Doe we offer thee any wrong? is it for thee to direct vs, or for vs to governe thee? Although thy age be not come to her period, thy life is. A little man, is a whole man, as well as a great man. Neither men nor their lives are meaſured by the Ell. <hi>Chiron</hi> refuſed immortalitie, being informed of the conditions thereof, even by the God of time and of continuance, <hi>Saturne</hi> his father. Imagine truely how much an ever during life would be leſſe tollerable and more painefull to a man, then is the life which I have given him: Had you not death, you would then vnceſſantly curſe, and cry out againſt me, that I had deprived you of it. I have of purpoſe and wittingly blended ſome bitternes amongſt it, that ſo ſeeing the commoditie of it's vſe, I might hinder you from over greedily embracing, or indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calling for it. To continue in this moderation, that is neither to flie from life, nor to run to death (which I require of you) I have tempered both the one and other betweene ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; ſowrenes. I firſt taught <hi>Thales</hi> the chiefeſt of your Sages and Wiſe men, that to live &amp; die, were indifferent, which made him anſwer one very wiſely, who asked him, wherefore he died not; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is indifferent. The water, the earth, the aire, the fire, and other members of this my vniverſe, are no more the inſtruments of thy life, then of thy death. Why fearest thou thy laſt day? He is no more guiltie, and conferreth no more to thy death, then any of the others. It is not the last ſtep that cauſeth wearineſſe: it onely declares it. All daies march towards death, onely the laſt comes to it.</hi> Behold heere the good precepts of our vniverſall mother Nature. I have oftentimes bethought my ſelfe whence it proceedeth, that in times of warre, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of death (whether wee ſee it in vs or in others) ſeemeth without all compariſon much leſſe dreadfull and terrible vnto vs, then in our houſes, or in our beds, otherwiſe it ſhould be an armie of Phiſitians and whiners, and ſhe ever being one, there muſt needes bee much more aſſurance amongſt contrie-people and of baſe condition, then in others. I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, theſe fearefull lookes, and aſtoniſhing countenances wherewith we encompaſſe it, are thoſe that more amaze and terrifie vs then death: a new forme of life: the out-cries of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the wailing of women and children; the viſitation of diſmaid and ſwouning friends: the aſſiſtance of a number of pale-looking, diſtracted, and whining ſervants; a darke cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: tapers burning round about; our couch beſet round with Phiſitians and Preachers; and to conclude, nothing but horror and aſtoniſhment on every ſide of vs: are wee not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie dead and buried?

But he forgot to ſay, that mine might alſo be empaired and infected. <hi>Gallus Vibius</hi> did ſo well enure his minde to comprehend the eſſence and motions of folly, that he ſo tranſported his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from out his ſeate, as he could never afterward bring it to his right place againe: and might rightly boaſt, to have become a ſoole through wiſdome.

Wee ſweate, we ſhake, we grow pale, and we bluſh at the motions of our imaginations; and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in our beds we feele our bodies agitated and turmoiled at their apprehenſions, yea in ſuch manner, as ſometimes we are ready to yeeld vp the ſpirit. And burning youth (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though aſleepe) is often therewith ſo poſſeſſed and enfoulded, that dreaming it doth ſatisfie and enjoy her amorous deſires.</p>

It is no great woonder, that ſuch accidents doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen, for if imagination have power in ſuch things, it is ſo continually annexed, and ſo forcibly faſtened to this ſubject, that leaſt ſhe ſhould ſo often fall into the relaps of the ſame thought, and ſharpeneſſe of deſire, it is better one time for all, to incorporate this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile part vnto wenches. Some will not ſticke to aſcribe the ſcarres of King <hi>Dagobert,</hi> or the cicatrices of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> vnto the power of Imagination.

And <hi>Celſus</hi> reports of a Prieſt, whoſe ſoule was raviſhed into ſuch an extaſie, that for a long time the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained voide of all reſpiration and ſenſe. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of an other, who if hee but heard any lamentable and wailefull cries, would ſuddenly fall into a ſwone, and bee ſo forcibly carried from himſelfe, that did any chide and braule never ſo loud, pinch and thumpe him never ſo much, he could not be made to ſtirre, vntill hee came to himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

And that it was not an obſtinate conceit, or wilfull humour in him, or againſt his feeling ſenſe, it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by this, becauſe during his extaſie, he ſeemed to have neither pulſe nor breath.

For I know by experience, that ſomeone, for whom I may as well anſwer as for my ſelfe, and in whom no maner of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition either of weakeneſſe or enchantment might fall, hearing a companion of his make report of an extraordinary faint ſowning, wherein he was fallen, at ſuch a time, as he leaſt looked for it, and wrought him no ſmall ſhame, whereupon the horrour of his report did ſo ſtrongly ſtrike his imagination, as he ranne the ſame fortune, and fell into a like droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: And was thence forward ſubject to fall into like fits: So did the paſſionate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his inconvenience poſſeſſe and tyrannize him; but his fond doting was in time remedied by an other kinde of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For himſelfe avowing and publiſhing aforehand the infirmitie he was ſubject vnto, the contention of his ſoule was ſolaced vpon this, that bearing his euill as expected, his dutie thereby diminiſhed, and he grieved leſſe thereat. And when at his choice, he hath had law and power (his thought being cleered and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked, his body finding it ſelfe in his right due and place) to make the ſame to be felt, ſeized vpon, and apprehended by others knowledge: he hath fully and perfectly recovered himſelfe. If a man have once beene capable, he cannot afterward be incapable, except by a juſt and abſolute weakeneſſe. Such a michiefe is not to be feared, but in the enterpriſes, where our minde is beyond all meaſure bent with deſire and reſpect; and chiefely where opportunitie comes vnexpected and requires a ſudden diſpàtch. There is no meanes for a man to recover himſelfe from this trouble; I know ſome, who have found to come vnto it with their bodies as it were halfe glutted elſe-where, thereby to ſtupifie or allay the heat of that furie, and who through age, finde themſelves leſſe vnable, by how much more they be leſſe able: And another, who hath alſo found good, in that a friend of his aſſured him to bee provided with a counter-battery of forcible enchantments, to preſerue him in any ſuch conflict: It is not amiſſe I relate how it was.

And every time hee ſpake them he ſhould girt the ribband, which I put into his handes, and very carefully place the plate thereto faſtned, juſt vpon his kidneyes, and the whole figure, in ſuch a poſture.

I have knowne a Gentleman, who having feaſted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of very honeſt Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, in his owne houſe, by way of ſport, and in jeaſt, boaſted two or three daies after (for there was no ſuch thing) that he had made them ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Magitians are but ill reſpondents for me. So it is, that by experience wee ſee women to transferre divers markes of their fantaſies, vnto children they beare in their wombes: witnes ſhe that brought foorth a Blacke-a-more. There was alſo preſented vnto <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> an Emperour, a young girle, borne about <hi>Piſa,</hi> all ſhagd and hairy over and over, which her mother ſaid, to have beene conceived ſo, by reaſon of an image of Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> that was ſo painted, &amp; hung over her bed. That the like is in beaſtes, is witneſſed by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſheepe, and alſo by partriges and hares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that grow white by the ſnow vpon mountaines. There was lately ſeene a cat about my owne houſe, ſo earneſtly eyeing a bird, ſitting vpon a tree, that he ſeeing the Cat, they both ſo wiſtly fixed their looks one vpon another, ſo long, that at laſt, the bird tell downe as dead in the Cats pawes, either drunken by his owne ſtrong imagination, or drawne by ſome attractiue power of the Cat. Thoſe that love hawking, have happily heard the Falkners tale, who earneſtly fixing his ſight vpon a Kite in the aire, laide a wager that with the onely force of his looke, he would make it come ſtooping downe to the ground, and as ſome report did it many times. The Hiſtories I borrow, I referre to the conſciences of thoſe I take them from. The diſcourſes are mine, and holde together by the proofe of reaſon, not of experiences: each man may adde his example to them: and who hath none, conſidering the number and varietie of accidents, let him not leave to think, there are ſtore of them. If I come not well for my ſelfe, let another come for me. So in the ſtudie wherein I treat of our manners and motions, the fabulous teſtimonies, alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be likely and poſſible, may ſerve to the purpoſe, as well as the true, whether it hapned or no, be it at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> it is alwaies a tricke of humane capacitie, of which I am profitably adviſed by this report. I ſee it and reape profit by it, as well in ſhadow as in bodie. And in divers leſſons that often hiſtories affoord, I commonly make vſe of that, which is moſt rare and memorable. Some writers there are, whoſe end is but to relate the events. Mine, if I could attaine to it, ſhould be to declare, what may come to paſſe, touching the ſame. It is juſtly allowed in ſchooles, to ſuppoſe ſimilitudes, when they have none. Yet do not I ſo, and concerning that point, in ſuperſtitious religion, I exceed all hiſtoricall credit. To the examples I here ſet down, of what I have read, heard, done, or ſeene, I have ſorbid my ſelfe ſo much as to dare to change the leaſt, or alter the idleſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. My conſcience doth not falſifie the leaſt iot. I wot not whether my inſight doth. Concerning this ſubject I doe ſometimes enter into conceit, that it may well become a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, a Philoſopher, or rather men of exquiſite conſcience, and exact wiſdome, to write hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. How can they otherwiſe engage their credit vpon a popular reputation? How can they anſwer for the thoughts of vnknowne perſons? And make their bare conjectures paſſe for currant paiment? Of the actions of divers members, acted in their preſence, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to beare witnes of them, if by a judge they were put to their corporall oath.

A man would carefully teach children to hate vices of their owne genuity, and ſo diſtinguiſh the deſormity of them, that they may not onely eſchew them in their actions, but above all, hate them in their hearts: and what colourſoeuer they beare, the very conceit may ſeeme odious vnto them. I know well, that becauſe in my youth, I have ever accuſtomed my ſelfe to treade a plaine beaten path; and have ever hated to entermeddle any manner of deceipt of couſoning-craft, even in my childith ſportes (for truely it is to be noted, that Childrens playes are not ſports, and ſhould be deemed as their moſt ſerious actions.)

A French Gentleman was ever woont to blow his noſe in his hand, (a thing much againſt our faſhion) maintaining his ſo doing; and who in wittie jeaſting was very famous. He asked me on a time, what priviledge this filthie excrement had, that wee ſhould have a daintie linnen cloth or handkercher to receive the ſame; and which is woorſe, ſo carefully folde it vp, and keepe the ſame about vs, which ſhould be more loathſome to ones ſtomacke, than to ſee it caſt away, as wee doe all our other excrements and filth.

Humane reaſon is a tincture in like waight and meaſure, infuſed into all our opinions and cuſtomes, what form ſoever they be of: infinite in matter: infinite in diverſitie.

And in another country, if a Marchant chance to marrie, all other Marchants that are bidden to the wedding, are bound to lie with the bride before her husband, and the more they are in number, the more honor and commendation is hers, for conſtancie and capacitie: the like if a gentleman or an officer marrie; and ſo of all others: except it be a day-labourer, or ſome other of baſe condition; for then muſt the Lord or Prince lie with the bride; amongſt whom (notwithſtanding this abuſive cuſtome) loyaltie in married women is highly regarded, and held in ſpeciall account, during the time they are married.

The very fables of <hi>Thyestes,</hi> of <hi>Oedipus</hi> and of <hi>Macareus,</hi> hauing with the pleaſure of their ſongs infuſed this profitable opinion, in the tender conceit of children. Certes, chaftitie is an excellent vertue, the commoditie whereof is very well knowne: but to vſe it, and according to nature to prevaile with it, is as hard as it is caſie, to endeare it and to prevaile with it according to cuſtome, to lawes and precepts. The firſt and vniverſall reaſons are of a hard perſcutation. And our Maſters paſſe them over in gleaning, or in not daring ſo much as to taſte them, at firſt ſight caſt themſelves head-long into the libertie or ſanctuarie of cuſtome. Thoſe that will not ſuffer themſelves to be drawne out of his originall ſource, do alſo commit a greater error, and ſubmit themſelves to ſavage opinions, witneſſe <hi>Chryſippus;</hi> who in ſo many ſeverall places of his compoſitions, inſerted the ſmall accompt he made of conjunctions, how inceſtuous ſoever they were. Hee that will free himſelfe from this violent prejudice of cuſtome, ſhall find divers things received with an vndoubted reſolution, that have no other anker but the hoarie head and frowning wrimples of cuſtome, which ever attends them: which maske being pulled off, &amp; referring all matters to truth and reaſon, he ſhall perceive his judgement, as it were over-turned, and placed in a much ſurer ſtate. As for example, I will then aske him, what thing can be more ſtrange than to ſee a people bound to follow lawes, he never vnderſtood? Being in all his domeſticall affaires, as marriages, donations, teſtaments, purchaſes, and ſales, neceſſarily bound to coſto?mary
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12117:32"/>
rules, which forſomuch as they were never written nor publiſhed in his owne tongue, he cannot vnderſtand, and whereof he muſt of neceſſity purchaſe the interpretation and vſe. Not according to the ingenious opinion of <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> who counſelleth his King <hi>to make the Trafikes and negotiations of his ſubiests, free, enfranchized and gainefull, and their debates, centro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and quarrels burthen-ſome, and charged with great ſubſidies, and impoſitions:</hi> But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a prodigious opinion, to make open ſale, and trafficke of reaſon it ſelfe, and to give lawes a courſe of marchandize, is very ſtrange. I commend fortune, for that (as our Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans reporte) it was a Gentleman of <hi>Gaskonie,</hi> and my Countriman, that firſt oppoſed himſelf againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the great, at what time he went about to eſtabliſh the Latine and Imperiall lawes amongeſt vs. What is more barbarous than to ſee a nation, where by lawfull cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome the charge of judging is ſold, and judgements are paid for with readie money; and where juſtice is lawfully denied him, that hath not wherewithall to paie for it; and that this marchandize hath ſo great credite, that in a politicall government there ſhould be ſet vp a fourth eſtate of Lawyers, breath-ſellers, and pettifoggers, and joyned to the three ancient ſtates, to wit, the Clergie, the Nobility, and the Communaltie; which fourth ſtate having the charge of lawes, and ſometimes auctoritie of goods and lives, ſhould make a body, apart, and ſeverall from that of Nobilitie, whence double Lawes muſt follow; thoſe of honour, and thoſe of juſtice; in many things very contrarie do thoſe as rigorouſly condemne a lie pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, as theſe a lie revenged: by the law and right of armes he that putteth vp an injurie ſhalbe degraded of honour and nobilitie; and he that revengeth himſelfe of it, ſhall by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Lawe incurre a capitall puniſhment? Hee that ſhall addreſſe himſelfe to the Lawes to have reaſon for ſome offence done vnto his honour, diſhonoreth himſelfe. And who doth not ſo, is by the Lawes puniſhed and chaſtiſed. And of theſe ſo different parts, both neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe having reference to one head; thoſe having peace, theſe war committed to their charge; thoſe having the gaine, theſe the honor: thoſe knowledge, theſe vertue: thoſe reaſon, theſe ſtrength: thoſe the word, theſe action: thoſe juſtice, the ſevalour: thoſe reaſon theſe force: thoſe a long gowne, &amp; theſe a ſhort coat, in partage and ſhare. Touching indifferent things, as clothes and garments, whoſoever will reduce them to their true end, which is the ſervice and commodity of the bodie, whence dependeth their originall grace and comlines, for the moſt fantaſticall to my humour that may be imagined, amongſt others I will give them our ſquare caps; that long hood of plaited velvet, that hangs over our womens heads, with his parti-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured traile and that vaine &amp; vnprofitable modell of a member, which we may not ſo much as name with modeſtie, wherof notwithſtanding we make publike ſhew, and open demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe conſiderations do nevertheleſſe never diſtract a man of vnderſtanding from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the common guiſe? Rather on the contrary, me ſeemeth, that all ſeverall, ſtrange, and particular faſhions proceede rather of follie, or ambitious effectation, than of true reaſon: and that a wiſe man ought inwardly to retire his minde from the common preſſe, and hold the ſame liberty and power to judge freely of all things, but for outward matters, he ought abſolutely to follow the faſhions and forme cuſtomarily received. Publicke ſocietie hath nought to do with our thoughts; but for other things, as our actions, our travel, our fortune, and our life, that muſt be accommodated and left to it's ſervice and common opinions: as that good and great <hi>Socrates,</hi> who refuſed to ſave his life by diſobeying the magiſtrate, yea a magiſtrate moſt wicked and vnjuſt. For that is the rule of rules, and generall law of lawes, for every man to obſerve thoſe of the place wherein he liveth.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe which attempt to ſhake an Eſtate, are commonly the firſt overthrowne by the fall of it: he that is firſt moover of the ſame, reapeth not alwaies the fruite of ſuch troubles; he beates and troubleth the water for others to fiſh in. The contexture and combining of this monarchie, and great building, having bin diſmiſt and diſolved by it, namely in her old yeares, giveth as much overture and entrance as a man will to like injuries. Royall Majeſtie doth more hardly fall from the top to the middle, then it tumbleth downe from the middle to the bottom. But if the inventors are more damageable, the imitators are more vicious, to caſt themſelves into examples, of which they have both felt and puniſhed the horror and miſchiefe. And if there be any degree of honour, euen in ill doing, theſe are indebted to others for the glory of the invention, and courage of the firſt attempt. All ſortes of new licentiouſneſſe doe happily draw out of this originall and frutefull ſource, the images and patterns to trouble our common-wealth. We may reade in our very lawes, made for the remedie of the firſt evill, the apprentiſage and excuſe of all ſortes of wicked enterpriſes: And in favour of publikevices, they are named with new and more pleaſing words for their excuſes, baſtardizing &amp; allaying their true titles: yet it is to reforme our conſciences and our conceites, <hi>Honeſt a oratio eſt.

So nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cut of the firſt place is allowable:</hi> Yet me ſeemeth (if I may ſpeake boldely) that it argueth a great ſelfe-love and preſumption, for a man to eſteeme his opinions ſo far, that for to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them, a man muſt be faine to ſubvert a publike peace, and introduce ſo many inevitable miſchiefes, and ſo horrible a corruption of manners, as civill warres, and alterations of a ſtate bring with them, in matters of ſuch conſequence, and to bring them into his owne countrie. It is not ill husbanded to advance ſo many certaine and knowne vices, for to combate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and debatable errors? Is there any worſe kinde of vices, than thoſe which ſhocke a mans owne conſcience and naturall knowledge? The Senate durſt give this defeate in payment about the controverſies betweene it and the people for the myſterie of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: <hi>Ad deos, id magis quàm ad ſe pertinere: ipſos viſuros, ne ſacra ſuapolluantur: That that did rather belong to the Gods than to them, and the Gods ſhould looke to it, that their due rites were not polluted.</hi> A greeing with that, which the Oracle anſwered thoſe of <hi>Delphos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Chriſtian religion hath all the markes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame juſtice &amp; profit, but none more apparant then the exact commendation of obedience due vnto magiſtrates, and manutention of policies: what wonderfull example hath divine wiſedome left vs, which to eſtabliſh the well-fare of humane kinde, and to conduct this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victorie of hers againſt death and ſinne, would not do it but at the mercy of our politik order, and hath ſubmitted the progreſſe of it, and the conduct of ſo high and worthie effect, to the blindneſſe and injuſtice of our obſervations and cuſtomes, ſuffering the innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud of ſo many her favored elect to runne, and allowing a long loſſe of yeares for the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ineſtimable fruit?

It is not yet three weekes ſince I knew you, what reaſon might move you to conſpire and enterpriſe my death?</hi> The Gentleman with a faint-trembling voyce, and ſelfe-accuſing looke anſwered him, that no particular occaſion had ever moved him to that, but the intereſt of the generall cauſe of his faction, and that ſome of them had perſwaded him, that to roote out, and in what maner ſoever, to make away ſo great an enemy of their religion, would be an execution full of pietie, and a worke of ſupererogation.

Auguſtus</hi> ſeemed very glad to have found an Advocate of his humour, and having thanked his wife, and countermaunded his friends, whom he had ſummoned to the Counſell, commaunded <hi>Cinna</hi> to be brought before him alone. Then ſending all men out of his chamber, and a chaire prepared for <hi>Cinna</hi> to ſit in, he thus beſpake him: <hi>Firſt</hi> Cinna, <hi>I require to have gentle audience, and that thou wilt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt my ſpeech, which ended, I will give thee time and leaſure to anſwer me: Thou knoweſt (oh</hi> Cinna) <hi>that when I had taken thee priſoner in mine enemies campe, who wast not only become, but borne my foe; I ſaved thee, then put thee in quiet poſſeſſion of thy goods, and at last, have ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched thee, and placed thee in ſo high a degree, that even the conquerours are become envious over the conquered. The Prieſtes office, which thou beggedst at my hands, I freely beſtowed on thee, having firſt refuſed the ſame to others, whoſe fathers and friendes had in many battels ſhead their bloud for me: After all which benefites, and that I had in dutie tied thee ſo fast vnto me, thou haſt notwithſtanding vndertaken to kill me.</hi> To whom <hi>Cinna</hi> replied, crying alowde, <hi>That he had never ſo much as conceived ſo wicked a thought, much leſſe entertained the ſame. Oh</hi> Cinna, <hi>this is not according to thy promiſe,</hi> anſwered then <hi>Auguſtus, which was, that thou wouldeſt not interrupt me: What I ſay, is true, thou haſt vndertaken to murther me, in ſuch a place, on ſuch a day, in ſuch a company, and in ſuch manner: and ſeeing him ſo amazed in heart, and by his evidence ſtrucken dombe, moved thereunto, not by the condition of his promiſe, but by the guilt of his ſelfe-accuſing conſcience; why wouldeſt thou doe it, replied he, is it becauſe thou wouldeſt be Emperour?

Shortly after he gave him the Conſulſhip, blaming him that he durſt not aske it of him. And ever after held him as his deere friend, and made him alone, heire and executor of his goodes. Now after this accident, which hapned to <hi>Augustus</hi> in the xl. yeare of his age, there was never any conſpiracie or enterpriſe attempted againſt him; and he received a juſt reward
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12117:34"/>
for his ſo great clemency. But the like ſucceeded not to our Prince, for his mildneſſe and lenitie, could not ſo warrant him, but that afterward he fell into the ſnares of the like treaſon: ſo vaine and frivolous a thing is humane wiſedome: and contrary to al projects, deviſes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, &amp; precautions, fortune doth ever keepe a full ſway and poſſeſſion of all events. We count thoſe Phiſitians happy and ſucceſſefull, that ſucceſſefully end a deſperate cure, or come to a good iſſue: as if there were no other arte but theirs, that could not ſubſiſt of it ſelfe, and whoſe foundations were too feeble, to ſtand and relie vpon her owne ſtrength: and as if there were none but it, that ſtandes in neede of fortunes helpe-affoording hand, for the effecting of her operations. My conceit of it, is both the worſt and the beſt a man may imagine: for thankes be to God, there is no commerce betweene vs: I am contrary to others; for I ever deſpiſe it, and when I am ſick, in ſtead of entring into league or compoſition with it, I then beginne to hate and feare it moſt: and anſwere ſuch as vrge mee to take Phyſicke, that at leaſt they will tarie till ſuch time as I have recovered my health and ſtrength againe; that then I may the better be enabled to endure the violence and hazard of their potions. I let nature worke, and preſuppoſe vnto my ſelfe, that ſhe hath provided her ſelfe, both of teeth and clawes, to defend her ſelf from ſuch aſſaults as ſhal beſet her, and to maintaine this contexture or frame, whoſe diſſolution it ſo much hateth. In liew of bringing helpe vnto her, when ſhee moſt ſtriveth, and is combated by ſickeneſſe, I greatly feare leſt I bring ſuccor vnto her adverſarie, and ſurcharge her with new enemies. Now I conclude, that not onely in Phiſicke, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſundry more certaine artes, fortune hath great ſhare in them. The Poeticall furies, which raviſh and tranſport their Author beyond himſelfe, why ſhall we not aſcribe them to his good fortune, ſince himſelfe confeſſeth, that they exceede his ſtrength and ſufficiencie, and acknowledgeth to proceede from elſewhere, than from himſelfe, and that they are not in his power, no more than Orators ſay to have thoſe ſtrange motions and extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, that in their arte tranſport them beyond their purpoſe? The like wee ſee to bee in painting, for ſometimes the Painters hand ſhall draw certaine lines or draughts, ſo farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his conception or skill, that himſelfe is forced to enter into admiration and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But fortune yet doth much more evidently ſhewe, the ſhare ſhee hath in all their workes, by the graces and beauties that often are found in them, not only beyond the intent, but beſides the very knowledge of the workman. A heedy Reader ſhall often diſcover in other mens compoſitions, perfections farre-differing from the Authors meaning, and ſuch as haply he never dreamed of, and illuſtrateth them with richer ſenſes, and more excellent conſtructions. As for military enterpriſes, no man is ſo blinde but ſeeth what ſhare fortune hath in them: even in our counſels and deliberations, ſome chance or good lucke muſt needs be joyned to them, for whatſoever our wiſedome can effect, is no great matter. The ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and quicker it is, more weakeneſſe findes it in itſelfe, and ſo much the more doth it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt itſelfe. I am of <hi>Sillaes</hi> opinion: and when I neareſt conſider the moſt glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites of warre, me thinkes I ſee, that thoſe who have the conduct of them, employ ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſell nor deliberation about them, but for faſhion-ſake, and leave the beſt part of the enterpriſe to fortune, and on the confidence they have in her ayde, they ſtill go beyond the limits of all diſcourſe. Caſuall rejoycings, and ſtrange furies enſue among their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which for the moſt induce them to take the counſell leaſt grounded vpon apparance or reaſon, and which quaile their courage beyond reaſon; whence it hath ſucceeded vnto diverſe great Captaines, by giving credite to ſuch raſh counſels, and aleaging to their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that by ſome divine inſpiration, and other ſignes and prognoſtications, they were encouraged to ſuch and ſuch enterpriſes. Loe here wherefore in this vncertainty and perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xitie, which the impuiſſances and inabilitie doth bring vs to ſee and chuſe what is moſt commodious, for the difficulties which the divers accidents and circumſtances of everie thing drawe with them: the ſureſt way, if other conſiderations did not invite vs thereto, is, in my conceit, to follow the partie, wherein is moſt honeſtie and juſtice; and ſince a man doubteth of the neareſt way, ever to keepe the right. As in theſe two examples I have lately mentioned, there is no doubt, but that it was more commendable and generous in him, who had received the offence, to remit and pardon the ſame, than to have done otherwiſe. If the firſt had but ill ſucceſſe, his good intent is not to be blamed; and no man knoweth, had he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the contrary way, whether he ſhould have eſcaped the end, to which his deſtinie called him; and then had he loſt the glorie and commendations, of ſo ſeld-ſeene humanitie.

men poſſeſſed with this feare, are read-of in auncient Hiſtories; the greateſt part of which have followed the way of fore-running the conſpiracies, which were complotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, by revenge or tortures, but I ſee very few, that by this remedy have received any good; witneſſe ſo many Romane Emperours. Hee that perceiveth himſelfe to be in this danger, ought not much to relie vpon his power, or hope in his vigilancie. For, how hard a matter is it, for a man to warrant and ſafegard himſelfe from an enemie, that masks vnder the viſage of the moſt officious and heartie-ſeeming friend we have? And to knowe the inward thoughts and minde-concealed meanings of ſuch as daily attend, and are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with vs?

                        <p>Moreover that continuall ſuſpition, which makes the Prince to miſtruſt every body, ſhould be a wonderfull vexation to his minde.

Being yet a child, I ſaw a gentleman, who had the command of a great Citie, and by a commotion of a ſeditiouſly-furious people greatly put to his plunges, who to ſuppreſſe the riſing-fire of this tumult, reſolved to ſally out from a ſtrongly-aſſured place, where he was ſafe, and yeeld himſelfe to that many-headed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter mutinous rowt; thrived ſo ill by it, that he was miſerably ſlaine amongſt them: yet deeme I not his overſight to have beene ſo great an iſſuing out, his memorie being of moſt men condemned, as becauſe he tooke a way of ſubmiſſion, and remiſſeneſſe, and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to extinguiſh that rage and hurly-burly, rather by way of following, than of guiding, and by requiring ſute, than by demonſtrative reſolution: and I deeme a gratiouſly-milde ſeveritie, with a militarie commandement, full of confidence and ſecuritie, beſeeming his ranke, and the dignitie of his charge, had better availed him, had beene more ſucceſſefull, at leaſt with more honour, and well ſeeming comlineſſe. There is nothing leſſe to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or hoped for at the hands of this monſtrous-faced-multitude, thus agitated by furie, then humanitie and gentleneſſe; it will much ſooner receive reverence, and admit feare.

It was determined, there ſhould be a generall muſter made of divers troupes of armed men (a place fitteſt for ſecret revenges, and where they may ſafeſt be atchieved) there were moſt apparant reaſons, that the place was very vnſure, or at leaſt, to be ſuſpected, by ſuch as were to have the principall and neceſſary charge to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them. Divers counſels were propoſed, ſundry opinions heard, as in a ſubject of great difficultie, and on which depended ſo many weightie conſequences. My adviſe was, they ſhould carefully avoide to give any teſtimonie of ſuſpition, or ſhew of doubt, and that our troupes ſhould be as full as might be, and the Fyles orderly ranked, and every Souldier ſhew an vndanted carriage, and vndiſmaied countenance, and in ſtead of keeping ſome of our forces backe (which thing moſt opinions aimed at) all Captaines ſhould be put in minde to admoniſh their Souldiers to make their ſallies as orderly and as ſtrong as might be, in honour of the aſſiſtance; and ſpare no powder, which would ſerve as a gratification to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theſe ſuſpectfull troupes, which afterward cauſed a mutuall and profitable confidence.

It is not likely that ever he would have given ſo great a ſumme of mony to an vnknowne man, but in reward of a moſt profitable inſtruction; for by way of this reputaion he kept his enemies ſtill in awe. And therefore doe Princes wiſely publiſh ſuch advertiſements as they receive of the plots conſpired, and treaſons, practiſed againſt their lives and ſtates, thereby to make men beleeve, that nothing can be attempted againſt them, but they ſhall have knowledge of it. The Duke of <hi>Athens</hi> committed many fond overſights in the eſtabliſhing of his late tyrannie vpon the Florentines, but this the chiefeſt, that having received the firſt advertiſement of the Monopolies and Complots the Florentines contrived againſt him, by <hi>Mathew,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Morozo,</hi> one of the complices, thinking to ſuppreſſe this warning, and conceale that any in the Citie were offended at him, or grudged at his rule, cauſed him immediatly to be put to death. I remember to have heretofore read the ſtorie of a Romane (a man of ſpeciall dignitie) who flying the tyrannie of the <hi>Triumuirate,</hi> had many times by the ſutteltie of his invention, eſcaped thoſe who purſued him. It fortuned vpon a day, that a troupe of horſe-men, who had the charge to apprehend him, paſſing alongſt a hedge, vnder which he lay lurking, had well nigh diſcovered him; which he perceiving, and conſidering the dangers and difficulties he had ſo long endured, thinking, to ſave himſelfe from the continuall and daily ſearches that every where were made after him, and calling to minde the ſmall pleaſure he might hope of ſuch a life, and how much better it were for him to die once, than live in ſuch continuall feare and agonie, himſelfe called them, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily diſcovered his lurking hole, and that he might ridde them and himſelfe from further purſuite and care, did willingly yeeld vnto their crueltie. For a man to call his enemies to aid him, is a counſell ſomewhat raſh, yet thinke I, it were better to embrace it, than remaine ſtill in the continuall fit of ſuch a feaver that hath no remedie. But ſince the proviſions of man may apply vnto it, are full of vnquietneſſe and vncertaintie, much better is it with a full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to prepare himſelfe patiently to endure whatſoever may happen, and draw ſome comfort from that, which a man is never ſure ſhall come to paſſe.</p>

                        <p>I Have in my youth oftentimes beene vexed, to ſee a Pedant brought in, in moſt of Italian comedies, for a vice or ſporte-maker, and the nicke-name of <hi>Magiſter</hi> to be of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſignification amongſt vs. For, my ſelfe being committed to their tuition, how could I chuſe but be ſomewhat jealous of their reputation? In deed I ſought to excuſe them by reaſon of the naturall diſproportion, that is betweene the vulgar ſort, and rate and excellent men, both in judgement and knowledge: forſomuch as they take a cleane contrarie courſe one from another. But when I conſidered, the choyſeſt men were they, that moſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, I was far to ſeeke, and as it were loſt my ſelfe, witneſſe our good <hi>Bellaye:</hi>

                        <p>Yet is this cuſtome very ancient; for <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Greeke and Scholer, were amongeſt the Romans, words of reproach and imputation.</hi> And comming afterwards to yeares of more diſcretion, I have found they had great reaſon, and that, <hi>magis magnos clericos, non ſunt magis magnos ſapientes. The moſt greateſt Clarkes is not the moſt wiſeſt men.</hi> But whence it may proceed, that a minde rich in knowledge, and of ſo many things, becommeth thereby never livelier nor more quicke-ſighted; and a groſe-headed, and vulgare ſpirit, may without amendment, containe the diſcourſe and judgement of the moſt excellent wits, the world ever produced, I ſtill remaine doubtfull. To receive ſo many, ſo ſtrange, yea and ſo great wits, it muſt needs follow (ſaid once a Lady vnto me, yea one of our chiefeſt Princeſſes, ſpeaking of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12117:36"/>
                           <hi>that a mans owne wit, force, droope, and as it were diminiſh it ſelfe, to make roome for others.</hi> I might ſay, that as plants are choked by over-much moiſture, and lamps dammed with too much oyle, ſo are the actions of the mind over-whelmed by over-aboundance of matter and ſtudie: which occupied and intangled with ſo great a diverſitie of things, looſeth the mean to ſpread and cleare it ſelfe; and that ſurcharge keepeth it low-drooping and faint. But it is otherwiſe, for our mind ſtretcheth the more by how much more it is repleniſhed. And in examples of former times, the contrary is ſeene, of ſufficient men in the managing of publike affaires, of great Captaines, and notable Counſellers in matters of eſtate, to have been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall excellently wiſe. And concerning Philoſophers, retired from all publike negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have indeed ſometimes been vilified, by the comike libertie of their times, then opinions and demeanors yeelding them ridiculous. Will you make them judges of the right of a proceſſe, or of the actions of a man? They are readie for it. They enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any life yet remaining, whether any motion. Whether man be any thing but an Oxe, what working or ſuffering is; what ſtrange beaſts law and juſtice are. Speake they of the Magiſtrate, or ſpeake they vnto him? They do it with an vnreverent and vncivill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Heare they a Prince or a King commended? Hee is but a ſhepheard to them, as idle as a Swaine buſied about milking of his cattell, or ſhearing of his ſheepe: but yet more rudely. Eſteeme you any man the greater for poſſeſſing two hundred acres of land? They ſcoffe at him, as men accuſtomed to embrace all the world, as their poſſeſſion. Do you boaſt of your Nobilitie, becauſe you can blazon your deſcent of ſeaven or eight rich Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? They will but little regard you, as men that conceive not the vniverſall image of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and how many predeceſſors every one of vs hath had, both rich and poore, kings and groomes, Greekes and Barbarians. And were you lineally deſcended in the fiftieth degree from <hi>Hercules,</hi> they deeme it a vanitie to vaunt or alleadge this gift of fortune. So did the vulgare ſort diſdaine them as ignorant of the firſt and common things, and as preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inſolent. But this Platonicall luſtre is far from that which our men ſtand in need of. They were envied as being beyond the common ſort, as deſpiſing publike actions, as having propoſed vnto themſelves a particular and inimitable life, aiming and directed at certaine high diſcourſes, and from the common vſe: theſe are diſdained as men beyond the ordinary faſhion, as incapable of publike charges, as leading an vnſociable life, and profeſſing baſe and abject cuſtomes, after the vulgar kind. <hi>Odi homines ignavos opera, Philoſophos ſententia.</hi>

                           <hi>I hate men that are fooles in working, and Philoſophers in ſpeaking.</hi> As for thoſe Philoſophers, I ſay, that as they were great in knowledge, ſo were they greater in all action. And even as they report of that <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Geometrician, who being taken from his bookiſh contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſhew ſome practiſe of his skill, for the defence of his countrie, reared ſodainly certain terror-moving engines, and ſhewed effects farre exceeding all mens conceit, himſelfe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding diſdaining all this his handie-worke, ſuppoſing he had thereby corrupted the dignitie of his arte; his engines and manuall works being but the apprentiſhips, and trials of his skill in ſport. So they, if at any time they have been put to the triall of any action, they have been ſeen to flie ſo high a pitch, and with ſo loftie a flight, that men might apparantly ſee their minds and ſpirits were through the intelligence of things, become wonderfully rich and great. But ſome perceiving the ſeat of politike government poſſeſſed by vnworthy and incapable men, have withdrawne themſelves from it. And hee who demaunded of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> how long men ſhould Philoſophize, received this anſwere, vntill ſuch time as they who have the conduct of our Armies be no longer blockiſh aſſes. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> reſigned the roial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto his brother. And to the Epheſians, who reproved him for ſpending his time in playing with children before the temple: hee anſwered, And is it not better to doe ſo, then to governe the publike affaires in your companie? Others having their imagination pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced beyond fortune and the world, found the ſeat of juſtice, and the thrones of Kings, to be but baſe and vile. And <hi>Empedocles</hi> refuſed the royaltie, which the <hi>Agrigentines</hi> offered him. <hi>Thales</hi> ſometimes accuſing the carke and care men tooke about good husbandry, and how to grow rich; ſome replied vnto him, that he did as the Fox, becauſe he could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it himſelfe: which hearing, by way of ſport he would needs ſhew by experience how he could at his pleaſure become both thriftie and rich; and bending his wits to gaine and profit, erected a traffike, which within one yeare brought him ſuch riches, as the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt in the trade of thriving, could hardly in all their life deviſe how to get the like. That
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12117:37"/>
which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reporteth of ſome, who called both him, and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and ſuch like men, wiſe, and not prudent, becauſe they cared not for things more profitable: beſides, I do not verie well digeſt this nice difference of words, that ſerveth my find-fault people for no excuſe: and to ſee the baſe and needie fortune, wherewith they are content, we might rather have juſt cauſe to pronounce them, neither wiſe nor prudent. I quit this firſt reaſon, and thinke it better to ſay, that this evill proceedeth from the bad courſe they take to follow ſciences; and that reſpecting the manner we are inſtructed in them, it is no wonder if neither Schollers nor Maſters, howbeit they proove more learned, become no whit more ſufficient. Verily the daily care, and continuall charges of our fathers, aymeth at nothing ſo much, as to ſtore our heads with knowledge and learning; as for judgement and vertue, that is never ſpoken of. If a man paſſe by, crie out to our people; <hi>Oh what a wiſe man goeth yonder? And of another: Oh what a good man is yonder?</hi> He will not faile to caſt his eyes and reſpect toward the former. A third crier were needfull, to ſay, <hi>Oh what blocke-heads are thoſe!</hi> We are ever readie to aske, <hi>Hath he any skill in the Greeke and Latine tongue? can he write well? doth hee write in proſe or verſe?</hi> But whether hee be growne better or wiſer, which ſhould be the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of his drift, that is never ſpoken of, we ſhould rather enquire who is better wiſe, then who is more wiſe. We labour, and toyle, and plod to fill the memorie, and leave both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conſcience emptie. Even as birds flutter and skip from field to field to pecke vp corne, or any graine, and without taſting the ſame, carrie it in their bils, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to feed their little ones; ſo do our pedants gleane and picke learning from bookes, and never lodge it further then their lips, onely to degorge and caſt-it to the wind. It is ſtrange how fitly ſottiſnneſſe takes hold of mine example. Is not that which I doe in the greateſt part of this compoſition, all one and ſelfe ſame thing? I am ever heer and there picking and culling, from this and that booke, the ſentences that pleaſe me, not to keepe them (for I have no ſtore-houſe to reſerve them in) but to tranſport them into this: where, to ſay truth, they are no more mine, then in their firſt place: we are (in mine opinion) never wiſe, but by preſent learning, not by that which is paſt, and as little by that which is to come. But which is worſe, their Schollers, and their little ones are never a whit the more fed or better nouriſhed: but paſſeth from hand to hand, to this end onely, thereby to make a glorious ſhew, therewith to entertaine others, and with it's helpe to frame ſome quaint ſtories, or prettie tales, as of a light and counterfeit coyne, vnprofitable for any vſe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but to reckon and caſt acompts. <hi>Apud alios loqui didicerunt, non ipſi ſecum.

A Peroquet would ſay as much. This faſhion puts me in mind of that rich Romane, who to his exceeding great charge had beene verie induſtrious to finde out the moſt ſufficient men in all ſciences, which he continually kept about him, that if at any time, occaſion ſhould bee moved amongſt his friends to ſpeake of any matter pertaining to Schollerſhip, they might ſupplie his place, and be readie to aſſiſt him: ſome with diſcourſe, ſome with a verſe of <hi>Homer,</hi> otherſome with a ſentence, eachone according to his skill or profeſſion; who perſwaded himſelfe that all ſuch learning was his owne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was contained in his ſervants minds.

See but one of theſe our vniverſitie men or bookiſh ſchollers returne from ſchoole, after he hath there ſpent ten or twelve yeares vnder a Pedants charge: who is ſo vnapt for any matter? who ſo vnfit for any companie? who ſo to ſeeke if he come into the world? all the advantage you diſcover in him, is, that his Latine and Greeke, have made him more ſottiſh, more ſtupide, and more preſumptuous, then before he went from home. Whereas he ſhould returne with a mindfull-fraught, he returnes with a wind-puft conceit: in ſtead of plum-feeding the ſame, he hath onely ſpunged it vp with vanitie. Theſe Maſters, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaketh of Sophiſters (their coſin germanes) of all men, are thoſe, that promiſe to be moſt profitable vnto men, and alone, amongſt all, that not onely amend not what is committed to their charge, as doth a carpenter or a maſon, but empaire and deſtroy the ſame, and yet they muſt full dearely be paied. If the law which <hi>Protagoras</hi> propoſed to his diſciples, were followed, which was, that either they ſhould pay-him according to his word, or ſweare in the temple, how much they eſteemed the profit they had received by his diſcipline, and accordingly ſatisfie him for his paines, my Pedagogues would be aground, eſpecially if they would ſtand to the oath of my experience. My vulgar Perigordin-ſpeech doth verie pleaſantly terme ſuch ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited wiſards, Letter-ferits, as if they would ſay letter ſtrucken men, to whom (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying is) letters have given a blow with a mallet. Verily for the moſt part they ſeeme to be diſtracted even from common ſenſe. Note but the plaine husbandman, or the vnwilie ſhoomaker, and you ſee them ſimply and naturally plod on their courſe, ſpeaking onely of what they know, and no further; whereas theſe letter-puft pedants, becauſe they would faine raiſe themſelves aloft, and with their litterall doctrine which floteth vp and downe the ſuperficies of their braine, arme themſelves beyond other men, they vnceſſantly intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and entangle themſelves: they vtter loftie words, and ſpeake golden ſentences, but ſo that another man doth place, fit, and applie them.

And I naturally hate our people, that will more hardly endure a long roabe vncuriouſly worne, then a croſſe skittiſh mind: &amp; that obſerve what leg, or reverence he makes, note his garbe or demeanor, view his boots, or his hat, and marke what maner of man he is. For his inward parts, I deeme him to have been one of the moſt vnſpotted and truly honeſt minds that ever was. I have ſundry times of purpoſe vrged him to ſpeake of matters furth eſt from his ſtudy, wherein he was ſo cleare-ſighted, and could with ſo quicke an apprehenſion conceive, and with ſo ſound a judgement diſtinguiſh them, that he ſeemed never to have profeſſed or ſtudied other facultie then warre, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate.

The minds of which people being both by naturall inclination, by example, and familiar inſtitution, of the baſeſt ſtampe, do falſely reap the fruit of learning. For it is not in hir power to give light vnto the mind, that hath none, nor to make a blind man to ſee. The myſterie of it is not to affoord him ſight, but to direct it for him, to addreſſe his goings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies provided he have feet of his owne, and good, ſtraite, and capable legs. Knowledge is an excellent drug, but no drug is ſufficiently ſtrong to preſerve it ſelfe without alteration or corruption, according to the fault of the veſſell, that containes it. Some man hath a cleare ſight, that is not right-ſighted; and by conſequence ſeeth what good is, and doth not follow it; and ſeeketh knowledge, but makes no vſe of it. The chiefeſt ordinance of <hi>Plato</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is, to give vnto his Citizens their charge, according to their nature. Nature can do all, and doth all. The crookt backt, or deformed, are vnfit for any exerciſe of the bodie, and crooked and miſhappen minds vnproper for exerciſes of the minde. The baſtard and vulgar ſort are vnworthy of Philoſophie. When we ſee a man ill ſhod, if he chaunce to be a Shoomaker, wee ſay it is no wonder, for commonly none goes worſe ſhod then they. Even ſo it ſeemes, that experience doth often ſhew vs, a Phiſitian leſſe healthy, a Divine leſſe reformed, and moſt commonly a Wiſeman leſſe ſufficient then an other. <hi>Ariſto Chius</hi> had heeretofore reaſon to ſay, that Philoſophers did much hurt to their auditors, foraſmuch as the greateſt number of minds are not apt to profit by ſuch inſtructions, which, if they take not a good, they will follow a bad courſe: <gap reason="foreign">

Their ſpeciall charge was firſt to ſhapen his limmes and bodie, goodly, and healthy; and at ſeaven yeares of age, they inſtructed and inured him to ſit on horſebacke, and to ride a hunting: when he came to the age of fourteene, they delivered him into the hands of foure men, that is to ſay, the wiſeſt, the juſteſt, the moſt temperate, and the moſt valiant of all the nation. The firſt taught him religion; the ſecond, to be ever vpright and true; the third, to become Maſter of his owne deſires; and the fourth, to feare nothing.

And then vndertaking to ſpeake indifferently of all that preſents it ſelfe vnto my fantaſie, and having nothing but mine owne naturall meanes to imploy therein, if it be my hap (as commonly it is) among good Authors, to light vpon thoſe verie places which I haue vndertaken to treat off, as even now I did in <hi>Plutarke,</hi> reading his diſcourſe of the power of imagination, wherein in regard of thoſe wiſe men, I acknowledge my ſelfe ſo weake, and ſo poore, ſo dull and groſe-headed, as I am forced both to pittie and diſdaine my ſelfe, yet am I pleaſed with this, that my opinions have often the grace to jumpe with theirs, and that I follow them a loofe off, and thereby poſſeſſe at leaſt, that which all other men have not; which is, that I know the vtmoſt difference betweene them and my ſelfe: all which notwithſtanding I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my inventions to run abroad, as weake and faint, as I have produced them, without bungling and botching the faults, which this compariſon hath diſcovered to me in them.

humours: The Philoſopher <hi>Chriſippus</hi> was wont to foiſt-in amongſt his bookes, not onely whole ſentences, and other long long diſcourſes, but whole bookes of other Authors, as in one, he brought in <hi>Euripides</hi> his <hi>Medea.</hi> And <hi>Appollodorus</hi> was wont to ſay of him, that if one ſhould draw from out his bookes, what he had ſtolne from others, his paper would remaine blanke. Where as <hi>Epicurus</hi> cleane contrarie to him in three hundred volumes, he left behind him, had not made vſe of one allegation. It was my fortune not long ſince to light vpon ſuch a place: I had languiſhingly traced after ſome French words, ſo naked and ſhallow, and ſo void either of ſence or matter, that at laſt I found them to be nought but meere French words; and after a tedious and weariſome travell, I chanced to ſtumble vpon an high, rich, and even to the clouds-raiſed piece, the deſcent whereof had it been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more pleaſant or eaſie, or the aſcent reaching a little further, it had been excuſable, and to be borne-withall; but it was ſuch a ſteepie downe-fall, and by meere ſtrength he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen out of the maine rocke, that by reading of the firſt ſixe words, me thought I was carried into another world: whereby I perceive the bottome whence I came to be ſo low and deep, as I durſt never more adventure to go through it; for, if I did ſtuffe any one of my diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with thoſe rich ſpoiles, it would manifeſtly cauſe the ſottiſhneſſe of others to appeare. To reprove mine owne faults in others, ſeemes to me no more vnſufferable, then to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend (as I doe often) thoſe of others in my ſelfe. They ought to be accuſed everywhere, and have all places of Sanctuarie taken from them: yet do I know how over-boldly, at all times I adventure to equall my ſelfe vnto my filchings, and to march hand in hand with them; not without a fond-hardie hope, that I may perhaps be able to bleare the eyes of the judges from diſcerning them. But it is as much for the benefit of my application, as for the good of mine invention and force. And I doe not furiouſly front, and bodie to bodie wreſtle with thoſe old champions: it is but by ſleights, advantages, and falſe-offers I ſeek to come within them, and if I can, to give them a fall. I do not raſhly take them about the necke, I do but touch them, nor do I go ſo far as by my bargaine I would ſeeme to doe; could I but keepe even with them, I ſhould then be an honeſt man; for I ſeeke not to venture on them, but where they are ſtrongeſt. To doe as I have ſeen ſome, that is, to ſhroud themſelves vnder others armes, not daring ſo much as to ſhow their fingers ends vnarmed, and to botch vp all their works (as it is an eaſie matter in a common ſubiect, namely for the wiſer ſort) with anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inventions, heere and there hudled-vp together. And in thoſe who endevored to hide what they have filched from others, and make it their owne, it is firſt a manifeſt note of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, then a plaine argument of cowardlineſſe; who having nothing of any worth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make ſhow of, will yet vnder the countenance of others ſufficiencie goe about to make a faire offer: Moreover (oh great fooliſhneſſe) to ſeek by ſuch coſening tricks to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall the ignorant approbation of the common ſort, nothing fearing to diſcover their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to men of vnderſtanding (whoſe praiſe onely is of value) who will ſoone trace out ſuch borrowed ware. As for me, there is nothing I will doe leſſe. I never ſpake of others, but that I may the more ſpeake of my ſelfe. This concerneth not thoſe mingle-mangles of many kinds of ſtuffe, or as the Grecians call them <hi>Rapſodies,</hi> that for ſuch are publiſhed, of which kind I have (ſince I came to yeares of diſcretion) ſeen divers moſt ingenious and wittie; amongſt others, one vnder the name of <hi>Capilupus;</hi> beſides many of the ancient ſtampe.

Some having read my precedent Chapter, told me not long ſince in mine owne houſe, I ſhould ſomewhat more have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my ſelfe in the diſcourſe concerning the inſtitution of children. Now (Madam) if there were any ſufficiencie in me, touching that ſubiect, I could not better imploy the ſame, then to beſtow it as a preſent vpon that little lad, which ere long threatneth to make a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie iſſue from out your honorable wombe: for (Madame) you are too generous to begin

And having had ſo great a part in the conduct of your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull marriage, I may challenge ſome right and intereſt in the greatneſſe and proſperitie of all that ſhall proceed from it: moreover, the ancient and rightfull poſſeſſion, which you from time to time have ever had, and ſtill have over my ſervice, vrgeth me with more then ordinarie reſpects, to wiſh all honour, well-fare and advantage to whatſoever may in any ſort concerne you and yours. And truely, my meaning is, but to ſhew, that the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, and importing all humane knowledge, ſeemeth to be in this point, where the nurture and inſtitution of young children is in queſtion. For, as in matters of husbandrie the labor that muſt be vſed before ſowing, ſetting, and planting, yea in planting it ſelfe, is moſt certaine and eaſie. But when that which was ſowen, ſet, and planted, commeth to take life; before it come to ripeneſſe, much adoe, and great varietie of proceeding belongeth to it. So in men, it is no great matter to get them, but being borne, what continuall cares, what diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, what doubts and feares, doe daily waite on their parents and tutors, before they can be nurtured and brought to any good? The fore-ſhew of their inclination whileſt they are young is ſo vncertaine, their humours ſo variable, their promiſes ſo changing, their hopes ſo falſe, and their proceedings ſo doubtfull, that it is very hard, (yea for the wiſeſt) to ground any certaine judgement, or aſſured ſucceſſe vpon them.

                        <p>Madame, Learning joyned with true knowledge is an eſpeciall and gracefull ornament, and an implement of wonderfull vſe and conſequence, namely in perſons raiſed to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fortune, wherein you are. And in good trueth, learning hath not her owne true forme, nor can ſhe make ſhew of her beauteous lineaments, if ſhe fall into the hands of baſe and vile perſons. [For, as famous <hi>Torquato Taſſo</hi> ſaith; Philoſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phie being a rich and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queene, and knowing her owne worth, graciouſly ſmileth vpon, and lovingly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Princes and noble men, if they become ſuters to her, admitting them as her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gently affoording them all the favours ſhe can; whereas vpon the contrarie, if ſhe be wooed, and ſued vnto by clownes, mechanicall fellowes, and ſuch baſe kind of people, ſhe holds hir ſelfe diſparaged and diſgraced, as holding no proportion with them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee we by experience, that if a true Gentleman, or nobleman follow hir with any atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wooed her with importunitie, he ſhall learne and know more of hir, and proove a better ſcholler in one yeare, then an vngentle, or baſe fellow ſhal in ſeaven, though he purſue hir never ſo attentively.] She is much more readie and fierce to lend hir furtherance and direction in the conduct of a warre, to attempt honorable actions, to command a people, to treat a peace with a prince of forraine nation, then ſhe is to forme an argument in Logick, to deviſe a Syllogiſine, to canvaſe a caſe at the barre, or to preſcribe a receit of pills. So (noble Ladie) forſomuch as I cannot perſwade my ſelfe, that you will either forget or neglect this point, concerning the inſtitution of yours, eſpecially having taſted the ſweetneſſe thereof, and being deſcended of ſo noble and learned a race. For we yet poſſeſſe the learned compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ancient and noble Earles of <hi>Foix,</hi> from out whoſe heroicke loynes your husband and you take your of-ſpring. And <hi>Francis</hi> Lord of <hi>Candale</hi> your worthie vnckle, doth daily bring forth ſuch fruits thereof, as the knowledge of the matchleſſe qualitie of your houſe ſhall hereafter extend it ſelfe to many ages; I will therefore make you acquainted with one conceit of mine, which contrarie to the common vſe I hold, and that is all I am able to affoord you, concerning that matter. The charge of the Tutor, which you ſhall appoint your ſonne, in the choice of whom conſiſteth the whole ſubſtance of his education and

bringing-vp; on which are many branches depending, which (foraſmuch as I can adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any moment to it) I will not touch at all. And for that point, wherein I preſume to adviſe him, he may ſo far forth give credite vnto it, as he ſhall ſee juſt cauſe. To a gentleman borne of noble parentage, and heire of a houſe, that aymeth at true learning, and in it would be diſciplined, not ſo much for gaine or commoditie to himſelfe (becauſe ſo abject an end is far vnworthie the grace and favour of the Muſes, and beſides, hath a regard or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of others) nor for externall ſhew and ornament, but to adorne and enrich his inward minde, deſiring rather to ſhape and inſtitute an able and ſufficient man, then a bare learned man. My deſire is therefore, that the parents or overſeers of ſuch a gentleman be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and carefull in chuſing his director, whom I would rather commend for having a well compoſed and temperate braine, then a full ſtuft head, yet both will doe well. And I would rather prefer wiſedome, judgement, civill cuſtomes, and modeſt behaviour, then bare and meere litterall learning; and that in his charge he hold a new courſe.

of his bodie: and to thinke that the mind is together with the ſame exerciſed, and not the contrarie? As for other matters, this inſtitution ought to be directed by a ſweet-ſevere mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Not as ſome doe, who in liew of gently-bidding children to the banquet of letters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them with nothing but horror and crueltie. Let me have this violence and compulſion removed, there is nothing that, in my ſeeming, doth more baſtardiſe and dizzie a wel-borne, and gentle nature: If you would have him ſtand in awe of ſhame and puniſhment, doe not ſo much enure him to-it: accuſtome him patiently to endure ſweat and cold, the ſharpneſſe of the wind, the heat of the ſunne, and how to deſpiſe all hazards. Remove from him all niceneſſe and quaintneſſe in clothing, in lying, in eating, and in drinking: faſhion him to all things; that he prove not a faire and wanton-puling boy, but a luſtie and vigorous boy: When I was a child, being a man, and now am old, I have ever judged &amp; believed the ſame. But amongſt other things, I could never away with this kind of diſcipline vſed in moſt of our Colledges. It had peradventure been leſſe-hurtfull, if they had ſomewhat inclined to mildneſſe, or gentle intreatie. It is a verie priſon of captivated youth, and proves diſſolute, in puniſhing it before it be ſo. Come vpon them when they are going to their leſſon, and you heare nothing but whipping and brawling, both of children tormented, and maſters beſotted with anger and chafing. How wide are they, which go about to allure a childs mind to go to his booke, being yet but tender and fearefull, with a ſtearne-frowning countenance, and with hands-full of rods? Oh wicked and pernicious manner of teaching! which <hi>Quintillian</hi> hath verie well noted, that this imperious kind of authoritie, namely, this way of puniſhing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, drawes many dangerous inconveniences with-in. How much more decent were it, to ſee their ſchool-houſes and formes ſtrewed with greene boughes and flowers, then with bloodie burchen-twigs? If it lay in me, I would do as the Philoſopher <hi>Speuſippus</hi> did, who cauſed the pictures of Gladneſſe and Ioy, of <hi>Flora,</hi> and of the Graces, to be ſet-vp round about his ſchool-houſe. Where their profit lieth, there ſhould alſo be their recreation. Thoſe meats ought to be ſugred-over, that are healthfull for childrens ſtomakes, and thoſe made bitter that are hurtfull for them. It is ſtrange to ſee how carefull <hi>Plato</hi> ſheweth himſelfe in framing of his lawes about the recreation &amp; paſtime of the youth of his Citie, and how far he extends himſelfe about their exerciſes, ſports, ſongs, leaping, and dancing, wherof he faith, that ſevere antiquitie gave the conduct and patronage vnto the Gods themſelves, namely, to <hi>Apollo,</hi> to the Muſes, and to <hi>Munerva.</hi> Marke but how far-forth he endevoreth to give a thouſand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to be kept in his places of exerciſes both of bodie and mind. As for learned Sciences, he ſtands not much vpon them, and ſeemeth in particular to commend Poeſie, but for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickes-ſake. All ſtrangeneſſe and ſelfe particularitie in our manners, and conditions, is to be ſhunned, as an enemie to ſocietie and civill converſation. Who would not be aſtoniſhed at <hi>Demophons</hi> complexion, chiefe ſteward of <hi>Alexanders</hi> houſhold, who was wont to ſweat in the ſhadow, and quiver for cold in the ſunne? I have ſeene ſome to ſtartle at the ſmell of an apple, more then at the ſhot of a peece; ſome to be frighted with a mouſe, ſome readie to caſt their gorge at the ſight of a meſſe of creame, and others to be ſcared with ſeeing a fether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſhaken: as <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who could not abide to ſee a cock, or heare his crowing. There may happily be ſome hidden propertie of nature, which in my judgement might eaſilie be removed, if it were taken in time. Inſtitution hath gotten this vpon me (I muſt confeſſe with much a doe) for, except beere, all things elſe that are mans foode agree indifferently with my taſte. The bodie being yet ſouple, ought to be accommodated to all faſhions and cuſtomes; and (alwaies provided, his appetites &amp; deſires be kept vnder) let a yong man boldly be made fit for all Nations and companies-yea, if need be, for all diſorders and ſorfetings; let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himſelfe with all faſhions; That he may be able to doe all things, and love to do none but thoſe that are commendable. Some ſtrict Philoſophers commend not, but rather blame <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> for looſing the good favour of his Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> only becauſe he would not pledge him as much as he had drunke to him. He ſhall laugh, jeſt, dallie, and debauch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his Prince. And in his debauching, I would have him out-go all his fellowes in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and conſtancie, and that he omit not to doe evill, neither for want of ſtrength or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but for lacke of will. <hi>Multum intereſt, vtrum peccare quis nolit, aut neſctat.

The world is nothing but babling and words, and I never ſaw man, that doth not rather ſpeake more than he ought, then leſſe. Notwithſtanding halfe our age is conſumed that way. We are kept foure or five yeares learning to vnderſtand bare words, and to joine them into clauſes, then as long in proportioning a great bodie extended into foure or five parts; and five more at leaſt, ere we can ſuccinctly know how to mingle, joine, &amp; interlace them handſomly into a ſubtil faſhion, and into one coherent orbe. Let-vs leave-it to thoſe, whoſe profeſſion is to doe nothing elſe. Being once on my journey toward <hi>Orleans,</hi> it was my chance to meet vpon that plaine that lieth on this ſide <hi>Clery,</hi> with two Maſters of Arts, traveling toward <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> about fiftie paces one from another far-off behind them, I deſcride a troupe of horſemen, their Maſter riding formoſt, who was the Earle of <hi>Rochefocault;</hi> one of my ſervants enquiring
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12117:47"/>
of the firſt of thoſe Maſters of artes, what Gentleman he was that followed him; ſuppoſing my ſervant had meant his fellow-ſcholler, for he had not yet ſeen the Earles traine, anſwered pleaſantly, <hi>He is no gentleman Sir, but a Gramarian, and I am a Logitian.</hi> Now, we that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe ſeek not to frame a Gramarian, nor a Logitian, but a compleat gentleman, let vs give them leave to miſpend their time; we have elſe-where, and ſomewhat elſe of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to doe. So that our Diſciple be well and ſufficiently ſtored with matter; words will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low apace, and if they will not follow gently, he ſhall hale them-on perforce. I heare ſome excuſe themſelves, that they cannot expreſſe their meaning, and make a ſemblance that their heads are ſo full-ſtuft with many goodly things, but for want of eloquence they can neither vtter nor make ſhew of them. It is a meere fopperie.

Let me vſe none other then are ſpoken in the hals of <hi>Paris.

The greater number of Readers, becauſe they have found one ſelfe-ſame kind of gowne, ſuppoſe moſt falſly to holde one like bodie. Outward garments and cloakes may be borrowed, but never the ſinews and ſtrength of the bodie. Moſt of thoſe that converſe with me, ſpeake like vnto theſe Eſſayes; but I know not whether they thinke alike.

                           </gap>, who reſpected nothing more then the language. Yet can no man ſay, but that to ſpeake well, is moſt gracious and commendable, but not ſo excellent as ſome make it: and I am grieved to ſee how we imploy moſt part of our time about that onely. I would firſt know mine owne tongue perfectly, then my neighbours with whom I have moſt commerce. I muſt needs acknowledge, that the Greeke and Latine tongues, are great ornaments in a gentleman, but they are purchaſed at over-high a rate. Vſe-it who liſt, I will tell you how they may be gotten better cheape, and much ſooner then is ordinarily vſed, which was tried in my ſelfe. My late father, having by all the meanes and induſtrie, that is poſſible for man, ſought amongſt the wiſeſt, and men of beſt vnderſtanding, to find a moſt exquiſite and readie way of teaching, being adviſed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences then in vſe; was given to vnderſtand, that the lingring while, and beſt part of our youth, that we imploy in learning the tongues, which coſt them nothing, is the only cauſe we can never attaine to that abſolute perfection of skill and knowledge, of the Greekes, and Romanes. I doe not believe that to be the onely cauſe. But ſo it-is, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient my father found-out, was this; that being yet at nurſe, and before the firſt looſing of my tongue, I was delivered to a Germaine (who died ſince, a moſt excellent Phiſitian in <hi>France</hi>) he being then altogether ignorant of the French tongue, but exquiſitely readie and skilfull in the Latine. This man, whom my Father had ſent-for of purpoſe, and to whom he gave verie great intertainment, had me continually in his armes, and was mine onely overſeer. There were alſo iojned vnto him two of his countrimen, but not ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; whoſe charge was to attend, and now and then, to play with me; and all theſe together did never intertaine me with other then the Latine tongue. As for others of his houſhold, it was an inviolable rule, that neither himſelfe, nor my mother, nor man, nor maide-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, were ſuffered to ſpeake one word in my companie, except ſuch Latine words, as every one had learned to chat and prattle with me, It were ſtrange to tell how euery one in the houſe profited therein. My Father and my Mother learned ſo much Latine, that for a neede they could vnderſtand-it, when they heard-it ſpoken, even ſo did all the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſervants, namely ſuch as were neereſt and moſt about-me. To be ſhort, we were all ſo Latinized, that the townes round about vs had their ſhare of-it; inſomuch as even at this day, many Latine names both of workmen and of their tooles, are yet in vſe among them. And as for my ſelfe, I was about ſix yeares old, and could vnderſtand no more French or Perigordine, then Arabike, and that without arte, without bookes, rules, or gramer, without whipping or whining. I had gotten as pure a Latine tongue as my Maſter could ſpeake; the rather becauſe I could neither mingle or confound the ſame with other tongues. If for an Eſſay they would give me a Theame, whereas the faſhion in Colledges is, to give it in French, I had it in bad Latine, to reduce the ſame into good. And <hi>Nicholas Grucchi,</hi>

And <hi>Buchanan,</hi> who afterward I ſaw attending on the Marſhall of <hi>Briſſacke,</hi> told me, he was about to write a treatiſe of the inſtitution of children, and that he tooke the model and patterne from mine: for, at that time he had the charge and bringing vp of the yong Earle of <hi>Briſſack,</hi> whom ſince we have ſeene proove ſo woorthy and ſo valiant a captaine. As for the Greeke, wherein I have but ſmall vnderſtanding, my father purpoſed to make me learne-it by arte; But by new and vncuſtomed meanes, that is, by way of recreation and exerciſe. We did toſſe our declinations, and conjugations to and fro, as they do, who by way of a certaine game at tables learne both Arithmetike and Geometrie. For, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he had eſpecially beene perſwaded to make me taſte and apprehend the fruits of dutie and ſcience by an vnforced kinde of will, and of mine owne choice; and without any compulſion or rigor to bring me vp in all mildeneſſe and libertie: yea with ſuch kinde of ſuperſtition, that, whereas ſome are of opinion, that ſuddenly to awaken yoong children, and as it were by violence to ſtartle and fright them out of their dead ſleepe in a morning (wherein they are more heavie and deeper plunged then we) doth greatly trouble and diſtemper their braines, he would every morning cauſe me to be awakened by the ſound of ſome inſtrument; and I was never without a ſervant; Who to that purpoſe attended vpon me. This example may ſerve to judge of the reſt; as alſo to commend the judgement and tender affection of ſo carefull and loving a father: who is not to be blamed, though hee reaped not the fruites anſwerable to his exquiſite toyle, and painefull manuring. Two things hindered the ſame; firſt the barrenneſſe and vnfit ſoyle: for howbeit I were of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

What I ſaw, I ſaw it perfectly; and vnder this heavy, and as it were Lethe-complexion did I breed hardie imaginations, and opinions farre-above my yeares. My ſpirit was very ſlow, and would goe no further then it was led by others; my apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on blockiſh, my invention poore; and beſides, I had a marvelous defect in my weake me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: it is therefore no woonder, if my father could never bring me to any perfection. Secondly, as thoſe that in ſome dangerous ſickneſſe, moved with a kind of hope-full &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deſire of perfect health againe, give eare to every Leache or Emperike, and follow all counſels, the good-man being exceedingly fearefull to commit any overſight, in a matter he tooke ſo to heart, ſuffered himſelfe at laſt to be led away by the common opinion, which like vnto the Cranes, followeth ever thoſe that go before, and yeelded to cuſtome: Having thoſe no longer about him, that had given him his firſt directions, and which they had brought out of <hi>Italie.</hi> Being but ſix yeeres old I was ſent to the Colledge of <hi>Guienne,</hi> then moſt flouriſhing and reputed the beſt in <hi>France,</hi> where it is impoſſible to adde any thing to the great care he had, both to chuſe the beſt and moſt ſufficient Maſters, that could be found, to reade vnto me, as alſo for all other circumſtances pertaining to my education; wherein contrary to vſuall cuſtomes of Colledges, he obſerved many particular rules. But ſo it is, it was ever a Colledge. My Latin tongue was forthwith corrupted, whereof by reaſon of diſcontinuance, I afterward loſt all manner of vſe: which new kind of inſtitution, ſtood me in no other ſtead, but that at my firſt admittance, it made me to ouer-skip ſome of the lower formes, and to be placed in the higheſt. For at thirteene yeares of age, that I left the Colledge, I had read over the whole courſe of Philoſophie (as they call it) but with ſo ſmall profit, that I can now make no account of it. The firſt taſte or feeling I had of bookes, was of the pleaſure I tooke in reading the fables of <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorphoſies; for, being but ſeaven or eight yeares old, I would ſteale and ſequeſter my ſelfe from all other delights, onely to reade them: Forſomuch as the tongue wherein they were written was to me natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and it was the eaſieſt booke I knew, and by reaſon of the matter therein contained, moſt agreeing with my yoong age. For of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> of <hi>Lancelot du Lake,</hi> of <hi>Amadis,</hi> of <hi>Huon</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and ſuch idle time-conſuming, and wit-beſotting traſh of bookes wherein youth doth commonly ammuſe it ſelfe, I was not ſo much as acquainted with their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12117:49"/>
names, and to this day know not their bodies, nor what they containe: So exact was my diſcipline. Wherby I became more careleſſe to ſtudie my other preſcript leſſons. And well did it fall out for my purpoſe, that I had to deale with a very diſcreet Maſter, who out of his judgement could with ſuch dexteritie winke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at, and ſecond my vntowardlineſſe, and ſuch other faults that were in me. For by that meanes, I read-over <hi>Virgils Aeneades, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Plautus,</hi> and other Italian Comedies, allured thereunto by the pleaſantneſſe of their ſeverall ſubjects: Had he beene ſo fooliſhly-ſevere, or ſo ſverely froward as to croſſe this courſe of mine, I think verily I had never brought any thing from the Colledge, but the hate and contempt of Bookes, as doth the greateſt part of our Nobilitie. Such was his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo warily did he behave himſelfe, that he ſaw and would not ſee: hee would foſter and encreaſe my longing: ſuffering me but by ſtealth, and by ſnatches to glut my ſelfe with thoſe Bookes; holding ever a gentle hand over me, concerning other regular ſtudies. For, the chiefeſt thing my father required at their hands (vnto whoſe charge he had committed me) was a kinde of well-conditioned mildeneſſe, and facilitie of complexion. And, to ſay truth, mine had no other fault, but a certaine dull-languiſhing, and heavie ſlothfulneſſe. The danger was not, I ſhould do-ill, but that I ſhould doe nothing.</p>
                        <p>No man did ever ſuſpect, I would prove a bad, but an vnprofitable man: foreſeeing in me rather a kind of idleneſſe, than a voluntary craftineſſe. I am not ſo ſelfe-conceited but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what hath followed. The complaints that are daily buzzed in mine eares are theſe; that I am idle, colde, and negligent in offices of friendſhip, and dutie to my parents, and kinsfolkes; and touching publike offices, that I am over-ſingular and diſdainefull. And thoſe that are moſt iniurious cannot aske, wherefore I have taken, and why I have not paied? but may rather demand, why I doe not quit, and wherefore I doe not give? I would take it as a favour, they ſhould wiſh ſuch effects of ſupererogation in me. But they are vnjuſt and over-partiall, that will goe about to exact that from me, which I owe not, with more rigor than they will exact from themſelves that which they owe; wherein if they condemne me, they vtterly cancell, both the gratifying of the action, and the gratitude, which thereby would be due to me. Whereas the active well-doing ſhould be of more conſequence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from my hand, in regard I have no paſſive at all. Wherefore I may ſo much the more freely diſpoſe of my fortune, by how much more it is mine, and of my ſelfe that am moſt mine owne. Notwithſtanding, if I were a great blazoner of mine owne actions, I might peradventure barre ſuch reproches, and juſtly vpbraid ſome, that they are not ſo much offended, becauſe I doe not enough, as for that I may, and it lies in my power to doe much more then I doe. Yet my minde ceaſed not at the ſame time to have peculiar vnto it ſelfe well-ſetled motions, true and open judgements, concerning the objects, which it knew; which alone, and without any helpe or communication it would digeſt. And amongſt other things I verily beleeue, it would have proved altogether incapable, and vnfit to yeeld vnto force, or ſtoope vnto violence. Shall I account or relate this qualitie of my infancie, which was, a kinde of boldeneſſe in my lookes, and gentle ſoftneſſe in my voice, and affabilitie in my geſtures, and a dexteritie in conforming my ſelfe to the parts I vndertooke? for before the age of the</p>

Yet there is no ſcholer ſo meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, but will convince him of lying, &amp; read a lecture of contradiction againſt him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the progreſſe of natures workes.

For, after that according to your beſt vnderſtanding, you have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the limits of truth, and bounds of falſehood, and that it is found, you muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve things, wherein is more ſtrangeneſſe, then in thoſe you deny; you have alreadie bound your ſelfe to abandon them. Now that which me thinkes brings as much diſorder in our conſciences, namely in theſe troubles of religion wherin we are, is the diſpenſation Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes make of their beliefe. They ſuppoſe to ſhew themſelves very moderate and skilfull, when they yeeld their adverſaries any of thoſe articles now in queſtion. But beſides that, they perceive not what an advantage it is for him that chargeth you, if you but once begin to yeeld &amp; give them ground; and how much that encorageth him to purſue his point: thoſe articles which they chuſe for the lighteſt, are oftentimes moſt important. Either a man muſt wholy ſubmit himſelfe to the authoritie of our Eccleſiaſticall pollicie, or altogether diſpence himſelfe from it: It is not for vs to determine what part of obedience we owe vnto it. And moreover, I may ſay it, becauſe I have made triall of it, having ſometimes vſed this libertie of my choice, and particular election, not regarding certaine points of the obſeruance of our Church, which ſeeme to beare a face, either more vaine, or more ſtrange; comming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them with wiſemen, I have found that thoſe things have a moſt ſolide and ſteadie foundation, and that it is but fooliſhneſſe and ignorance, makes vs receiue them with leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence then the reſt. Why remember we not, what, and how many contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we finde and feele even in our owne judgement?

I have adviſed my ſelfe to borrow one of <hi>Steven de la Boitie,</hi> who with this kinde of worke ſhall honour all the world. It is a diſcourſe he entitled, <hi>Voluntary Servitude,</hi> but thoſe who have not knowen him, have ſince very properly rebaptized the ſame. <hi>The againſt one.</hi> In his firſt youth he writ, by way of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie, in honour of libertie againſt Tyrants. It hath long ſince beene diſperſed amongſt men of vnderſtanding, not without great and well deſerved commendations: for it is full of wit, and containeth as much learning as may be: yet doth it differ much from the beſt he can do. And if in the age I knew-him in, he would have vndergone my deſſigne, to ſet his fantaſies downe in writing, we ſhould doubtleſſe ſee many rare things, and which would very neerely approch the honour of antiquity: for eſpecially touching that part of natures gifts, I know none may be compared to him. But it was not long of him, that ever this Treatize, came to mans view, and I believe he never ſawe it ſince it firſt eſcaped his hands: with certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notes concerning the edict of Ianuarie, famous by reaſon of our inteſtine warre, which haply may in other places finde their deſerved praiſe. It is all I could ever recover of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques (whom when death ſeized, he by his laſt will and teſtament, left with ſo kinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, heire and executor of his librarie and writings) beſides the little booke, I ſince cauſed to be publiſhed: To which his pamphlet I am particularly moſt bounden, for ſo much as it was the inſtrumentall meane of our firſt acquaintance. For it was ſhowed me long time before I ſawe him; and gave me the firſt knowledge of his name, addreſſing, and thus nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing that vnſpotted friendſhip, which we (ſo long as it pleaſed God) have ſo ſincerely, ſo entire and inviolably maintained betweene vs, that truely a man ſhall not commonly heare of the like; and amongſt our moderne men no ſigne of any ſuch is ſeene. So many partes are required to the erecting of ſuch a one, that it may be counted a wonder, if fortunce once in three ages contract the like. There is nothing to which Nature hath more addreſſed vs than to ſocietie. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>that perfect Law-givers have had more regardfull care of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then of iuſtice.</hi> And the vtmoſt drift of it's perfection is this. For generally, all thoſe amities which are forged and nouriſhed by voluptuouſneſſe or profit, publike or private neede, are thereby ſo much the leſſe faire and generous, and ſo much the leſſe true amities, in that they intermeddle other cauſes, ſcope, and fruit with friendſhip, then it ſelfe alone: Nor doe thoſe foure auncient kindes of friendſhips; <hi>Naturall, ſociall, hoſpitable,</hi> and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerian,</hi> either particularly or conjointly beſeeme the ſame. That from children to parents may rather be termed reſpect: Friendſhip is nouriſhed by communication, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the over-great diſparitie cannot bee found in them, and would happly offend the duties of nature: for neither all the ſecret thoughts of parents can be communicated vnto children, leſt it might engender an vnbeſeeming familiaritie betweene them, nor the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and corrections (which are the chiefeſt offices of friendſhip) could be exerciſed from children to parents. There have nations beene found, where, by cuſtome, children killed their parents, and others, where parents ſlew their children, thereby to avoide the hindrance of enter-bearing one another in after times: for naturally one dependeth from the ruine of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There have Philoſophers beene found diſdaining this naturall conjunction, witneſſe <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> who being vrged with the affection he ought his children, as proceeding from his loynes, began to ſpit, ſaying, <hi>That alſo that excrement proceeded from him, and that alſo we engendred wormes and lice.</hi> And that other man, whom <hi>Plutarke</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to agree with his brother, anſwered, <hi>I care not a ſtraw the more for him, though he came out of the ſame wombe I did.</hi> Verily the name of Brother is a glorious name, and ful of loving kindneſſe, and therefore did he and I terme one another ſworne brother: but this commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, dividence, and ſharing of goods, this joyning wealth to wealth, and that the riches of one ſhall be the povertie of another, doth exceedingly diſtemper and diſtract all brotherly

aliance, and lovely conjunction: If brothers ſhould conduct the progreſſe of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and thrift in one ſame path and courſe, they muſt neceſſarily oftentimes hinder and croſſe one another. Moreover, the correſpondencie and relation that begetteth theſe true and mutually-perfect amities, why ſhall it be found in theſe? The father and the ſonne may very well be of a farre differing complexion, and ſo many brothers: He is my ſonne, he is my kinſman; but he may be a foole, a bad, or a peeviſh-minded man. And then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are friendſhips, which the law and dutie of nature doth command-vs, ſo much the leſſe of our owne voluntarie choice and libertie is there required vnto it: And our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine libertie hath no production more properly her owne, then that of affection and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Sure I am, that concerning the ſame I have aſſaied all that might be, having had the beſt and moſt indulgent father that ever was, even to his extreameſt age, and who from father to ſonne was deſcended of a famous houſe, and touching this rare-ſeene vertue of brotherly concord very exemplare:</p>

                        <p>As ſoone as it creepeth into the termes of friendſhip, that is to ſay, in the agreement of wils, it languiſheth and vaniſheth away: enioying doth looſe it, as having a corporall end, and ſubject to ſacietie. On the other ſide, friendſhip is enjoyed according as it is deſired, it is neither bred, nor nouriſhed, nor encreaſeth but in joviſſance, as being ſpirituall, and the minde being refined by vſe and cuſtome. Vnder this chiefe amitie, theſe fading affections have ſometimes found place in me, leſt I ſhould ſpeake of him, who in his verſes ſpeakes but too much of it. So are theſe two paſſions entred into me in knowledge one of another, but in compariſon never: the firſt flying a high, and keeping a proud pitch, diſdainfully behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other to paſſe her points farre vnder it. Concerning marriage, beſides that it is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which hath nothing free but the entrance, the continuance being forced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, depending elſe-where then from our will, &amp; a match ordinarily concluded to other ends: A thouſand ſtrange knots are there in commonly to be vnknit, able to break the web, &amp; trouble the whole courſe of a lively affection; whereas in friendſhip, there is no commerce or buſines depending on the ſame, but it ſelfe. Seeing (to ſpeake truly) that the ordinary ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of women, cannot anſwer this conference &amp; communication, the nurſe of this ſacred bond: nor ſeeme their mindes ſtrong enough to endure the pulling of a knot ſo hard, ſo faſt, and durable. And truely, if without that, ſuch a genuine and voluntarie acquaintance might be contracted, where not onely mindes had this entire joviſſance, but alſo bodies, a ſhare of the aliance, and where a man might wholy be engaged: It is certaine, that friendſhip would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12117:52"/>
thereby be more compleate and full: But this ſex could never yet by any example attaine vnto it, and is by ancient ſchooles rejected thence. And this other Greeke licence is juſtly abhorred by our cuſtomes, which notwithſtanding, becauſe according to vſe it had ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie a diſparitie of ages, and difference of offices betweene lovers, did no more ſufficiently anſwer the perfect vnion and agreement, which heere we require: <hi>Quis eſt enim iste amor</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cic. Tuſc. que. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>amicitiae? curneque deformem adoleſcentem quiſquam amat, neque for moſum ſenem? For, what love is this of friendſhip? why doth no man loue either a deformed yong man, or abeantifull old man?</hi> For even the picture the <hi>Academic</hi> makes of it, will not (as I ſuppoſe) diſavowe mee, to ſay thus in her behalfe: That the firſt furie, enſpired by the ſon of <hi>Venus</hi> in the lovers hart, vpon the object of tender youths-flower, to which they allow all inſolent and paſſionate violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an immoderate heate may produce, was ſimply grounded vpon an externall beauty; a falſe image of corpor all generation: for in the ſpirit it had no power, the ſight whereof was yet concealed, which was but in his infancie, and before the age of budding. For, if this furie did ſeize vpon a baſe minded courage, the meanes of it's purſute, where riches, gifts, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the advancement of dignities, and ſuch like vile marchandize, which they reproove. If it fell into a moſt generous minde, the interpoſitions were likewiſe generous: Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtructions, documents to reverence religion, to obey the lawes, to die for the good of his countrie: examples of valor, wiſedome and juſtice. The lover endevoring and ſtudying to make himſelfe acceptable by the good grace and beauty of his minde (that of his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long ſince decayed) hoping by this mentall ſocietie to eſtabliſh a more firme and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bargaine. When this purſute attained the effect in dueſeaſon, (for by not requiring in a lover, he ſhould bring leaſure and diſcretion in his enterpriſe, they require it exactly in the beloved; for aſ much as he was to judge of an internall beauty, of a difficile knowledge, &amp; abſtruſe diſcovery) then by the interpoſition of a ſpirituall beauty was the deſire of a ſpiritual conception engendred in the beloved. The latter was heere chiefeſt; the corporall, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and ſecond, altogether contrarie to the lover. And therefore do they preferre the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and verifie that the gods likewiſe preferre the ſame: and greatly blame the Poet <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus,</hi> who in the love between <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus</hi> aſcribeth the lovers part vnto <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was in the firſt and beardleſſe youth of his adoleſcency, and the faireſt of the Graecians. After this generall communitie, the miſtris and worthieſt part of it, predominant &amp; exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her offices (they ſay the moſt availeful commodity did therby redound both to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate &amp; publike) That it was the force of countries received the vſe of it, and the principall defence of equitie and libertie: witneſſe the comfortable loves of <hi>Hermodiu</hi> and <hi>Ariſtogiton.</hi> Therefore name they it ſacred and divine, and it concerns not them whether the violence of tyrants, or the demiſneſſe of the people be againſt them: To conclude, all can be alleaged in favour of the Academy, is to ſay, that it was a love ending in friendſhip, a thing which hath no bad reference vnto the Stoical definition of love: <hi>Amorem conatum eſſe amicitiae facienda ex</hi>

Clearely friendſhips are to be indge by wits, and ages already ſtrengthened and confirmed.</hi> As for the reſt, thoſe we ordinarily call friendes and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are but acquaintances and familiarities, tied together by ſome occaſion or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by meanes whereof our mindes are entertained. In the amitie I ſpeake of, they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe and confound themſelves one in the other, with ſo vniuerſall a commixture, that they weare out, and can no more finde the ſeame that hath conjoyned them together. If a man vrge me to tell wherefore I loved him, I feele it cannot be expreſſed, but by anſwering; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was he, becauſe it was my ſelfe. There is beyond all my diſcourſe, and beſides what I can particularly report of it, I know not what inexplicable and fatall power, a meane and Mediatrix of this indiſſoluble vnion. Wee ſought one another, before we had ſeene one another, and by the reports we heard one of another; which wrought a greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in vs, than the reaſon of reports may well beare: I thinke by ſome ſecret ordinance of the heavens, we embraced one another by our names. And at our firſt meeting, which was by chance at a great feaſt, and ſolemne meeting of a whole towneſhip, we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſurprized, ſo knowne, ſo acquainted, and ſo combinedly bound together, that from thence forward, nothing was ſo neere vnto vs, as one vnto another. He writ an excellent Latine Satyre; ſince publiſhed; by which he excuſeth and expoundeth the precipitation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12117:52"/>
of our acquaintance, ſo ſuddenly come to her perfection; Sithence it muſt continue ſo ſhort a time, and begun ſo late (for we were both growne men, and he ſome yeeres older than myſelfe) there was no time to be loſt. And it was not to bee modelled or directed by the paterne of regular and remiſſe friendſhip, wherein ſo many precautions of a long and preallable converſation are required. This hath no other <hi>Idea</hi> than of it ſelfe, and can have no reference but to it ſelfe. It is not one eſpeciall conſideration, nor two, nor three, nor foure, nor a thouſand: It is I wot not what kinde of quinteſſence, of all this commixture, which having ſeized all my will, induced the ſame to plunge and looſe it ſelfe in his, which likewiſe having ſeized all his will, brought it to looſe and plunge it ſelfe in mine, with a mutuall greedineſſe, and with a ſemblable concurrance. I may truely ſay, looſe, reſerving nothing vnto vs, that might properly be called our owne, nor that was either his, or mine. When <hi>Lelius</hi> in the preſence of the Romane Conſuls, who after the condemnation of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Gracchus,</hi> purſued all thoſe that had beene of his acquaintance, came to enquire of <hi>Caius Bloſius</hi> (who was one of his chiefeſt friends) what he would have done for him, and that he anſwered: <hi>All things, What? All things?</hi> replied he: <hi>And what if he had willed thee to burne our Temples? Bloſius</hi> anſwered, <hi>He would never have commanded ſuch a thing. But what if he had done it?</hi> replied <hi>Lelius:</hi> The other anſwered, <hi>I would have obeyed him:</hi> If hee were ſo perfect a friend to <hi>Gracchus,</hi> as Hiſtories report, he needed not offend the Conſuls with this laſt and bolde confeſſion, and ſhould not have departed from the aſſurance hee had of <hi>Gracchus</hi> his minde. But yet thoſe, who accuſe this anſwer as ſeditious, vnderſtand not well this myſterie: and doe not preſuppoſe in what termes he ſtood, and that he held <hi>Gracchus</hi> his will in his ſleeve, both by power and knowledge. They were rather friends than Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, rather friends than enemies of their countrey, or friends of ambition and trouble. Having abſolutely committed themſelves one to another, they perfecty held the reines of one anothers inclination: and let this yoke be guided by vertue and conduct of reaſon (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without them it is altogether impoſſible to combine and proportion the ſame.) The anſwer of <hi>Bloſius</hi> was ſuch as it ſhould be. If their affections miſcarried, according to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were neither friendes one to other, nor friends to themſelves. As for the reſt, this anſwer ſoundes no more than mine would doe, to him that would in ſuch ſort enquire of me; if your will ſhould commaund you to kill your daughter, would you doe it? and that I ſhould conſent vnto it: for, that beareth no witneſſe of conſent to do it: becauſe I am not in doubt of my will, and as little of ſuch a friends will. It is not in the power of the worlds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to remove me from the certaintie I have of his intentions and judgements of mine: no one of it's actions might be preſented vnto me, vnder what ſhape ſoever, but I would preſently finde the ſpring and motion of it. Our mindes have jumped ſo vnitedly together, they have with ſo fervent an aflection conſidered of each other, and with like affection ſo diſcovered and ſounded, even to the very bottome of ech others heart and entrails, that I did not onely know his, as well as mine owne, but I would (verily) rather have truſted him concerning any matter of mine, than my ſelfe. Let no man compare any of the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friendſhips to this. I have as much knowledge of them as another, yea of the perfecteſt of their kinde: yet will I not perſwade any man to confound their rules, for ſo a man might be deceived. In theſe other ſtrict friendſhips a man muſt march with the bridle of wiſdome and precaution in his hand: the bond is not ſo ſtrictly tied, but a man may in ſome ſort diſtruſt the ſame. <hi>Love him</hi> (ſaide <hi>Chilon</hi>) <hi>as if you ſhould one day hate him againe. Hate him as if you ſhould love him againe.</hi> This precept, ſo abhominable in this ſoveraigne and miſtris Amitie, is neceſſarie and wholeſome in the vſe of vulgar and cuſtomarie frendſhips: toward which a man muſt employ the ſaying <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was woont ſo often to repeat, <hi>Oh you my friends, there is no perfect friend.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this noble commerce, offices and benefits (nurſes of other amities) deſerve not ſo much as to bee accounted of: this confuſion ſo full of our willes is cauſe of it: for euen as the friendſhip I beare vnto my ſelfe, admits no accreaſe, by any ſuccour I give my ſelfe in any time of neede, whatſoever the Stoickes alleadge; and as I acknowledge no thanks vnto my ſelfe for any ſervice I doe vnto my ſelfe, ſo the vnion of ſuch friends, being truely perfect, makes them looſe the feeling of ſuch duties, and hate, and expell from one another theſe words of diviſion, and difference; benefit, good deed, dutie, obligation, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prayer, thanks, and ſuch their like. All things being by effect common betweene
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12117:53"/>
them; wils, thoughts, judgements, goods, wives, children, honour, and life; and their mutuall agreement, being no other than one ſoule in two bodies, according to the fit defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> they can neither lend or give ought to each other. See here the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Law-makers, to honour marriage with ſome imaginary reſemblance of this divine bond, inhibite donations betweene husband and wife; meaning thereby to inferre, that all things ſhould peculiarly bee proper to each of them, and that they have nothing to divide and ſhare together. If in the friendſhip wherof I ſpeake, one might give vnto another, the receiver of the benefit ſhould binde his fellow. For, each ſeeking more than any other thing, to doe each other good, he who yeelds both matter and occaſion, is the man ſheweth himſelfe liberall, giving his friend that contentment, to effect towards him what he deſireth moſt. When the Philoſopher <hi>Diogenes</hi> wanted money, he was wont to ſay; <hi>That he re-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſame of his friends, and not that he demanded it:</hi> And to ſhew how that is practiſed by effect, I will relate an auncient ſingular example. <hi>Eudamidas</hi> the Corinthian had two friends. <hi>Charixenus</hi> a Sycionian, and <hi>Aretheus</hi> a Corinthian; being vpon his death-bed, and very poore, and his two friends very rich, thus made his laſt will and teſtament. <hi>To</hi> Aretheus, <hi>I bequeath the keeping of my mother, and to maintaine her when ſhe ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>lde: To</hi> Charixenus <hi>the marrying of my daughter, and to give her as great a dowry as he may: and in caſe one of them ſhall chance to die before, I appoint the ſurviver to ſubſtitute his charge, and ſupply his place.</hi> Thoſe that firſt ſaw this teſtament, laughed and mocked at the ſame; but his heires being advertiſed thereof, were very well pleaſed, and received it with ſingular contentment. And <hi>Charixenus</hi> one of them, dying five daies after <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> the ſubſtitution being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of <hi>Aretheus,</hi> he carefully and very kindly kept and maintained his mother, and of five talents that he was worth, he gave two &amp; a halfe in mariage to one only daughter he had, and the other two &amp; a halfe to the daughter of <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> whom he maried both in one day. This example is very ample, if one thing were not, which is the multitude of friends: For, this perfect amity I ſpeake-of, is indiviſible; each man doth ſo wholy give himſelfe vnto his friend, that he hath nothing left him to divide elſe-where: moreover he is grieved that he is double, triple, or quadruple, and hath not many ſoules, or ſundry wils, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them all vpon this ſubject. Common friendſhips may bee divided; a man may love beautie in one, facilitie of behaviour in another, liberalitie in one, and wiſedome in another, paternity in this, fraternity in that man, &amp; ſo forth: but this amitie which poſſeſſeth the ſoul, and ſwaies it in all ſoveraigntie, it is impoſſible it ſhould be double. If two at one inſtant ſhould require helpe, to which would you runne? Should they crave contrary off<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Should one commit a matter to your ſilence, which if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew would greatly profit him, what courſe would you take? Or how would you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your ſelfe? A ſingular and principall friendſhip diſſolveth all other duties, &amp; freeth all other obligations. The ſecret I have ſworne not to reveale to another, I may without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie impart it vnto him, who is no other but my ſelfe. It is a great and ſtrange woonder for a man to double himſelfe; &amp; thoſe that talk of tripling, know not, <q>nor cannot reach vnto the height of it. <hi>Nothing is extreame, that hath his like.</hi> And he who ſhall preſuppoſe, that of two I love the one as well as the other</q>, and that they enter-love one another, and love me as much as I loue them: he multiplieth in brother-hood, a thing moſt ſingular, and alonely one, and then which one alone is alſo the rareſt to be found in the world. The remainder of this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeth very wel with what I ſaid; for, <hi>Eudamidas</hi> giveth as a grace &amp; fauor to his friends to employ them in his need: he leaveth them as his heires of his liberality, which conſiſteth in putting the meanes into their hands, to doe him good. And doubtleſſe, the force of friendſhip is much more richly ſhewen in his deed, then in <hi>Aretheus.</hi> To conclude, they are imaginable effects, to him that hath not taſted them; and which makes me woonderfully to honor the anſwer of that yong Souldier to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who enquiring of him, what he would take for a horſe, with which he had lately gained the prize of a race, and whether he would change him for a Kingdome? <hi>No ſurely my Liege</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>yet would I willingly forgoe him to gaine a true friend, could I but finde a man worthy of ſo precious an alliance.</hi> He ſaid not ill, in ſaying, <hi>could I but finde.</hi> For, a man ſhall eaſily finde men fit for a ſuperficiall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but in this, wherein men negotiate from the very centre of their harts, and make no ſpare of any thing, it is moſt requiſite, all the wardes and ſprings be ſincerely wrought, and perfectly true.

So doe I in the familiar acquaintances, that thoſe who ſerve-me contract with me. I am nothing inquiſitive whether a Lackey be chaſte or no, but whether he be diligent: I feare not a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Muletier, ſo much as if he be weake; nor a hot ſwearing Cooke, as one that is ignorant and vnskilfull; I never meddle with ſaying what a man ſhould do in the world; there are over many others that do it; but what my ſelfe do in the world.</p>

                        <p>Concerning familiar table-talke, I rather acquaint my ſelfe with, and follow a merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited humour, than a wiſe man: And in bed I rather prefer beauty, then goodneſſe; and in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or coverſation of familiar diſcourſe, I reſpect rather ſufficiency, though without <hi>Preua' hommie,</hi> and ſo of all things elſe. Even as he that was found riding vpon an hobby-horſe, playing with his children, beſought him, who thus ſurprized him, not to ſpeake of-it, vntil he were a father himſelf, ſuppoſing the tender fondneſſe, and fatherly paſſion, which then would poſſeſſe his minde, ſhould make him an impartiall iudge of ſuch an action. So would I wiſh to ſpeake to ſuch as had tried what I ſpeake of: but knowing how far ſuch an amitie is from the common vſe, &amp; how ſeld ſeene and rarely found, I looke not to finde a competent judge.

And leſt the Authors memory ſhould any way be intereſſed with thoſe that could not thoroughly know his opinions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſhall vnderſtand, that this ſubject was by him treated of in his infancie, onely by way of exerciſe, as a ſubject, common, bare-worne, and wyer-drawne in a thouſand bookes. I will never doubt but he beleeved what he writ, and writ as he thought: for hee was ſo conſcientious, that no lie did ever paſſe his lips, yea were it but in matters of ſport or play: and I know, that had it bin in his choyce, he would rather have bin borne at <hi>

There was never a better Citizen, nor more affected to the welfare and quietneſſe of his countrie, nor a ſharper enemie of the changes, innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, newfangles, and hurly-burlies of his time: He would more willingly have imployed the vtmoſt of his endevours to extinguiſh and ſuppreſſe, then to favour or further them: His minde was modelled to the patterne of other beſt ages. But yet in exchange of his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatiſe, I will here ſet you downe another, more pithie, materiall, and of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, by him likewiſe produced in that tender age.</p>

Mine eies trouble me as much in climbing vp toward a great light, as to goe downe in the darke. <hi>Caliscles</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, <hi>The extremitie of Philoſophie to bee hurtfull: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades no man to wade further into it, then the bounds of profit: And that taken with moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is pleaſant and commodious, but in the end it makes a man wilde and vicious, diſdainfull of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and of common lawes: an enemie of civill converſation: a foe to humane ſenſualitie, and worldly pleaſures: incapable of all politike adminiſtration; and vnfit to aſſiſt others or to helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: apt to be without revenge buffeted, and baſſled.</hi> He ſaith true: for in her exceſſe, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralleth our naturall libertie, and by an importunate wile, diverts vs from the faire and plaine path, which nature traceth out for vs. The love we beare to women, is very lawfull; yet doth Divinitie bridle and reſtraine the ſame. I remember to have read in Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> in a place where he condemneth marriages of kinsfolkes in forbidden degrees, this one reaſon amongſt others: that the love a man beareth to ſuch a woman may be immoderate; for, if the wedlocke, or husband-like affection be ſound and perfect, as it ought to be, and alſo ſurcharged with that a man oweth to alliance and kindred, there is no doubt, but that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe may eaſily tranſport a husband beyond the bounds of reaſon. Thoſe Sciences that direct the maners of men, as Divinitie and Philoſophie, medleth with all things. There is no action ſo private and ſecret may be concealed from their knowledge and juriſdiction. Well doe they learne that ſearch and cenſure their libertie. It is women communicate their partes as much as a man liſt to wantonize with them: but to phiſicke them baſhfulneſſe forbids them. I will then in their behalfe teach husbands this, if there be any too much fleſht vpon them: which is, that the verie pleaſures they have by the familiaritie of their wives, except moderately vſed; they are reprooved: and not onely in that, but in any other vnlawfull ſubjects, a man may treſpaſſe in licentiouſneſſe and offend in exceſſe. Thoſe ſhameleſſe endearings, which the firſt heate ſuggeſts vnto vs in that ſportfull delight, are not onely vndecently, but hurtfully employed towards our wives. Let them at leaſt learne impudencie from another hand. They are ever broad-waking when wee neede them. I have vſed no meanes but naturall and ſimple inſtruction. Marriage is a religious and devout bond: and that is the reaſon the pleaſure a man hath of it, ſhould be a moderate, ſtaied, and ſerious pleaſure, and mixed with ſeveritie, it ought to bee a voluptuouſneſſe ſomewhat circumſpect and conſcientious. And becauſe it is the chiefeſt of generation, there are that make a queſtion, whether it be lawfull to require them of copulation, as well when we have no hope of children, as when they are over-aged, or bigge with childe. <hi>It is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,</hi> according to <hi>Plato.</hi> Certaine nations (and amongſt others, the Mahometane) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre Conjunction with women great with childe. Many alſo with thoſe that have their monethly diſeaſe. <hi>Zenobia</hi> received her husband but for one charge; which done, al the time of her conception, ſhe let him goe at randon, and that paſt, ſhe gave him leave to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: a notable and generous example of marriage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Plato</hi> borroweth the narration (of ſome needy and hunger-ſtarven Poet) of this ſport. That <hi>Iupiter</hi> one day gave his wife ſo hot a charge, impatient to ſtay till ſhe came to bed, hee laide her along vpon the floore, and by the vehemence of his pleaſure forgot the vrgent and weighty reſolutions lately concluded vpon with the other gods of his caeleſtiall court; boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting he found it as ſweet at that time, as he had done, when firſt he ſpoiled her of her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by ſtealth and vnknowne to their parents. The Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> called for their wives, when they went to any ſolemne feaſt, but when much drinking and wine began to heate them in good earneſt they ſent them to their chambers, ſeeing they could no longer refrain, but muſt needs yeeld to ſenſual tie, leſt they ſhould be partakers of their immoderate luſt; and in their ſteade ſent for other women, whom this duty of reſpect might not concerne. <hi>All pleaſures and gratifications are not well placed in all ſortes of people. Epaminondas</hi> had cauſed a diſſolute yoong man to be impriſoned: <hi>Pelopidas</hi> entreated him, that for his ſake he would ſet him at libertie, but he refuſed him, and yeelded to free him at the requeſt of an harlot of his, which likewiſe ſued for his enlargement; ſaying, <hi>it was a gratification due vnto a Courtizan, and not to a Captaine. Sophocles</hi> being partner with <hi>Pericles</hi> in the Pretorſhip, ſeeing by chance a faire boy to paſſe by: <hi>Oh what a beauteous boy goeth yonder!</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Pericles: That</hi>

                           <hi>ſpeech were more fitting another then a Pretor,</hi> anſwered <hi>Pericles, who ought not onely to haue chaſte handes, but alſo vnpolluted eies. Aelius Verus</hi> the Emperour, his wife complaining that he followed the love of other women, anſwered <hi>he did it for conſcience ſake, for ſo much as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was a name of honour, and dignity, and not of fooliſh and laſcivious luſt.</hi> And our Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtorie, hath with honour preſerved the memorie of that wife, which ſued to be devor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from her husband, becauſe ſhe would not ſecond and conſent to his over-inſolent and lewde embracements. To conclude, there is no voluptuouſneſſe ſo juſt, wherein exceſſe and intemperance is not reprochfull vnto vs. But to ſpeake in good ſooth, is not a man a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creature? He is ſcarce come to his owne ſtrength by his naturall conditions, to taſte one onely compleate, entire and pure pleaſure, but he laboreth by diſcourſe to cut it off: he is not wretched enough, except by arte and ſtudy he augment his miſerie.</p>

Had I beene chiefe of a faction, I would have followed a more naturall courſe, which to ſay true, is both commodious and ſacred, and ſhould perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture have made my ſelfe ſtrong enough to limite the ſame. Although our ſpirituall and corporall Phyſitians: as by covenant agreed vpon betweene them, finde no way of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor remedies for diſeaſes of bodie and minde, but by torment, griefe and paine, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, haire-ſhirts, farre and ſolitarie exile, perpetuall priſon, roddes and other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have therefore beene invented: But ſo, that they be truely afflictions, and that there be ſome ſtinging ſharpeneſſe in them: And that the ſucceſſe be not as <hi>Gallios</hi> was, who having beene confined to the ile of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> newes came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that there he lived a merry life; and what the Senate had laide vpon him for a puniſhment, redounded to his commodity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they agreed to revoke him home to his owne houſe and wife, ſtrictly enjoyning him to keepe the ſame, thereby to accommodate their puniſhment to his ſenſe and feeling. For he to whom faſting ſhould procure health and a merrie heart, or he to whom poiſon ſhould be more healthie then meate, it would be no longer a wholeſome receipt, no more then drugs in other medicines, are of no effect to him that takes them with appetite and pleaſure. Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe and difficultie are circumſtances fitting their operat on. That nature which ſhould take Reubarbe as familiar, ſhould no doubt corrupt the vſe of it; it muſt be a thing that hurts the ſtomacke, if it ſhal cure it: and heere the common rule failes, that infirmities are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their contraries: for one ill cureth another.

All their idolles are ſprinkled with humane blood, not without divers examples of horrible crueltie.

The Ambaſſadours of the Kings of <hi>Mexico,</hi> in declaring and magnifying the greatneſſe of their Maſter to <hi>Fernando Cortez,</hi> after they had tolde him, that he had thirtie vaſſals, whereof each one was able to levie a hundred thouſand combatants, and that he had his reſidence in the faireſt and ſtrongeſt Citie vnder heaven, added moreover, that he had fifty thouſand to ſacrifice for every yeere: verily ſome affirme that they maintaine continuall warres with certaine mightie neighbouring Nations, not ſo much for the exerciſe and training of their youth, as that they may have ſtore of priſoners taken in warre to ſupply their ſacrifices.

The Lords of <hi>Carthage</hi> ſeeing their countrie by little and little to be diſpeopled, made a lawe and expreſſe inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that vpon paine of death no more men ſhould goe thither, and baniſhed all that were gone thither to dwell, fearing (as they ſaid) that in ſucceſſe of time, they would ſo mu tiply as they might one day ſupplant them, and overthrow their owne eſtate. This narration of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hath no reference vnto our new found countries. This ſervant I had, was a ſimple and rough-hewen fellow: a condition fit to yeeld a true teſtimonie. For, ſubtile people may indeed marke more curiouſly, and obſerve things more exactly, but they amplifie and gloſe them: and the better to perſwade, and make their interpretations of more validity, they cannot chuſe but ſomewhat alter the ſtorie. They never repreſent things truely, but faſhion and maske them according to the viſage they ſaw them in; and to purchaſe credit to their judgement, and draw you on to beleeve them, they commonly adorne, enlarge, yea, and Hyperboliſe the matter. Wherein is required either a moſt ſincere Reporter, or a man ſo ſimple, that he may have no invention to build vpon, and to give a true likelihood vnto falſe deviſes, and be not wedded to his owne will. Such a one was my man; who beſides his owne report, hath many times ſhewed me divers Mariners, and Marchants, whom hee had knowne in that vovage. So am I pleaſed with his information, that I never enquire what Coſmographers ſay of it. We had need of Topographers to make vs particular narrations of the places they have beene in. For ſome of them, if they have the advantage of vs, that they have ſeene <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> will challenge a priviledge, to tell vs newes of all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. I would have every man write what he knowes, and no more: not onely in that, but in all other ſubjects. For one may have particular knowledge of the nature of one river, and experience of the qualitie of one fountaine, that in other things knowes no more then another man: who nevertheleſſe to publiſh this little ſcantling, will vndertake to write of all the Phiſickes. From which vice proceed divers great inconveniences. Now (to returne to my purpoſe) I finde (as farre as I have beene informed) there is nothing in that nation, that is either barbarous or ſavage, vnleſſe men call that barbariſme which is not common to them. As indeed, we have no other ayme of truth and reaſon, then the example and <hi>Idea</hi> of the opinions and cuſtomes of the countrie we live in. There is ever perfect religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect policie, perfect and compleat vſe of all things. They are even ſavage, as we call thoſe

fruites wilde, which nature of hir ſelfe, and of hir ordinarie progreſſe hath produced: where as indeede, they are thoſe which our ſelves have altered by our artificiall diviſes, and diver ted from their common order, we ſhould rather terme ſavage. In thoſe are the true and moſt profitable vertues, and naturall properties moſt lively and vigorous, which in theſe we have baſtardized, applying them to the pleaſure of our corrupted taſte. And if notwithſtanding, in divers fruites of thoſe countries that were never tilled, we ſhall finde, that in reſpect of ours they are moſt excellent, and as delicate vnto our taſte; there is no reaſon, arte ſhould gaine the point of honour of our great and puiſſant mother Nature.

They are ſeated alongſt the ſea-coaſt, encompaſſed toward the land with huge and ſteepie mountaines, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both, a hundred leagues or thereabout of open and champaine ground. They have great abundance of fiſh and fleſh, that have no reſemblance at all with ours, and eate them without any ſawces, or skill of Cookerie, but plaine boiled or broiled. The firſt man that brought a horſe thither, although he had in many other voyages converſed with them, bred ſo great a horror in the land, that before they could take notice of him, they ſlew him with arrowes. Their buildings are very long, and able to containe two or three hundred ſoules, covered with barkes of great trees, faſtned in the ground at one end, enterlaced and ioyned cloſe together by the tops, after the maner of ſome of our Granges; the covering where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hangs downe to the ground, and ſteadeth them as a flancke.

They riſe with the Sunne, and feed for all day, as ſoone as they are vp: and make no more meales after that. They drinke not at meate, as <hi>Suidas</hi> reporteth of ſome other people of the Eaſt, which dranke after meales, but drinke many times a day, and are much given to pledge carowſes. Their drinke is made of a certaine roote, and of the colour of our Claret wines, which laſteth but two or three daies; they drinke it warme: It hath ſomewhat ſharpe taſte, wholſome for the ſtomack, nothing heady, but laxative for ſuch as are not vſed vnto it, yet verie pleaſing to ſuch as are accuſtomed vnto it.

The forme of their beds, cordes, ſwordes, blades, and woodden bracelets, wherewith they cover their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wriſts when they fight, and great Canes open at one end, by the ſound of which they keepe time and cadence in their dauncing, are in many places to be ſeene, and namely in mine own houſe. They are ſhaven all-over, much more cloſe and cleaner than wee are, with no other Razors than of wood or ſtone. They beleeve their ſoules to be eternall, and thoſe that have deſerved well of their Gods, to be placed in that part of heaven where the Sunne riſeth, and the curſed toward the Weſt in oppoſition. They have certaine Prophets and Prieſts, which commonly abide in the mountaines, &amp; very ſeldome ſhew themſelves vnto the people; but when they come downe, there is a great feaſt prepared, and a ſolemne aſſemblie of manie towneſhips together (each Grange as I have deſcribed maketh a village, and they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a French league one from another.) The Prophet ſpeakes to the people in publike, exhorting them to embrace vertue, and follow their dutie. All their morall diſcipline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth but theſe two articles; firſt an vndiſmaied reſolution to warre, then an inviolable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their wiues. Hee doth alſo Prognoſticate of things to come, and what ſucceſſe they ſhall hope for in their enterpriſes: hee either perſwadeth or diſſwadeth them from warre; but if he chance to miſſe of his divination, and that it ſucceed otherwiſe than hee foretolde them, if hee be taken, he is hewen in a thouſand peeces, and condemned for a falſe Prophet. And therefore he that hath once miſreckoned himſelfe is never ſeene againe. Divination is the gift of God; the abuſing wherof ſhould be a puniſhable impoſture. When the Divines amongſt the Scithians had foretold an vntruth, they were couched along vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hurdles full of heath or bruſhwood, drawne by oxen, and ſo manicled hand and foote, burned to death. Thoſe which manage matters ſubject to the conduct of mans ſufficiencie, are excuſable, although they ſhew the vtmoſt of their skill. But thoſe that gull and conicatch vs with the aſſurance of an extraordinarie facultie, &amp; which is beyond our knowledge, ought to be double puniſhed; firſt becauſe they performe not the effect of their promiſe, then for the raſhneſſe of their impoſture and vnadviſedneſſe of their fraud. They warre againſt the nations, that lie beyond their mountaines, to which they go naked, having no other weapons then bowes, or wodden ſwords, ſharpe at one end, as our broaches are. It is an admirable thing to ſee the conſtant reſolutuion of their combates, which never end but by effuſion of blood &amp; murther: for they know not what feare or rowts are. Every Victor brings home the head of the enemie he hath ſlaine as a Trophey of his victorie, and faſtneth the ſame at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his dwelling place. After they have long time vſed and entreated their priſoners well, and with all commodities they can deviſe, he that is the Maſter of them; ſummoning a great aſſembly of his acquaintance; tieth a corde to one of the priſoners armes, by the end whereof he holdes him faſt, with ſome diſtance from him, for feare he might offend him, and giveth the other arme, bound in like maner, to the deareſt friend he hath, and both in the preſence of all the aſſemblie kill him with ſwordes: which done, they roſte, and then eare

The reputation and woorth of a man conſiſteth in his heart and will: therein conſiſts true honor: Conſtancie is valour, not of armes and legs, but of minde and courage? it conſiſteth not in the ſpirit and courage of our horſe, nor of our armes, but in ours.

For being ſuddenly environed round by the Arcadians: After a great ſlaughter made of them, both himſelfe and all his were put to the ſword. Is any Trophey aſſigned for conquerours, that is not more duly due vnto theſe conquered? A true conqueſt reſpecteth rather an vndanted reſolution: and honourable end, then a faire eſcape, and the honour of vertue doth more conſiſt in combating then in beating. But to returne to our hiſtorie, theſe priſoners, howſoever they are dealt withall, are ſo farre from yeelding, that contrariwiſe during two or three moneths that they are kept, they ever carry a cheerefull countenace, and vrge their keepers to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten their triall, they outragiouſly defic, and injure them.

Surely, in reſpect of vs theſe are very ſavage men: for either they muſt be ſo in good ſooth, or we muſt be ſo indeed: There is a woondrous diſtance betweene their forme and ours. Their men have many wives, and by how much more they are reputed valiant, ſo much the greater is their number. The maner and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their marriages is woondrous ſtrange and remarkable: For, the ſame jealouſie our wives have to keepe vs from the love and affection of other women, the ſame have theirs to procure it. Being more carefull for their husbands honour and content, then of any thing elſe: They endevour and apply all their induſtrie, to have as many rivals as poſſibly they can, foraſmuch as it is a teſtimonie of their husbands vertue. Our women would count it a woonder, but it is not ſo: It is vertue properly Matrimoniall; but of the higheſt kinde. And in the Bible, <hi>Lea, Rachell, Sara,</hi> and <hi>Iacobs</hi> wives, brought their faireſt maiden ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants vnto their husbands beds.

And leaſt a man ſhould thinke, that all this is done by a ſimple, and ſervile, or awefull dutie vnto their cuſtome, and by the impreſſion of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtomes authoritie, without diſcourſe or judgement, and becauſe they are ſo blockiſh, and dull-ſpirited, that they can take no other reſolution, it is not amiſſe, wee alleadge ſome evidence of their ſufficiencie.

Touching that point, wherein I demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, what good he received by the ſuperioritie he had amongſt his countriemen (for he was a Captaine and our Marriners called him King) he told me, it was to march formoſt in any charge of warre: further, I asked him, how many men did follow him, hee ſhewed me a diſtance of place, to ſignifie they were as many as might be contained in ſo much ground, which I gueſſed to be about 4. or 5. thouſand men: moreover I demanded,

All that is not very ill; but what of that? They weare no kinde of breeches nor hoſen.</p>

There are no more vertuous actions knowne; thoſe that beare a ſhew of vertue, have no eſſence of it: for profit, glorie, cuſtome, feare, and other like ſtrange cauſes direct vs to produce them. Iuſtice, valour, integritie, which we then exerciſe, may by others conſideration, and by the countenance they publikely beare, be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo: but with the true workeman, it is no vertue at all. There is another end propoſed; another efficient cauſe. Vertue alloweth of nothing, but what is done by her, and for hir alone. In that great battell at Potidaea which the Graecians vnder <hi>Pauſanias</hi> gained of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> and the Perſians, the victors following their cuſtome, comming to ſhare the glorie and priſe of the victory betweene them, aſcribed the pre-excellencie of valor in that conflict to the <hi>Spartane</hi> nation. The Spartanes imparciall judges of vertue, when they came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, to what particular man of their countrie, the honor to have done beſt in that day, ſhuld of right belong; they found that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> had moſt couragiouſly engaged and hazarded himſelfe: Yet gave him not the priſe of honour of it, becauſe his vertue had beene thereunto incited, by an earneſt deſire to purge himſelfe from the reproch and infamie, which hee had incurred in the action at <hi>Thermopyles,</hi> and from all daring ambition to die couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie, thereby to warrant his former imputation. Our judgements are yet ſicke, and follow the depravations of our cuſtomes. I ſee the greateſt part of our ſpirits to affect wit, and to ſhew themſelves ingenious, by obſcuring and detracting from the glorie of famous and generall ancient actions, giving them ſome baſe and malicious interpretation, fondly and enviouſly charging them with vaine cauſes, and frivolous occaſions. A ſubtill invention no doubt. Let any man preſent me, with the moſt excellent and blameleſſe action, and I will oppoſe it with fiftie vicious and bad intentions, all which ſhall carrie a face of likeli-hood. God knowes (to him that will extend them) what diverſitie of images our internall will doth ſuffer: They doe not ſo maliciouſly as groſely and rudely endeuour to be ingenious with all their railing and detraction. The ſame paine a man taketh to detract from theſe noble &amp; famous names, and the verie ſame libertie, would I as willingly take to lend them my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to extoll and magnifie them. I would endevour to charge theſe rare and choiſe-figures, ſelected by the conſent of wiſe men, for the worlds example, as much, and as high, as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention would give me leaue with honour, in a plauſible interpretation, and favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. And a man muſt thinke, that the diligent labours of our invention, are farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their merit. It is the part of honeſt minded men to pourtray vertue, as faire as poſſible faire may be. A thing which would no whit be miſ-ſeeming or vndecent, if paſſion ſhould tranſport vs to the favour and purſuite of ſo ſacred formes, what theſe doe contrarie, they either doe it through malice or knaverie, with purpoſe to reduce and ſute their beliefe to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12117:63"/>
their capacitie, where of I lately ſpake: or rather as I thinke, becauſe their ſight is not of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power or clearnes, nor addreſſed to conceive or apprehend the farre-ſhining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vertue in naturall and genuine purity: As <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith, that in his time, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the cauſe of <hi>Cato</hi> the yongers death to the feare he had conceived of <hi>Ceſar:</hi> whereat he hath ſome reaſon to be moved: by which a man may iudge, how much more he would have beene offended with thoſe that have aſcribed the ſame vnto ambition. Oh fooliſh people! Hee would no doubt have performed a faire action, ſo generous and ſo iuſt, rather with ignominie, then for glorie. This man was truely a patterne, whom nature choſe to ſhew how farre humane vertue may reach, and mans conſtancie attaine-vnto. But my purpoſe is not here to treate this rich argument: I will onely confront together the ſayings of five Latin Poets vpon <hi>Catoes</hi> commendacions, and for the intereſt of <hi>Cato,</hi> and by inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie for theirs alſo. Now ought a gentleman well-bred, in reſpect of others, finde the two former ſomewhat languiſhing. The third more vigorous, but ſuppreſſed by the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of force. He will iudge there were yet place for one or two degrees of invention, to reach vnto the fourth, in conſideration of which he will through admiration ioyne handes for the laſt (yet firſt in ſome degree and ſpace, but which ſpace he will ſweare can by no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit be filled-vp) he wil be much amazed, he will be much amated. Loe here are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we haue more Poets than iudges and interpreters of poeſie. It is an eaſier matter to frame it; then to knowe-it: Being baſe and humble, it may be iudged by the precepts and art of it: But the good &amp; loftie, the ſupreme &amp; divine, is beyond rules, and aboue reaſon. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer diſcerneth hir beauty, with a conſtant, quicke-ſeeing, and ſetled looke, he can no more ſee and comprehend the ſame then the ſplendor of a lightning flaſh. It hath no community with our iudgement; but ranſacketh and raviſheth the ſame. The furie which prickes and moves him that can penetrate hir, doth alſo ſtricke and wound a third man, if he heare-it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handled or recited, as the Adamant ſtone drawes, not only a needle, but infuſeth ſome of hir faculty in the ſame to drawe others: And it is more apparently ſeene in theaters, that the ſacred inſpiration of the Muſes, having firſt ſtirred vp the Poet with a kinde of agitation vnto choler, vnto griefe, vnto hatred, yea and beyond him ſelf, whether and how ſoever they pleaſe, doth alſo by the Poet ſtrike &amp; enter into the Actor, and conſequently by the Actor, a whole auditorie or multitude. It is the ligament of our ſences depending one of another. Even from my infancie, Poeſie hath had the vertue to tranſpierce and tranſport me. But that lively and feeling-mouing that is naturally in me, hath diverſly beene handled, by the diverſitie of formes, not ſo much higher or lower (for they were ever the higheſt in every kind) as different in colour. Firſt a blithe and ingenious fluidity, then a quaint-witie, and lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conceit. To conclude, a ripe and conſtant force. <hi>Ovid, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Virgill,</hi> will better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. But here our Gallants are in their full cariere.</p>

If I chance to call one knaue or aſſe, my purpoſe is not, for ever to enfeoffe him with thoſe nick-names; nor doe I thinke to ſay, tong thou lieſt, if immediately after I call him an honeſt man. No qualitie doth embrace vs purely and vniverſally.

It is a kind of mockerie and iniurie, to raiſe a man to worth, by qualities miſ-ſeeming his place, and vnfittting his calling, although for ſome other reſpects praiſe-worthie; and alſo by qualities that ought not to be his principall object. As he that would commend a King to be a cunning Painter, or a skilfull Architect, or an excellent Harquibuzier, or a never miſſing runner at the Ring. Theſe commendations acquire a man no honour, if they be not preſented altogether with thoſe that are proper and convenient vnto him, that is to ſay, juſtice, and the skill to governe, and knowledge to direct his people both in peace &amp; warre.

Euery opinion is of ſufficient power to take hold of a man in reſpect of life. The firſt Article of that couragious oath, which the Countrie of <hi>Greece</hi> did ſweare, and keep, in the Median warre, was, that every particular man ſhould rather change his life vnto death, than the Perſian lawes for theirs.

The newes of this barbarous inhumanity being reported to thoſe that were yet on land, moſt of them reſolved to yeeld and continue bound-ſlaves: whereof ſome made a ſemblance to change their religion. <hi>Emanuel</hi> that immediately ſucceeded <hi>Iohn,</hi> being come to the Crowne, firſt ſet them at libertie, then changing his minde, commanded them to depart out of his dominions, and for their paſſages aſſigned them three ports. He hoped, as Biſhop <hi>Oſorius</hi> reporteth, (a Latine Hiſtorian of our ages, not to be deſpiſed) that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the libertie, to which he had reſtored them, having failed to convert them vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the difficultie to commit themſelves vnto marriners and pyrates robberies, to leave a Country where they were ſetled with great riches, for to go ſeeke vnknowen and ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, would bring them into <hi>Portugall</hi> againe. But ſeeing all his hopes fruſtrate, &amp; that they purpoſed to paſſe away, hee cut off two of the three ports he had promiſed them, that ſo the tedious diſtance and incommoditie of the paſſage might retaine ſome, or rather that he might have the meane to aſſemble them all together in one place, for a fitter opportunitie of the execution he intended, which was this. Hee appointed that all their children vnder fourteene yeeres of age, ſhould be taken from out the handes of their parents, and remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their ſight and converſation, to ſome place where they might be brought-vp, and inſtructed in our religion. He ſaith that this effect cauſed an horrible ſpectacle: The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection betweene the fathers and the children; moreover the zeale vnto their ancient faith, ſtriving againſt this violent ordinance. Diverſe fathers and mothers were ordinarily ſeene to kill themſelues, and with a more cruell example through compaſſion and love, to throw their yong children into pittes and welles, thereby to ſhunne the Law. The terme, which he had prefixed them being expired, for want of other meanes, they yeelded vnto thraldome. Some became Chriſtians, from whoſe faith and race, even at this day (for it is a hundred yeares ſince) few Portugalles aſſure themſelves; although cuſtome, and length of time be much more forcible counſellors vnto ſuch mutations, that any other compulſion.

For, having no heart to borrow before others, or by word of mouth, I would adventure it vpon a piece of paper, which with ſome hath no great power to move or force to perſwade, and which greatly helps to refuſe, I was wont to commit the ſucceſle of my wants more freely and more careleſſely vnto fortune, then I have done ſince vnto my wit and providence.

Neceſſitie muſt firſt pinch you by the throate, and touch you neere, before you will lay handes on it. And I ſhould ſooner pawne my clothes, or ſell my horſe, with leſſe care and compulſion, then make a breach into that beloved purſe, which I kept in ſtore. But the danger was, that a man can hardly prefix any certaine limits vnto his deſire (they are hard to be found in things a man deemeth good) and continue at one ſtay in ſparing: A man ſhall ever encreaſe this heape, and augment-it from one number to another; yea ſo long, til he baſely and niggardly deprive himſelfe of the enioying of his owne goods, and wholy fix-it on the ſafe-keeping of them, and never vſe them. According to this kind of vſage, thoſe are the richeſt people of the world, that have the charge of keeping the gates and walles of a rich Cittie. Every monied man is covetous, according to mine opinion. <hi>Plato</hi> marſhalleth this humane or corporall goods; <hi>health, beautie, ſtrength, riches: And riches,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not blind, but cleere-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they be illuminated by wiſedome.

The pleaſure I apprehended of a farre and chargeable journey, having overthrowne this fooliſh imagination in me; From which I am falne into a third kinde of life (I ſpeake what I thinke of it) aſſuredly much more pleaſing and formall: which is, that I meaſure my garment according to my cloth, and let my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences goe together with my comming in; ſometimes the one, other-whilſt the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes: But they are never farre a ſunder.

And it is folly to expect that fortune will ever ſufficiently arme vs againſt her-ſelfe. It is with our owne weapons that we muſt combate her.

And for his regard, I ſee no houſhould order, neither more worthily directed, nor more conſtantly managed then his. Happie is that man, that hath ſo proportionably directed his eſtate, as his riches may diſcharge and ſupply the ſame, without care or encombrance to himſelfe; and that neither their conſultation or meetings may in any ſorte interrupt other affaires or diſturbe other occupations, which he followeth, more convenient, more quier, and better agreeing with his heart. Therefore doth eaſe and indigencie depend from every mans owne opinion; and wealth and riches no more then glorie or health, have either more preheminence or pleaſure, then he who poſſeſſeth them, lendeth them. Every man is either well or ill, according as he findes himſelfe. Not he whom another thinkes content, but he is content indeede, that thinkes he is ſo himſelfe: And onely in that, opinion giveth it ſelfe eſſence and veritie. Fortune doth vs neither good nor ill: She onely offereth-vs the ſeede and matter of it, which our minde more powerfull then ſhe, turneth and applieth as beſt it pleaſeth: as the efficient cauſe and miſtris of condition, whether happie or vnhappie. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acceſſions take both ſavor and color from the internall conſtitution: As garments do notwarme-vs by their heate, but by ours, which they are fit to cover, and nouriſh: he that with clothes ſhould cover a cold body, ſhould draw the very ſame ſervice from them by cold. So is ſnow and yce kept in ſummmer. Verily as vnto an idle and lazie body, ſtudie is but a torment; abſtinence from wine to a drunkard, is a vexation; frugalitie is a harts ſorrowe to the luxurious; and exerciſe moleſteth an effeminate body: ſo is it of all things elſe. Things are not of themſelves ſo irkſome, nor ſo hard, but our baſenes, and weakeneſſe maketh them ſuch. To iudge of high land great matters, a high and great minde is required; otherwiſe we atribute that vice vnto them, which indeede is ours. A ſtraight oare being vnder water ſeemeth to be crooked. It is no matter to ſee a thing, but the matter is how a man dooth ſee the ſame. Well, of ſo many diſcourſes, which diverſly perſwade men to contemne death, and patiently to endure paine, why ſhall we not finde ſome on to make for our purpoſe; And of ſo ſeverall and many kinds of imagnations, that have perſwaded the ſame vnto others why doth not every man apply one vnto himſelfe, that is moſt agreeing with his humor; If he cannot digeſt a ſtrong and abſterſive drugge, for to remove his evill, let him at leaſt take a lenitive pill to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE maner wherewith our Lawes aſſay to moderate the fooliſh and vaine expences of table-cheare and apparell, ſeemeth contrarie to it's end. The beſt courſe were to beget in men a contempt of gold and ſilk-wearing, as of vaine and vnprofitable things, whereas we encreaſe their credite and price: A moſt indirect courſe to withdraw men from them. As for example, to let none but Princes eate dainties, or weare velvets, and clothes of Tiſſew, and interdict the people to do-it, what is-it but to give reputation vnto thoſe things, and to encreaſe their longing to vſe them? Let Kings boldly quit thoſe badges of honour; They have many other beſides: Such exceſſe is more excuſable in other men, then in Princes. We may, by the examples of divers Nations, learne ſundry better faſhions to diſtinguiſh our ſelves and our degrees (which truely I eſteeme requiſite in an eſtate,) without nouriſhing to that purpoſe, this ſo manifeſt corruption and apparant inconvenience. It is ſtrange how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in theſe indifferent things doth eaſilie encroch and ſodainly eſtabliſh the footing of hir authoritie. We had ſcarce worne cloth one whole yeare at the Court, what time we mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for our King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, but certainly in every mans opinion, all maner of ſilkes were alreadie become ſo vile and abject, that was any man ſeene to weare them, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently judged to be ſome countrie fellow, or mechanicall man. They were left only for Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians and Phyſitians. And albeit moſt men were apparreled a-like, yet were there other ſufficient apparant diſtinctions of mens qualities. How ſoone doe plaine chamoy-jerkins, and greaſie canvaſe doublets creepe into faſhion and credite amongſt our ſouldiers, if they lie in the field? And the gariſhneſſe, neatneſſe, and riches of ſilken garments grow in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorne? Let Kings firſt begin to leave theſe ſuperfluous expences, we ſhall all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and within a moneth, without edicts, ordinances, proclamations, and acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will be obſerved as a law. The ſtatutes ſhould ſpeake contrarie, as thus. That no man or woman, of what qualitie ſoever, ſhall, vpon paine of great forfeitures, weare any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſilke, of skarlet, or any gold-ſmiths worke, except only Enterlude-players, Harlots, and Curtizans- With ſuch an invention did <hi>Zaleucus</hi> whilome correct the corrupted maners of the <hi>Locrines.</hi> His ordinances were ſuch Be it enacted that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And we are warned, that the foundation or maine ſummers of our houſes faile and ſhrinke, when we ſee the quarters bend, or wals to breake. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Lawes, thinkes there is no worſe plague, or more pernicious in his Citie, then to ſuffer youth, to have the reines of libertie in her owne hand, to change in their attires, in their geſtures, dances, exerciſes, and ſongs, from one forme to an other: And to remove their judgement, now to this, now to that place; following new-fangled deviſes, and regarding their inventors: By which, old cuſtomes are corrupted, and ancient inſtitutions deſpiſed.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12117:79"/>
monie amongſt his ſervans, and whetted the edge of a ſword, wherewith he intended to wound himſelfe, expecting no other thing, but to know whether all his friends were gone to reſt, fell into ſo ſound a ſleepe, that the groomes of his chamber heard him ſnort in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other roome. This Emperours death hath many parts ſemblable vnto that of great <hi>Cato,</hi> and namely this: For, <hi>Cato</hi> being prepared to defeat himſelfe, whileſt he expected to heare newes, whether the Senators, whom he cauſed to retire, were lanched out from the haven of <hi>Vtica,</hi> fell ſo faſt aſleep, that he was heard to ſnort into the next chamber: And he whom he had ſent toward the port, having awaked him, to tell him, the ſtorme was ſo rough, that the Senators could not conveniently put out to ſea, he ſent another, and lying downe a new, fell aſleep againe, vntill the laſt meſſenger aſſured him, they were gone. We may alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> in that great and dangerous ſtorme, which threatned him, by the ſedition of <hi>Metellus</hi> the Tribune, who laboured to publiſh the decree of <hi>Pompeys</hi> re-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal into the Citie, together with his armie, at what time the commotion of <hi>Catiline</hi> was on foote: againſt which decree onely <hi>Cato</hi> did inſiſt, and to that purpoſe had <hi>Metellus</hi> and he had many injurious ſpeeches, and menaced one another in the Senate-houſe: And it was the next day, they were like to come to the execution in the market-place, where <hi>Metellus,</hi> beſides the favour of the common people, and of <hi>Caeſar</hi> then conſpiring and complotting for the aduancement of <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſhould come, accompanied with a multitude of ſtrange and fortaine ſlaves and fencers, to doe their vtmoſt: And <hi>Cato</hi> ſtrengthened with his onely conſtancie, and with an vnmated reſolve: So that his kinſmen, his familiars, and many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men tooke great care, and were in heavie anxietie and penſiveneſſe for him: of which many never left him all night, but ſate vp together, without reſt, eating, or drinking, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the danger they ſaw prepared for him; yea, his wife and ſiſters did nought but weep and waile, and for his ſake torment themſelves in their houſe, whereas contrariwiſe he alone comforted every bodie, and blamed them, for their demiſſeneſſe: And after he had ſupped, (as he was wont) he went quietly to his bed, and ſlept verie ſoundly vntill the next morning, that one of his copartners in the Tribune-ſhip, came to call him, to goe to the skirmiſh. The knowledge we have of this mans vnmated-haughtie heart, by thereſt of his life; may make vs judge with all ſecuritie, that it onely proceeded from a ſpirit, ſo far elevated above ſuch accidents, that he dained not ſo much as to trouble his mind with them, no more then with ordinarie chances. In the ſea-fight, which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gained againſt <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> even at the inſtant he ſhould go to fight, was ſurpriſed with ſo heavie a ſleep, that his friends were compelled to awaken-him, to give the ſignall of the battell; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gave occaſion vnto <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> to charge him with this imputation, that he had not dared with open eyes to ſurvay the marſhalling of his armie, and that his heart would not ſuffice him, to preſent himſelfe vnto his ſouldiers, vntill ſuch time that <hi>Agrippa</hi> brought him newes of the victorie he had obtained of his enemies. But concerning yong <hi>Marius,</hi> who committed a greater errour (for on the day of his laſt battel againſt <hi>Sylla,</hi> after he had marſhalled his armie, and given the word or ſignall of the battell) he lay downe in the ſhadow vnder a tree, a while to reſt himſelfe, and fell ſo faſt aſleep, that he could hardly be awaked with the rout and flight of his men, having ſeen no part of the fight, they ſay, it was becauſe he was ſo exceedingly aggravated with travell, and over-tired with wearineſſe, and want of ſleep, that nature was overcome, and could no longer endure. And touching this point, Phiſitians may conſider; whether ſleep be ſo neceſſarie, that our life muſt needs depend of-it: For we find that <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> being kept from ſleep, was made to die; but <hi>Plinie</hi> aleadgeth, that ſome have lived a long time without any ſleep at all.

                        <p>THere hapned divers rare accidents, and remarkable chances in our battell of <hi>Dreux:</hi> but thoſe who do not greatly favour the reputation of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> doe boldly aledge, that he cannot be excuſed, to have made a ſtand, and temporiſed with the forces he commaunded, whilſt the Lord Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> Generall of the Armie, was engaged and ſuppreſſed with the enemies Artillerie, and that it had been better for him, to hazard himſelfe, to charge the enemie flankwiſe, then by expecting any aduantage, to have him come behind him, to ſuffer ſo reprochfull an overthrow, and ſo ſhamefull a loſſe. But omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what the event thereof witneſſed, he that ſhall without paſſion debate the matter, ſhall eaſilie (in my conceit) confeſſe, that the ayme and drift, not onely of a Captaine, but of every particular Souldier, ought chiefly to reſpect a victorie in great: And that no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occurrences, of what conſequence ſoever, or what intereſt may depend on them, ſhould never divert-him from that point. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> in an encounter with <hi>Machanidas,</hi> having ſent before, a ſtrong troupe of Archers, and good marke men, to begin the skirmiſh: and the enemie, after he had put them to route and diſ-ranked them, ammuſing himſelfe in mainly purſuing them, and following the victorie alongſt the maine battell, where <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poemen</hi> was, although his ſouldiers were much moved and offended to ſee their fellowes put to the worſt, he could not be induced to bouge from his place, nor make head againſt his enemie, to ſuccour his men; but rather, having ſuffered them to be defeated, and cut in pieces before his face, began then to charge his enemies in the battalion of their Infanterie, when he perceived them forſaken of their horſemen: And albeit they were Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, foraſmuch as he charged them, at what time (ſuppoſing to have gained the day) they began to diſorder themſelves, he eaſilie overcame them; which done, he purſued <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas.</hi> This caſe, is couſin-german vnto that of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> In that ſharpe-bloodie battell of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> againſt the Boeotians, which <hi>Xenophon</hi> (who was there preſent) ſaith, <hi>To have beene the whotteſt and rudeſt, that ever he had ſeene: Ageſilaus</hi> refuſed the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which fortune preſented him, to let the battalion of the Boeotians paſſe, and to charge them behind, what certaine victorie ſoever he ſaw likely to follow the ſame, eſteeming that it were rather skill then valour, and to ſhew his proweſſe, and matchleſſe-haughtie courage, choſe rather to charge them in the front of their forces: But what followed?

A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man my neighbour, eſteeming the commodities of ancient times in regard of our daies, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not to aledge the fierceneſſe and magnificence of the names of the Nobilitie of thoſe times, as Don <hi>Grumedan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quedragan,</hi> and <hi>Ageſilan:</hi> And that, but to heare them ſounded, a man might eaſilie perceive; they had been other manner of men; then <hi>Peter, Gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

To conclude my diſcourſe; It is an ill cuſtome, and of exceeding bad conſequence in our countrie of <hi>France,</hi> to call every man by the name of his Towne, Mannor, Hamlet, or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as the thing that doth moſt confound houſes, and bring ſur-names out of knowledge. A cadet or yonger-brother of a good houſe, having had for his appanage a Lordſhip, by whoſe name he hath beene knowne and honored, cannot well forſake and leave the ſame ten yeares after his death; His Lord-ſhip commeth vnto a ſtranger, who doth the like: Gheſſe then where we are, and how we ſhall doe to come to the perfect knowledge of theſe men. Wee need not goe far for other examples, but looke into our Royall houſe, where ſo many partages, ſo many ſur-names, and ſo many ſeverall titles have ſo encumbred-vs, that the originall of the ſtocke is vtterly loſt. There is ſo much libertie in theſe mutations, that even in my time, I have ſeen no man nor woman advanced by fortune vnto ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie preferment, that hath not immediatly had adjoyned vnto him or hir Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall titles, new and vnknowne to their fathers, and that hath not beene engraffed into ſome noble ſtocke or familie.

Was it not pretilie ſaid, and with a good grace, by one of my friends? There was a great companie bandied together about a quarell which a Gentleman had with another, who in verie truth had ſome prerogative of titles, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and alliances aboue the common ſort of Nobilitie; vpon which word of his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, every one ſeeking to equall himſelfe vnto him, alledged, ſome one of ſpring, ſome another, ſome the reſemblance of his name, ſome of his armes, otherſome an old far-fetcht pedigree, and the meaneſt of them to be the great grand-child of ſome King beyond the Seas. When they came all to dinner, this man whom hitherto they had all followed, in liew of taking his wonted place, making low-lowting reverences, went to the loweſt end of the board, entreating the companie to hold him excuſed, that through raſh-vnadviſedneſſe he had hitherto lived with them companion-like, but now being lately enformed of their right qualities, he began to know them according to their ancient degrees, and that it did not duly belong vnto him to ſit above ſo many Princes. And after he had acted his play, he began to raile vpon them with a thouſand injuries; ſaying thus vnto them. For the love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelves, with what your forefathers have been contented, and with the ſtate whereto God hath called-vs: we have ſufficient if we can maintaine it well, let-vs not diſparage the fortune and condition of our predeceſſors; and reject-we theſe fond imaginations, which can not faile any man, whatſoever he be, that is ſo impudent as to alledge them. Creſts, Armes, and Coates have no more certaintie then ſurnames. I beare Azure ſemè of trefoiles, a Lions Paw in faece, Or, armed Gules. What priviledge hath this Coate, that it ſhould for ever continue particularly to my houſe? A ſonne in law will transferre the ſame into an other familie: Some ſilly-vpſtart purchaſer of Armes will make it his chiefe coate. There is nothing wherein meet ſo many alterations, and ſo much confuſion.</p>
                        <p>But this conſideration draweth me perforce vnto an other field. Let vs ſomewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſearch-into, and for Gods ſake conſider, on what foundation we ground this glorie and reputation, for which the world is turned topſie-turvie. On what doe we eſtabliſh this tranſitorie renowne, which with ſo great mind-poſſeſſing toyle, and induſtrie we ſeeke and gape-after? In fine, it is <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>William,</hi> that beareth the ſame (marke-it well Reader) and to whom it belongeth. Is not hope a couragious facultie, which in a mortall ſubject, and in a moment, ſeekes to vſurp infinite, and immenſitie, and to repleniſh his maſters indigence with the poſſeſſion of al things he can imagine or deſire, before it would? Nature hath given vs a pleaſant joy to play withall in that.

A reaſon (ſaith <hi>Xenophon</hi>) why the Aſiatikes carried with them, when they went to warres their wives and Concubines, with all their jewels and chiefeſt wealth. And might alſo encline to the other ſide, which is, that a man ſhould rather remoove from his ſouldier, all care to preſerve himſelfe, than to encreaſe-it vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, by that meanes he ſhall doubly feare to hazard or engage himſelfe, ſeeing theſe rich ſpoiles do rather encreaſe an earneſt deſire of victorie in the enemie: and it hath been obſerved, that the ſaid reſpect hath ſometimes wonderfully encouraged the Romans againſt the Samnites. <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſhewing the Armie, he prepared againſt them, gorgeouſly accountred with all pompe and ſtatelineſſe, vnto <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him, whether the Romanes would be contented with-it: yea verily, anſwered the other, they will be verie well pleaſed with-it: They muſt needs be ſo, were they never ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. <hi>Licurgus</hi> forbad his Souldiers, not only all maner of ſumptuouſneſſe, in their equipage, but alſo to vncaſe or ſtrip their enemies, when they overcame them, willing, as he ſaid, that frugalitie &amp; povertie ſhould ſhine with the reſt of the battell. Both at ſieges, and elſe-where, where occaſion brings vs neere the enemie, we freely give our ſouldiers libertie, to brave, to diſdaine, and injurie him with all maner of reproaches: And not without apparance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for, it is no ſmall matter, to take from them all hope of grace and compoſition, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto them, that there is no way left to expect-it, from-him, whom they have ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly outraged, and that there is no remedy left but from victorie. Yet had <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itelluis</hi> but bad ſucceſſe in that; for, having to deale with <hi>Otho,</hi> weaker in his Souldiers valour, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long diſaccuſtomed from warre, and effeminated through the delights and pleaſures of the Citie, himſelfe in the end ſet them ſo on fire with his reproachſull and injurious words, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayding them with their puſilanimitie and faint-hartedneſſe, and with the regret of their Ladies, banquettings and ſenſualities, which they had left at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he put them into hart againe, which no perſwaſions or other means could do before; and thereby drew them, whom nought could have driven, to fight, and fall vpon him. And verilie, when they are injuries that touch a man to the quicke, they ſhall eaſilie vrge him, who was verie backward to fight for his Kings quarrell, to be verie forward in his owne cauſe or intereſt. If a man but conſider of what conſequence the preſervation, and importance, the ſafetie of a generall is in an Armie, and how the enemies chiefeſt ayme, is at the faireſt marke, which is the head, from which all other depend, it ſeemeth that that counſell can not be doubted of, which by ſundrie great Chieftaines we have ſeene put in practiſe, which is, in the beginning of the fight, or in the furie of the battell, to diſguiſe themſelves. Notwithſtanding the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a man may by this meanes incurre, is no leſſe then that miſchiefe, which a man ſeeketh to avoid: For the Captaine being vnſeene and vnknowne of his Souldiers, the courage they take by his example, and the hart they keep by his preſence, is therewithall empaired and diminiſhed; and looſing the knowne enſignes, and accuſtomed markes of their Leader, they either deeme him dead, or diſpairing of any good ſucceſſe, to be fled. And touching experience, we ſometimes ſee-it to favour the one, and ſometimes the other partie.

Among other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, that <hi>Pompey</hi> is charged withall in the battell of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> this is one ſpeciall, that he idlely lingred with his Armie, expecting what his enemie would attempt; foraſmuch as that (I will heare borrow the verie words of <hi>Plutarke,</hi> which are of more conſequence then mine) weakneth the violence, that running giveth the firſt blowes, and therewithall remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the charging of the Combattants one againſt another, which more, then any other thing is wont to fill them with furie and impetuoſitie, when with vehemence they come to enter-ſhocke one another, augmenting their courage by the crie and running; and in a maner alayeth and quaileth the heat of the Souldiers: Loe-here what he ſaith concerning this. But had <hi>Caeſar</hi> loſt, who might not alſo have ſaid, that contrariwiſe the ſtrongeſt and firmeſt ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is that, wherein a man keeps his ſtand without budging, and that who is ſettled in his

march, cloſing, and againſt any time of need, ſparing his ſtrength in himſelfe, hath a great advantage againſt him, that is in motion and diſordered, and that running hath alreadie conſumed part of his breath? Moreover, that an armie being a bodie compoſed of ſo many ſeverall parts, it is impoſſible it ſhould in ſuch furie advance it ſelfe with ſo juſt a march, and proportioned a motion, and not breake and diſ-ranke, or at leaſt alter hir ordinance, and that the nimbleſt be not grapling before his fellowes may help-him. In that drearie battell of the two Perſian brethren, <hi>Clearchus</hi> the Lacedemonian, who commanded the Graecians that followed <hi>Cycus</hi> his faction, led them faire and gently without any haſt-making to their charges; but when he came within fiſtie paces of his enemies, he bad them with all ſpeed to run vnto it; hoping by the ſhortneſſe of the diſtance to manage their order and direct their breath; in the meane time giving them the advantage of the impetuoſitie, both for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and for their ſhooting-armes. Others have ordered this doubt in their armie after this maner: If your enemies headlong run vpon you, ſtay for them and bouge not: If they without ſtirring ſtay for you, run with furie vpon them.</p>
                        <p>In the paſſage which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift made into <hi>Provence,</hi> our king <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, ſtood a good while vpon this choice; whether it were beſt, by way of prevention, to go and meet with him in <hi>Italie,</hi> or to ſtay his comming into <hi>France:</hi> and albeit he conſidered what an advantage it is, for one to preſerve his houſe from the troubles and miſchiefes that warre brings with it, to the end that poſſeſſing hir whole ſtrength, it may continually in all times of need, ſtore him with money, and ſupplie him with all other helps; and conſidering how the neceſſitie of direfull warre, doth dailie enforce a Generall to make ſpoile of goods, and waſte the Countrie, which cannot well be done in our own goods &amp; countrie: and if the countriman doth not as patiently indure this ravage at his friends hands, as at his enemies, ſo as ſeditions may enſue amongſt our owne factions, and troubles among our friends: That licence to rob and ſpoile, which in his Countrie may not be tolerated, is a great furtherauce in a Souldier, and makes him the more willing, to endure the miſeries and toylings that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low warre: And what a hard matter it is to keep the Souldier in office and hart, who hath no other hope of profit, but his bare pay, and is ſo neere his wife, his children, his friends, and his home: <hi>That he who layeth the cloth, is ever put to the greateſt charges: That there is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in aſſailing than in defending:</hi> And that the apprehenſion of a battell-loſt in our owne home and entrailes, is ſo violent, that it may eaſily ſnake the whole frame, and diſtemper the whole bodie. Seeing there is no paſſion ſo contagious, as that of feare, nor ſo eaſie apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and taken a-truſt, or doth more furiouſly poſſeſſe all parts of man: And that the Cities or Townes, which have either heard the buſtling noiſe of the Tempeſt, or ſeene the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of this all conſuming fire at their gates, or have perhaps received their captaines woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their Citizens purſued, and their Souldiers ſpoiled, and all out of breath, if they be not more then obſtinately-conſtant, it is a thouſand to one, if in that brunt of furie, they do not headlong caſt themſelves into ſome deſperate reſolution: yet did he conclude and choſe this reſolve for the beſt. Firſt to revoke his forces, he had beyond the Mountaines in <hi>Italie,</hi> and to ſtay his enemies approches. For, he might on the contrarie part imagine, that being in his owne Countrie, and amidſt good friends, he had the better leaſure to re-enforce his decayed forces, and more oportunitie, to ſtrengthen Townes, to munite Caſtles, to ſtore Rivers with all neceſſaries they wanted, and to keep all paſſages at his devotion, which done, all the waies ſhould be open for him, and might by them have all maner of victuals, money, and other hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12117:83"/>
at the ſwords point; where he ſhould never have leaſure to take any reſt, or breath; where he ſhould have no knowledge of places, paſſages, woods, foords, rivers, or countrie, that might defend him from ambuſcados, or ſurpriſes: And if he ſhould vnfortunately chance to looſe a battell, no hope to ſave, or meanes to re-unite the reliques of his forces. And there want not examples to ſtrengthen both ſides. <hi>Scipio</hi> found-it better for him to invade his enemies countrie of <hi>Affrica,</hi> then to defend his owne, and fight with him in <hi>Italie,</hi> where he was, wherein he had good ſucceſſe. But contrariwiſe, <hi>Hanniball,</hi> in the ſame warre wrought his owne overthrow, by leaving the conqueſt of a forraine countrie, for to go and defend his owne. The Athenians having left the enemie in their owne land, for to paſſe into <hi>Sicilie,</hi> had verie ill ſucceſſe, and were much contraried by fortune: whereas <hi>Agathocles</hi> King of <hi>Siracuſa</hi> proſpered and was favoured by her, what time he paſſed into <hi>Affrica,</hi> and left the warre on ſoote in his owne countrie. And we are accuſtomed to ſay with ſome ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that eſpecially in matters of warre, the events depend (for the greateſt part) on fortune; which ſeldome will yeeld, or never ſubject her-ſelfe vnto our diſcourſe or wiſedome, as ſay theſe enſuing verſes.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>BEhold, I am now become a Gramarian, I, who never learn't tongue but by way of roat, and that yet know knot what either Adjective, Conjunctive, or Ablative meaneth. As far as I remember, I have ſometimes heard-ſay, that the Romanes had certaine horſes, which they called <hi>Funales,</hi> or <hi>Dextrarios,</hi> which on the right hand were led-by as ſpare horſes, to take them freſh at any time of need: And thence it commeth, that we call hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſervice <hi>Deſtriers.</hi> And our ancient Romanes doe ordinarily ſay, to <hi>Adexter,</hi> in ſteed of, to accompanie. They alſo called <hi>Deſultorios equos,</hi> certaine horſes that were ſo taught, that mainly-running with all the ſpeede they had, joyning ſides to one another, without either bridle or ſaddle, the Roman gentlemen armed at all aſſayes, in the middeſt of their running-race, would caſt and recaſt themſelves from one to an other horſe. The Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian men at armes, were wont to have a ſecond ſpare-horſe led by hand, that in the greateſt furie of the battell, they might ſhift and change horſe: <hi>Quibus, deſultorum in modum, binos</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Liv bel pun. dec. 3. l. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>trahentibus equos, inter acerrimam ſoepe pugnam in recentem equum ex feſſo armatis tranſultare, mos erat. Tanta velocitas ipſis, támque docile equorum genus. Whoſe maner was, as if they had been vaulters, leading two horſes with them in armour to leap from their tired horſe to the freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, even in the hotteſt of the fight. So great agilitie was in themſelves, and ſo apt to be taught was the race of their horſes.</hi> There are many horſes found, that are taught to helpe their maſter, to run vpon any man ſhall offer to draw a naked ſword vpon them; furiouſly to leap vpon any man, both with feete to ſtrike, and with teeth to bite, that ſhall affront them; but that for the moſt part they rather hurt their friends then their enemies.

alſo, that if they once be grapled, you can not eaſilie take them-off, and you muſt needs ſtand to the mercie of their combat. <hi>Artibius,</hi> Generall of the Perſian armie had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ill lucke to be mounted vpon a horſe faſhioned in this ſchoole, at what time he ſought man to man againſt <hi>Oneſilus</hi> King of <hi>Salamis;</hi> for, he was the cauſe of his death, by reaſon the ſhield-bearer or ſquire of <hi>Oneſilus</hi> cut him with a faulchon betweene the two ſhoulders, even as he was leaping vpon his maſter. And if that, which the Italians report be true, that in the battell of <hi>Fornovo.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> his horſe with kicking, winching, and flying, rid both his maſter and himſelfe from the enemies that encompaſt-him, to diſmount or kill him, and without that, he had beene loſt: He committed himſelfe to a great hazard, and ſcap't a narrow ſcowring. The Mammalukes boaſt, that they have the nimbleſt and readieſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of any men at armes in the world. That both by nature they are inſtructed to diſcerne, and by cuſtome taught to diſtinguiſh their enemie, on whom they muſt leap and wince with feet, and bite with teeth, according to the voice their maſter ſpeaketh, or rider giveth them. And are likewiſe taught to take vp from the ground, lances, darts, or any other weapons with their mouths, and as he commandeth to preſent them to their rider. It is ſaid of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, that amongſt their many other excellent qualities, they were alſo moſt cunning and perfect horſemen; and namely of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that in his youth being mounted vpon a horſe, and without any bridle, he made him run a full cariere, make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſtop, and with his hands behind his backe performe what ever can be expected of an excellent readie horſe. And even as nature was pleaſed to make both him and <hi>Alexander</hi> two matchleſſe miracles in militarie profeſſion, ſo would you ſay, ſhe hath alſo endevoured, yea, enforced herſelfe to arme them extraordinarily; For, all men know, that <hi>Alexanders</hi> horſe called <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> had a head ſhaped like vnto that of a bull; that he ſuffered no man to get-on and ſit-him, but his maſter; that none could wealde and manage him but he; what honours were done him after his death, all know, for he had a Citie erected in his name. <hi>Caeſar</hi> likewiſe had another, who had his fore-feet like vnto a mans, with hoofes cloven in forme of fingers, who could never be handled, dreſt, or mounted but by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who when he died, dedicated his image to the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus.</hi> If I be once on horſe-backe, I alight verie vnwillingly; for, it is the ſeat I like beſt, whether I be ſound or ſicke.

                        <p>I Would willingly excuſe our people for having no other patterne or rule of perfection, but his owne cuſtomes, his owne faſhions: For, it is a common vice, not onely in the vulgar ſorte, but as it were in all men, to bend their ayme, and frame their thoughts vnto the faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein they were borne. I am pleaſed when he ſhall ſee <hi>Fabricius</hi> or <hi>Laelius,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are neither attired nor faſhioned according to our manner, that he condemne their countenance to be ſtrange, and their cariage barbarous. But I bewaile his particular indiſcretion, in that he ſuffereth him ſelfe to be ſo blinded, and deceived by the authoritie of preſent cuſtome, and that if cuſtome pleaſeth, he is readie to change opinion, and varie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12117:86"/>
every moneth, nay every day, and judgeth ſo diverſly of himſelfe. When he wore ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſted doublets, and but little lower then his breaſt, he would maintaine by militant reaſons, that the waſte was in his right place: but when not long after he came to weare them ſo long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſted, yea almoſt ſo low as his privities, then began he to condemne the former faſhion, as fond, intollerable and deformed; and to commend the latter, as comely, handſome, and commendable. A new faſhion of apparell creepeth no ſooner into vſe, but preſently he blameth and diſpraiſeth the old, and that with ſo earneſt a reſolution, and vniverſall a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that you would ſay, it is ſome kind of madneſſe, or ſelfe-fond humor, that giddieth his vnderſtanding.</p>
                        <p>And for aſmuch as our changing or altering of faſhions, is ſo ſudden and new-fangled, that the inventions, and new deviſes of all the tailors in the world, cannot ſo faſt invent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, it muſt neceſſarily follow that neglected, and ſtale reiected faſhions doe often come into credite and vſe againe: And the lateſt and neweſt, within a while-after come to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt and deſpiſed, and that one ſelfe ſame judgement within the ſpace of fifteene or twenty yeares admitteth, not onely two or three different, but alſo cleane contrary opinions, with ſo light and incredible inconſtancie, that any man would wonder at it.

                        <p>IVdgement is an inſtrument for all ſubiects, and medleth every where. And therefore in the Eſſayes I make of it, there is no maner of occaſion, I ſeeke not to employ therein. If it be a ſubiect I vnderſtand not my ſelfe, therein I make triall of it, ſounding afarre off the depth of the ford, and finding the ſame over deepe for my reach, I keepe my ſelfe on the ſhoare. And to acknowledge not to be able to wade through, is a part of it's effect, yea of ſuch whereof he vanteth moſt. If I light vpon a vaine and idle ſubiect, I aſſay to trie, and endevor to ſee, whether I may find a good ground to worke vpon, and matter to frame a body, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to builde and vnder-lay-it. Sometimes I addreſſe my judgement and contrive-it to a noble and out-worne ſubject, wherein is nothing found ſubſiſting of it ſelfe, the high way to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12117:88"/>
it, being ſo bare-trodden, that it cannot march, but in other ſteps. There he pleaſeth himſelf in chuſing the courſe he thinkes beſt, and a thouſand paths ſometimes he ſaith, this or that was beſt choſen. I take my firſt Argument of fortune: All are alike vnto me: And I never purpoſe to handle them throughly: For, there is nothing wherein I can perceive the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Which they doe not that promiſe to ſhew it-vs. Of a hundred partes and viſages that everie thing hath, I take one, which ſometimes I ſlightly runne-over, and other times but curſorily glance-at. And yet other whilſt I pinch it to the quicke. And give it a <hi>Stockado,</hi> not the wideſt, but the deepeſt I can. And for the moſt part I love to ſeize vpon them by ſome vnwonted luſtre. I would adventure to treate and diſcourſe of ſome matter to the depth; knew I my ſelfe leſſe, or where I deceived in mine owne impuiſſance; Scattering here one and there another worde: Scantlings taken from their maine ground-work, diſorderly diſperſed, without any well-grounded deſigne and promiſe. I am not bound to make it good, nor without varying to keepe my ſelfe cloſe tied vnto-it; whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe me to yeeld my ſelfe to doubt, to vncertaintie, and to my Miſtris forme, which is ignorance. Ech motion ſheweth and diſcouereth what we are. The very ſame minde of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> we ſee in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, marſhalling, and ſetting the battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> is likewiſe ſeene to order, diſpoſe, and contrive, idle, trifling and amorous deviſes. We iudge of a horſe, not onely by ſeeing him ridden, and cunningly managed, but alſo by ſeeing him trot, or pace; yea, if we but looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as he ſtands in the ſtable. Amongſt the functions of the ſoule, ſome are but meane and baſe. He that ſeeth hir no further, can never know hir thorowly. And he that ſeeth hir march hir naturall and ſimple pace, doth peradventure obſerve hir beſt. The winds of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions take hir moſt in her higheſt pitch, ſeeing ſhe entirely coucheth hirſelfe vpon every mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wholy therein exerciſeth hirſelfe: and handleth but one at once; not according to-it, but according to hirſelfe. Things ſeverall in themſelves have peradventure, weight, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and condition: But inwardly, in vs, ſhe cuttes-it out for them, as ſhe vnderſtandeth the ſame hirſelfe. Death is fearefull and vgly vnto <hi>Cicero;</hi> wiſhed-for and deſired of <hi>Cato:</hi> and indifferent vnto <hi>Socrates.</hi> Health, well-fare, conſcience, authoritie, riches, glory, beauty, and their contraries are diſpoyled at the entrance, and receive a new veſture at the ſoules hand. Yea, and what coulour ſhe pleaſeth; browne, bright greene, ſadde, or any hew elſe: ſharpe or ſweete, deepe or ſuperficiall, and what each of them pleaſeth. For, none of them did ever veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their ſtiles, their rules, or formes in common; each on ſeverally is a Queene in hir owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Therefore let vs take no more excuſes from externall qualites of things. To vs it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to give our ſelves accoumpt of it. Our good, and our evill hath no dependancy, but from our ſelves. Let vs offer our vowes and offerings vnto it; and not to fortune. She hath no power over our maners. Why ſhall I not iudge of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as I am ſitting and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Table, and talking in good company? Or if hee were playing at Cheſſe, what ſtring of his witte doth not touch or harpe on this fond-childiſh, and time-conſuming play? I lothe and ſhunne-it, only becauſe there is not ſport inough in it, and that in his recreation, he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerious with vs, being aſhamed I muſt apply that attention thervnto, as might be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſome good ſubiect. He was no more buſied in levying his forces and preparing for his glorious paſſage into <hi>India;</hi> nor this other in diſintangling and diſcovering of a paſſage, whence dependeth the wel-fare and ſafety of mankind. See how much our mind troubleth this ridiculous ammuzing, if all hir ſinnewes bandy not. How amply ſhe giveth every one Law in that, to know and directly to iudge of himſelfe.

Such was the ſcience and profeſſion of him, who long time buſied himſelfe, to number how many ſeverall waies the letters of the Alphabet might be ranged, and found-out that incredible number mentioned by <hi>Plutarke.</hi> I allow of his opinion, who having one brought before him, that was taught with ſuch induſtrie, and ſo curiouſly to caſt a graine of Millet with his hand, that without ever miſſing, he would every time make-it goe through a needles-eye; and being entreated to beſtow ſome thing vpon him, (as a reward for ſo rare a skill,) verie pleaſantly and worthily, commaunded, that this cunning workman ſhould have two or thee peckes of Millet delivered him, to the end his rare arte and wittie labour might not remaine without da lie exerciſe. It is a wonderfull teſtimonie of our judgements imbecilitie, that it ſhould commend and allow of things, either for their rareneſſe, or noveltie, or for their difficultie, though neither goodneſſe or profit be joyned vnto them.

any impreſſion therein. The ordinarie and meane condition of men abideth betweene theſe two extremities; which are thoſe that perceive and have a feeling of michiefes, but can not endure them. Both infancie and decrepitude meet with weakneſſe of the braine. Covetiſe and profuſion in a like deſire to acquire and hoard-vp. It may with likelyhoode be ſpoken, that there is a kind of <hi>Abecedarie</hi> ignorance, preceding ſcience: an other doctorall, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcience: an ignorance, which ſcience doth beget: even as it ſpoileth the firſt. Of ſimple, leſſe-curious, and leaſt-inſtructed ſpirits are made good chriſtians, who ſimplie beleeve through reverence and obedience, and are kept in awe of the lawes. In the meane vigor of ſpirits, and ſlender capacitie is engendred the error of opinions: They follow the apparance of the firſt ſenſe; and have ſome title to interpret-it fooliſhneſſe and ſottiſhneſſe, that we are confirmed in ancient waies, reſpecting vs, that are nothing therein inſtructed by ſtudie. The beſt, moſt-ſetled, and cleareſt-ſeeing ſpirits, make another ſort of well-beleevers, who by long and religious inveſtigation, penetrate a more profound, and find-out a more abſtruſe light in ſcriptures, and diſcover the miſterious and divine ſecrets of our eccleſiaſticall pollicie. And therefore ſee we ſome of them, that have reached vnto this laſt ranke, by the ſecond, with wonderfull fruit and confirmation; as vnto the furtheſt bounds of chriſtian intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: and injoy their victorie with comfort, thanſ-giving, reformation of manners, and great modeſtie. In which ranke, my purpoſe is not to place theſe others, who to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſuſpicion of their forepaſſed errors, and the better to aſſure vs of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extreame, indiſcreet, and vnjuſt in the conduct of our cauſe, and taxe and taint the ſame with infinit reproches of violence. The ſimple peaſants are honeſt men; ſo are Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, (or as our time nameth them, ſtrong and cleare natures) enriched with a large inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of profitable ſciences. The mongrell ſort of husband-men, who have diſdained the firſt forme of ignorance of letters, and could never reach vnto the other (as they that ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two ſtooles, of which beſides ſo many others I am one) are dangerous, peeviſh, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and importunate, and they which trouble the world moſt. Therefore do I (as much as lieth in me) with-draw my ſelfe into the firſt and naturall ſeat, whence I never aſſaied to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Popular and meerely naturall Poeſie, hath certaine graces, and in-bred livelineſſe, whereby it concurreth and compareth it ſelfe vnto the principall beautie of perfect and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Poeſie, as may plainly be ſeene in the <hi>Villannelles,</hi> homely gigs, and countrie ſongs of <hi>Gaſconie,</hi> which are brought vnto vs from Nations, that have no knowledge at all, either of any learning, or ſo much as of writing. Meane and indifferent Poeſie, and that conſiſteth betweene both, is skorned, and contemned, and paſſeth without honour or eſteeme. But foraſmuch as ſince the paſſage hath been opened vnto the ſpirit, I have found (as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hapneth) that we had apprehended that which is neither ſo nor ſo for a difficult ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and of a rare ſubject; And that ſince our invention hath been ſet on fire, it diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an infinit number of like examples; I will onely adde this one: That if theſe Eſſayes were worthie to be judged-of, it might in mine opinion happen, that they would not greatly pleaſe the common and vulgar ſpirits, and as little the ſingular and excellent. The firſt will vnderſtand but little of them, the latter over-much; they might perhaps live and rub out in the middle region.</p>

                        <p>The ſimpleſt and meerely-naturall ſmels, are moſt pleaſing vnto me; which care ought chiefly to concerne women. In the verie heart of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> the Scithian women, after they had waſhed themſelves, did ſprinkle, dawbe, and powder all their bodies and faces over, with a certaine odoriferous drug, that groweth in their Countrie: which duſt and dawbing being taken away, when they come neere men, or their husbands, they remaine verie cleane, and with a verie ſweet-ſavouring perfume. What odor ſoever it be, it is ſtrange to ſee, what hold it will take on-me, and how apt my skin is to receive it. He that complaineth againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſhe hath not created man with a fit inſtument, to carrie ſweet ſmels faſt-tied to his noſe, is much to blame: for, they carrie themſelves. As for me in particular, my moſtachoes, which are verie thicke, ſerve me for that purpoſe. Let me but approach my gloves or my hand-kercher to them, their ſmell will ſticke vpon them a whole day. They manifeſt the place I come from. The cloſe-ſmacking, ſweetneſſe-moving, love-alluring, and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmirking kiſſes of youth, were heretofore wont to ſticke on them many houres after; yet am I little ſubject to thoſe popular diſeaſes, that are taken by converſation, and bred by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of the ayre: And I have eſcaped thoſe of my time, of which there hath been many and ſeverall kinds, both in the Townes about me, and in our Armie. We read of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that during the time of many plagues and relapſes of the peſtilence, which ſo often infeſted the Citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> he never forſooke or went out of the Towne: yet was he the onely man, that was never infected, or that felt any ſickneſſe. Phiſitians might (in mine opinion) draw more vſe and good from odours, then they doe. For, my ſelfe have often perceived, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto their ſtrength and qualitie, they change and alter, and move my ſpirits, and worke ſtrange effects in me: which makes me approve the common ſaying, that the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of incenſe and perfumes in Churches, ſo ancient and ſo far-diſperſed throughout all nations and religions, had an eſpeciall regard to rejoyce, to comfort, to quicken, to rowze, and to purifie our ſenſes, that ſo we might be the apter and readier vnto contemplation. And the better to judge of it, I would I had my part of the skill, which ſome Cookes have, who can ſo curiouſly ſeaſon and temper ſtrange odors with the ſavour and relliſh of their meats. As it was eſpecially obſerved in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Tunes,</hi> who in our dayes landed at <hi>Naples,</hi> to meete and enter-parly with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. His viands were ſo exquiſitely farced, and ſo ſumptuouſly ſeaſoned with ſweet odoriferous drugs, and aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſpices, that it was found vpon his booke of accompt, the dreſſing of one peacocke, and two feſants amounted to one hundred duckets; which was their ordinarie maner of cooking his meates. And when they were carved-vp, not onely the dining chambers, but all the roomes of his pallace, and the ſtreets round about-it were repleniſhed with an exceeding

And might I be believed, both riſing and going to bed, ſitting downe and riſing from boorde, and going about any particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or buſineſſe, I would have all good Chriſtians, to ſay the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and if no other praier, at leaſt not to omit that. The Church may extend, amplifie, and diverſifie praiers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the need of our inſtruction: For, I know it is alwaies the ſame ſubſtance, and the ſame thing. But that one ſhould ever have this priviledge, that all manner of people, ſhould at all times, and vpon every occaſion have it in their mouth: For, it is moſt certaine, that onely it containeth whatſoever we want, and is moſt fit, and effectuall in all events. It is the onely praier I vſe in every place, at all times, and vpon every accident; and in ſtead of changing, I vſe often repetition of it: whence it commeth to paſſe, that I remember none ſo well as that one. I was even now conſidering, whence this generall errour commeth, that in all our deſſeignes and enterpriſes, of what nature ſoever, we immediatly have recourſe vnto God, and in every neceſſitie, we call vpon his holie name: And at what time ſoever we ſtand in need of any help, and that our weakneſſe wanteth aſſiſtance, we onely invoke him, without conſidering whether the occaſion be juſt or vnjuſt; and what eſtate or action we be in, or go about, be it never ſo vicious or vnlawfull, we call vpon his name and power. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he is our onely protector, and of power to affoord-vs all maner of help and comfort; but although he vouchſafe to honour vs with this joy-bringing fatherly adoption, yet is he as juſt as he is good; and as good and juſt, as he is mightie: But oftner vſeth his juſtice than his might, and favoureth vs according to the reaſon of the ſame, and not according to our requeſts. <hi>Plato</hi> in his lawes maketh three ſorts of injurious beliefe in the Gods: Firſt, that there is none at all; Secondly, that they meddle not with our affaires; Thirdly, that they never refuſe any thing vnto our vowes, offrings, and ſacrifices. The firſt errour, according to his opinion, did never continue immutable in man, even from his firſt infancie vnto his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age. The two ſucceeding may admit ſome conſtancie. His juſtice and power are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. It is but in vaine to implore his power in a bad cauſe. Man muſt have an vnpolluted

ſoule when he praieth (at leaſt in that moment he addreſſeth himſelfe to pray) and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free from all vicious paſſions; otherwiſe we our ſelves preſent him the rods to ſcourge vs withall. In liew of redreſſing our fault, we redouble the ſame, by preſenting him with an affection fraught with irreverence, ſinne, and hatred, to whom onely we ſhould ſue for grace and forgiveneſſe. Loe-heere, why I doe not willingly commend thoſe Phariſaicall humours, whom I ſo often behold, and more then ordinarie, to pray vnto God, except their actions immediately preceding or ſucceeding their praiers witneſſe ſome ſhew of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or hope of amendment.</p>

                        <p>And the ſtate of a man that commixeth devotion vnto an execrable life, ſeemeth in ſome ſort to be more condemnable, then that of one, that is conformable vnto himſelfe, and euery way diſſolute. Therefore doth our Church continually refuſe, the favour of hir enterance and ſocietie, vnto cuſtomes and manners, wilfully-obſtinate on ſome egregious villanie. We onely pray by cuſtome and vſe, and for faſhion-ſake, or to ſay better, we but reade and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our prayers: To conclude, it is nothing but a ſhew of formalitie, and a formall ſhew. And it greeveth me to ſee many men, who at grace before and after meat, will with great ſhew of devotion, croſſe themſelves three or foure times, (and it vexeth me ſo much the more, when I call to mind, that it is a ſigne I greatly reverence, and have in continuall vſe, yea, if I be but gaping) and there-whilſt, ſhall you ſee them beſtow all other houres of the day in all maner of hatred, malice, covetouſneſſe, and injuſtice. Many houres ſpend they about vice, but one to God, and that as it were by way of recompence and compoſition. It it wonderous to ſee, ſo far different and divers actions, continue with ſo even a tenor, that no interruption or alteration at all can be perceived, either about their confines, or paſſage from one vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. What prodigious conſcience can be at any harts-caſe, foſtring, and feeding with ſo mutuall, quiet, and agreeing ſociety in one ſelfe ſame manſion, both crime and judge? A man whoſe <hi>Paillardize</hi> and Iuxurie, doth vnceſſantly ſway and rule the head, and who judgeth the ſame ab hominable and moſt hatefull in the ſight of God; what ſaith he vnto his all-ſeeing Majeſtie, when he openeth his lips, either of mouth or hart, to ſpeake to him of-it? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth himſelfe, but falleth ſodainly againe. <hi>If the obiect of his divine iustice, and his preſence ſhould ſtrike,</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>and chastice his ſoule, how ſhort-ſoever the penitence were; feare it ſelfe would ſo often caſt his thought on-it, that he would preſently perceive himſelfe maſter of thoſe vices, which are habituated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in-bred, ſetled, and enfleſhed in him.</hi> But what of thoſe, which ground a whole life vpon the fruit and benefite of that ſinne, they know to be mortall? How many trades, profeſſions, occupations, and vacations, have we dailie and continually vſed, frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and allowed amongeſt vs, whoſe eſſence is vicious and moſt pernicious? And he that would needs confeſſe himſelfe vnto me, and of his owne accord told me, that for feare of looſing his credite, and to keep the honour of his offices; he had for a whole age, made ſhew and profeſſion, and acted the effects of a religion, which in his owne ſelfe-accuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he judged damnable, and cleane contrarie vnto that he had in his hart: How could he admit and foſter ſo contradictorie and impious a diſcourſe in his hart? With what language entertaine they divine juſtice concerning this ſubject? Their repentance, conſiſting in viſible amends, and manageable reparation; they looſe both towards God and vs, the meanes to alleage the ſame. Are they ſo malapart and fond-hardie as to crave pardon without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſans repentance? I think it goeth with the firſt, as with theſe laſt: But obſtinacie is not herein ſo eaſie to be vanquiſhed. This ſo ſuddaine contrarietie, and violent volubilitie of opinion, which they faine-vnto-vs, ſeemeth to me a miracle. They preſent-vs with the ſtate of an indigeſtible agonie. How ſantaſticall ſeemed their imagination vnto me, who theſe latter yeares had taken vp a faſhion, to checke and reproove all men, that profeſſed the Catholike Religion, in whom ſhined any extraordinarie brightneſſe of ſpirit, ſaying, that it was but fained: and to doe him honour, held, that whatſoever he ſaid in apparance, he could not inwardly chuſe but have his beliefe reformed according to their byaſe. It is a peeviſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, for a man to thinke himſelfe ſo firmely grounded, as to perſwade himſelfe, that the contrarie may not be believed: And more peeviſh alſo, to be perſwaded by ſuch a ſpirit, that

preferreth I wot not what diſparitie of fortune, before the hopes and threats of eternall life, They may beleeve me: If any thing could have attempted my youth, the ambition of the hazard, and difficultie, which followed this late-moderne enterprize, ſhould have had good part therein. It is not without great reaſon, in my poore judgement, that the Church forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the confuſed, raſh and indiſcreet vſe of the ſacred and divine ſongs, which the holie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath indited vnto <hi>David.</hi> God ought not to be commixed in our actions, but with awfull reverence, and an attention full of honour and reſpect. The word or voice is too divine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other vſe but to exerciſe our lungs, and to pleaſe our eares. It is from the conſcience and not from the tongue that it muſt proceed. It is not conſonant vnto reaſon, that a pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe or ſhop-keeping boy, amiddeſt his idle, vaine, and frivolous conceits, ſhould be ſuffered to entertaine himſelfe, and play therewith. Nor is it ſeemely, or toollerable, to ſee the ſacred booke of our beliefes-Myſteries, toſſed vp and downe and plaid withall, in a ſhop, or a hall, or a kitchin. They have heretofore been accompted myſteries, but through the abuſe of times, they are now held as ſports and recreations. So ſerious, and venerable a ſtudie ſhould not, by way of paſtime, and tumultuarie be handled. It ought to be a fixed, a purpoſed, and ſetled action, to which this preface of our office <hi>ſurſum corda</hi> ſhould ever be adioyned; and the verie exterior parts of the bodie, ſhould with ſuch a countenance, be referred vnto it, that to all mens eyes it may witneſſe a particular attention and duteous reſpect. It is not a a ſtudie fitting all men, but onely ſuch as have vowed themſelves vnto-it, and whom God hath, of his infinit mercie, called thereto. The wicked, the vngodly, and the ignorant are thereby empaired. It is no hiſtorie to be fabulouſly reported, but a hiſtorie to be dutifully reverenced, awfully feared, and religiouſly adored. Are they not pleaſantly conceited, who becauſe they have reduced the ſame into the vulgar tongues, and that all men may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand-it, perſwade themſelves, that the people ſhall the better conceive and digeſt the ſame? Conſiſteth-it but in the words, that they vnderſtand not all they find written? Shall I ſay more? By approaching thus little vnto it, they goe backe from it. Meere ignorance, and wholy relying on others, was verily more profitable and wiſer, then is this verball, and vaine knowledge, the nurſe of preſumption, and ſourſe of temeritie. Moreover, I am of opinion, that the vncontrouled libertie, that all men have to wreſt, diſſipate, and wyre-draw a word ſo religious, and important, to ſo many ſeverall idiomes, hath much more danger then profit following-it. The Iewes, the Mahometans, and well-nigh all other nations, are wedded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and reverence the language, wherein their myſteries and religion had originally been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and any change or tranſlation hath not without apparance of reaſon been directly forbidden. Know we whether there be Iudges enow in <hi>Baſque</hi> and in <hi>Brittanie</hi> to eſtabliſh this tranſlation made in their tongue? The vniverſall Church hath no more difficult and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne judgement to make. Both in ſpeaking and preaching the interpretation is wandring, free, and mutable, and of one parcell; ſo is it not alike. One of our Graecian Hiſtorians, doth juſtly accuſe his age, for aſ much as the ſecrets of Chriſtian religion were diſperſed in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like places, and even amongſt the baſeſt artificers; and that every man might, at his pleaſure, diſpute of it, and at randon ſpeake his mind of the ſame. And it ſhould be a great ſhame for vs, who by the vnſpeakable grace of God injoy the pure and ſacred myſteries of pietie, to ſuffer the ſame to be profaned in the mouthes of ignorant and popular people, ſeeing the verie Gentiles interdicted <hi>Socraetes</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and the wiſeſt, to meddle, enquire or ſpeake of things committed vnto the Prieſtes of <hi>Delphos.</hi> Saying moreover, <hi>That the factions of Princes, touching the ſubiect of Divinitie, are armed, not with Zeale, but with anger. That zeale dependeth of divine reaſon and iuſtice, holding an orderly and moderate courſe, but that it changeth into hatred and envie, and in ſteed of corne and grape, it produceth nettles and darnell, if it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by humane paſſion.</hi> And juſtly ſaith this other, who counſelling the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> affirmed <hi>that diſputations, did not ſo much appeaſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I have alſo in my time heard certaine writings complained-of, forſomuch as they are meerly humane and Philoſophicall, without medling with divinitie. He that ſhould ſay to the contrarie (which a man might doe with reaſon) that heavenly doctrine, as a Queene and governeſſe doth better keep hir ranke apart; that ſhe ought to be chiefe ruler and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall head every where, and not ſuffragant and ſubſidiarie. And that peradventure exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Grammer, Rethorike, and Logike, might more fitly and ſortably be taken from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, then from ſo ſacred and holie a ſubject, as alſo the arguments of theatres, plots of plaies, and grounds of publike ſpectacles. That myſteriouſly-divine reaſons are more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and reverently conſidered alone, and in their native ſtile, then joyned and compared to humane diſcourſe. That this fault is oftner ſeene, which is, that Divines write too hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely, then this other, that humaniſts write not Theologically enough. <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtome, is long ſince baeniſhed from ſacred ſchooles, as an vnprofitable ſervant, and deemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to behold, but in paſſing by the entrie, or the veſtrie of the ſacred treaſures of heavenly doctrine.</hi> That the formes of humane ſpeech, are more baſe, and ought by no meanes to make any vſe of the dignitie, majeſtie, and preheminence of divine ſpeech. As for my part, I give it leave to ſay, <hi>Verbis indiſciplinatis, with vndiſciplined words,</hi> Fortune, deſtinie, chance, accident, fate, good lucke, ill lucke, the Gods, and other phraſes, as beſt it pleaſeth. I propoſe humane fantaſies and mine owne, ſimply as humane conceits, and ſeverally conſidered; not as ſetled, concluded, and directed by celeſtiall ordinance, incapable of any doubt or alteration. A matter of opinion, and not of faith. What I diſcourſe according to my ſelfe, not what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve according vnto God, with a laicall faſhion, and not a clericall manner; yet ever moſt religious. As children propoſe their eſſayes, inſtructable, not inſtructing. And might not a man alſo ſay without apparance, that the inſtitution, which willeth, no man ſhall dare to write of Religion, but ſparingly, and reſervedly, except ſuch as make expreſſe profeſſion of it, would not want ſome ſhew of profit and juſtice; and happily to me to be ſilent. It hath bin told me, that even thoſe which are not of our conſent, do flatly inhibite amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the vſe of the ſacred name of God in all their vulgar and familiar diſcourſes. They would have no man vſe it as an interjection, or exclamation, nor to be alleaged as a witneſſe, or compariton; wherein I find they have reaſon. And howſoever it be, that we call God to our commerce and ſocietie, it ſhould be zealouſly, ſeriouſly, and religiouſly. There is (as far as I remember) ſuch a like diſcourſe in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> wherein he declareth, <hi>That we ſhould more rarely pray vnto God: for aſmuch as it is not eaſie, we ſhould ſo often ſettle our minds in ſo regular, ſo reformed, and ſo devout a ſeat, where indeed it ought to be, to pray aright and effectually: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> our praiers are, not onely vaine and vnprofitable, but vicious. <hi>Forgive vs (ſay we) our offences, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt vs.</hi> What elſe inferre we by that petition, but that we offer him our ſoule void of all revenge and free from all rancour?

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of Age.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Cannot receive that manner, whereby we eſtabliſh the continuance of our life. I ſee that ſome of the wiſer ſort doe greatly ſhorten the ſame, in reſpect of the common opinion. What ſaid <hi>Cato Iunior,</hi> to thoſe who ſought to hinder him from killing him-ſelfe? <hi>Doe I now live the age, wherein I may iuſtly be reproved to leave my life too ſoone?</hi> Yet was he but eight and fortie yeares old. He thought that age verie ripe, yea, and well advanced, conſidering how few men come vnto-it. And ſuch as entertaine themſelves with, I wot not what kind of courſe, which they call naturall, promiſeth ſome few yeares beyond, might do-it, had they a priviledge that could exempt them from ſo great a number of accidents, vnto which each one of vs ſtands ſubject by a naturall ſubjection, and which may interrupt the ſaid courſe, they propoſe vnto themſelves. What fondneſſe is-it, for a man to thinke he ſhall die, for, and through, a failing and defect of ſtrength, which extreame age draweth with-it, and to propoſe that terme vnto our life, ſeeing it is the rareſt kind of all deaths, and leaſt in vſe? We onely call it naturall, as if it were againſt nature to ſee a man breake his necke with a fall; to be drowned by ſhipwracke; to be ſurpriſed with a peſtilence, or pleuriſie, and as if our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12117:95"/>
condition did not preſent theſe inconveniences vnto vs all. Let vs not flatter our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves with theſe fond-goodly woords; a man may peradventure rather call that naturall, which is generall, common and vniverſall. To die of age, is a rare, ſingular, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie death, and ſo much leſſe naturall then others: It is the laſt and extreameſt kind of dying: The further it is from vs, ſo much the leſſe is it to be hoped for: Indeed it is the limit, beyond which we ſhall not paſſe, and which the law of nature hath preſcribed vnto vs, as that which ſhould not be outgon by any; but it is a rare priviledge peculiar vnto hir ſelfe, to make vs continue vnto-it. It is an exemption, which through ſome particular favour ſhe beſtoweth on ſome one man, in the ſpace of two or three ages, diſcharging him from the croſſes, troubles, and difficulties, ſhe hath enterpoſed betweene both, in this long cariere and pilgrimage. Therefore my opinion is, to conſider, that the age vnto which we are come, is an age whereto few arive: ſince men come not vnto it by any ordinarie courſe, it is a ſigne we are verie forward. And ſince we have paſt the accuſtomed bounds, which is the true meaſure of our life, we muſt not hope, that we ſhall goe much further. Having eſcaped ſo many occaſions of death, wherein we ſee the world to fall, we muſt acknowledge that ſuch an extraordinarie fortune, as that is, which maintaineth vs, and is beyond the common vſe, is not likely to continue long. It is a fault of the verie lawes, to have this falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They allow not a man to be capable and of diſcretion, to manage and diſpoſe of his owne goods, vntill he be five and twentie yeares old, yet ſhall he hardly preſerve the ſtate of his life ſo long. <hi>Augustus</hi> abridged five yeares of the ancient Romane Lawes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that for any man that ſhould take vpon him the charge of judgement, it ſufficed to be thirtie yeares old. <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> diſpenſed with the Knights, who were ſeaven and fortie yeares of age, from all voluntarie ſervices of warre. <hi>Augustus</hi> brought them to fortie and five. To ſend men to their place of ſojourning before they be five and fiftie or three ſcore yeares of age, me ſeemeth, carrieth no great apparance with-it. My advice would be, that our vacation, and employment ſhould be extended as far as might be for the publike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie; but I blame ſome, and condemne moſt, that we begin not ſoone enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ſelves. The ſame <hi>Augustus</hi> had been vniverſall and ſupreame judge of the world, when he was but nineteene yeares old, and would have another to be thirtie, before he ſhall bee made a competent judge of a cottage or farme. As for my part, I thinke our minds are as full growne and perfectly joynted at twentie yeares, as they ſhould be, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as much as they can. A mind which at that age hath not given ſome evident token or earneſt of hir ſufficiencie, ſhall hardly give-it afterward; put hir to what triall you liſt. Naturall qualities and vertues, if they have any vigorous or beauteous thing in them, will produce and ſhow the ſame within that time, or never. They ſay in Daulphiné,</p>

                        <p>Of all humane honorable and glorious actions, that ever came vnto my knowledge, of what nature ſoever they be, I am perſwaded, I ſhould have a harder taske, to number thoſe, which both in ancient times, and in ours, have been produced and atchieved before the age of thirtie yeares, then ſuch as were performed after: yea, often in the life of the ſame men. May not I boldly ſpeak it of thoſe of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> his great adverſarie? They lived the better part of their life with the glorie which they had gotten in their youth: And though afterward they were great men, in reſpect of all others, yet were they but meane in regard of themſelves. As for my particular, I am verily perſwaded, that ſince that age, both my ſpirit and my bodie, have more decreaſed then encreaſed, more recoyled then advanced. It may be, that knowledge and experience ſhall encreaſe in them, together with life, that beſtow their time well: but vivacitie, promptitude, conſtancie, and other parts much more our owne, more important and more eſſentiall, they droope, they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and they faint.</p>

                        <p>There is ſome apparance to judge a man by the moſt common conditions of his life; but ſeeing the naturall inſtability of our cuſtomes and opinions; I have often thought, that even good Authors doe ill, and take a wrong courſe, wilfully to opinionate themſelves about fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a conſtant and ſolide contexture of vs. They chuſe an vniverſall ayre, and following that image, range and interpret all a mans actions; which if they cannot wreſt ſufficiently, they remit them vnto diſſimulation. <hi>Augustus</hi> hath eſcaped their hands; for there is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, ſo ſudden and continuall a variety of actions found in him, through the courſe of his life, that even the boldeſt judges and ſtricteſt cenſurers, have beene faine to give him over, and leave him vndecided. <hi>There is nothing I ſo hardly beleeve to be in man, as constancy, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo eaſie to be found in him, as inconſtancy.</hi> He that ſhould diſtinctly and part by part, judge of him, ſhould often jumpe to ſpeake truth.

For, to comprehend all in one word, ſaith an ancient writer, and to embrace all the rules of our life into one, it is at all times to will, and not to will one ſame thing. I would not vouchſafe, (ſaith he) to adde anything; alwaies provided the will be juſt: for, if it be vnjuſt, it is impoſſible it ſhould ever continue one.

Had any man preſcribed certaine Lawes, or eſtabliſhed aſſured policies in his owne head; in his life ſhould we daily ſee, to ſhine an equality of cuſtomes, an aſſured order, and an infallible relation from one thing to another (<hi>Empedocles</hi> noted this deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be amongſt the Agrigentines, that they gave themſelves ſo over vnto delights, as if they ſhould die tomorrow next, and built as if they ſhould never die) the diſcourſe thereof were eaſie to be made. As is ſeene in yoong <hi>Cato:</hi> He that toucht but one ſtep of it, hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all. It is an harmony of well according tunes and which cannot contradict it ſelf. With vs it is cleane contrary, ſo many actions, ſo many particular judgements are there requir'd. The ſureſt way (in mine opinion) were to refer them vnto the next circumſtances, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into further ſearch, and without concluding any other conſequence of them. During the late tumultuous broiles of our mangled eſtate, it was told me, that a yoong woman, not farre from mee, had head-long caſt hir ſelfe out of a high window, with intent to kill hirſelfe, onely to avoide the raviſhment of a raſcaly-baſe ſouldier, that lay in hir houſe, who offred to force hir: and perceiving that with the fall ſhe had not killed hirſelfe, to make an end of hir enterprize, ſhe would have cutte hir owne throate with a knife, but that ſhe was hindered by ſome that came-into her: Nevertheleſſe having ſore wounded hirſelfe, ſhe voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the Souldier had yet but vrged hir with importunate requeſts, ſuing-ſolicitations, and golden bribes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe feared he would in the end have obtained his purpoſe by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:

And as the common ſaying is; Faire and ſoft, as ſquemiſh-honeſt as ſhe ſeemes, although you miſſe of your intent, conclude not raſhly an inviolable chaſtitie to be in your Miſtreſſe; For, a groome or a horſe-keeper may find an houre to thrive in; and a dog hath a day. <hi>Antigonus</hi> having taken vppon him to favour a Souldier of his, by reaſon of his vertue and valour, commaunded his Phiſicians to have great care of him, and ſee whether they could recover him of a lingring and inward diſeaſe, which had long tormented him, who being perfectly cured, he afterward perceived him to be nothing ſo earneſt and diligent in his affaires, demaunded of him, how he was ſo changed from himſelfe, and become ſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſh: your ſelfe good ſir (anſwered he) have made me ſo, by ridding me of thoſe in firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ſo did grive me, that I made no accompt of my life.

It is no hart nor courage ſo framed by diſcourſe or deliberation: Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances haue ſetled the ſame in him: Therefore is it no marvell if by other contrary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance he become a craven and change coppy. This ſupple variation, and eaſie yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradiction, which is ſeene in vs, hath made ſome to imagine, that wee had two ſoules and others, two faculties; whereof every one as beſt ſhe pleaſeth, accompanieth and doth agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate-vs; the one towards good, the other towards evil. For ſomuch as ſuch a rough diverſitie cannot wel ſort and agree in one ſimple ſubject. The blaſt of accidents, doth not only remove me according to his inclination; for beſides, I remove and trouble my ſelfe by the inſtability of my poſture, and whoſoever looketh narrowly about himſelfe, ſhall hardly ſee himſelfe twiſe in one ſame ſtate. Somtimes I give my ſoule one viſage, and ſometimes another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the poſture or ſide I lay hir in. If I ſpeake diverſly of my ſelfe, it is becauſe I looke diverſly vpon my ſelfe. All contrarieties are found in hir, according to ſome turne or remooving, and in ſome faſhion or other. Shamefaſt, baſhfull, inſolent, chaſte, luxurious, peeviſh, pratling, ſilent, fond, doting, labourious, nice, delicate, ingenious, ſlowe, dull, froward, humorous, debonaire, wiſe, ignorant, falſe in wordes, true ſpeaking, both liberall, co, vetous, and prodigall. All theſe I perceive in ſome meaſure or other to bee in mee, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as I ſtirre or turne my ſelfe; And whoſoever ſhall heedefully ſurvay and conſider him ſelfe, ſhall finde this volubilitie and diſcordance to be in himſelfe, yea and in his very judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have nothing to ſay entirely, ſimply, and with ſoliditie of my ſelfe, without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, diſorder, blending, mingling; and in one word, <hi>Diſtinguo</hi> is the moſt vniverſall part of my logike. Although I ever purpoſe to ſpeake good of good, and rather to enterprete thoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12117:99"/>
things, that will beare it, vnto a good ſenſe; yet is it that, the ſtrangenes of our condition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth that we are often vrged to doe wel by vice it ſelfe, if wel doing were not judged by the intention only. Therefore may not a couragious acte conclude a man to be valiant. He that is ſo, when juſt occaſion ſerveth, ſhall ever be ſo, and vpon all occaſions. If it were an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of vertue, and not a ſodaine humour, it would make a man equally reſolute at all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes, in all accidents: Such alone, as in company; ſuch in a ſingle combate, as in a ſet battell; For, whatſoever ſome ſay, valour is all alike, and not one in the ſtreet or towne, and another in the campe or field. As couragiouſly ſhould a man beare a ſickenes in his bed, as a hurt in the field and feare death no more at home in his houſe, then abroad in an aſſault. We ſhould not then ſee one ſame man enter the breach, or charge his enemie with an aſſured and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted fierceneſſe, and afterward having eſcaped that, to vexe, to grive and torment him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like vnto a ſeely woman, or faint-hearted milke-ſoppe for the loſſe of a ſute, or death of a childe. If one chance to be careleſly baſe-minded in his infancie, and conſtantly-reſolute in povertie; if he be timorouſly-fearefull at ſight of a Barbers razor, and afterward ſtowtly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vndiſmayed againſt his enemies ſwordes: The action is commendable, but not the man. Divers Graecians (ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi>) can not endure to looke their enemy in the face, yet are they moſt conſtant in their ſickeneſſes; whereas the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> and <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> are meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Nihil enim poteſt eſſe aequabile, quod non à certa ratione proficiſcatur: For nothing can beare</hi>

As incomparable as it is, it hath his blemiſhes, which is the reaſon that in the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſuſpitions, he apprehendeth at the conſpiracies of his followers againſt his life, we ſee him ſo earneſtly to vex, and ſo deſperately to trouble himſelfe: In ſearch and purſuite whereof he demeaneth himſelfe with ſo vehement and indiſcreet an injuſtice, and with ſuch a demiſſe feare, that even his naturall reaſon is thereby ſubverted. Alſo the ſuperſtition, wherewith he is ſo throughly tainted, beareth ſome ſhew of puſilanimitie. And the vnlimited exceſſe of the repentance he ſhewed for the murther of <hi>Clitus,</hi> is alſo a witneſſe of the inequalitie of his courage. Our matters are but parcels hudled-vp, and peeces patched together, and we endevour to acquire honour by falſe meanes, and vntrue tokens. <hi>Vertue will not bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but by her-ſelfe:</hi> And if at any time wee borrow her maske, vpon ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe will as ſoone pull-it from our face. It is a lively hew, and ſtrong die, if the ſoule be once dyed with the ſame perfectly, and which will never fade or be gone, except it carry the skinne away with-it. Therefore to judge a man, we muſt a long time follow, and very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly marke his ſteppes; whether conſtancie doe wholy ſubſiſt and continue vpon hir owne foundation in him, <hi>Cui vivendi via conſider at a atque proviſa est, who hath forecast and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the way of life;</hi> whether the variety of occurrences make him change his pace (I meane his<note place="margin">Cic. parad. 5.</note> way, for his pace may either be haſtened or ſlowed) let him runne on: ſuch a one (as ſayeth the impreaſe of our good Talbot) goeth before the winde. It is no marvell (ſaith an olde writer) that hazard hath ſuch power over-vs, ſince wee live by hazard. It is impoſſible for him to diſpoſe of his particular actions, that hath not in groſe directed his life vnto one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine end. It is impoſſible for him to range all pieces in order, that hath not a plot or forme of the totall frame in his head. What avayleth the proviſion of all ſorts of colours vnto one that knowes not what he is to draw? No man makes any certaine deſigne of his life, and we deliberate of it but by parcels. A skilfull archer ought firſt to know the marke he aimeth at, and then apply his hand, his bow, his ſtring, his arrow and his motion accordingly. Our counſels goe a ſtray, becauſe they are not rightly addreſſed, and have no fixed end. <hi>No winde makes for him, that hath no intended port to ſaile-vnto.</hi> As for me, I allow not greatly of that iudgement, which ſome made of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and to have concluded him ſufficient in the managing of domeſticall matters, againſt the accuſation of his owne Sonne, only by the ſight of one of his tragedies. Nor do I commend the conjecture of the <hi>Parians,</hi> ſent to reforme the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> as ſufficient to the conſequence they drew thence. In viſiting and ſurveying the Ile, they marked the Landes that were beſt husbanded, and obſerved the country houſes that were beſt governed. And having regiſtred the names of their owners; and afterward made an aſſemblie of the Towneſ-men of the Citie, they named and inſtituted thoſe owners as new governours and magiſtrates, judging and concluding, that beeing good husbands and carefull of their houſhold affaires, they muſt conſequently be ſo of publike matters. We are

                        <p>There is as much diverſity in that as in any other thing. The confuſion of order and meaſure of crimes, is dangerous: Murtherers, Traitors and Tyrants, have too much gaine by it: it is no reaſon their conſcience ſhould be eaſed, in that ſome is either idle or laſcivious, or leſſe aſſiduous vnto devotion. Every man poiſeth vpon his fellowes ſinne, and elevates his owne. Even teachers doe often range it ill in my conceit. As <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, that the chiefeſt office of wiſedome, was to diſtinguiſh goods and evils. We others, to whom the beſt is ever in vice, ſhould ſay the like of knowledge, to diſtinguiſh vices. Without which, and that very exact, both vertuous and wicked men remaine confounded and vnknowen. Now drunkenneſſe amongſt others, appeareth to mee a groſe and brutiſh vice. The minde hath more part elſe where; and ſome vices there are, which (if it may lawfully be ſpoken) have a kinde of I wot not what generoſity in them. Some there are, that have learning, diligence, valour, prudence, wit, cunning, dexterity, and ſubtlety joyned with them; whereas this is meerely corporall, and terreſtriall. And the groſeſt and rudeſt nation,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12117:100"/>
that liveth amonſt vs at this day, is onely that which keepeth it in credite. Other vices but alter and diſtract the vnderſtanding, whereas this vtterly ſubverteth the ſame, and aſtonieth the body.</p>

And amongſt the beſt policed and formaleſt nations, the cuſtome of drinking, and pleadging of healths was much in vſe. I have heard <hi>Silvius,</hi> that excellent Phiſitian of <hi>Paris</hi> affirme that to preſerve the vigor of our ſtomake from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, it is not amiſſe once a moneth to rowze vp the ſame by this exceſſe of drinking; and leſt it ſhould grow dull and ſtupide thereby to ſtirre it vp. And it is written, that the <hi>Perſians,</hi> after they had well tippled, were wont to conſult of their chiefeſt affaires. My taſte, my relliſh and my complexion, are ſharper enemies vnto this vice, then my diſcourſe: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that I captivate more eaſily my conceits vnder the auctoritie of ancient opinions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I finde-it to be a fond, a ſtupide and a baſe kinde of vice, but leſſe malicious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then others; all which ſhocke, and with a ſharper edge wound publike ſocietie. And if we cannot give our ſelves any pleaſure, except (as they ſay) it coſt-vs ſomething; I finde this vice to be leſſe chargeable vnto our conſcience then others; beſides, it is not hard to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, difficult to be found; a conſideration not to be deſpiſed. A man well advanced in yeares and dignitie, amongſt three principall commodities he told me to have remaining in life, counted this: and where ſhall a man more rightly finde-it, then amongſt the naturall? But he tooke-it ill, delicateneſſe, and the choiſe of wines is therein to be avoided. If you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your voluptuouſnes to drinke it with pleaſure and daintily neate, you tie your ſelfe vnto an inconvenience to drinke-it other then is allwayes to be had. A man muſt have a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a looſe and a freer taſte. To be a true drinker, a man ſhould not have ſo tender and ſqueamiſh a palat. The Germans doe in a maner drinke aqually of all ſorts of wine with like pleaſure. Their end is rather to gulpe it downe freely, then to taſte it kindely. And to ſay truth they have it better cheape. Their voluptuouſneſſe is more plenteous and fuller. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, to drinke after the French maner, as two draughts and moderatly, is over-much to reſtraine the favours of that God. There is more time and conſtancie required therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Our forefathers were wont to ſpend whole nights in that exerciſe, yea often times they joyned whole long dayes vnto them. And a man muſt proportion his ordinarie more large and firme. I have in my dayes ſeene a principall Lord; a man of great employment and enterpriſes, and famous for good ſucceſſe, who without ſtraining himſelfe, and eating but an ordinary meales-meat, was wont to drinke litle leſſe then five pottles of wine, yet at his riſing ſeemed to be nothing diſtempered, but rather as we have found to our no ſmall coſt in managing of our affaires, over-wiſe and conſiderate. The pleaſure of that, whereof we would make account in the courſe of our life ought to be employed longer ſpace. It were neceſſary, as ſhop-boyes or labouring people, that we ſhould refuſe no occaſion to drinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to have this deſire in our minde. It ſeemeth that wee dayly ſhorten the vſe of this: and that in our houſes, (as I have ſeene in mine infancie) breakefaſts, nunchions, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhould be more frequent and often vſed, then now adayes they are. And ſhould wee thereby in any ſorte proceede towards amendment? Noverily. But it may be, that we have
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12117:101"/>
much more given our ſelves over vnto paillardiſe and all maner of luxurie then our fathers were. They are two occupations, that enter-hinder one another, in their vigor. On the one ſide, it hath empaired and weakned our ſtomake, and on the other, ſobrietie ſerveth to make vs more jolly-quaint, luſty, and wanton for the exerciſe of love matters. It is a wonder to thinke on the ſtrange tales I have heard my father report, of the chaſtitie of his times. He might well ſpeake of it, as he that was both by art and nature proper for the vſe and ſolace of Ladies. He ſpake little and well, few words, but to the purpoſe, and was ever wont to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe ſome ornament taken from vulgar bookes, and above all, Spaniſh, amongſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeeches: And of all Spaniſh authors, none was more familiar vnto him then <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Aurelius.</hi> His demeanour and carriage was ever milde, meeke, gentle, and very modeſt, and above all, grave and ſtately. There is nothing he ſeemed to be more carefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of, then of his honeſty, and obſerve a kinde of decencie of his perſon, and orderly decorum in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, were it on foote or on hoſebacke. He was exceeding nice in performing his word or promiſe; And ſo ſtrictly conſcientious and obſequous in religion, that generally he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather to encline toward ſuperſtition, then the contrary. Though he were but a little man, his courage and vigor was great: he was of an vpright, and well proportioned ſtature, of a pleaſing, cheerefull-looking countenance, of a ſwarthy hue, nimbly addicted, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely nimble vnto all noble and gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like exerciſes. I have ſeene ſome hollow ſtaves of his filled with lead, which hee wont to vſe and exerciſe his armes withall, the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him-ſelfe to pitch to barre, to throw the ſledge, the caſt the pole and to play at fence: and ſhooes with leaden ſoles, which he wore to enure himſelfe, to leape, to vault and to run. I may without bluſhing ſay, that in memory of himſelfe, he hath left certain pety miracles amongſt vs. I have ſeene him when hee was paſt three-ſcore yeeres of age mocke at all our ſports, and out-countenance our youthfull paſtimes, with a heavy furr'd Gowne about him to leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſaddle; to make the pommada round about a Table vpon his thumb; and ſeldom to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend any ſtaires without skipping three or foure ſteppes at once. And concerning my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, hee was wont to ſay, that in a whole Province there was ſcarſe any woman of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that had an ill name. Hee would often report ſtrange familiarities, namely of his owne, with very honeſt women, without any ſuſpicion at all. And proteſted verie religiouſlie, that when he was married, he was yet a pure Virgine; yet had he long time followed the warres beyond the Mountaines, and therein ſerved long, whereof hee hath left a Iournall-Booke of his owne collecting, wherein hee hath particularly noted, whatſoever happened day by day worthy the obſervation, ſo long as he ſerved, both for the publike and his particular vſe. And he was well ſtrucken in yeeres, when he tooke a wife. For returning out of <hi>Italie,</hi> in the yeere of our Lord, one thouſand five hundred eight and twenty, and being ful three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres olde, by the way hee choſe himſelfe a wife. But come we to our drinking againe. The incommodities of age, which neede ſome helpe and refreſhing, might with ſome reaſon beget in me a deſire or longing of this faculty: for, it is in a man the laſt pleaſure, which the courſe of our yeers ſtealeth vpon vs. Good fellowes ſay, that naturall heate is firſt taken in our feete: That properly belongeth to infancie. From thence it aſcendeth vnto the middle region, where it is ſetled and continueth a long time: and in mine opinion, there produceth the onely true, and mooving pleaſures of this corporall life. Other delight and ſenſualities in reſpect of that, doe but ſleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the end, like vnto a vapour, which by little and little exhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and mounteth aloft, it comes vnto the throate, and there makes hir laſt bode. Yet could I never conceive, how any man may either encreaſe or prolong the pleaſure of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond thirſt, and in his imagination frame an artificiall appetite, and againſt nature. My ſtomacke could not well reach ſo farre: it is very much troubled to come to an end of that which it takes for his neede. My conſtitution is, to make an accompt of drinking, but to ſucceed meate, and therefore doe I ever make my laſt draught the greateſt. And foraſmuch as in age, we have the roofe of our mouthes commonly furred with rhume, or diſtempered, diſtaſted and altered through ſome other evill conſtitution, wine ſeemeth better vnto vs and of a quicker reliſh, according as our pores be either more or leſſe open and waſhed. At leaſt I ſeldome reliſh the ſame very well, except it be the firſt draught I take. <hi>Anacharſis</hi> wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſee the Graecians drinke in greater glaſſes at the end of their meales, then in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It was (as I imagine) for the very ſame reaſon, that the Germans doe-it, who never begin to carouſe, but when they have well fed. <hi>Plato</hi> forbiddeth children to drinke any
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12117:101"/>
wine, before they be eighteene yeeres of age, and to be druncke before they come to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But to ſuch as have once attained the age of fortie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is content to pardon them, if they chaunce to delight themſelves with it, and alloweth them ſomwhat largely to blend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of <hi>Dioniſius</hi> in their banquets, that good God, who beſtoweth cheerefulneſſe vpon men, and youth vnto aged men, who layeth and aſwageth the paſſions of the minde, even as yron is made flexible by the fire: and in his profitable lawes drinking-meetings or quaffing companies as neceſſary and commendable (alwaies provided there be a chiefe leader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them to containe and order them) drunkeneſſe being a good and certaine tryall of everie mans nature; and therewithall proper to give aged men the courage to make merry in dancing and in muſicke; things alowable and profitable, and ſuch as they dare not vndertake being ſober and ſetled. That wine is capable to ſupply the mind with temperance, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with health. Notwithſtanding, theſe reſtrictions, partely barrowed of the Carthaginians, pleaſe him well. Let thoſe forebeare it that are going about any expedition of warre. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very magiſtrate, and all judges abſtain from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it at what time they are to execute their charge, and to conſult of publike affaires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let none beſtow the day in drinking, as the time that is due vnto more ſerious negotiations, nor the nights wherein a man intendeth to get children. It is reported, that <hi>Stilpo</hi> the Philoſopher, finding himſelfe ſurcharged with age, did purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſten his end, by drinking of pure wine. The like cauſe (though not wittingly) did alſo ſuffocat the vital forces, crazed through old age of the Philoſopher <hi>Arceſilaus.</hi> But it is an old and pleaſant queſtion, whether a wiſemans mind were like to yeelde vnto the force of wine.</p>

But to joyne conſtancie vnto it, in her laſt perfection: I meane if nothing ſhould ſhocke her: which a thouſand accidents may do. <hi>Lucretius</hi> that famous Poet, may philoſophie and bandie at his pleaſure: Loe where he lieth ſenſleſſe of an amorous potion.

Some of them have by the force of a ſickneſſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their owne names, and a ſlight hurt hath overthrowne the judgement of others.

                           <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, there are but three ſorts of ſickneſſes, which to avoide, a man may have ſome colour of reaſon to kill himſelfe. The ſharpeſt of all is the ſtone in the bladder, when the vrine is there ſtopped. <hi>Seneca,</hi> thoſe onely, which for long time diſturbe and diſtract the offices of the minde. To avoide a worſe death, ſome are of opinion, a man ſhould take it at his owne pleaſure. <hi>Democritus</hi> chiefe of the Aetolians, being led captive to <hi>Rome,</hi> found meanes to eſcape by night: but being purſued by his keepers, rather then he would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againe, ran himſelfe through with his Sword. <hi>Antinoüs</hi> and <hi>Theodotus,</hi> their Citie of <hi>Epirus</hi> being by the Romans reduced vnto great extreamitie, concluded, and perſwaded all the people to kill themſelves. But the counſell, rather to yeeld, having prevailed: they went to ſeeke their owne death, and ruſhed amidſt the thickeſt of their enemies, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather to ſtrike, than to warde themſelves. The Iland of <hi>Goſa,</hi> being ſome yeares ſince ſurpriſed and over run by the Turkes, a certaine Sicilian therein dwelling, having two faire daughters readie to be married, killed them both with his owne hands, together with their mother, that came in to help them. That done, running out into the ſtreets, with a croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow in one hand, and a caliver in the other, at two ſhoots, ſlew the two firſt Turks that came next to his gates, then reſolutely drawing his Sword, ran furiouſly among them; by whom he was ſuddainly hewen in peeces: Thus did he ſave himſelfe from ſlaviſh bondage, having firſt delivered his owne from-it. The Iewiſh women, after they had cauſed their children to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12117:104"/>
be circumcized, to avoide the crueltie of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> did headlong precipitate themſelves and them vnto death. I have heard-it crediblie reported, that a gentleman of good qualitie, being priſoner in one of our Gaoles, and his parents advertized that he ſhould aſſuredly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, to avoide the infamie of ſo reproachfull a death, appointed a Prieſt to tell him, that the beſt remedie for his deliverie, was to recommend himſelfe to ſuch a Saint, with ſuch and ſuch a vow, and to continue eight daies without taking any ſuſtenance, what faintneſſe or weakneſſe ſoever he ſhould feel in himſelfe. He believed them, and ſo without thinking on it, was delivered both of life and danger. <hi>Scribonia</hi> perſwading <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which notwithſtanding, perceiving life to remaine in him, he tooke heart againe; and getting vp on his feet, all goared with bloud, and loaden with ſtrokes, making way through the preaſe, came to a craggie and downe-ſteepie rocke, where vnable to goe any further, by one of his wounds, with both his hands he pulled out his guts, and tearing and breaking them, caſt them amongſt ſuch as purſued him, calling and atteſting the vengeance of God to light vpon them. Of all violences committed againſt conſcience, the moſt in mine opinion to be avoyded, is that which is offred againſt the chaſtitie of women, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is naturally ſome corporall pleaſure commixt with it: And therefore the diſſent cannot fully enough be joyned thereunto: And it ſeemeth, that force is in ſome ſort, intermixed with ſome will.

The verie ſame law was likewiſe vſed in other places. <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> going into <hi>Aſia,</hi> paſſed through the Iland of <hi>Cea,</hi> belonging to <hi>Negropont;</hi> it fortuned whilſt he abode there, (as one reporteth that was in his companie) that a woman of great authoritie, having firſt yeelded an accompt vnto her Citizens, and ſhewed good reaſons why ſhe was reſolved to end her life, earneſtly entreated <hi>Pompey</hi> to be an aſſiſtant at her death, that ſo it might be eſteemed more honourable, which he aſſented vnto; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long time in vaine ſought, by vertue of his eloquence (wherein he was exceeding ready) and force of perſwaſion, to alter her intent, and remove her from her purpoſe, in the end yeelded to her requeſt. She had lived foure ſcore and ten yeares in a moſt happie eſtate of minde and bodie, but then lying on her bed, better adorned then before ſhe was accuſtomed to have-it, and leaning on her elbow, thus ſhe beſpake: The Gods, Oh <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> and rather thoſe I forgo, then thoſe I go vnto, reward and appay thee, for that thou haſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to be both a counſeller of my life, and a witneſſe of my death. As for my part, having hitherto ever taſted the favourable viſage of fortune, for feare the deſire of living overlong ſhould make me taſte of her frownes, with an happie an ſucceſſefull end, I will now depart, and licence the remainder of my ſoule, leaving behind me two daughters of mine, with a legion of grand-children and nephewes. That done, having preached vnto, and exhorted all her people and kinsfolks to an vnitie and peace, and divided her goods amongſt them, and recommended her houſhold Gods vnto her eldeſt daughter, with an aſſuredly-ſtaide hand ſhe tooke the cup, wherein the poyſon was, and having made her vowes vnto <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,</hi> and praiers, to conduct her vnto ſome happie place in the other world, roundly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that mortall potion; which done, ſhe intertained the companie with the progreſſe of her behaviour, and as the parts of her bodie were one after another poſſeſſed with the cold operation of that venome; vntill ſuch time as ſhee ſaid, ſhee felt-it worke at the heart and in her entrals, ſhee called her daughter to doe her the laſt office, and cloſe her eyes. <hi>Plinie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth of a certaine <hi>Hiperborean</hi> nation, wherein, by reaſon of the milde temperature of the aire, the inhabitants thereof, commonly never die, but when they pleaſe to make themſelves away, and that being wearie and tired with living, they are accuſtomed at the end of a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long age; having firſt made merrie and good cheare with their friends, from the top of an heigh-ſteedie rocke, appointed for that purpoſe, to caſt themſelves headlong into the Sea. Grieving-ſmart, and a worſe death ſeeme to me the moſt excuſable incitations.</p>

Verily, being on the inſtance of curioſitie, and on the greedie and inſatiate paſſion of newes, which with ſuch indiſcreet impatience, and impatient indiſcretion, induceth vs to neglect all things, for to entertaine a new-come gueſt, and forget all reſpect and countenance, whereſoever we be, ſuddainly to break-vp ſuch letters as are brought-vs; he had reaſon to commend the gravitie of <hi>Rusticus:</hi> to which he might alſo have added the commendation of his civilitie and curteſie, for that he would not interrupt the courſe of his declamation; But I make a queſtion, whether he might be commended for his wiſedome: for, receiving vnexpected letters, and eſpecially from an Emperour, it might verie well have fortuned, that his deferring to read them, might have cauſed ſome notable inconvenience. <hi>Rechleſneſſe is the vice contrarie vnto curioſitie;</hi> towards which I am naturally enclined, and wherein I have ſeen many men ſo extreamly plunged, that three or foure daies after the receiving of letters, which hath been ſent them, they have been found in their poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets yet vnopened.

                        <p>MY brother the Lord of <hi>Bronze</hi> and my ſelfe, during the time of our civill wars, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one day together, we fortuned to meet vpon the way with a Gentleman, in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſemblance, of good demeanour: He was of our contrarie faction, but foraſmuch as he counterfaited himſelfe otherwiſe; I knew it not. And the worſt of theſe tumultuous inteſtine broyles, is, that the cards are ſo ſhuffled (your enemie being neither by language nor by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, nor by any other apparant marke diſtinguiſhed from you; nay, which is more, brought vp vnder the ſame lawes and cuſtomes, and breathing the ſame ayre) that it is a verie hard matter to avoide confuſion and ſhun diſorder. Which conſideration, made me not a little fearfull to meet with our troopes, eſpecially where I was not knowne, leſt I ſhould be vrged to tell my name, and happly doe worſe.

But this man ſeemed ſo fearfully-diſmaid, and at every encounter of horſemen, and paſſage, by, or through any Towne that held for the King, I obſerved him to be ſo ſtrangely diſtracted, that in the end I perceived, and gheſſed they were but guiltie alarums that his conſcience gave him.

                        <p>Me ſeemeth nevertheleſſe, that in ſome ſort there is a meane to familiarize our ſelves with it, and to aſſay-it. We may have ſome experience of it, if not whole and perfect, at leaſt ſuch as may not altogether be vnprofitable, and which may yeelde vs better fortified and more aſſured. If we cannot attaine vnto it, we may at leaſt approch-it, and diſcerne the ſame: And if we cannot enter hir ſort, yet ſhall we ſee and frequent the approches vnto-it. It is not with out reaſon we are taught to take notice of our ſleepe, for the reſemblance it hath with death. How eaſily we paſſe from waking to ſleeping; with how little intereſt we looſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of light, and of ourſelves. The facultie of ſleepe might happily ſeeme vnprofitable, and againſt nature, ſithence it depriveth vs of all actions, and barreth vs of all ſenſe, were it not that nature doth thereby inſtruct vs, that ſhe hath equally made vs, as wel to live, as to die; and by life preſenteth the eternall ſtate vnto vs, which ſhe after the ſame reſerveth for vs, ſo to accuſtome vs thereunto, and remove the feare of it from vs. But ſuch as by ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent accident are falne into a faintnes of heart, and have loſt all ſenſes, they, in mine opinion, have well-nigh beene, where they might beholde hir true and naturall viſage: For, touching the inſtant or moment of the paſſage, it is not to be feared, it ſhould bring any travell or diſpleaſure with-it, foraſmuch as we can have, nor ſenſe, nor feeling without leaſure. Our ſufferances have neede of time, which is ſo ſhort, and plunged in death, that neceſſarily it muſt be inſenſible. It is the approches that lead vnto it we ſhould feare; and thoſe may fall within the compaſſe of mans experience. Many things ſeeme greater by imagination, then by effect. I have paſſed over a good part of my age in ſound and perfect health. I ſay, not onely ſound, but blithe and wantonly-luſtfull. That ſtate full of luſt, of prime and mirth, made me deeme the conſideration of ſickneſſes ſo yrkeſome and horrible, that when I came to the experience of them, I have found their fittes but weake, and their aſſaultes but faint, in reſpect of my apprehended feare. Lo here what I daily proove. Let me be vnder a roofe, in a good chamber, warme-clad, and well at eaſe in ſome tempeſtuous and ſtormy

Onely to be continually pent vp in a chamber, ſeemed in tollerable to me. I have now en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ured my ſelfe to live a whole weeke, yea a moneth in my chamber full of care, trouble, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and weakenes; and have found, that in the time of my beſt health I moaned ſuch as were ſicke, much more, then I can well moane my ſelfe when I am ill at eaſe: and that the power of my apprehenſion did well-nigh halfe endeare the eſſence and truth of the thing it ſelfe.

At my returning home againe, a ſudden occaſion being offered me, to make vſe of this nagge in a peece of ſervice, whereto he was neither trained not accuſtomed, one of my men (a-ſtrong ſturdie fellow) mounted vpon a yong ſtrong-headed horſe, and that had a deſperate hard mouth, freſh, luſtie and in breath; to ſhew his courage, and to out-goe his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woes, fortuned with might and maine to ſet ſpurres vnto him, and giving him the bridle, to come right into the path where I was, and as a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> with his weight riding over me and my nagge, that were both very little, he overthrew vs both, and made vs fall with our heeles vpward: ſo that the nagge lay along aſtonied in one place, and I in a trance groveling on the ground ten or twelfe paces wide of him; my face all torne and bruſed, my ſword which I had in my hand a good way from me, my girdle broken, with no more motion or ſenſe in me then a ſtocke.

                        <p>My ſtomacke was ſurcharged with clotted blood, my hands of themſelves were ſtill run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to it, as often they are wont (yea againſt the knowledg of our will) where we feele it to itch. There are many creatures, yea and ſome men, in whom after they are dead, we may ſee their muskles to cloſe and ſtirre. All men know by experience, there be ſome partes of our bodies, which often without any conſent of ours, doe ſtirre, ſtand and lie downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Now theſe paſſions, which but exteriourly touch vs, can not properly be termed ours; For, to make them ours, a man muſt wholy be engaged vnto them: And the paines that our feete or handes feele whileſt we ſleepe, are not ours. When I came neere my houſe, where the tidings of my fall was alreadie come, and thoſe of my houſholde met me, with ſuch outcries as are vſed in like times, I did not onely anſwere ſome words, to what I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but ſome tell me, I had the memory to commaund my men to give my wife a horſe, whom I perceived to be over-tired, and labouring in the way, which is very hilly, fowle, and rugged. It ſeemeth this conſideration proceeded from a vigilant ſoule: yet was I cleane diſtracted from-it, they were but vaine conceits, and as in a cloud, onely moved by the ſenſe of the eyes and eares: They came not from my ſelfe. All which notwithſtanding, I knew neither whence I came, nor whither I went, nor could I vnderſtand or conſider what was ſpoken vnto me. They were but light effects, that my ſenſes produced of themſelves, as it were of cuſtome. Whatſoever the ſoule did aſſiſt-it with, was but a dreame, being lightly touched, and only ſprinkled by the ſoft impreſſion of the ſenſes. In the meane time my ſtate was verily moſt pleaſant and eaſefull. I felt no maner of care or affliction, nither for my ſelfe nor others. It was a ſlumbering, languſhing and extreame weakneſſe, without anie paine at all. I ſaw mine owne houſe and knew it not; when I was laide in my bedde, I felt great eaſe in my reſt, For I had beene vilely hurred and haled by thoſe poore men, which had taken the paines to carry me vpon their armes a long and wearyſome way, and to ſay truth, they had all beene wearied twice or thrice over, and were faine to ſhift ſeverall times. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remedies were preſently offerd me, but I tooke none, ſuppoſing verily I had beene dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt in the head. To ſay truth, it had beene a very happy death: For, the weakeneſſe of my diſcourſe hinderd me from judging of it, and the feeblenes of my body from feeling the ſame. Me-thought I was yeelding vp the ghoſt ſo gently, and after ſo eaſie and indolent a maner, that I feele no other action leſſe burthenſome then that was.

Concerning the maner of my falling they in favor of him who had bin the cauſe of it, concealed the truth
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12117:110"/>
from me, and told me other flim flam tales. But a while after, and the morrow next when my memorie beganne to come to it ſelfe againe, and repreſent the ſtate vnto me, wherein I was at the inſtant, when I perceived the horſe riding over me (for being at my heeles, I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to eſpie him, and helde my ſelfe for dead; yet was the conceite ſo ſodaine, that feare had no leaſure to enter my thoughts) me ſeemed it was a flaſhing or lightning, that ſmote my ſoule with ſhaking, and that I came from another world. This diſcourſe of ſo ſlight an accident, is but vaine and frivolous, were not the inſtructions I have drawne from thence, for my vſe: For truly, for a man to acquaint himſelfe with death, I finde no better way, then to approch vnto it. Now as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, every man is a good diſcipline vnto himſelfe alwayes provided he be able to prie into himſelfe. This is not my doctrine, it is but my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; And not another mans leſſon, but mine owne. Yet ought no man to blame me if I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the ſame. What ſerves my turne, may happily ſerve another mans; otherwiſe I marre nothing, what I make vſe of, is mine owne. And if I play the foole, it is at mine owne coſt, and without any other bodies intereſt. For it is but a kind of folly, that dies in me, and hath no traine. We have notice but of two or three former ancients, that have trodden this path; yet can we not ſay, whether altogether like vnto this of mine, for we know but their names. No man ſince hath followed their ſteppes: it is a thorny and crabbed enterpriſe, and more then it makes ſhew of, to follow ſo ſtrange and vagabond a path, as that of our ſpirit: to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the ſhady, and enter the thicke-covered depths of theſe internall winding crankes; To chuſe ſo many, and ſettle ſo ſeverall aires of his agitations: And tis a new extraordinary ammuſing, that diſtracts vs from the common occupation of the world, yea and from the moſt recommended: Many yeares are paſt ſince I have no other aime, whereto my thoughts bend, but my ſelfe, and that I controule and ſtudy nothing but my ſelfe. And if I ſtudy any thing elſe, it is imediatly to place it vpon, or to ſay better, in my ſelfe.

If I did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſeeme good and wiſe vnto my ſelfe, I would boldly declare it. To ſpeake leſſe of himſelfe then he poſſeſſeth, is folly and not modeſty.

And yet for a man to ſay more of himſelfe, then he can well prove, is not ever preſumption, though often ſottiſhneſſe. For a man to over-weene, and pleaſe himſelfe exceedingly with what he is, and fall into indifereet love with himſelfe, is in my conceit, the ſubſtance of this vice. The beſt remedy to cure him, is to doe cleane contrary to that which thoſe appoint, who inforbidding men to ſpeake of themſelves, doe conſequently alſo inhibite more to thinke of themſelves. <hi>Pride conſisteth in conceit:</hi> The tongue can have no great ſhare in it. For one to ammuſe on himſelfe, is in their imagination to pleaſe himſelfe: And for a man to frequent and practiſe himſelfe, is at an over-deare rate to pleaſe himſelfe. But this exceſſe doth onely breed in them, that but ſuperficially feele and ſearch themſelves, that are ſeene to follow their affaires, which call idleneſſe and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for a man to entertaine, to applaud and to endeare himſelfe, and frame Chimeraes, or build Caſtles in the ayre; deeming themſelves as a third perſon and ſtrangers to themſelves. If any be beſotted with his owne knowledge, looking vpon himſelfe, let him caſt his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards former ages, his pride ſhall be abated, his ambition ſhall be quailed; for there ſhall he finde many thouſands of ſpirits, that will cleane ſuppreſſe and treade him vnder. If he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to enter into any ſelfe-preſumption of his owne worth, let him but call to remembrance the lives of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas;</hi> ſo many armies, and ſo many Nations, which leave him ſo far behind them. No particular quality ſhall make him proud, that therewith ſhall reckon ſo many imperfect and weake qualities that are in him and at laſt, the nullity of humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Forſomuch as <hi>Socrates</hi> had truely onely nibled on the precept of his God, to know himſelfe, and by that ſtudy had learned to contemne himſelfe, he alone was eſteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the name of Wiſe. Whoſoever ſhall ſo know himſelfe, let him boldly make himſelfe knowen by his owne mouth:</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12117:111"/>
opinions of Nations, which continueth to this day. We have for our part, together with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our neighbour-Nation, the orders of Knight-hood, which only were eſtabliſhed to this purpoſe. Verily it is a moſt laudable vſe, and profitable cuſtome, to find meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the worth, and acknowledge the valour of rare and excellent men, to ſatisfie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them with ſuch payments, as in no ſort charge the common wealth, and put the Prince to no coſt at all. And that which was ever knowne by ancient experience, and at other times we have plainely perceived amongſt ourſelves, that men of qualitie, were ever more jealous of ſuch recompences, then of others, wherein was both gaine and profit: which was not without reaſon and great apparance. If to the prize, which ought ſimply to be of honour, there be other commodities and riches joyned, this kinde of commixing, in ſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the eſtimation thereof, doeth empaire, diſſipate, and abridge-it. The order of the Knights of Saint <hi>Michaell</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which of ſo long continuance hath bin in credite amongſt vs, had no greater commoditie then that it had no manner of communication with any other advantage or profite, which hath hecretofore beene the cauſe, that there was no charge or ſtate of what quality ſoever, whereto the nobilitie pretended with ſo much deſire, or aſpired with more affection, as it did to obtaine that order; nor calling, that was followed with more reſpect or greatnes.

And it will come to paſſe that the laſt ſhall even from her birth incur the incommodities, which haue lately ruined and ouerthrowne the other. The rules of this new orders-diſpenſation had need to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wreſted and conſtrained, for to giue it authority: and this tumultuous ſeaſon is not capable of a ſhort and ordered bridle. Beſides, before a man is able to giue credit vnto it, it is requiſite a man looſe the memory of the firſt, and of the contempt whereinto it is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. This place might admitte ſome diſcourſe vpon the conſideration of valour, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene this vertue and others: But <hi>Plutarch</hi> hauing often ſpoken of this matter, it were in vaine heere for mee to repeat what he ſayes of it. This is worthy to be conſidered, that our nation giveth the chiefe preheminence of all vertue vnto valiancy, as the Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the word ſheweth, which commeth of valour, or worth: and that according to our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued cuſtome, when after the phraſe of our court and nobility we ſpeake of a worthy man, or of an honeſt man, we thereby inferre no other thing than a valiant man; after the vſuall Roman faſhion. For, the generall denomination of vertue doth amongſt them take her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymology, of force or might. The only proper and eſſential forme of our nobility in <hi>France,</hi> is military vocation. It is very likely, that the firſt vertue that ever appeared amongſt men, and which to ſome hath given preheminence over others, hath bin this by which the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and more couragious have become maſters over the weakeſt, and purchaſed a particular rancke and reputation to themſelues: Whereby this honour and dignity of ſpeech is left vnto it: or elſe theſe nations being very war-like, haue giuen the price vnto that of vertues, which was the worthieſt and more familiar vnto them.

Now (woorthy Lady) ſithence I muſt pourtray my ſelfe to the life, I ſhould have forgotten a part of importance, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall I had not repreſented the honour I have ever yeeleed to your deſerts, which I have eſpecially beene willing to declare in the forefront of this Chapter; For aſmuch as amongſt your other good parts, and commendable qualities, that of loving amity, which you have ſhewen to your children, holdeth one of the firſt ranckes. Whoſoever ſhall vnderſtand and know the age, wherein your late husband the Lord of <hi>Eſtiſſac</hi> left you a Widdow, the great and honorable matches haue been offered you (as worthy and as many as to any other Lady in <hi>France</hi> of your condition) the conſtant reſolution, and reſolute conſtancy, wherewith ſo many yeeres you have ſuſtained, and even in ſpight, or a thwart ſo manifold thorny difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the charge and conduct of their affaires, which have toſſed, turmoyled and remooved you in all corners of <hi>France,</hi> and ſtill hold you beſieged; the happy and ſucceſſefull forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you, which only through your wiſdome or good fortune have given them, he will eaſily ſay with mee, that in our age we haue no patterne of motherly affection more exemplare; than yours. I praiſe God (Madam) it hath beene ſo well employed: For, the good hopes, which the yoong Lord of <hi>Estiſſac,</hi> your ſonne giveth of himſelfe, fore-ſhew an vndoubted aſſurance, that when he ſhall come to yeeres of diſcretion, you ſhall reape the obedience of a noble, and find the acknowledgement of a good childe. But becauſe, by reaſon of his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he could not take notice of the exceeding kindneſſe and many-fold offices he hath received from you, my meaning is, that if ever theſe my compoſitions ſhall happly one day come into his hands (when peradventure I ſhall neither have mouth nor ſpeach to declare it vnto him) he receive this teſtimonie in all veritie from me; which ſhall alſo more lively be teſtified vnto him by the good effects, (whereof, if ſo it pleaſe God, he ſhall have a ſenſible feeling) that there is no Gentleman in <hi>France,</hi> more endebted to his mother, then he; and that hereafter he cannot yeeld a more certaine proofe of his goodneſſe, and teſtimonie of his vertue, then in acknowledging and confeſſing you for ſuch. If there be any truely-naturall law, that is to ſay, any inſtinct, vniverſally and perpetually imprinted, both in beaſts and vs, (which is not without controverſie) I may, according to mine opinion, ſay, that next to the care, which each living creature hath to his preſervation, and to flie what doth hurt him; the affection which the engenderer beareth his off-ſpring, holds the ſecond place in this ranke. And foraſmuch as nature ſeemeth to have recommended the ſame vnto-vs, ayming to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, encreaſe, and advance, the ſucceſſive parts or parcels of this hir frame. It is no woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>againe it is not ſo great from children vnto fathers. This other Ariſtotelian conſideration remembred: That <hi>hee who doth benefit another, loveth him better than hee is beloved of him againe:</hi> And hee to whom a debt is owing, loveth better, than hee that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And every workeman loveth his worke better, than hee ſhould bee beloved of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if it had ſenſe or feeling. Foraſmuch as we love to be; and being conſiſteth in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and action. Therefore is every man, in ſome ſort or other in his owne workmanſhip. <hi>Whoſoever doth a good deed, exerciſeth a faire and honeſt action: Whoſoever receiveth, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth onely a profitable action.</hi> And profite is nothing ſo much to be eſteemed or loved as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie. Honeſtie is firme and permanent, affording him that did it, a conſtant gratification. Profite is verie ſlipperie, and eaſilie loſt, nor is the memorie of it ſo ſweet, or ſo freſh. Such things are deareſt vnto vs, that have coſt vs moſt: And to give, is of more coſt then to take. Since it hath pleaſed God to endow-vs with ſome capacitie of diſcourſe, that as beaſts we ſhould not ſervily be ſubjected to common lawes, but rather with judgement and voluntarie libertie applie our ſelves vnto them; we ought ſomewhat to yeeld vnto the ſimple auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Nature: but not ſuffer hir tyrannically to carrie-vs away: only reaſon ought to have the conduct of our inclinations. As for me, my taſte is ſtrangely diſtaſted to it's propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in vs are produced without the ordinance and direction of our judgement. As vpon this ſubject I ſpeak-of, I cannot receive this paſſion, wherewith ſome embrace chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſcarſly borne, having neither motion in the ſoule, nor forme well to be diſtinguiſhed in the bodie, whereby they might make themſelves lovely or amiable. And I could never well endure to have them brought vp or nurſed neere about me. A true and wel ordred affection,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12117:113"/>
ought to be borne and augmented, with the knowledge they give vs of themſelves; and then, if they deſerve-it (naturall inclination marching hand in hand with reaſon) to cheriſh and make much of them, with a perfect fatherly love and loving friendſhip, and conformably to judge of them if they be otherwiſe, alwaies yeelding our ſelves vnto reaſon, notwithſtanding naturll power. For the moſt part; it goeth cleane contrary, and commonly feele our ſelves more mooved with the ſports, idleneſſe, wantonneſſe, and infant-trifles of our children, than afterward we doe with all their actions, when they bee men: As if we had loved them for our paſtimes, as we doe apes, monkies, or perokitoes, and not as men. And ſome that liberally furniſh them with ſporting bables while they be children, will miſerably pinch it in the leaſt expence for neceſſaries when they grow men. Nay, it ſeemeth that the jelouſie we have to ſee them appeare into, and injoy the world, when we are ready to leave them, makes vs more ſparing and cloſe-handed toward them. It vexeth and grieveth vs when we ſee them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs at our heeles, ſuppoſing they ſolicite vs to be gone hence: And if we were to feare that ſince the order of things beareth, that they cannot indeede, neither be, nor live, but by our being and life, we ſhould not meddle to be fathers. As for mee, I deeme it a kind of cruelty and injuſtice, not to receive them into the ſhare and ſociety of our goods, and to admit them as Partners in the vnderſtanding of our domeſticall affaires (if they be once capable of it) and not to cut off and ſhut- vp our commodities to provide for theirs, ſince we have engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them to that purpoſe. It is meere injuſtice to ſee an old, crazed, ſinnow-ſhronken, and nigh dead father ſitting alone in a Chimny-corner, to enjoy ſo many goods as would ſuffice for the preferment and entertainment of many children, and in the meane while, for want of meanes, to ſuffer them to looſe their beſt daies and yeares, without thruſting them into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſervice and knowledge of men; whereby they are often caſt into diſpaire, to ſeeke, by ſome way how vnlawfull ſoever to provide for their neceſſaries. And in my daies, I have ſeene divers yong-men, of good, houſes ſo given to ſtealing and filching, that no correction could divert them from it. I know one very well alied, to whom, at the inſtance of a brother of his (a moſt honeſt, gallant, and vertuous Gentleman) I ſpake to that purpoſe, who bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered and confeſſed vnto me, that onely by the rigor and covetiſe of his father he had beene forced and driuen to fall into ſuch lewdneſſe and wickedneſſe. And even at that time he came from ſtealing certaine jewels from a Lady, in whoſe bed-chamber he fortuned to come with certaine other Gentlemen when ſhe was riſing, and had almoſt beene taken. He made me remember a tale I had heard of an other Gentleman, from his youth ſo faſhioned and inclined to this goodly trade of pilfering, that comming afterward to be heire and Lord of his owne goods, reſolved to giue over that manner of life, could notwithſtanding (if he chanced to come neere a ſhop, where he ſaw any thing he ſtood in neede of) not chuſe but ſteale the ſame, though afterward he would ever ſend mony and pay for it. And I have ſeene diverſe ſo inured to that vice, that amongſt their companions, they would ordinarily ſteale ſuch things, as they would reſtore againe. I am a Gaſcoine, and there is no vice wherein I have leſſe skill: I hate it ſomewhat more by complexion, then I accuſe it by diſcourſe. I doe not ſo much as deſire another mans goods.</p>
                        <p>And although my Country-men be indeed ſomewhat more taxed with this fault, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> yet have we ſeene of late daies, and that ſundry times men well borne and of good parentaeg in other parts of <hi>France</hi> in the hands of juſtice, and lawfully convicted of many moſt horrible robberies. I am of opinion that in regard of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches and lewd actions, fathers may, in ſome ſort, be blamed, and that it is onely long of them. And if any ſhall anſwer mee, as did once a Gentleman of good worth and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he thriftily endevored to hoard vp riches, to no other purpoſe, nor to have any vſe and commodity of them, then to be honoured, reſpected and ſuingly ſought vnto by his friends and kinsfolkes, and that age having bereaved him of all other forces, it was the onely remedy he had left to maintaine himſelfe in authority with his houſhold, and keepe him from falling into contempt and diſdaine of all the world. (And truely according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> not onely old-age, but each imbecility, is the promoter, and motive of couetouſneſſe. That is ſomething, but it is a remedie for an evill, whereof the birth ſhould have beene hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and breeding a voyded.

owne ſtate againe, was wont to vpbraid his fathers memorie, for ſo diſſolutely-frequenting of women, terming him a ſloven, effeminate, and a luſtfull engenderer of children. The Greeke ſtorie doth note <hi>Iecus</hi> the <hi>Tarentine, Chryſo, Aſtylus, Diopomus</hi> and others, who to keepe their bodies tough and ſtrong for the ſervice of the Olympicke courſes, wreſtlings and ſuch bodily exerciſes, they did, as long as they were poſſeſſed with that care, heedefully ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from all venerian actes, and thouching of women. In a certaine country of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Indies,</hi> no man was ſuffered to take a wife, before he were fortie yeares olde, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might marry at tenne yeares of age. There is no reaſon, neither is it convenient, that a Gentleman of five and thirtie yeares, ſhould give place to his ſonne, that is but twenty: For then is the father as ſeemely, and may aſwell appeare, and ſet himſelfe forward, in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of voyages of warres, aſwell by land as ſea, and doe his Prince as good ſervice, in court, or elſe where, as his ſonne: He hath neede of all his parts, and ought truly to impart them, but ſo, that he forget not himſelfe for others: And to ſuch may juſtly that anſwere ſerve, which fathers have commonly in their mouthes: <hi>I will not put off my clothes before I be readie to goe to bed.</hi> But a father over-burthend with yeares, and crazed through ſickeneſſe, and by reaſon of weakeneſſe and want of health, barred from the common ſocietie of men, doth both wrong himſelfe, injure his, idely and to no vſe to hoorde vp, and keepe cloſe a great heape of riches, and deale of pelfe. He is in ſtate good enough, if he be wiſe to have a deſire to put off his clothes to goe to bed. I will not ſay to his ſpirt, but to a good warme night gowne, As for other pompe and traſh whereof hee hath no longer vſe or neede; hee ought willingly to diſtribute and beſtow them amongſt thoſe, to whom by naturall decree they ought to belong. It is reaſon he ſhould have the vſe, and bequeath the fruition of them, ſince nature doth alſo deprive him of them, otherwiſe without doubt there is both envy and malice ſtirring. The worthieſt action, that ever the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth performed was this, in imitation of ſome ancients of his quality, that he had the diſcretion to know, that reaſon commanded vs, to ſtrip or ſhift our ſelves when our cloathes trouble and are too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie for vs, and that it is high time to goe to bed, when our legges faile vs. He reſigned his meanes, his greatneſſe and Kingdome to his Sonne, at what time he found his former vndan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reſolution to decay, and force to conduct his aſlaires, to droope in himſelfe, together with the glory he had thereby acquired.</p>

I chanced one day to tell him ſomewhat boldly (as my cuſtome is) that it would better beſeeme him to give vs place, and reſigne his chiefe houſe to his ſon (for he had no other mannor-houſe conveniently well furniſhed) and quietly retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſome farme of his, where no man might trouble him, or diſturbe his reſt, ſince he could not otherwiſe avoide our importunitie, ſeeing the condition of his children; who afterward followed my counſell, and found great eaſe by it. It is not to be ſaid, that they have any thing given them by ſuch a way of obligation, which a man may not recall againe: I, that am readie to play ſuch a part, would give over vnto them the full poſſeſſion of my
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12117:114"/>
houſe, and enjoying of my goods, but with ſuch libertie and limited condition, as if they ſhould give me occaſion, I might repent my ſelfe of my gift, and revoke my deede. I would leave the vſe and fruition of all vnto them, the rather becauſe it were no longer fit for me to weald the ſame. And touching the diſpoſing of all matters in groſſe, I would reſerve what I pleaſed vnto my ſelfe. Having ever judged, that it muſt be a great contentment to an aged father, himſelfe to direct his children in the government of his houſhold-affaires, and to be able whilſt himſelfe liveth, to checke and controule the demeanors: ſtoring them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and adviſed counſel according to the experience he hath had of them, and himſelf to addreſſe the ancient honour and order of his houſe in the handes of his ſucceſſours, and that way warrant himſelfe of the hopes hee may conceive of their future conduct and after ſucceſſe. And to this effect, I would not ſhunne their company. I would not be far from them, but as much as the condition of my age would permit, enjoy and be a partner of their ſports, mirths, and feaſts. If I did not continually live amongſt them (as I could not wel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending their meetings and hindering their recreation, by reaſon of the peeviſh fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of my age, and the trouble of my infirmities, and alſo without forcing their rules, and reſiſting the forme of life, I ſhould then follow) I would at leaſt live neere them, in ſome corner of my houſe, not the beſt and faireſt in ſhew, but the moſt eaſefull and commodious. And not as ſome yeeres ſince, I ſaw a Deane of S. <hi>Hillarie</hi> of Poictiers, reduced by reaſon and the incommoditie of his melancholy to ſuch a continuall ſolitarineſſe, that when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his chamber he had never remooved one ſtep out of it in two and twenty yeares before: yet had all his faculties free and eaſie, onely a rheume excepted that fell into his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make. Scarſe once a weeke would he ſuffer any body to come and ſee him. Hee would ever be ſhut vp in his chamber all alone, where no man ſhould come, except a boy, who once a day brought him meate, and who might not tarrie there, but as ſoone as he was in, muſt goe out againe. All his exerciſe was ſometimes to walke vp and downe his chamber, and now and then reade on ſome booke (for he had ſome vnderſtanding of letters) but obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſolved to live and die in that courſe, as he did ſhortly after. I would endevour by a kinde of civill demeanour and milde converſation, to breede and ſettle in my children a true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harty-loving friendſhip, and vnfained good will towards me. A thing eaſily obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt well-borne mindes: For, if they proove, or be ſuch ſurly-furious beaſtes, or given to churliſh diſobedience, as our age bringeth forth thouſands, they muſt as beaſtes be hated, as churls neglected, and as degenerate avoided. I hate this cuſtome, to forbid children to call their fathers father, and to teach them another ſtrange name, as of more reverence: As if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not ſufficiently provided for our authoritie. We call God-almightie by the name of father, and diſdaine our children ſhould call vs ſo. I have reformed this fault in mine owne houſholde. It is alſo follie and injuſtice to deprive children, eſpecially being of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent age, of their fathers familiaritie, and ever to ſnew them a ſurly, auſtere, grim, and diſdainefull countenance, hoping thereby to keepe them in awefull feare and duteous obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For, it is a very vnprofitable proceeding, and which maketh fathers yrkeſome vnto children; and which is worſe, ridiculous. They have youth and ſtrength in their hands, and conſequently, the breath and favour of the worlde; and doe with mockerie and contempt receive theſe churliſh fierce, and tyrannicall countenaunces, from a man that hath no luſty bloud left him, neither in his heart, nor in his veines; meere bugge-beares, and ſcar-crowes, to ſcare birdes with all. If it lay in my power to make my ſelfe feared, I had rather make my ſelfe beloved. There are ſo many ſortes of defects in age, and ſo much impuiſſance: It is ſo ſubject to contempt, that the beſt purchaſe it can make, is the good will, love and affection of hers. Commandement and feare are no longer her weapons. I have knowen one whoſe youth had bin very imperious and rough, but when he came to mans age, although hee live in as good plight and health as may be, yet he chaſeth, he ſcoldeth, he brawleth, he fighteth, he ſweareth, and biteth, as the moſt boiſtrous and tempeſtuous maſter of <hi>France,</hi> he frets and conſumes himſelfe with ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It were a matter beſeeming a ſcholaſticall queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be better ſo, or otherwiſe. In his preſence all things give place vnto him. This vaine courſe is ever left vnto his authority, that he is never gaine-ſaid. He is had in awe, he is fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he is beleeved, he is reſpected his belly-full. Doth he diſcharge any boy or ſervant? he preſently truſſeth vp his packe, then is he gone; but whether? onely out of his ſight, not out of his houſe. The ſteps of age are follow, the ſenſes ſo troubled, the minde ſo diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he ſhall live and doe his office, a whole yeere in one ſame houſe, and never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And when fit time or occaſion ſerveth, Letters are produced from farre places, humbly ſuing, and pittifully complayning, with promiſes to doe better, and to amend, by which he is brought into favour and office againe. Doth the maſter make any bargaine, or diſpatch that pleaſeth not? it is immediately ſmothered and ſuppreſſed, ſoone after forging cauſes, and deviſing colourable excuſes, to excuſe the want of execution or anſwer. No for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Letters being firſt preſented vnto him, he ſeeth but ſuch as are fit for his knowledge. If peradventure they come vnto his hands, as he that truſteth ſome one of his men to reade them vnto him, he will preſently deviſe what he thinketh good, whereby they often invent, that ſuch a one ſeemeth to aske him forgiveneſſe, that wrongeth him by his Letter.

If others deceive me, yet do I not deceive my ſelfe, to eſteeme my ſelfe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of power to looke vnto my ſelfe, nor to trouble my braines to yeeld my ſelfe vnto it. I doe beware and keepe my ſelfe from ſuch treaſons, and cunny-catching in mine owne boſome, not by an vnquiet, and tumultuary curioſity, but rather by a diverſion and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When I heare the ſtate of any one reported or diſcourſed of, I ammuſe not my ſelfe on him, but preſently caſt mine eyes on my ſelfe, and all my wits together, to ſee in what ſtate I am, and how it goeth with me. Whatſoever concerneth him, the ſame hath relation to me. His fortunes forewarne me, and ſummon vp my ſpirites that way. <hi>There is no day nor houre, but we ſpeake that of others, we might properly ſpeake of our ſelves, could we as well enfold, as we can vnfould our conſideration.</hi> And many Authours doe in this maner wound the protection of their cauſe, by over-raſnly running againſt that, which they take hold-of, thirling ſuch darts at their enemies, that might with much more advantage be caſt at them. The Lord of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc,</hi> late one of the Lord Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> having loſt his ſonne, who died in the Iland of <hi>Madera,</hi> a worthy, forward and gallant yoong gentleman, and truely of good hope; amongſt other his griefes and regrets, did greatly moove me to condole, the infinite diſpleaſure and heartes-ſorrow that he felt, in aſmuch as he had never communicated and opened himſelfe vnto him: for, with his auſtere humour and continuall endevoring to hold a grimme-ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatherly gravity over him, he had loſt the meanes, perfectly to finde and throughly to know his ſonne, and ſo to manifeſt vnto him, the extreame affection he bare him, and the worthy judgement he made of his vertue. Alas (was he wont to ſay) the poore lad, ſaw never any thing in me, but a ſevere-ſurly-countenance, full of diſdaine, and happily was poſſeſſed with this conceit, that I could neither love nor eſteeme him according to his merits. Ay-me, to whom did I reſerve, to diſcover that ſingular and loving affection, which in my ſoule I bare vnto him? Was it not he that ſhould have had all the pleaſure and acknowledgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? I have forced and tormented my ſelfe to maintaine this vaine maske, and have vtterly loſt the pleaſure of his converſation, and therwithal his good will, which ſurely was but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold towards me, forſomuch as he never received but rude entertainement of mee, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt but a tyrannicall proceeding in me towards him. I am of opinion, his complaint was reaſonable and well grounded. For, as I know by certaine experience, there is no comfort ſo ſweete in the loſſe of friends, as that our owne knowledge or conſcience tels vs, we never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to tell them every thing, and expoſtulate all matters vnto them, and to have had a perfect and free communication with them. Tell me my good friend, am I the better or the worſe by having a taſte of it? Surely I am much the better. His griefe doth both comfort and honour mee. Is it not a religious and pleaſing office of my life, for ever to make the obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies thereof? Can there be any pleaſure worth this privation? I doe vnfold and open my ſelfe as much as I can to mine owne people, and willigly declare the ſtate of my will and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment toward them, as commonly I doe towards all men: I make haſte to produce and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelfe, for I would have no man miſtake me, in what part ſoever. Amongſt other particular cuſtomes, which our ancient Gaules had, (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> affirmeth) this was one, that children never came before their fathers, nor were in any publicke aſſembly ſeene in their company, but when they began to beare armes; as if they would infer, that then was the time, fathers ſhould admit them to their acquaintance and familiarity. I have alſo obſerved another kinde of indiſcretion in ſome fathers of our times, who during their owne life, would never be induced to acquaint or impart vnto their children, that ſhare or portion, which by the Law of Nature, they were to have in their fortunes: Nay, ſome there are, who after their death bequeath and commit the ſame aucthority, over them and their goods, vnto their wives, with full power and law to diſpoſe of them at their pleaſure. And my ſelfe have knowen a Gentleman, a chiefe officer of our crowne, that by right and hope of ſucceſſion (had he lived vnto it) was to inherite above fifty thouſand crownes a yeere good land, who at the age of more then fifty yeeres fell into ſuch neceſſity and want, and was run ſo farre in debt, that he had nothing left him, and as it is ſuppoſed died for very neede; whileſt his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hir extreame decrepitude, enjoyed all his lands and poſſeſſed all his goods, by vertue
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:12117:116"/>
of his fathers will and teſtament, who had lived very neere foure-ſcore yeares. A thing (in my conceite) no way to be commended, but rather blamed. Therefore doe I thinke, that a man but little advantaged or bettered in eſtate, who is able to liue of himſelfe, and is out of debt, eſpecially if he have children, and goeth about to marry a wife, that muſt have a great joynter out of his lands, aſſuredly there is no other debt, that brings more ruine vnto hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then that. My predeceſſours have commonly followed this counſell, and ſo have I, and all have found good by it. But thoſe that diſſwade vs from marrying of riche wives, leſt they might proove over diſdainefull and peeviſh, or leſſe tractable and loving, are alſo deceived to make vs neglect and for-goe a reall commoditie, for ſo frivolous a conjecture. To an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable women, it is all one coſt to hir, whether they paſſe vnder one reaſon, or vnder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>They love to be where they are most wronged.</hi> Injuſtice doeth allure them; as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their vertuous actions enticeth the good. And by how much richer they are, ſo much more milde and gentle are they: as more willingly and gloriouſly chaſt, by how much fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are. Some colour of reaſon there is, men ſhould leave the adminiſtration of their goods and affaires vnto mothers, whilſt their children are not of competent age, or fit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes to manage the charge of them: And il hath their father brought them vp, if he cannot hope, theſe comming to yeares of diſcretion, they ſhal have no more wit, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſufficiencie, then his wife, conſidering the weakneſſe of their ſexe. Yet truly were it as much againſt nature, ſo to order things, that mothers muſt wholy depend of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens deſcretion. They ought largely and competently to be provided, wherewith to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their eſtate, according to the quality of their houſe and age: becauſe <hi>neede and want is much more vnſeemely and hard to be indured in women, than in men:</hi> And children rather then mothers ought to be charged therewith. In generall, my opinion is, that the beſt diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods, is when we die, to diſtribute them according to the cuſtome of the Country. The Lawes have better thought vpon them then we: And better it is to let them erre in their election, then for vs raſhly to hazard to faile in ours. They are not properly our owne, ſince without vs, and by a civill preſcription, they are appointed to certaine ſucceſſours. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we have ſome further liberty, I thinke it ſhould be a great and moſt apparant cauſe to induce vs to take from one, and barre him from that, which Fortune hath allotted him, and the common Lawes and Iuſtice hath called him vnto: And that againſt reaſon wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this liberty, by ſuting the ſame vnto our priuate humours and frivolous fantaſies. My fortune hath beene good, inaſmuch as yet it never preſented mee with any occaſions, that might tempt or divert my affections from the common and lawfull ordinance. I ſee ſome, towards whom it is but labour loſt, carefully to endevour to doe any good offices. <hi>A word il taken defaceth the merite of tenne yeeres.</hi> Happy he, that at this laſt paſſage is ready to ſooth and applaud their will. The next action tranſporteth him; not the beſt and moſt frequent offices, but the freſheſt and preſent worke the deede. They are people that play with their wils and teſtaments, as with apples and rods, to gratifie or chaſtize every action of thoſe who pretend any intereſt therevnto. It is a matter of over-long purſute, and of exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, at every inſtance to be thus dilated, and wherein the wiſer ſort eſtabliſh themſelves once for all, chiefely reſpecting reaſon, and publike obſervance. We ſomewhat over-much take theſe maſculine ſubſtitutions to hart, and propoſe a ridiculous eternity vnto our names. We alſo over-weight ſuch vaine future conjectures, which infant-ſpirits give-vs. It might peradventure have beene deemed injuſtice, to diſplace me from out my rancke, becauſe I was the dulleſt, the ſloweſt, the vnwillingeſt, and moſt leaden-pated to learne my leſſon o a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good, that ever was, not onely of all my brethren, but of all the children in my Countrie; were the leſſon concerning any exerciſe of the minde or body. It is follie to trie anie extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie concluſions vpon the truſt of their divinations, wherein we are ſo often deceived. If this rule may be contradicted, and the deſtinies corrected, in the choiſe they have made of our heires, with ſo much more apparance, may it be done in conſideration of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and enormous corporall deformitie; a conſtant and incorrigible vice; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vs great eſteemers of beautie; a matter of important prejudice. The pleaſant dialogue of <hi>Plato</hi> the law-giver, with his citizens, will much honor this paſſage. Why then (ſay they) perceiving their ende to approch, ſhall we not diſpoſe of that which is our owne, to whom and according as we pleaſe? Oh Gods what cruelty is this? That it ſhall not be lawfull for vs, to give or bequeath more or leſſe according to our fantaſies, to ſuch as have
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:12117:116"/>
ſerved vs, and taken paines with vs in our ſickeneſſes, in our age, and in our buſines? To whom the Law-giver anſwereth in this manner; my frends (ſaith he) who doubtles ſhall ſhortly die it is a hard matter for you, both to know your ſelves, and what is yours, according to the <hi>Delphike</hi> in ſcription: As for me, who am the maker of your lawes, I am of opinion that neither your ſelves are your owne, nor that which you enjoy. And both you and your goods, paſt and to come, belong to your familie; and moreover both your families and your goods are the common wealths: Wherfore, leaſt any flatterer, either in your age, or in time of ſickenes, or any other paſſion, ſhould vnadviſedly induce you to make any vnlawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayance or vnjuſt will and teſtament, I will looke to you and keepe you from-it. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an eſpeciall reſpect both to the vniverſall intereſt of your Citie, and particular ſtate of your houſes, I will eſtabliſh lawes, and by reaſon make you perceive and confeſſe, that <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commoditie ought to yeelde to a publike benefit.</hi> Followe that courſe meerely, whereto humaine neceſſitie doth call you. To me it belongeth, who have no more regarde to one thing, then to another, and who as much as I can, take care for the general, to have a regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſpect of that which you leave behind you. But to returne to my former diſcourſe, me thinkes, we ſeldome ſee that woman borne, to whom the ſuperioritie or majeſtie over men is due, except the motherly and naturall; vnles it be for the chaſtiſement of ſuch, as by ſome fond-febricitant humor have voluntarily ſubmitted themſelves vnto them: But that doth nothing concerne old women, of whom we ſpeake here. It is the apparance of this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, hath made vs to frame, and willingly to eſtabliſh this law (never ſeene elſe where) that barreth women from the ſucceſſion of this crowne, and there are few principalities in the world, where it is not aleaged, aſwel as here, by a likely and apparant reaſon, which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth the ſame. But fortune hath given more credit vnto-it in ſome places, then in other ſome. It is dangerous to leave the diſpenſation of our ſucceſſion vnto their judgement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the choyſe they ſhall make of their children, which is moſt commonly vnjuſt and fantaſticall. For, the ſame vnrulie appetite, and diſtaſted reliſh, or ſtrange longings, which they have when they are great with child, the ſame have they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> al times in their minds. They are commonly ſeene to affect the weakeſt, the ſimpleſt and moſt abject, or ſuch (if they have any) that had more neede to ſucke. For, wanting reaſonable diſcourſe to chuſe, and embrace what they ought, they rather ſuffer themſelves to be directed, where natures impreſſions are moſt ſingle, as other creatures, which take no longer knowledge of their yong-ones, then they are ſucking. Moreover, experience doth manifeſtly ſnew vnto vs, that the ſame naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to which we aſcribe ſo much authoritie, hath but a weake foundation. For a very ſmall gaine, we daily take mothers owne children from them and induce them to take charge of ours; Doe we not often procure them to bequeath their children to ſome fond, filthie, ſluttiſh, and vnhealthie nurce, to whom we would be very loth to commit ours, or to ſome brutiſh Goate, not onely forbidding them to nurce and feede their owne children (what danger ſoever may betide them) but alſo to have any care of them, to the end they may the more diligently follow, and carefully attend the ſervice of ours? Whereby wee ſoone ſee through cuſtome a certaine kinde of baſtard-affection to be engendred in them, more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement then the naturall, and to be much more tender and carefull for the well fare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of other mens children, then for their owne. And the reaſon why I have made mention of Goates, is, becauſe it is an ordinarie thing round about me where I dwell, to ſee the countrie women, when they have not milke enough to feed their infants with their owne breaſts, to call for Goates to helpe them. And my ſelfe have now two lacke is wayting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, who except it were eight daies never ſuck't other milke then Goates; They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to come at call, and give yong infants ſucke, and become ſo well acquainted with their voice, that when they heare them crie; they runne forthwith vnto them. And if by chance they have any other child put to their teates, then their nurſeling, they refuſe and reject him, and ſo doth the childe a ſtrange Goate. My ſelfe ſaw that one not long ſince, from whom the father tooke a Goate, which he had ſucked two or three daies, becauſe he had but borrowed it of one his neighbours, who could never be induced to ſucke any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby he ſhortly died; and as I verely thinke, of meere hunger. <hi>Beaſts as well as we doe ſoone alter, and eaſily baſtardize their naturall affection.</hi> I beleeve, that in that, which <hi>Hero dotus</hi> reporteth of a certaine province of <hi>Libia,</hi> there often followeth great error and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. He ſaith, that men doe indifferently vſe, and as it were in common frequent women;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12117:117"/>
And that the childe as ſoone as he is able to goe, comming to any ſolemne meetings and great aſſemblies, led by a naturall inſtinct findeth out his owne father: where being turned looſe in the middeſt of the multitude, looke what man the childe doth firſt addreſſe his ſteps vnto, and then goe to him, the ſame is ever afterward reputed to be his right father. Now if we ſhal duely conſider this ſimple occaſion of loving our children, becauſe we have begotten them, for which we call them our other ſelves. It ſeemes there is another production com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from vs, and which is of no leſſe recommendation and conſequence. For what we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender by the minde, the fruites of our courage, ſufficiencie, or ſpirite, are brought forth by a far more noble part, then the corporall, and are more, our owne. We are both father and mother together in this generation: ſuch fruites coſt vs much dearer, and bring vs more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and chiefly if they have any good or rare thing in them. For, the value of our other children, is much more theire, then ours. The ſhare we have in them is but little; but of theſe all the beautie, all the grace, and all the worth is ours. And therefore doe they repreſent, and reſemble vs much more lively then others. <hi>Plate</hi> addeth moreover, that theſe are immortall iſſues, and immortalize their fathers, yea and deifie them, as <hi>Licurgus, Solen,</hi> and <hi>Minos.</hi> All hiſtories being full of examples of this mutuall friendſhip of fathers toward their children, I have not thought it amiſſe to ſet downe ſome choiſe one of this kinde. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> that good Biſhop of <hi>Tricea,</hi> loved rather to looſe the dignity, profit and devotion of ſo venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Prelateſhip, then to for-goe his daughter, a yong woman to this day commended for hir beautie, but happily ſomewhat more curiouſly and wantonly pranked-vp then beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the daughter of a churchman and a Biſhop, and of over-amorous behavior. There was one <hi>Labienus</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> a man of great worth and authority, and an ongſt other commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities, moſt excellent in all maner of learning, who (as I think) was the ſonne of that great <hi>Labienus,</hi> cheife of all the captaines that followed and were vnder <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the warres againe the Gaules, and who afterward taking great <hi>Pompeys</hi> part, behaved himſelfe ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly and ſo conſtantly, that he never forſooke him vntill <hi>Caeſar</hi> defeated him in <hi>Spaine.</hi> This <hi>Labienus</hi> of whom I ſpake, had many that envied his vertues; But aboue all (as it is likely) courtiers, and ſuch as in his time were favored of the Emperors, who hated his frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, his fatherly humors, and diſtaſte he bare ſtill againſt tyrannie, wherewith it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he had ſtuffed his bookes and compoſitions. His adverſaries vehemently purſued him before the Magiſtrate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and prevailed ſo farre, that many of his works which he had publiſhed were condemned to be burned. He was the firſt on whom this new example of puniſhment was put in practiſe, which after continued long in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on divers others, to puniſh learning, ſtudies, and writings with death and conſuming fire. There were neither meanes enough, or matter ſufficient of crueltie, vnleſſe we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled amongſt them things, which nature hath exempted from all ſenſe and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as reputation, and the inventions of our minde: and except we communicated corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall miſchiefes vnto diſciplines and monuments of the Muſes. Which loſſe <hi>Labienus</hi> could not endure, nor brooke to ſurvive thoſe his deare, and highly-eſteemed iſſues: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cauſed himſelfe to be carried, and ſhut vp alive within his aunceſtors monument, where, with a dreadleſſe reſolution, he at once provided, both to kill himſelfe and be buried toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is hard to ſhew any more vehement fatherly affection, than that. <hi>Caſſius Severus, a</hi> moſt eloquent man, and his familiar friend, ſeeing his Bookes burnt, exclamed, that by the ſame ſentence hee ſhould therewithall be condemned to be burned alive, for hee ſtill bare and kept in minde, what they contained in them.

And if it had beene in his choiſe, to leave behind him, either a counterfeit, deformed, or ill-borne childe, or a fooliſh, triviall, and idle booke, not onely he, but all men in the world beſides of like learning and ſufficiency, would much rather have choſen, to incurre the former then the latter miſchiefe.

And I wot not well, whether my ſelfe ſhould not much rather deſire to beget and produce a perfectly-well-ſhaped, and excellently-qualited infant, by the acquaintance of the Muſes, then by the copulation of my wife. Whatſoever I give to this, let the world allow of it as it pleaſe, I give it as purely and irrevocable, as any man can give to his corporal children. That little good which I have done him, is no longer in my diſpoſition.

If any man chance to be ſlaine for want of an armour, there are as many more that miſcary with the over-heavy burthen of their armes, and by them are engaged, and by a counterbuffe are bruſed, or otherwiſe defeated. For in truth to ſee the vnweildy weight of our and their thickneſſe, it ſeemeth we but endevour to defend our ſelves, and we are rather charged then covered by them. We have enough to doe, to endure the burthen of them, and are ſo engived and ſhackled in them, as if we were to fight but with the ſhocke or brunt of our armes: And as if we were as much bound to defend them, as they to ſhield vs. <hi>Cornelius Facitus</hi> doth pleaſantly quip and jeſt at the men of war of our ancient Gaules, ſo armed, only to maintaine themſelves, as they that have no meane, either to offend or to be offended, or to raiſe themſelves being overthrowne. <hi>Lucullus</hi> ſeeing certaine Median men at armes, which were in the front of <hi>Tigranes</hi> Army, heavily and vnweildely armed, as in an yron-priſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended thereby an opinion, that he might eaſily defeat them, and began to charge them firſt, and got the victory.

                        <p>The Emperour <hi>Caracalla</hi> in leading of his Army was ever wont to march a foot armed at all aſſaies. The Roman footmen caried not their morions, ſword and target only, as for other armes (ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi>) they were ſo accuſtomed to weare them continually, that they hindered
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12117:118"/>
them no more then their limbs: <hi>Arma enim, membra militis eſſe dicunt:</hi> for they ſay armor and weapon, are a ſoldiers limbs. But there withal ſuch victuals as they ſhould need for a fortnight and a certaine number of ſtakes, to make their rampards or paliſadoes with; ſo much as weighed threeſcore pound weight. And <hi>Marius</hi> his ſouldiers thus loden, marching in battel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array, were taught to march five leagues in five houres, yea ſix if need required. Their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline was much more laborſome then ours: So did it produce far different effects. <hi>Scipto</hi> the yonger, reforming his army in <hi>Spaine,</hi> appointed his ſouldiers to eate no meate but ſtanding, and nothing ſodden or roſted. It is worth the remembrance how a Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſouldier being in an expedition of warre, was much noted and blamed, becauſe hee was once ſeene to ſeeke for ſhelter vnder a houſe: They were ſo hardened to enduree all manner of labour and toyle, that it was counted a reprechfull infamy for a ſouldier to be ſeene vnder any other roofe then that of heavens-vault, in what weather ſoever: Were we to doe ſo, we ſhould never leade our men far. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> a man well trained in the Roman wars, doth cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly obſerve the manner which the Parthians vſed to arme themſelves, and noteth it ſo much the more, by how much it was far different from the Romans. They had (ſaith he) certaine armes ſo curiouſly enter-wrought as they ſeemed to be made like feathers, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindered the ſtirring of their bodies, and yet ſo ſtrong, that our darts hitting them, did rather rebound, or glance by, then hurt them (they be the ſcales our anceſtors were ſo much wont to vſe.) In another place, they had (ſaith he) their horſes ſtiffe and ſtrong, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with thicke hides, and themſelves armed from head to foote, with maſſie yron plates ſo artificially contrived, that where the joynts are, there they furthered the motion, and helped the ſtirring. A man would have ſaid, they had been men made of yron: For they had peeces ſo handſomly fitted and ſo lively repreſenting the forme and parts of the face; that there was no way to wound them, but at certaine little holes before their eyes, which ſerved to give them ſome light, and by certaine chinckes about their noſtrils, by which they hardly drew breath</p>

Theſe are but my fantaſies, by which I endevour not to make things knowen, but myſelfe. They may haply one day be knowen vnto me, or have bin at other times, according as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath brought me where they were declared or manifeſted. But I remember them no more. And if I be a man of ſome reading, yet I am a man of no remembring, I conceive no certainty, except it bee to give notice, how farre the knowledge I have of it, dooth now reach. Let no man buſie himſelfe about the matters, but on the faſhion I give them. Let that which I borrow be ſurvaid, and then tell me whether I have made good choice of ornaments, to beautifie and ſet foorth the invention, which ever comes from mee. For, I make others to relate (not after mine owne fantaſie, but as it beſt falleth out) what I can not ſo well expreſſe, either through vnskill of language, or want of judgement. I number not my borrowings, but I weigh them. And if I would have made their number to prevaile, I would have had twice as many. They are all, or almoſt all of ſo famous and ancient names, that me thinks they ſufficiently name themſelves without mee. If in reaſons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons and arguments, I tranſplant any into my ſoile, or confound them with mine owne, I purpoſely conceale the Authour, thereby to bridle the raſhneſſe of theſe haſtie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that are ſo headlong caſt vpon all manner of compoſitions, namely yoong writings, of men yet living; and in vulgare, that admitte all the worlde to talke of them, and which ſeemeth to convince the conception and publike deſigne alike. I will have them to give <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> a bobbe vpon mine owne lippes, and vex themſelves, in wronging <hi>Seneca</hi> in mee. My weakeneſſe muſt be hidden vnder ſuch great credites. I will love him that ſhall trace, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feather me; I meane through cleareneſſe of judgement, and by the onely diſtinction of the force and beautie of my Diſcourſes. For my ſelfe, who for want of memorie, am ever to ſeeke, how to trie and refine them, by the knowledge of their country, knowe perfectly, by meaſuring mine owne ſtrength, that my ſoyle is no way capable, of ſome over-pretious flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, that therin I find ſet, and that all the fruites of my encreaſe could not make it amendes. This am I bound to anſwer-for, if I hinder my ſelfe, if there be either vanitie, or fault in my Diſcourſes, that I perceive not or am not able to diſcerne, if they be ſhewed me. For, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults doe often eſcape our eyes; but the infirmitie of judgement conſiſteth in not being able to perceive them, when another diſcovereth them vnto vs. Knowledge and truth may be in vs without judgement, and we may have judgement without them: Yea, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of ignorance, is one of the beſt and ſureſt teſtimonies of judgement that I can finde. I have no other Sergeant of band to marſhall my rapſodies, than fortune. And looke how my humours or conceites preſent them-ſelves, ſo I ſhuffle them vp. Sometimes they preaſe out thicke and thee-folde, and other times they come out languiſhing one by one. I will have my naturall and ordinarie pace ſeene as looſe, and as ſhuffling as it is. As I am, ſo I goe on plodding. And beſides, theſe are matters, that a man may not be ignorant of, and raſhly and caſually to ſpeake of them. I would wiſh to have a more perfect vnderſtanding of things, but I will not purchaſe it ſo deare, as it coſt. My intention is to paſſe the remainder of my life quietly, and not laboriouſly, in reſt, and not in care. There is nothing I will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or vex my ſelfe about, no not for Science it ſelfe, what eſteeme ſoever it be-of. I doe not ſearch and toſſe over Books, but for an honeſter recreation to pleaſe, and paſtime to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſelfe: or if I ſtudie, I onely endevour to find out the knowledge that teacheth or handleth the knowledge of my ſelfe, and which may inſtruct me how to die well, and how to live well.</p>

with any earneſtnes, except it be at ſuch houres as I am idle, or that I am wearie with doing nothing. I am not greatly affected to new books, becauſe ancient Authors are in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more full and pithie: nor am I much addicted to Greeke books, foraſmuch as my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can well rid his worke with a childiſh and apprentiſe intelligence. Amongſt moderne bookes meerly pleaſant. I eſteeme <hi>Bocace</hi> his <hi>Decameron, Rabelais,</hi> and the kiſſes of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond (if they may be placed vnder this title) worth the paines-taking to reade them. As for <hi>Amadis</hi> and ſuch like traſh of writings, they had never the credit ſo much as to allure my youth to delight in them. This I will ſay more, either boldly or raſhly, that this old and heavie-paſed mind of mine, will no more be pleaſed with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or tickled with good <hi>Ovid:</hi> his facilitie, and quaint inventions, which heretofore have ſo raviſhed me, they can now adaies ſcarcely entertaine me. I ſpeake my minde freely of all things, yea of ſuch as peradventure exceede my ſufficiencie, and that no-way I hold to be of my juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What my conceit is of them, is alſo to manifeſt the proportion of my inſight, and not the meaſure of things. If at any time I find my ſelfe diſtaſted of <hi>Platoes Axiochus,</hi> as of a forceles worke, due regarde had to ſuch an Author, my judgement doth nothing beleeve it ſelfe: It is not ſo fond-hardy, or ſelfe-conceited, as it durſt dare to oppoſe it ſelfe againſt the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſo many other famous ancient judgements, which he reputeth his regents and maiſters, and with whome hee had rather erre. He chafeth with, and condemneth himſelfe, either to rely on the ſuperficiall ſenſe, being vnable to pierce into the centre, or to view the thing by ſome falce luſtre. He is pleaſed onely to warrant himſelfe from trouble and vnrulines: As for weaknes he acknowledgeth and ingeniouſly auoweth the ſame. He thinkes to give a juſt interpetation to the apparances which his conception preſents vnto him, but they are ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and imperfect. Moſt of <hi>Aeſopes</hi> fables have divers ſenſes, and ſeverall interpretations: Thoſe which <hi>Mythologize</hi> them, chuſe ſome kinde of color well-ſuting with the fable; but for the moſt part, it is no other then the firſt and ſuperficiall gloſſe: There are others more quicke, more ſinnowie, more eſſential and more internal, into which they could never pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate; and thus thinke I with them. But to follow my courſe; I have ever deemed that in Poeſie, <hi>Virgil, Lucretius, Catullus,</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> doe doubtles by far hold the firſt ranke: and eſpecially <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Georgiks,</hi> which I eſteeme to be the moſt accompliſhed piece of worke of Poeſie: In compariſon of which one may eaſily diſcerne, that there are ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the <hi>Aeneidos,</hi> to which the Author (had he lived) would no doubt have given ſome review or correction: The fift booke whereof is (in my mind) the moſt abſolutely perfect. I alſo love <hi>Lucan,</hi> and willingly read him, not ſo much for his ſtile, as for his owne worth, and truth of his opinion and judgement. As for good <hi>Terence,</hi> I allow the quaintnes and grace of his Latin tongue, and judge him wonderfull conceited and apt, lively to repreſent the motions and paſhions of the minde, and the condition of our manners: our actions make me often remember him. I can never reade him ſo often, but ſtill I diſcover ſome new grace and beautie in him. Thoſe that lived about <hi>Virgils</hi> time, complained that ſome would compare <hi>Lucretius</hi> vnto him. I am of opinion, that verily it is an vnequall compariſon; yet can I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſure my ſelfe in this opinion whenſoever I find my ſelfe entangled in ſome notable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Lucretius.</hi> If they were moved at this compariſon, what would they ſay now of the fond, hardie and barbarous ſtupiditie of thoſe which now adaies compare <hi>Arioſto</hi> vnto him? Nay what would <hi>Artoſto</hi> ſay of it himſelfe?</p>

                        <p>Loe-here then, concerning this kind of ſubjects, what Authors pleaſe me beſt: As for my other leſſon, which ſomewhat more mixeth profite with pleaſure, whereby I learne to range my opinions, and addreſſe my conditions; the Bookes that ſerve me thereunto, are <hi>Plutarke</hi> (ſince he ſpake French,) and <hi>Seneca;</hi> Both have this excellent commodity for my humour, that the knowledge I ſeeke in them, is there ſo ſcatteringly and looſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that whoſoever readeth them is not tied to plod long vpon them, whereof I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable. And ſo are <hi>Plutarkes</hi> little workes, and <hi>Senecaes</hi> Epiſtles; which are the beſt and moſt profitable partes of their writings. It is no great matter to draw mee to them, and I leave them where I liſt. For, they ſucceed not, and depend not one of another. Both jumpe and ſuite together, in moſt true and profitable opinions: And fortune brought them both into the world in one age. Both were Tutors vnto two Roman Emperours: Both were ſtrangers, and came from farre Countries; both rich and mighty in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and in credite with their maſters. Their inſtruction is the prime and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:12117:120"/>
creame of Philoſophie, and preſented with a plaine, vnaffected, and pertinent faſhion. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke</hi> is more vniforme and conſtant; <hi>Seneca</hi> more waving and diverſe. This doth labour, force, and extend himſelfe, to arme and ſtrengthen vertue againſt weakneſſe, feare, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſires; the other ſeemeth nothing ſo much to feare their force or attempt, and in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſcorneth to haſten or change his pace about them, and to put himſelfe vpon his guarde. <hi>Plutarkes</hi> opinions are Platonicall, gentle and accommodable vnto civill ſocietie: <hi>Senacaes</hi> Stoicall and Epicurian, further from common vſe, but in my conceit, more proper parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and more ſolide. It appeareth in <hi>Seneca,</hi> that he ſomewhat inclineth and yeeldeth to the tyrannie of the Emperors which were in his daies; for, I verily beleeve, it is with a forced judgement, he condemneth the cauſe of thoſe noblie-minded murtherers of <hi>Caeſar: Plutarke</hi> is every where free and open-hearted; <hi>Seneca,</hi> full-fraught with points and ſallies, <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſtuft with matters. The former doth moove and enflame you more; the latter, content, pleaſe, and pay you better: This doth guide you, the other drive you on. As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> of all his works, thoſe that treat of Philoſophie (namely morall) are they which beſt ſerve my turne, and ſquare with my intent. But boldly to confeſſe the trueth, (For, <hi>Since the bars of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie were broken downe, all curbing is taken away</hi>) his maner of writing ſeemeth verie tedious vnto me, as doth all ſuch-like ſtuffe. For, his prefaces, definitions, diviſions, and Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, conſume the greateſt part of his Works; whatſoever quicke, wittie, and pithie conceit is in him, is ſurcharged, and confounded by thoſe his long and far-fetcht preambles. If I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow but one houre in reading him, which is much for me; and let me call to minde what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or juice I have drawne from him, for the moſt part, I find nothing but winde &amp; oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in him: for he is not yet come to the arguments, which make for his purpoſe, and reaſons that properly concerne the knot or pith I ſeek-after. Theſe Logicall and Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ordinances are not availfull for me, who onely endevour to become more wiſe and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and not more wittie or eloquent. I would have one begin with the laſt point: I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſufficiently what death and voluptuouſneſſe are: let not a man buſie himſelfe to anatomize them. At the firſt reading of a Booke, I ſeeke for good and ſolide reaſons, that may inſtruct me how to ſuſtaine their aſſaults. It is nether gramaticall ſubtilties, nor logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call quiddities, nor the wittie contexture of choiſe words, or arguments, and ſyllogiſmes, that will ſerve my turne. I like thoſe diſcourſes that give the firſt charge to the ſtrongeſt, part of the doubt; his are but flouriſhes, and languiſh every where. They are good for Schooles, at the barre, or for Orators and Preachers, where we may ſlumber: and though we wake a quarter of an houre after, we may find and trace him ſoone enough. Such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech is fit for thoſe Iudges, that a man would corrupt by hooke or crooke, by right or wrong, or for children and the common people, vnto whom a man muſt tell all, and ſee what the event will be. I would not have a man go about, and labour by circumlocutions, to induce and win me to attention, and that (as our Herolds or Criers do) they ſhall ring out their words.

Shall the priviledge of times excuſe me from this ſacrilegious boldneſſe, to deeme <hi>Platoes</hi> Dialogiſmes to be as languiſhing, by over-filling and ſtuffing his matter? And to bewaile the time that a man, who had ſo many thouſands of things to vtter, ſpends about ſo many, ſo long, ſo vaine, and idle interloquutions, and preparatives?

I likewiſe love to read the Epiſtles and <hi>ad Atticum,</hi> not onely becauſe they containe a moſt ample inſtruction of the Hiſtorie, and affaires of his times, but much more becauſe in them I deſcrie his private humours. For, (as I have ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where (I am wonderfull curious, to diſcover and know, the minde, the ſoule, the genuine diſpoſition, and naturall judgement of my Authors.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12117:121"/>
forth on this worlds Theatre. I have ſorrowed a thouſand times, that ever we loſt the booke, that <hi>Brutus</hi> writ of Virtue. <hi>Oh it is a goodly thing to learne the Theorike of ſuch as vnderſtand the practiſe well.</hi> But forſomuch as the Sermon is one thing, and the Preacher an other: I love as much to ſee <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Plutarke,</hi> as in himſelfe, I would rather make choiſe to know certainly, what talke he had in his Tent with ſome of his familiar friends, the night fore-going the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, then the ſpeach he made the morrow after to his Armie: and what he did in his chamber or cloſet, then what in the Senate or market place. As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> I am of the common judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that beſides learning, there was no exquiſite excellencie in him: He was a good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, of an honeſt-gentle nature, as are commonly fat and burly men; for ſo was he: But to ſpeake truely of him, full of ambitious vanitie and remiſſe niceneſſe. And I know not well how to excuſe him, in that he deemed his Poeſie worthy to be publiſhed. It is no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, to make bad verſes, but it is an imperfection in him, that he never perceived how vnworthy they were of the glorie of his name. Concerning his eloquence, it is beyond all compariſon, and I verily beleeve, that none ſhall ever equall it. <hi>Cicero</hi> the yoonger, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his father in nothing, but in name, commaunding in <hi>Aſia,</hi> chanced one day to have many ſtrangers at his board, and amongſt others, one <hi>Castius</hi> ſitting at the lower end, as the maner is to thruſt-in at great mens tables: <hi>Cicero</hi> inquired of one of his men what he was, who told him his name, but he dreaming on other matters, and having forgotten what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere his man made him, asked him his name twice or thrice more: the ſervant, becauſe he would not be troubled to tell him one thing ſo often, and by ſome circumſtance make him to know him better. It is, ſaid he, the ſame <hi>Castius,</hi> to whom ſome have told you, that in reſpect of his owne, maketh no accompt of your fathers eloquence: <hi>Cicero</hi> being ſuddainly, mooved, commaunded the ſaid poore <hi>Castius,</hi> to be preſently taken from the table, and well whipt in his preſence: Lo-heere an vncivill and barbarous hoſt. Even amongſt thoſe, which (all things conſidered) have deemed his eloquence matchleſſe and incomparable others there have been, who have not ſpared to note ſome faults in it: As great <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaid, that it was an eloquence, broken, halting, and disjoynted, <hi>fractam &amp; elumbem: Incoherent and ſinnowleſſe.</hi> Thoſe Orators that lived about his age, reprooved alſo in him the curious care he had of a certaine long cadence, at the end of his clauſes, and noted theſe words, <hi>Eſſe videatur,</hi> which he ſo often vſeth. As for me, I rather like a cadence that falleth ſhorter, cut like I am bikes: yet doth he ſometimes confound his numbers; but it is ſeldome: I have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially obſerved this one place. <hi>Ego verò me minus diu ſenem eſſe mallem, quàm eſſe ſeuem,</hi>

Verily I read that Author with a little more reverence and reſpect, than commonly men reade profane and humane Workes: ſometimes conſidering him by his actions, and wonders of his greatneſſe, and other times waighing the puritie and inimitable poliſhing and elegancie of his tongue, which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) hath not onely exceeded all Hiſtorians, but happly <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelfe: with ſuch ſinceritie in his judgement. Speaking of his enemies, that except the falſe colours, wherewith he goeth about to cloake his bad cauſe, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and filthineſſe of his peſtilent ambition. I am perſwaded there is nothing in him to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12117:121"/>
be found fault-with: and that he hath been over-ſparing to ſpeake of himſelfe: for, ſo many notable and great things could never be executed by him, vnleſſe he had put more of his owne vnto them, than he ſetteth downe. I love thoſe Hiſtorians that are either verie ſimple, or moſt excellent. The ſimple who have nothing of their owne to adde vnto the ſtorie, and have but the care and diligence to collect whatſoever come vnto their knowledge, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and faithfully to regiſter all things, without choice or culling, by the naked truth leave our judgement more entire, and better ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>Such amongſt others (for example ſake) plaine and well-meaning Froiſard, who in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prize, hath marched with ſo free and genuine a puritie, that having committed ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight; he is neither aſhamed to acknowledge, nor afraide to correct the ſame, whereſoever he hath either notice or warning of it: and who repreſenteth vnto vs the diverſitie of the newes then currant, and the different reports, that were made vnto him. The ſubject of an hiſtorie ſhould be naked, bare, and formeleſſe; each man according to his capacitie or vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may reap commoditie out of it. The curious and moſt excellent have the ſufficiencie to cull and chuſe that, which is worthie to be knowne, and may ſelect of two relations, that which is moſt likely: of the condition of Princes, and of their humors, therby they conclude their counſels, and attribute convenient words vnto them: they have reaſon to aſſume au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnto them, to direct and ſhapen our beliefe vnto theirs. But truely that belongs not to many. Such as are betweene both (which is the moſt common faſhion) it is they that ſpoile all; they will needs chew our meat for vs, and take vpon them a law to judge, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſquare and encline the ſtorie according to their fantaſie; for, where the judgement bendeth one way, a man cannot chuſe but wreſt and turne his narration that way. They vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to chuſe things worthy to be knowne, and now and then conceal either a word, or a ſecret action from vs, which would much better inſtruct vs: omitting ſuch things as they vnderſtand not, as incredible: and happily ſuch matters, as they know not how to declare, either in good Latin, or tollerable French. Let them boldly enſtall their eloquence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: Let them cenſure at their pleaſure, but let them alſo give vs leave to judge after them: And let them neither alter nor diſpence by their abridgements and choiſe, any thing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the ſubſtance of the matter; but let them rather ſend it pure and entire with all hir dimenſions vnto vs. Moſt commonly (as chiefly in our age) this charge of writing hiſtories is committed vnto baſe, ignorant, and mechanicall kind of people, only for this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they can ſpeak well; as if we ſought to learne the Grammer of them; and they have ſome reaſon, being only hyred to that end, and publiſhing nothing but their tittle-tattle to aime at nothing elſe ſo much. Thus with ſtore of choiſe and quaint words, and wyre-drawne phraſes they huddle vp, and make a hodge-pot of a laboured contexture of the reports, which they gather in the market-places, or ſuch other aſſemblies. <hi>The only good hiſtories are thoſe that are written by ſuch as commanded, or were imploid themſelves in weighty affaires, or that were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the conduct of them, or that at leaſt have had the fortune to manage others of like qualitie.</hi> Such in a maner are all the Graecians and Romans. For, many eye-witneſſes hauing written of one ſame ſubject (as it hapned in thoſe times, when Greatneſſe and Knowledge did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly meet) if any fault or over-ſight have paſt them, it muſt be deemed exceeding light, and vpon ſome doubtfull accident. <hi>What may a man expect at a Phiſitions hand, that diſcourſeth of warre, or of a bare Scholler, treating of Princes ſecret deſignes?</hi> If we ſhall but note the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Romans had in that, we need no other example: <hi>Aſinius Polio</hi> found ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking or overſight in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries, whereinto he was falne, only becauſe he could not poſſiblie overſee all things with his owne eyes, that hapned in his Armie, but was faine to relie on the reports of particular men, who often related vntruths vnto him; or elſe becauſe he had not been curiouſly advertiſed, and diſtinctly enformed by his Lieutenants and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, of ſuch matters as they in his abſence had managed or effected. Whereby may be ſeen, that <hi>nothing is ſo hard, or ſo vncertaine to be found-out, as the certaintie of a Truth,</hi> ſithence no man can put any aſſured confidence concerning the truth of a battel, neither in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, that was Generall, or commanded over it, nor in the ſoldiers that fought, of any thing, that hath hapned amongſt them; except after the maner of a ſtrict point of law, the ſeverall witneſſes are brought and examined face to face, and that all matters be nicely and thorowly ſifted by the objects and trials of the ſucceſſe of every accident. Verily the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of our own affaires is much more barren and feeble. But this hath ſufficiently
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:12117:122"/>
been handled by <hi>Bodine,</hi> and agreeing with my conception. Somewhat to aide the weakneſſe of my memorie, and to aſſiſt her great defects; for it hath often been my chance to light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bookes, which I ſuppoſed to be new, and never to have read, which I had not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diligently read and run-over many yeares before, and all beſcribled with my notes: I have a while ſince accuſtomed my ſelfe, to note at the end of my booke (I meane ſuch as I purpoſe to read but once) the time I made an end to read it, and to ſet downe what cenſure or judgement I gave of it; that ſo, it may at leaſt, at another time repreſent vnto my mind, the aire and generall Idea, I had conceived of the Author in reading him. I will here ſet downe the Coppie of ſome of mine annotations, and eſpecially what I noted vpon my <hi>Guicciardine</hi> about ten yeares ſince: (For what language ſoever my bookes ſpeake vnto me, I ſpeake vnto them in mine owne.) He is a diligent Hiſtoriographer, and from whom in my conceit, a man may as exactly learne the truth of ſuch affaires as paſſed in his time, as of any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoever: and the rather becauſe himſelfe hath been an Actor of moſt part of them, and in verie honourable place. There is no ſigne or apparance, that ever he diſguiſed or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured any matter, either through hatred, malice, favour, or vanitie; whereof the free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parciall judgements he giveth of great men, and namely of thoſe by whom he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced or imployed in his important charges, as of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeaventh, beareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted teſtimonie. Concerning the parts wherewith he moſt goeth about to prevaile, which are his digreſſions and diſcourſes, many of them are verie excellent, and enriched with faire ornaments, but he hath too much pleaſed himſelfe in them: for, endevouring to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might be ſpoken, having ſo full and large a ſubject, and almoſt infinite, he proveth ſomewhat languiſhing, and giveth a taſte of a kind of ſcholaſticall tedious babling. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I have noted this, that of ſo ſeverall and divers armes, ſucceſſes, and effects he judgeth of; of ſo many and variable motives, alterations, and counſels, that he relateth, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth any one vnto vertue, religion, or conſcience: as if they were all extinguiſhed and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the world: and of all actions, how glorious ſoever in apparance they be of themſelves, he doth ever impute the cauſe of them, to ſome vicious and blame-worthie occaſion, or to ſome commoditie and profit. It is impoſſible to imagine, that amongſt ſo infinite a number of actions, whereof he judgeth, ſome one have not been produced and compaſſed by way of reaſon. No corruption could ever poſſeſſe men ſo vniverſally, but that ſome one muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity eſcape the contagion; which makes me to feare, he hath had ſome diſtaſte or blame in his paſſion, and it hath haply fortuned, that he hath judged or eſteemed of others according to himſelfe. In my <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> there is this: In him you ſhall find a pleaſing-ſweet, and gently-gliding ſpeach, fraught with a purely-ſincere ſimplicitie, his narration pure and vnaffected, and wherein the Authours vnſpotted-good meaning doth evidently appeare, void of all maner of vanitie or oſtentation ſpeaking of himſelfe, and free from all affection or envie ſpeaking of others: his diſcourſes and perſwaſions, accompanied more with a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning zeale, and meere veritie, then with any laboured and exquiſit ſufficiencie, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through, with gravitie and authoritie, repreſenting a man well-borne, and brought vp in high negotiations. Vpon the memories and hiſtorie of Monſieur du <hi>Bellay:</hi> It is ever a well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thing, to ſee matters writen by thoſe, that have aſſaide how, &amp; in what maner they ought to be directed and managed: yet can it not be denied, but that in both theſe Lords, there will manifeſtly appeare a great declination from a free libertie of writing, which clearely ſhineth in ancient writers of their kind: as in the Lord of <hi>Ionuille,</hi> familiar vnto Saint <hi>Lewis, Eginard,</hi> Chancellor vnto <hi>Charlemaine;</hi> and of more freſh memorie in <hi>Philip de Comines.</hi> This is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a declamation or pleading for king <hi>Francis</hi> againſt the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, then an Hiſtorie. I will not believe, they have altered or changed any thing concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of matters, but rather to wreſt and turne the judgement of the events, many times againſt reaſon, to our advantage, and to omit whatſoever they ſuppoſed, to be doubtfull or tickliſh in their maſters life: they have made profeſſion of it witneſſe the recoylings of the Lords of <hi>Momorancy</hi> and <hi>Byron,</hi> which therein are forgotten; and which is more, you ſhall not ſo much as find the name of the Ladie of Eſtampes mentioned at all. A man may ſometimes colour, and happily hide ſecret actions, but abſolutely to conceal that, which all the world knoweth, and eſpecially ſuch things as have drawne-on publike effects, and of ſuch conſequence, it is an inexcuſable defect, or as I may ſay vnpardonable overſight. To conclude, whoſoever deſireth to have perfect information and knowledge of King <hi>Fraucis</hi>

                        <p>ME thinks vertue is another manner of thing, and much more noble than the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto goodneſſe, which in vs are ingendered. Mindes well borne, and directed by themſelves, follow one ſame path, and in their actions repreſent the ſame viſage, that the vertuous doe. But vertue importeth, and ſoundeth ſomewhat I wot not what greater and more active, then by an happy complexion, gently and peaceably, to ſuffer it ſelfe to be led or drawne, to follow reaſon. He that through a naturall facilitie, and genuine mildneſſe, ſhould neglect or contemne injuries received, ſhould no doubt performe a rare action, and worthy commendation: But he who being toucht and ſtung to the quicke, with any wrong or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence received, ſhould arme himſelfe with reaſon againſt this furiouſly-blind deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and in the end after a great conflict, yeeld himſelfe maſter over-it, ſhould doubtleſſe doe much more. The firſt ſhould doe well, the other vertuouſly: the one action might be termed goodneſſe, the other vertue. For, <hi>It ſeemeth, that the verie name of vertue preſuppoſeth difficultie, and inferreth reſiſtance, and cannot well exerciſe it ſelfe without an enemie.</hi> It is perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the reaſon why we call God good, mightie, liberall, and juſt, but we terme him not vertuous. His workes are all voluntarie, vnforced, and without compulſion. Of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, not onely Stoicks, but alſo Epicurians (which endearing I borrow of the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, which is falſe) whatſoever the nimble ſaying or wittie quipping of <hi>Arſeſilaus</hi> implieth, who anſwered the man that vpbraided him, how divers men went from his ſchoole to the Epicurian, but none came from thence to him: I eaſily beleeve-it (ſaid he) for, <hi>Of cocks are many capons made, but no man could ever yet make a cocke of a capon.</hi> For truly, in conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and rigor of opinions, and ſtrictneſſe of precepts, the Epicurian Sect doth in no ſort yeeld to the Stoicke.

and is a continuall fighting at the ſharpe. <hi>Metellus</hi> of all the Romane Senators (he onely having vndertaken with the power of vertue, to endure the violence of <hi>Saturninus Tribune</hi> of the people in <hi>Rome,</hi> who by maine force went about, to have a moſt vnjuſt law paſſe in favor of the Communaltie: by which oppoſition, having incurred all the capital paines, that <hi>Saturninus</hi> had impoſed on ſuch as ſhould refuſe it) intertained thoſe that led him to the place of execution, with ſuch ſpeeches: That <hi>to doe evill was a thing verie eaſie, and too demiſſely baſe: and to doe well where was no danger, was a common thing; but to doe well, where was both perill and oppoſition, was the peculiar office of a man of vertue.</hi> Theſe words of <hi>Metellus</hi> doe clearely repreſent vnto vs, what I would have verified; which is, that <hi>vertue reiecteth facilitie to be hir companion:</hi> And that an eaſefull, pleaſant, and declining way, by which the regular ſteps of a good inclination of nature, are directed, is not the way of true vertue. She requireth a craggie, rough, and thornie way; She would either have ſtrange difficulties to wreſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (as that of <hi>Metellus</hi>) by whoſe meanes fortune hir ſelfe is pleaſed to breake the roughneſſe of his courſe; or inward encombrances, as the diſordinate appetites and imperfections of our condition bring vnto hir. Hitherto I have come at good eaſe; but at the end of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, one thing commeth into my minde, which is, that the ſoule of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute the perfecteſt that ever came to my knowledge, would, according to my accompt, prove a ſoule deſerving but little commendation: For, I can perceive no maner of violence or vicious concupiſence in him: I can imagine no maner of difficultie or compulſion in the whole courſe of his vertue. I know his reaſon ſo powerfull, and ſo abſolute miſtreſſe over him, that ſhe can never give him way to any vicious deſire, and will not ſuffer it ſo much as to breed in him. To a vertue ſo exquiſit, and ſo high-raiſed as his is, I can perſwade nothing. Me thinkes I ſee it march with a victorious and triumphant pace, in pompe, and at eaſe, without let or diſturbance. If vertue cannot ſhine but by reſiſting contrarie appetites, ſhall we then ſay, it cannot paſſe without the aſſiſtance of vice, and oweth him this, that by his meanes it attaineth to honour and credit? What ſhould alſo betide of that glorious and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Epicurian voluptuouſneſſe, that makes accompt, effeminately to pamper vertue in hir lap, and there wantonly to entertaine it, allowing it for hir recreation, ſhame, reproch, agues, povertie, death, and tortures? If I preſuppoſe, that perfect vertue is knowne by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating ſorrow, and patiently vnder-going paine, by tollerating the fits and agonies of the gout, without ſtirring out of his place; if for a neceſſarie object, I appoint hir ſharpneſſe and difficultie; what ſhall become of that vertue, which hath attained ſo high a degree, as it doth not onely deſpiſe all maner of paine, but rather rejoyceth at-it, and when a ſtrong fit of the collike ſhall aſſaile-it, to cauſe it ſelfe to be tickled; as that is, which the Epicurians have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and whereof divers amongſt them, have by their actions left moſt certaine proofes vnto-vs? As alſo others have, whom in effect I finde to have exceeded the verie rules of their diſcipline; witneſſe <hi>Cato</hi> the yonger; when I ſee him die, tearing and mangling his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails; I cannot ſimply content my ſelfe to beleeve, that at that time, he had his ſoule wholy exempted from all trouble, or free from vexation: I cannot imagine, he did onely maintaine himſelfe in this march or courſe, which the rules of the Stoike ſect had ordained vnto him, ſetled, without ſome alteration or motion, and impaſſibilitie. There was, in my conceit, in this mans vertue overmuch cheerefulneſſe, and youthfulneſſe to ſtay there. I verily beleeve, he felt a kind of pleaſure and ſenſualitie in ſo noble an action, and that therein he more pleaſed himſelfe, then in any other, he ever performed in his life. <hi>Sic abijt è vita, vt cauſam moriendi</hi>

And which of thoſe, that have their ſpirites touched, be it-never ſo little, with the true tincture of Philoſophie, can content himſelfe to imagine <hi>Socrates,</hi> onely, free from feare and paſſion, in the accident of his impriſonment, of his fetters, and of his condemnation? And who doth not perceive in him, not onely conſtancie and reſolution (which were ever his ordinarie qualities) but alſo a kinde of I wot not what new contentment, and careleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in his laſt behaviour, and diſcourſes? By the ſtartling at the pleaſure, which he feeleth in clawing of his legges, after his fetters were taken-off; doth he not manifeſtly declare an equall glee and joy in his ſoule, for being rid of his former incommodities, and entring into the knowledge of things to come? <hi>Cato</hi> ſhall pardon me (if he pleaſe) his death is more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, and further extended, whereas this in a certaine manner is more faire and glorious. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> anſwered thoſe, that bewailed the ſame; when I die, I pray the Gods ſend me ſuch a death. A man ſhall plainly perceive in the minds of theſe two men, and of ſuch as imitate them (for I make a queſtion whether ever they could be matched) ſo perfect an habitude vnto vertue, that it was even converted into their complexion. It is no longer a painfull vertue, nor by the ordinances of reaſon, for the maintaining of which, their minde muſt be ſtrengthned: It is the verie eſſence of their ſoule; it is hir naturall and ordinarie habite. They have made it ſuch, by a long exerciſe and obſerving the rules and precepts of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, having lighted vpon a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The vigor and conſtancie of their ſoules, doth ſuppreſſe and extinguiſh all manner of concupiſences, ſo ſoone as they but begin to move. Now that it be not more glorious, by an vndaunted and divine reſolution, to hinder the growth of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; for a man to frame himſelfe to vertue, ſo that the verie ſeeds of vice be cleane rooted out; then by maine force to hinder their progreſſe; and having ſuffred himſelfe to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by the firſt aſſaults of paſſions, to arme and bandie himſelfe, to ſtay their courſe and to ſuppreſſe them: And that this ſecond effect be not alſo much fairer, then to be ſimply ſtored with a facile and gentle nature, and of it ſelfe diſtaſted and in diſlike with licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vice, I am perſwaded there is no doubt. For, this third and laſt manner, ſeemeth in ſome ſort, to make a man innocent, but not vertuous: free from doing ill, but not ſufficiently apt to doe well. Seeing this condition is ſo neere vnto imperfection and weakneſſe, that I know not well how to cleare their confines and diſtinctions. The verie names of goodneſſe and innocencie, are for this reſpect in ſome ſort names of contempt. I ſee that many vertues, as chaſtitie, ſobrietie, and temperance, may come vnto vs by meanes of corporall defects and imbecilitie. Conſtancie in dangers (if it may be termed conſtancie) contempt of death, patiencie in misfortunes, may happen, and are often ſeen in men, for want of good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch accidents, and that they are not apprehended for ſuch as they are indeed. <hi>Lacke of apprehenſion and ſtupiditie, doe ſometimes counterfet vertuous effects.</hi> As I have often ſeen come to paſſe, that ſome men are commended, for things they rather deſerve to be blamed. An Italian gentleman did once hold this poſition in my preſence, to the prejudice &amp; diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his nation; That the ſubtiltie of the Italians, and the vivacitie of their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12117:124"/>
was ſo great, that they foreſaw ſuch dangers and accidents as might betide them ſo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off, that it was not to be deemed ſtrange, if in times of warre, they were often ſeene to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their ſafetie, yea, before they had perceived the danger: That we and the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who were not ſo warie and ſubtill, went further; and that before we could be frighted with any perill, we muſt be induced to ſee it with our eyes, and feel it with our hands, and that even then we had no more hold: But that the Germanes and Switzers, more ſhallow and leaden-headed, had ſcarce the ſenſe and wit to re-adviſe themſelves, at what time they were even overwhelmed with miſerie, and the axe readie to fall on their heades. It was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure but in jeſt, that he ſpake-it, yet is it moſt true, that in the arte of warre-fare, new trained Souldiers, and ſuch as are but novices in the trade, doe often headlong, and hand over head caſt themſelves into dangers, with more inconſideration, then afterward when they have ſeene and endured the firſt ſhocke, and are better trained in the ſchoole of perils.</p>

As for the reſt, I am ſo far from attaining vnto that chiefe and moſt perfect degree of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, where a habitude is made of vertue, that even of the ſecond, I have made no great triall. I have not greatly ſtrived to bridle the deſires, wherewith I have found my ſelfe vrged and preſſed. My vertue, is a vertue, or to ſay better innocencie, accidentall and caſuall. Had I been borne with a leſſe regular complexion, I imagine my ſtate had been verie pittyfull, and it would have gon hard with me: for, I could never perceive any great conſtancie in my ſoule, to reſiſt and vndergoe paſſions, had they been any thing violent. I cannot foſter quarels, or endure contentions in my houſe. So am I not greatly beholding vnto my ſelfe, in that I am exempted from many vices:</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:12117:124"/>
the ſame: No, not mine owne diſcourſes, which becauſe they have been ſomewhat laviſh in noting or taxing ſomething of the common courſe, could eaſily induce me to ſome actions, which this my naturall inclination makes me to hate. I will tell you a wonder, I will tell it you indeed: I thereby find in many things, more ſtay and order in my maners, then in my opinion: and my concupiſcence leſſe debauched, then my reaſon. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> eſtabliſhed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine opinions ſo bold, in favour of voluptuouſneſſe &amp; riches, that he made all Philoſophie to mutinie againſt him. But concerning his maners, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant, having preſented him with three faire yong Wenches, that he might chuſe the faireſt; he anſwered he would chuſe them all three, and that <hi>Paris</hi> had verie ill ſucceſſe, forſomuch as he had preferred one above hir fellowes. But they being brought to his owne houſe, he ſent them backe againe, without taſting them. His ſervant one day carrying ſtore of money after him, and being ſo over-charged with the weight of it, that he complained, his Maſter commanded him, to caſt ſo much thereof away, as troubled him. And <hi>Epicurus,</hi> whoſe poſitions are irreligious and delicate, demeaned himſelfe in his life verie laboriouſly, and devoutly. He wrote to a friend of his, that he lived but with browne bread and water, and entreated him to ſend him a piece of cheefe, againſt the time he was to make a ſolemne feaſt. May it be true, that to be perfectly good, we muſt be ſo by an hidden, naturall, and vniverſall proprietie, without law, reaſon, and example? The diſorders and exceſſes, wherein I have found my ſelfe engaged, are not (God be thanked) of the worſt. I have rejected and condemned them in my ſelfe, according to their worth; for, my judgement was never found to be infected by them. And on the other ſide, I accuſe them more rigorouſly in my ſelfe, then in an other. But that is all: as for the reſt, I applie but little reſiſtance vnto them, and ſuffer my ſelfe over-eaſily to encline to the other ſide of the Ballance, except it be to order and empeach them from being commixt with others, which (if a man take not good heed vnto himſelfe) for the moſt part entertaine and enterchaine themſelves the one with the other. As for mine, I have as much as it hath laine in my power, abridged them, and kept them as ſingle, and as alone as I could:</p>

                        <p>For, as touching the Stoickes opinion, who ſay, that when the wiſe man worketh, he worketh with all his vertues together; howbeit, according to the nature of the action, there be one more apparant than others (to which purpoſe the ſimilitude of mans bodie might, in ſome ſort, ſerve their turne; for, the action of choller cannot exerciſe it ſelfe, except all the humours ſet-to their helping-hand, although choller be praedominant) if thence they will draw alike conſequence, that when the offender treſpaſſeth, he doth it with all the vices together. I doe not ſo eaſily beleeve them, or elſe I vnderſtand them not; for, in effect, I feel the contrarie. They are ſharpe-wittie ſubtilties, and without ſubſtance, about which Philoſophie doth often buſie it ſelfe. Some vices I ſhun; but otherſome I eſchew as much as any Saint can doe. The Peripatetikes doe alſo diſavow this connexitie, and indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knitting together. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> is of opinion, <hi>That a wiſe and iust man may be both intemperate and incontinent. Socrates</hi> avowed vnto them, who in his Phiſiognomie percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome inclination vnto vice, that indeed it was his naturall propenſion, but that by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline he had corrected the ſame. And the familiar friends of the Philoſopher <hi>Stilpo</hi> were wont to ſay, that being borne ſubject vnto wine and women, he had, by ſtudie, brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to abſtaine from both. On the otherſide, what good I have, I have it by the lot of my birth: I have it neither by law nor preſcription, nor by any apprentiſhip. The innocencie that is in me, is a kinde of ſimple-plaine innocencie, without vigor or arte. Amongſt all other vices, there is none I hate more, then crueltie, both by nature and judgement, as the extreameſt of all vices. But it is with ſuch an yearning and faint-hartedneſſe, that if I ſee but a chickins necke puld off, or a pigge ſtickt, I cannot chuſe but grieve, and I cannot well endure a ſeelie dew-bedabled hare to groane, when ſhe is ſeized vpon by the boundes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hunting be a violent ſport. Thoſe that are to withſtand voluptuouſneſſe, doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly vſe this argument, to ſhew, it is altogether vicious and vnreaſonable: That where ſhe is in her greateſt prime and chiefe ſtrength, ſhe doth ſo over-ſway vs, that reaſon can have no acceſſe vnto vs, and for a further triall, alleage the experience we feel and have

Yet doe I much waile and moane the dying.

Some one going about to witneſſe the clemencie of <hi>Iulius Caeſar;</hi> He was (ſaith he) tractable &amp; milde in matters of revenge. Having compelled the Pirates to yeeld themſelves vnto him, who had before taken him priſoner, and put him to ranſome, foraſmuch as he had threatned to have them all crucified, he condemned them to that kind of death, but it was after he had cauſed them to be ſtrangled. <hi>Philomon</hi> his ſecretarie, who would have poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, had no ſharper puniſhment of him, then an ordinarie death. Without mencioning the Latin Author, who for a teſtimonie of clemencie dareth to alleage, the onely killing of thoſe, by whom a man hath been offended, it may eaſily be gheſſed, that he is tainted with vile and horrible examples of crueltie, ſuch as Romane Tyrants brought into faſhion. As for me, even in matters of juſtice, <hi>Whatſoever is beyond a ſimple death, I deeme it to be meere crueltie:</hi> And eſpecially amongſt vs, who ought to have a regardfull reſpect, that their ſoules ſhould be ſent to heaven, which cannot be, having firſt by intollerable tortures agitated, and as it were brought them to diſpaire.

Shortly after, one of his keepers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-in vnto him, and yet living, finding him in that miſerable plight, but weltring in his goare-blood, and readie to gaſpe his laſt, told the Magiſtrates of it, which, to prevent time before he ſhould die, haſtned to pronounce ſentence againſt him: which when he heard, and that he was onely condemned to have his head cut-off, he ſeemed to take heart of grace againe, and to be ſorie for what he had done, and tooke ſome comfortable drinks, which before he had refuſed, greatly thanking the Iudges for his vnhoped gentle condemnation: And told them, that for feare of a more ſharply-cruell, and intollerable death by law, he had reſolved to prevent-it by ſome violent manner of death, having by the preparations he had ſeen the Carpenters make, and by gathering of people together, conceived an opinion, that they would torture him with ſome horrible torment, and ſeemed to be delivered from death, onely by the change of it.

                        <p>It was my fortune to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon a day that one <hi>Catena,</hi> a notorious high-way theeſe, was executed: at his ſtrangling no man of the companie ſeemed to be mooved to any ruth; but when he came to be quartered, the Executioner gave no blow that was not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a pitteous voyce, and hartie exclamation, as if every man had had a feeling ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie, or lent his ſenſes to the poore mangled wretch. Such inhumane outrages and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous exceſſes ſhould be exerciſed againſt the rinde, and not practiſed againſt the quicke. In a caſe ſomewhat like vnto this, did <hi>Artaxerces</hi> aſſwage and mittigate the ſharpneſſe of the ancient lawes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> appointing that the Lords, which had treſpaſſed in their eſtate, whereas they were wont to be whipped, they ſhould be ſtripped naked, and their clothes whipped for them: and where they were accuſtomed to have their haire pulled-off, they ſhould onely have their hat taken off. The Aegyptians ſo devout and religious, thought they did ſufficiently ſatiſfie divine Iuſtice, in ſacrificing painted and counterfait hogges vnto it: An over-hardy invention, to go about with pictures &amp; ſhadowes to appeaſe God, a ſubſtance ſo eſſentiall and divine. I live in an age, wherein we abound with incredible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this vice, through the licentiouſneſſe of our civill and inteſtine warres: And read all ancient ſtories, be they never ſo tragicall, you ſhall find none to equall thoſe, we daily ſee practiſed. But that hath nothing made me acquainted with it. I could hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, before I had ſeene it, that the world could have afforded ſo marble-hearted and ſavage-minded men, that for the onely pleaſure of murther would commit-it; then cut, mangle, and hacke other members in pieces: to rouze and ſharpen their wits, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent vnuſed tortures and vnheard-of torments; to deviſe new and vnknowne deathes, and that in cold blood, without any former enmitie or quarrell, or without any gaine or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite; and onely to this end, that they may enjoy the pleaſing ſpectacle of the languiſhing geſtures, pittifull motions, horror-moving yellings, deep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fetcht groanes, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyces of a dying and drooping man. For, that is the extreameſt point whereunto the crueltie of man may attaine. <hi>

                        <p>And the very ſame interpretation, that <hi>Plutarke</hi> giveth vnto this error, which is very well taken, is alſo honorable for them. For, he ſaith, that (for example-ſake,) it was neither the Cat nor the oxe, that the Egyptians adored; but that in thoſe beaſts, they worſhipped ſome image of divine faculties. In this patience and vtility, and in that, vivacity, or (as our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Borgonians with all <hi>Germany</hi>) the impatience to ſee themſelves ſhut-vp: Whereby they repreſented the liberty, which they loved and adored, beyond all other divine facultie, and ſo of others. But when amongſt the moſt moderate opinions, I meete with ſome diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that goe about and labour to ſhew, the neere reſemblance betweene vs and beaſtes, and what ſhare they have in our greateſt Priviledges, and with how much likely-hood they are compared vnto vs, truely I abate much of our preſumption, and am eaſily removed from that imaginary Soveraigntie, that ſome give and aſcribe vnto vs aboue all other creatures. If all that were to be contradicted, yet is there a kind of reſpect, and a general duty of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which tieth vs, not only vnto brute beaſts that have life and ſenſe, but even vnto trees and plants. <hi>Vnto men we owe Iustice, and to all other creatures, that are capable of it, grace and benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> There is a kinde of enter-changeable commerce and mutuall bond between them and vs. I am not aſhamed nor affraide to declare the tenderneſſe of my childiſh Nature, which is ſuch, that I cannot well reject my Dog, if he chance (although out of ſeaſon) to fawne vpon me, or begge of mee to play with him. The Turkes have almes, and certaine Hoſpitalls appoynted for brute beaſts. The Romans had a publike care to breed and nouriſh Geeſe, by whoſe vigilancy their Capitoll had beene ſaved. The Athenians did precizely ordaine, that all maner of Mules, which had ſerved or beene emploied about the building of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called <hi>Hecatompedon,</hi> ſhould be free, and ſuffered to feede whereſoever they pleaſed, without any let or empeachment. The Agrigentines had an ordinary cuſtome, ſeriouſly and ſolemnly to bury all ſuch beaſts, as they had held deare; as horſes of rare worth and merit, ſpeciall dogs, choiſe or profitable birds, or ſuch as had but ſerved to make their children ſport. And the ſumptuous magnificence, which in all other things was ordinary and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto them, appeared alſo almoſt notably in the ſtately ſumptuouſneſſe, and coſtly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of monuments erected to that end, which many ages after have endured and been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in pride and ſtate. The Aegyptians were wont to bury their Woolues, their Dogges, their Cats, their Beares, and Crocodiles in holy places, embalming their carcaſſes, and at their deaths to were mourning weedes for them. <hi>Cymon</hi> cauſed a ſtately-honourable toombe to be errected for the Mares, wherewith he had three times gained the prize at running in the Olimpike games. Ancient <hi>Xantippus</hi> cauſed his Dogge to be enterred vpon a hill by the ſea ſhoare, which ever ſince hath beene named by him. And <hi>Plutarke</hi> (as himſelfe ſaith) made it a matter of conſcience, in hope of a ſmall gaine, to ſell or ſend an Oxe to the ſhambles, that had ſerved him a long time.</p>

My houſe hath long ſince ever ſtood open to men of vnderſtanding, and is very well knowne to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: for, my father, who commanded the ſame fifty yeeres and vpward, ſet on fire by that new kind of earneſtneſſe, wherewith King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt embraced Letters, and raiſed them vnto credite, did with great diligence, and much coſt, endevour to purchaſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of learned men: receiving and entertaining them as holy perſons, and who had ſome particular inſpiration of divine wiſedome; collecting their ſentences and diſcourſes, as if they had beene Oracles; and with ſo much more reverence and religious regard, by how much leſſe authority he had to judge of them: for, he had no knowledge of Letters, no more than his predeceſſors before him. As for me, I love them indeed, but yet I worſhip them not. Amongſt others, <hi>Peter Bunel</hi> (a man in his time, by reaſon of his learning, of high eſteeme) having ſo journed a few daies at <hi>Montagne</hi> with my father, and others of his coate, being ready to depart thence, preſented him with a booke entituled <hi>Theologia naturalis; five liber creatur arum magistri Raimondi de Scbonda.</hi> And for ſomuch as the Italian and Spaniſh tongues were very familiar vnto him, and that the booke was written in a kind of latinized Spaniſh, whereof diverſe words had Latine terminations; he hoped, that with little aide, he might reape no ſmall profite by it, and commended the ſame very much vnto him, as a booke moſt profitable, and fitting the daies in which he gave it him. It was even at what time the new-fangles of <hi>Luther</hi> began to creepe in favour, and in many places to ſhake the foundation of our ancient beliefe. Wherein he ſeemed to be well adviſed, as he who by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of reaſon fore-ſaw, that this budding diſeaſe would eaſily turne to an execrable Atheiſme: For, the vulgar wanting the faculty to judge of things by themſelves, ſuffering it ſelfe to be carried away by fortune, and led-on by outward apparances, if once it be poſſeſſed with the boldneſſe to deſpiſe, and malapertneſſe to impugne the opinions, which to fore it held in awefull reverence (as are thoſe wherein conſiſteth their ſalvation) and that ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their religion be made doubtfull and queſtionable, they will ſoone and eaſily admit an equall vncertainty in all other parts of their beliefe, as they that had no other grounded authority or foundation, but ſuch as are now ſhaken and weakned, and immediately reject (as a tyrannicall yoke) all impreſſions, they had in former times received by the authority of Lawes, or reverence of ancient cuſtome,</p>

My father, a few-daies before his death, lighting by chance vpon this booke, which before he had neglected, amongſt other writings commanded mee to tranſlate the ſame into French. It is eaſie to tranſlate ſuch authors, where nothing but the matter is to be repreſented; but hard and dangerous, to vndertake ſuch as have added much to the grace and elegancy of the language, namely to reduce them into a weaker and poorer tongue. It was a ſtrange taske, and new occupation for mee: but by fortune beeing then at leiſure, and vnable to gaineſay the commandement of the beſt father that ever was; I came ere long (as well as I could) to an end of it: wherein he tooke ſingular delight, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame to be printed, which accordingly was after his deceaſe performed. I found the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12117:127"/>
conceits of the author to be excellent, the contexture of his worke well followed, and his project full of pietie. Now foraſmuh as diverſe ammuſe themſelves to reade-it, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Ladies, to whom we owe moſt ſervice, it hath often beene my hap to help them, when they were reading it, to diſcharge the booke of two principall objections, which are brought againſt the ſame. His drift is bold, and his ſcope adventurous; for he vndertaketh by humane and naturall reaſons, to eſtabliſh and verifie all the articles of Chriſtian religion againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts. Wherein (to ſay truth) I find him ſo reſolute and ſo happy, as I deeme it a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to doe better in that argument, and thinke that none equalleth him. Which booke ſeeming to me both over-rich and exquiſite, being written by an aucthor, whoſe name is ſo little knowne, and of whom. all we know, is, that he was a Spaniard, who about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres ſince profeſſed Phiſicke in <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi> I demanded once of <hi>Adrianus Turnebue</hi> (a man who knew all things) what ſuch a booke might be, who anſwered, that he deemed the ſame to be ſome Quinteſſence extracted from out Saint <hi>Thomas Aquinas:</hi> For, in good truth, onely ſuch a ſpirit fraught with ſo infinite erudition, and ſo full of admirable ſubtilitie, was capable of ſuch and ſo rare imaginations. So it is, that whoſoever be the authour or devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of it (the title whereof ought not without further reaſon to be taken from <hi>Sebond</hi>) he was a very ſufficient-worthie man, and endowed with ſundry other excellent qualities. The firſt thing he is reproved for in his Booke, is, that <hi>Chriſtians wrong themſelves much, in that</hi>

                           <hi>they ground their beliefe vpon humane reaſons, which is conceived but by faith, and by a particular inſpiration of God.</hi> Which objection ſeemeth to containe ſome zeale of pietie; by reaſon whereof we ought with ſo much more mildnes and regarde, endevour to ſatisfie them that propoſe it. It were a charge, more befitting a man converſant, and ſutable to one acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the holy Scriptures, than me, who am altogether ignorant in them. Nevertheleſſe I thinke, that even as to a matter ſo divine and high and ſo much exceeding al humane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as is this Verity, wherewith it hath pleaſed the goodneſſe of God to enlighten vs, it is moſt requiſite, that he affoord and lend vs his helpe. And that, with an extraordinary and priviledged favour, that ſo we may the better conceive and entertaine the ſame: For, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that meanes meerely humane can no way be capable of it; which if they were; ſo many rare and excellent mindes, and ſo plenteouſly ſtored with naturall faculties, as have beene in times paſt, would never by their diſcourſe, have miſt the attayning of this knowledge. <hi>It is faith onely, which lively and aſſiuredly embraceth the high mysteries of our Religion.</hi> And no man can doubt, but that it is a moſt excellent and commendable enterpriſe, properly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and fit to the ſervice of our faith, the natural helpes and humane implements which God hath beſtowed vpon vs. And no queſtion is to be made, but that it is the moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable employment we can put them vnto; and that there is no occupation or intent more worthy a good Chriſtian, than by all meanes, ſtudies and imaginations, carefully to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, how to embelliſh, amplifie and extend the trueth of his beliefe and religion. <hi>It is not enough for vs to ſerve God in ſpirit and ſoule,</hi> we owe him beſides, and wee yeelde vnto him a corporall worſhiping; we applie our limmes, our motions, and all externall things, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. The like ought to be done, and we ſhould accompany our faith with all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we poſſeſſe: Yet alwayes with this proviſo, that we thinke it doth not depend of-vs, and that all our ſtrength and arguments can never attaine to ſo ſupernaturall and divine a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Except it ſeize vpon vs, and as it were enter into vs by an extraordinarie infuſion: And vnleſſe it alſo enter into vs, not onely by diſcourſe, but alſo by humane meanes, ſhe is not in her dignitie, nor in her glorie. And verely I feare therfore, that except this waie, we ſhould not enjoy-it. Had we faſt-holde on God, by the enterpoſition of a lively faith; had we hold-faſt on God by himſelfe, and not by vs; had we a divine foundation, then ſhould not humane and worldly occaſions have the power ſo to ſhake and totter-vs, as they have. Our hold would not then yeeld to ſo weake a batterie: The love of noveltie; the conſtraint of Princes; the good ſucceſſe of one partie; the raſh and caſuall changing of our opinions, ſhould not then have the power to ſhake and alter our beliefe.

We ſhould bluſh for ſhame, that in humane ſects, there was never any ſo factions, what difficultie or ſtrangeneſſe ſoever his doctrine maintained, but would in ſome ſort conforme his behaviors and ſquare his life vnto it: Whereas ſo diuine and heavenly an inſtution never markes chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians but by the tongue. And will you ſee whether it be ſo?

                        <p>Now our reaſon and humane diſcourſe, is as the lumpiſh and barren matter; and the grace of God is the forme thereof. T'is that, which giveth both faſhion and worth vnto it. Even as the vertuous actions of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> are but frivolous and profitable, becauſe they had not their end, and regarded not the love and obedience of the true creator of all things; and namely, becauſe they were ignorant of the true knowledge of God: So is it of our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and diſcourſe; they haue a kind of body, but a ſhapeleſſe maſſe, without light or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, vnleſſe faith and the grace of God be joyned thereunto. Faith, giving as it were a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and luſtre vnto <hi>Sebonds</hi> arguments, make them the more firme and ſolide: They may well ſerve for a direction and guide to a yong learner, to lead and ſet him in the right way of this knowledge.

It is through the vanity of the ſame imagination, that he dare equall himſelfe to God, that he aſcribeth divine conditions vnto himſelfe, that he ſelecteth and ſeparateth himſelfe from out the ranke of other creatures; to which his fellow-brethren and compeers, he cuts out and ſhareth their parts, and allotteth them what portions of meanes or forces he thinkes good.

But to come to my purpoſe, I ſay therefore, there is no likely-hood, we ſhould imagine, the beaſts doe the very ſame things by a naturall inclination and forced genuitie, which we doe of our owne free-wil and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie. Of the very ſame effects we muſt conclude alike faculties; and by the richeſt effects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the nobleſt faculties, and conſequently acknowledge, that the ſame diſcourſe and way, we hold in working, the very ſame, or perhapps ſome other better, doe beaſts hold. Wherefore ſhall we imagine that natural compulſion in them, that prove no ſuch effect our ſelves? Since it is more honourable to be addreſſed to act, and tyed to worke orderly, by and through a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and vnavoideable condition, and moſt approching to Divinitie, then regularly to worke and act, by, and through a caſuall and raſh libertie, and it is ſafer to leave the reignes of our conduct vnto nature, then vnto our ſelves. The vanitie of our preſumption maketh vs rather to be beholding, and as it were endebted vnto our owne ſtrength, for our ſufficiency, then vnto hir liberalitie; and enrich other creatures with natural giftes, and yeeld thoſe vnto them, that ſo we may en-noble and honour our ſelves with gifts purchaſed: as me thinketh, by a very ſimple humour: For, I would prize graces, and value gifts, that were altogether mine owne, and naturall vnto me, as much as I would thoſe, I had begged, and with a long prentiſhippe, ſhifted. For, <hi>It lyeth not in our power to obtaine a greater commendation, then to be favored both of God and Nature.</hi> By that reaſon, the Foxe, which the inhabitants of <hi>Thrace</hi> vſe when they will attempt to march vpon the yce of ſome frozen river, and to that end let hir go looſe afore them, ſhould we ſee hir running alongſt the river ſide, approch hir eare cloſe to the yce, to liſten whether by any farre or neere diſtance, ſhe may heare the noyſe or roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the water, running vnder the ſame, and according as ſhe perceiveth the ice thereby to be thicke or thinne, to goe either forward or backeward; might not we lawfully judge, that the ſame diſcourſe poſſeſſeth hir head, as in like caſe it would ours?

Whereby we may conclude, they are much amended by diſcipline and ſtudy. And amongſt thoſe that run wilde, their ſong is not all one, nor alike.

And ſo jealous are they in their prentiſe-ſhip, that to excell one another, they will ſo ſtoutly contend for the maſtery, that many times, ſuch as are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed die; their wind and ſtrength ſooner failing then their voice.

In the great ſhewes of <hi>Rome,</hi> Elephants were ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſeene, taught to moove and dance at the ſound of a voice, certaine dances, wherein were many ſtrange ſhifts, enter-changes, caprings, and cadences, very hard to be learned. Some have beene noted to konne and practiſe their leſſons, vſing much ſtudy and care, as being loath to be chidden and beaten of their maſters. But the tale of the Piot is very ſtrange, which <hi>Plutarke</hi> confidently witneſſeth to have ſeene: This Iay was in a Barbers ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was admirable in counterfaiting with hir voice whatſoever ſhe heard: It fortuned one day, that certaine Trumpeters ſtaied before this ſhop, and there ſounded a good while; and being gone, all that day, and the next after, the Piot began to be very ſad, ſilent, and melancholy, whereat all men marvelled, and ſurmized that the noiſe or clang of the Trumpets had thus affrighted and dizzied hir, and that with hir hearing ſhe had alſo loſt hir voice. But at laſt they found, ſhe was but in a deepe ſtudy, and dumpiſh retracting into hir ſelfe, exerciſing hir minde, and preparing hir voice, to repreſent the ſound, and expreſſe the noiſe of the Trumpets ſhe had heard: And the firſt voice ſhe vttered was that, wherein ſhe perfectly expreſſed their ſtraines, their cloſes, and their changes: having by hir new Prentiſhip altogether quit, and as it were, ſcorned what ever ſhee could prattle before. I will not omit to alleadge another example of a Dogge, which <hi>Plutarke</hi> alſo ſaith to have ſeene (as for any order or methode, I know very well I doe but confound it, which I obſerve no more in ranging theſe examples, than I doe in all the reſt of my buſineſſe) who being in a ſhip, noted that this Dogge was in great perplexity how to get ſome Oyle out of a deepe Pitcher, which by reaſon of it's narrow mouth, he could not reach with his tongue, got him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſome Pibble-ſtones, and put ſo many into the Iarre, that he made the Oyle come vp ſo neare the brimme, as he could eaſily reach and licke ſome. And what is that but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a very ſubtill ſpirit? It is reported, that the Ravens of <hi>Barbary</hi> will doe the like, when the water they would drinke is too low. This action doth ſomewhat reſemble that, which <hi>Iuba</hi> a King of that Nation relateth of their Elephants; that when through the wiles of thoſe who chaſe them, any one chanceth to fall into certaine deepe pittes, which they prepare for them, and to deceive them, they cover over with reedes, ſhrubs, and boughes, his fellowes will ſpeedily with all diligence bring great ſtore of ſtones and peeces of timber, that ſo they may helpe to recover him out againe. But this beaſt hath in many other effects, ſuch affinity with mans ſufficiency, that would I particularly trace out what experience hath taught, I ſhould eaſily get an affirmation of what I ſo ordinarily maintaine, which is, that there is more difference found betweene ſuch and ſuch a man, than betweene ſuch a beaſt and ſuch a man. An Elephants keeper in a private houſe of <hi>Syria,</hi> was wont every meale
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:12117:135"/>
to ſteale away halfe of the allowance which was alotted him; it fortuned on a day, his maſter would needes feede him himſelfe, and having poured that juſt meaſure of barly, which for his allowance hee had preſcribed him, into his manger: the Elephant ſternely eying his maſter, with his truncke divided the provender in two equall partes, and laide the one a ſide, by which he declared the wrong his keeper did him. An other having a keeper, who to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the meaſure of his provender, was wont to mingle ſtones with it, came one day to the pot which with meat in it for his keepers dinner was ſeething over the fire, and filled it vp with aſnes. Theſe are but particular effects: But that which all the world hath ſeene, and all men know, which is, that in all the armies that came out of the Eaſt, their chiefeſt ſtrength conſiſted in their Elephants by whom they reaped, without compariſon, farre greater effects, than now adaies we do by our great Ordonance, which in a maner holds their place in a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged battell (ſuch as have any knowledge in ancient Hiſtories may eaſily gueſſe it to be true)</p>

                        <p>A man muſt needes reſt aſſured of the confidence they had in theſe beaſts, and of their diſcourſe, yeelding the front of a battell vnto them; where the leaſt ſtay they could have made, by reaſon of the hugeneſſe and weight of their bodies, and the leaſt amazement that might have made them turne head vpon their owne men, had bin ſufficient to loſe all. And few examples have been noted, that ever it fortuned they turned vpon their owne troupes, whereas we head-long throng one vpon another, and ſo are put to rowt: They had charge given them, not onely of one ſimple mooving, but of many and ſeverall parts in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: As the Spaniards did to their dogges in their new conqueſt of the <hi>Iudias;</hi> to whom they gave wages, and imparted their booties; which beaſts ſhewed as much dexteritie in purſuing, and judgement in ſtaying their victorie, in charging, or retreating, and as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerved in diſtinguiſhing their friends from their enemies, as they did earneſtneſſe and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernes: we rather admire and conſider ſtrange than common things: without which I ſhould never ſo long have ammuſed my ſelfe about this tedious catalogue. For, in my judgement he that ſhall neerely checke, what we ordinarily ſee in thoſe beaſts that live amongſt vs, ſhall in them finde as wonderful effects, as thoſe, which with ſo much toile are collected in far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and paſſed ages. It is one ſame nature, which ſtil doth keep her courſe. He that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould judge her preſent eſtate, might ſafely conclude, both what ſhall happen, and what is paſt. I have ſeene amongſt vs, men brought by ſea from diſtant countries, whoſe language, becauſe we could in no wiſe vnderſtand, and that their faſhions, their countenance, and their clothes did altogether differ from ours; who of vs did not deeme them brutiſh and ſavage? who did not impute their muteneſſe vnto ſtupiditie or beaſtlines, and to ſee them ignorant of the French tongue, of our kiſſing the handes, of our low-lowting courteſies, of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and carriage, by which, without contradiction, humane nature ought to take her patterne? Whatſoever ſeemeth ſtrange vnto vs, and we vnderſtand not, we blame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. The like befalleth vs in our judging of beaſts. They have diverſe qualities, which ſomewhat ſimbolize with ours: from which, we may comparatively draw ſome conjecture, but of ſuch as are peculiar vnto them, what know wee what they are? Horſes, Dogges, Oxen, Sheepe, Birdes, and the greater number of ſenſitive cratures that live amongſt vs, knowe our voyce, and by it ſuffer themſelves to be directed. So did the Lamprey which <hi>Craſſus</hi> had, and came to him when he called it; ſo do the Eeles that breed in <hi>Arethuſaes</hi> fountaine. And my ſelfe have ſeene ſome fiſh-pondes, where, at a certaine crie of thoſe that kept them, the fiſh would preſently come to ſhoare, where they were wont to be fed.</p>

                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:12117:136"/>By which we may judge, and conclude, that Elephants have ſome apprehenſion of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, forſomuch as after diverſe waſhings and purifications, they are ſeene to lift vp their truncke, as we doe our armes, and at certaine hours of the day, without any inſtruction, of their owne accorde, holding their eies fixed towardes the Sunne-riſing, fall into a long me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating contemplation: yet, becauſe wee ſee no ſuch apparance in other beaſts, may wee righly conclude, that they are altogether voide of religion, and may not take that in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is hidden from vs. As we perceive ſomething in that action, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Cleanthes</hi> well obſerved, becauſe it ſomewhat drawes neere vnto ours. He ſaw (as himſelfe reporteth) a company of Emmets goe from their neſt, bearing amongſt them the body of a dead Ant, toward another Emmets neſt, from which many other Ants came, as it were to meete them by the way to parly with them, who after they had continued together a while, they which came laſt, returned backe, to conſult (as you may imagine) with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, and becauſe they could hardly come to any capitulation; they made two or three voyages to and fro: In the end, the laſt come, brought vnto the other a worme from their habitation, as for a ranſome of the dead, which worme the firſt company tooke vpon their backes, and carried it home, leaving the dead body vnto the other. Loe heere the interpretation that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> gave it: Witneſſing thereby, that thoſe creatures which have no voice at all, have nevertheleſſe mutual commerce, and enterchangeable communication, whereof if we be not partakers, it is onely our fault; and therfore doe we fondly to cenſure it. And they yet produce divers other effects, farre ſurpaſſing our capacity, and ſo farre out of the reach of our imitation, that even our thoughts are vnable to conceive them. Many hold opinion, that in the laſt and famous ſea-fight, which <hi>Antonie</hi> loſt againſt <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall-gally was in hir courſe ſtaied by that little fiſh, the Latines call <hi>Remora,</hi> and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Sucke-ſtone, whoſe property is, to ſtay any ſhip he can faſten himſelfe vnto. And the Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> ſailing with a great fleete along the coaſt of <hi>Romania,</hi> his owne Gally was ſuddenly ſtaied by ſuch a fiſh, which he cauſed to be taken ſticking faſt to the keele moodily raging, that ſo little a creature had the power to force both ſea and winde, and the violence of all his oares, onely with hir bill ſticking to his Gally (for it is a kinde of ſhell-fiſh) and was much more amazed when he perceived the fiſh, being brought aboord his ſhip, to have no longer that powerfull vertue, which it had, being in the Sea. A certaine Citizen of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> whilom purchaſed vnto himſelfe the reputation to be an excellent Mathematitian, becauſe he had learn't the quality of the Hedge-hogge, whoſe property is to build his hole or denne, open diverſe waies, and toward ſeverall windes, and fore-ſeeing riſing ſtormes, he preſently ſtoppeth the holes that way; which thing the foreſaid Citizen heedfully obſerving, would in the City foretell any future ſtorme, and what winde ſhould blow. The Cameleon taketh the colour of the place wherein he is. The fiſh called a Pourcontrell, or Manie-feete, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe into what colour he liſts, as occaſion offereth it ſelfe; that ſo he may hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from what he feareth, and catch what he ſeeketh for. In the Camelion it is a change proceeding of paſſion, but in the Pourcontrell a change in action; we our ſelves doe often change our colour, and altar our countenance, through ſudden feare, choler, ſhame, and ſuch like violent paſſions, which are wont to alter the hew of our faces: but it is by the effect of ſufferance, as in the Cameleon. The jaundiſe hath power to make vs yelow, but it is not in the diſpoſition of our wils. The effects we perceive in other creatures, greater than ours, witneſſe ſome more excellent faculty in them, which is concealed from vs; as it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, diverſe others of their conditions and forces are, whereof no apperance or knowledge commeth to vs. Of all former praedictions, the ancienteſt and moſt certaine were ſuch as were drawen from the flight of birds: we have nothing equall vnto it, nor ſo admirable. The rule of fluttering, and order of ſhaking their wings, by which they conjecture the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things to enſue, muſt neceſſarily be directed to ſo noble an operation by ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſupernaturall meane: For, it is a wreſting of the letter, to attribute ſo wondrous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, to any naturall decree, without the knowledge, conſent, or diſcourſe of him, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and produceth them, and is a moſt falſe opinion: Which to proove, the Torpedo or Cramp-fiſh hath the property to benumme and aſtoniſh, not onely the limbes of thoſe that touch it, but alſo theirs, that with any long pole or fiſhing line touch any part thereof, ſhee doth tranſmit and convey a kinde of heavie numming into the hands of thoſe that ſtirre or handle the ſame: Moreover, it is averred, that if any matter be caſt vpon them, the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

is ſenſibly felt to gaine vpward vntill it come to the handes, and even through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it aſtoniſheth the feeling-ſence. Is not this a wonderfull power? Yet is it not altogether vnprofitable for the Cramp-fiſh, ſhe both knowes and makes vſe of it: for to catch prey ſhe purſueth, ſhe is ſeene to hide hirſelfe vnder the mudde, that, other fiſhes ſwimming over hir, ſtrucken and benummed with hir exceeding coldneſſe, may fall into hir clawes. The Cranes, Swallowes, and other wandering birdes, changing their abode, according to the ſeaſons of the yeare, ſhew evidently the knowledge they have of their fore divining faculty, and often put the ſame in vſe. Hunters aſſure vs, that to chuſe the beſt dogge, and which they purpoſe to keepe from our a litter of other yoong whelpes, there is no better meane than the damme hirſelfe: for, if they be remooved from out their kennell, him that ſhe firſt brings th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The manner of all beaſts breeding, engendering, nouriſhing, working, mooving, living and dying, being ſo neere to ours, what ever we abridge from their mooving cauſes, and adde to our condition above theirs, can no way depart from our reaſons diſcourſe.

Touching friendſhip, without all compariſon, they profeſſe it more lively and ſhew it more conſtantly, then men. <hi>Hircanus</hi> a dog of <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> the king, his maſter being dead, without eating or drinking would never come from off his bed, and when the dead corpes was remooved thence, he followed it, and laſtly flung himſelfe into the fire, where his maſter was burned. As did alſo the dogge of one called <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who after he was dead, would never budge from his maſters couch, and when he was remooved, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to be carried away with him, and at laſt flung himſelfe into the fire wherein his maſter was conſumed. There are certaine inclinations of affection, which without counſell of reaſon ariſe ſomtimes in vs, proceeding of a caſuall temerity, which ſome call <hi>Sympathic:</hi> beaſts as wel as men are capable of it. We ſee horſes take a kinde of acquaintance one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that often, travelling by the high-way, or feeding together, we have much ado to keep them aſunder, wee ſee them bend and applie their affections to ſome of their fellowes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as if it were vpon a certaine viſage; and when they meete with any ſuch, with ſignes of joy, and demonſtration of good will, to joine and accoſt them, and to hate aud ſhunne ſome other formes and colours. Beaſtes, as well as wee, have choiſe in their loves, and are
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:12117:137"/>
very nice in chuſing of their mates. They are not altogether voide of our extreame and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeſable jealouſies. Luſtful deſires are either natural, and neceſſary, as eating and drinking; or elſe naturall and not neceſſary, as the acquaintance of males and females: or elſe neither neceſſary nor naturall: Of this laſt kinde are almoſt all mens: For, they are all ſuperfluous and artificiall. It is wonderfull to ſee with how little, nature will be ſatisfied, and how little ſhe hath left for vs to be deſired. The preparations in our Kitchins, doe nothing at all concerne hir lawes. The Stoikes ſay, that a man might very well ſuſtaine himſelfe with one Olivea day.

Brute beaſts are much more regulate then we; and with more moderation containe themſelves within the compaſſe, which nature hath preſcribed them: yet not ſo exactly, but that they have ſome coherency with our rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous licenciouſneſſe.

                        <p>Touching a ſubtil pranke and witty tricke, is there any ſo famous as that of <hi>Thales</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Mule, which, laden with ſalt, paſſing through a River chanced to ſtumble, ſo that the ſacks ſhe carried were all wet, and perceiving the ſalt (becauſe the water had mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it) to grow lighter, ceaſed not, aſſoone as ſhe came neere any water, together with hir loade to plunge hirſelfe therein, vntill hir maſter, being aware of hir craft, commanded hir to be laden with wooll, which being wet became heavier; the Mule finding hirſelfe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, vſed hir former policy no more.

As for warre, which is the greateſt and moſt glorious of all humane actions, I would faine know, if we will vſe it for an argument of ſome prerogative, or otherwiſe for a teſtimonie of our imbecilitie and imperfection, as in truth, the ſcience wee vſe to defeate and kill one another, to ſpoile and vtterly to overthrow our owne kinde, it ſeemeth, it hath not much to make it ſelfe to be wiſhed-for in beaſtes, that have it not.</p>

Another Dogge being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to watch a Temple in <hi>Athens,</hi> having perceived a ſacrelegious theefe, to carrie away the faireſt jewels therein, barked at him ſo long as he was able, and ſeeing he could not awaken the Sextons or Temple-keepers, followed the theefe, whither-ſoever he went; daie-light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he kept himſelfe a loof-off, but never loſt the ſight of him: if he offered him meat, he vtterly refuſed it; but if any paſſenger chanced to come by, on them he fawned, with wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his taile, and tooke whatever they offered him; If the theefe ſtaied to reſt himſelfe, he alſo ſtayed in the ſame place: The newes of this Dogge being come to the Temple-keepers, they as they went along, enquiring of the Dogs haire and colour, purſued his tracke ſo long, that at laſt they found both the Dog and the theefe in the Citie of <hi>Cromyon,</hi> whom they brought backe to <hi>Athens,</hi> where for his offence he was ſeverely puniſhed. And the judges in acknowledgement of the Dogges good office, at the Cities charge appointed him for his ſuſtenance a certaine daily meaſure of Corne, and enjoyned the Prieſts of the Temple, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to looke vnto him. <hi>Plutarke</hi> affirmeth this ſtorie to be moſt true, and to have hapned in his time. Touching gratitude and thankfulneſſe, (for me thinks we have need to further this word greatly) this onely example ſhall ſuffice, of which <hi>Appion</hi> reporteth to have been aſpectator himſelfe. One day (ſaith he) that the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> (to pleaſe and recreate the common people) cauſed a great number of wilde beaſts to be baited, namely huge great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it ſo fortuned, that there was one amongſt the reſt, who by reaſon of his furious and ſtately carriage, of his vnmatched ſtrength, of his great limmes, and of his loude, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror-cauſing roaring, drew all by-ſtanders eyes to gaze vpon him. Amongſt other ſlaves, that in ſight of all the people were preſented to encounter with theſe beaſts, there chanced to be one <hi>Androdus of Dacia,</hi> who belonged vnto a Roman Lord, who had been Conſull. This huge Lion, having eyed him a far off, firſt made a ſuddaine ſtop, as ſtrucken into a kind of admiration, then with a milde and gentle countenance, as if he would willingly have taken acquaintance of him, faire and ſoftly approached vnto him: Which done, and reſting, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he was the man he tooke him for, begun fawningly to wagge his taile, as dogges doe that fawne vpon their new-ſound maſters, and licke the poore and miſerable ſlaves hands and thighes, who through feare was almoſt out of his wits and halfe dead. <hi>Androdus</hi> at laſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hart of grace; and by reaſon of the Lions mildeneſſe having rouzed vp his ſpirits, and wiſhly fixing his eies vpon him, to ſee whether he could call him to remembrance; it was to all beholders a ſingular pleaſure to obſerve the love, the joy, and blandiſhments, ech endevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter-ſhew one another. Whereat the people raiſing a loud crie, and by their ſhouting and clapping of hands ſeeming to be much pleaſed; the Emperour willed the ſlave to be brought before him, as deſirous to vnderſtand of him the cauſe of ſo ſtrange and ſeld-ſeene an accident: Who related this new, and wonderfull ſtorie vnto him.</p>
                        <p>My maſter (ſaid he) being Proconſull in <hi>Affrica,</hi> forſomuch as he cauſed me every day to be moſt cruelly beaten, and held me in ſo rigorous bondage, I was conſtrained, as being wearie of my life, to run away: And ſafely to ſcape from ſo eminent a perſon, and who had ſo great authoritie in the Countrie, I thought it beſt to get me into the deſert, and moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented wilderneſſes of that region, with a full reſolution, if I could not compaſſe the meanes to ſuſtaine my ſelfe, to finde one way or other, with violence to make my ſelfe away. One day, the Sunne about noone-tide being extreamly hote, and the ſcorching heat thereof intollerable, I fortuned to come vnto a wilde vnhanted cave, hidden amongſt crags, and almoſt inacceſſible, and where I imagined no footing had ever been; therein I hid my ſelfe: I had not long been there, but in comes this Lion, with one of his pawes ſore hurt, and bloody-goared, wailing for the ſmart, and groaning for the paine he felt; at whoſe arrivall, I was much diſmaide, but he ſeeing me lie cloſe-cowring in a corner of his den, gently made his approaches vnto me, holding forth his goared paw toward me, and ſeemed with ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame humbly to ſue, and ſuppliantly to beg for help at my hands. I, moved with ruth, taking it into my hand, pulled out a great ſplint, which was gotten into-it, and ſhaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off all feare, firſt I wrung and cruſht his ſore, and cauſed the filth and matter, which therein was gathered, to come forth; then, as gently as for my hart I could, I cleanſed, wiped, and dried the ſame. He feeling ſome eaſe in his griefe, and his paine to ceaſe, ſtill holding his foote betweene my hands, began to ſleep and take ſome reſt. Thence forward he and I lived
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12117:139"/>
together, the full ſpace of three years in his den, with ſuch meat as he ſhifted-for: For, what beaſts he killed, or what prey ſoever he tooke, he ever brought home the better part, and ſhared-it with me, which for want of fire, I roſted in the Sunne, and therewith nouriſhed my ſelfe all that while. But at laſt wearied with this kinde of brutiſh life, the Lion being one day gone to purchaſe his wonted pray, I left the place, hoping to mend my fortunes, and having wandred vp and downe three dayes, I was at laſt taken by certaine Souldiers, which from <hi>Africa</hi> brought me into this Citie to my Maſter againe, who immediately condemned me to death, and to be devoured by wilde beaſts. And as I now perceive, the ſame Lion was alſo ſhortly after taken, who as you ſee hath now required me of the good turne I did him, and the health which by my meanes he recoved. Behold heer the hiſtorie, <hi>Androdus</hi> reported vnto the Emperour, which after he cauſed to be declared vnto all the people, at whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall requeſt, he was forthwith ſet at libertie, and quit of his puniſhment, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of all, had the Lion beſtowed vpon him. <hi>Appion</hi> ſaith further, that <hi>Androdus</hi> was daily ſeen to leade the Lion vp and downe the ſtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> tied onely with a little twine, and walking from taverne to taverne, received ſuch money as was given him, who would gently ſuffer himſelfe to be handled, touched, decked, and ſtrowed with flowers, all over and over, many ſaying when they met him: yonder is the Lion that is the mans hoſte, and yonder is the man that is the Lions Phiſitian. We often mourne and weepe, for the loſſe of thoſe beaſts we love, ſo doe they many times for the loſſe of vs.</p>

                        <p>As ſome of our nations have wives in common, and ſome in ſeverall, each man keeping himſelfe to his owne; ſo have ſome beaſts; yet ſome there are, that obſerve their marriages, with as great reſpect as we doe ours. Touching the mutuall ſocietie, and reciprocall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which they deviſe amongſt themſelves, that ſo they may be faſt combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in times of need help one another, it is apparant, that if Oxen, Hogs, and other beaſts being hurt by vs, chance to crie, all the heard runnes to aide him, and in his defenſe will joine all together. The fiſh, called of the Latines <hi>Scarus,</hi> having ſwallowed the fiſhers hooke, his fellowes will preſently flocke about him, and nibble the line in ſunder; and if any of them happen to be taken in a bow-net, ſome of his fellowes turning his head away, will put his taile in at the necke of the net, who with his teeth faſt-holding the ſame, never leave him, vntill they have pulled him out. The Barble fiſhes, if one of them chance to be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, will ſet the line againſt their backes, and with a fin they have, toothed like a ſharp ſaw, preſently ſaw and fret the ſame aſunder. Concerning particular offices, which we for the benefit of our life, draw one from an other, many like examples are found amongſt them. It is aſſuredly beleeved, that the Whale never ſwimmeth, vnleſſe ſhe have a little fiſh going before her, as her vantgard, it is in ſhape like a Gudgeon, and both the Latines and we, call it the Whales-guide; for, ſhe doth ever follow him, ſuffering her ſelfe, as eaſily to be led and turned by him, as a ſhip is directed and turned by a ſterne: for requitall of which good turne, whereas all things elſe, be it, beaſt, fiſh, or veſſell, that comes within the horrible <hi>Chaes</hi> of this monſtrous mouth, is preſently loſt and devoured, this little fiſh, doth ſafely retire himſelfe therein, and there ſleepes verie quietly, and as long as he ſleepes, the Whale never ſtirs; but aſſoone as he awaketh and goeth his way, whereever he takes his courſe ſhe alwaies followeth him, and if ſhe fortune to looſe him, ſhe wanders here and there, and often ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the rocks, as a ſhip that hath nor maſt nor rudder. This, <hi>Plutarke</hi> witneſſeth to have ſeen in the Iland of <hi>Anticyra.</hi> There is ſuch a like ſocietie betweene the little bird cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Wren, and the Crocodill: For, the Wren ſerveth as a ſentinell to ſo great a monſter: And if the Ichneumon, which is his mortall enemie approach to fight with him, the little bird let, leſt he might ſurpriſe him whilſt he ſleepeth, with his ſinging, and pecking him with his bill, awakens him, and gives him warning of the danger he is in. The bird liveth by the ſcraps, and feedeth vpon the leavings of that monſter, who gently receiveth him into his mouth, and ſuffers him to pecke his jawes and teeth for ſuch mammockes of fleſh as ſticke betweene them: and if he purpoſe to cloſe his mouth, he doth firſt warne him to be gone, faire and eaſie cloſing it by little and little, without any whit cruſhing or hurting him. The
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12117:139"/>
ſhell-fiſh called a Nacre, liveth even ſo with the Pinnotere, which is a little creature like vnto a Crabfiſh, and as his porter or vſher waites vpon him, attending the opening of the Nacre, which he continually keepes gaping, vntill he ſee ſome little fiſh enter in, fit for their turne, then he creepes into the Nacre, and leaves not pinching his quicke fleſh, vntill he makes him cloſe his ſhell, and ſo they both together faſt in their hold, devour their prey. In the maner of the Tunnies life, may be diſcovered a ſingular knowledge of the three parts of the Mathematikes. Firſt for Aſtrologie, it may well be ſaid that man doth learne it of them: For, whereſoever the winter Solſtitium doth take them, there do they ſtay themſelves, and never ſtir till the next Aequinoctium, and that is the reaſon why <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth ſo willingly aſcribe that arte vnto them: Then for Geometrie and Arithmetike, they alwaies frame their ſhole of a Cubike figure, every way ſquare: and ſo forme a ſolide, cloſe and wel-ranged bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon, encompaſſed round about of ſixe equall ſides. Thus orderly marſhaled, they take their courſe and ſwim whither their journey tends, as broad and wide behind as before: So that he that ſeeth and telleth but one ranke, may eaſily number all the troope, forſomuch as the number of the depth is equall vnto the bredth, and the bredth vnto the length. Touching magnanimitie and haughtie courage, it is hard to ſet it forth more lively, and to produce a rarer patterne, then that of the Dog, which from <hi>India</hi> was ſent vnto <hi>Alexander:</hi> to whom was firſt preſented a Stag, then a wilde Boare, and then a Beare, with each of which he ſhould have foughten, but he ſeemed to make no accompt of them, and would not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove out of his place for them, but when he ſaw a Lion, he preſently rouzed himſelfe, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently he meant onely ſo noble a beaſt worthie to enter combate with him. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning repentance and acknowledging of faults committed, it is reported, that an Elephant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through rage of choller ſlaine his governour, conceived ſuch an extreame inward griefe, that he would never afterward touch any food, and ſuffered himſelf to pine to death. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clemencie, it is reported of a Tiger, (the fierceſt and moſt inhumane beaſt of all) who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Kid given her to feed vpon, endured the force of gnawing hunger, two daies together, rather then ſhe would hurt him; the third day with maine ſtrength ſhe brake the cage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe was kept-pent, and went elſewhere to ſhift for feeding; as one vnwilling to ſeize vpon the ſeelie Kid her familiar and gueſt. And concerning priviledges of familiaritie and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie cauſed by converſation, is it not oft ſeen, how ſome make Cats, Dogs, and Hares ſo tame, ſo gentle, and ſo milde, that without harming one another they ſhall live and continue together?

In what kinde of creature did ever nature ſo much prefer both their hatching, ſitting, brooding, and birth? Poets faine, that the Iland of <hi>Delos,</hi> being before wandring and fleeting vp and downe, was for the delivery of <hi>Latona</hi> made firme and ſetled. But Gods decree hath been, that all the watrie wilderneſſe ſhould be quiet and made calme, without raine, wind, or tempeſt, during the time the <hi>Halcyon</hi> ſitteth and bringeth forth her yoong-ones, which is much about the Winter <hi>Solstitium,</hi> and ſhorteſt day in the yeare: By whoſe priviledge even in the hart &amp; deadeſt time of Winter we have ſeven calme daies, and as many nights to ſaile without any danger. Their Hens know no other Cocke but their owne: They never forſake him all the daies of their life; and if the Cocke chance to be weake and crazed, the Hen will take him vpon her neck, and carrie him with her, whereſoever ſhe goeth, and ſerve him even vntill death.

                           <hi>Plutarke,</hi> who hath ſeen and handled many of them, thinkes it to be made of certaine fiſh-bones, which ſhe ſo compacts, and conjoyneth together, enterlaſing ſome long, and ſome croſſe-waies, adding ſome foldings and roundings to it, that in the end ſhe frameth a round kind of veſſell, readie to floate and ſwim vpon the water: which done, ſhe carrieth the ſame where the Sea-waves beate moſt; there the Sea gently beating vpon it, ſnewes her how to daube and patch vp the parts not well cloſed, and how to ſtrengthen thoſe places, and faſhion thoſe ribs, that are not faſt, but ſtir with the Sea-waves: And on the other ſide, that which is cloſely wrought, the Sea beating on it, doth ſo faſten and conjoyne together, that nothing, no, not ſtone or yron, can any way looſen, divide, or break the ſame, except with great violence; and what is moſt to be wondred at, is the proportion and figure of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavitie

within; for, it is ſo compoſed and proportioned, that it can receive or admit no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thing, but the Bird that built-it; for, to all things elſe, it is ſo impenetrable, cloſe and hard, that nothing can poſſiblie enter in: no, not ſo much as the Sea-water. Loe-heer a moſt plaine deſcription of this building, or conſtruction taken from a verie good Author: yet me thinks, it doth not fully and ſufficiently reſolve vs of the difficultie in this kinde of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture.

We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume vnto our ſelves imaginarie and fantaſticall goods, future and abſent goods, which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacitie can no way warrant vnto her ſelfe; or ſome other, which by the overweening of our owne opinion, we falſely aſcribe vnto our ſelves; as reaſon, honour, and knowledge; and to them as their proper ſhare we leave the eſſentiall, the maneagable, and palpable goods, as peace, reſt, ſecuritie, innocencie, and health: Health I ſay, which is the goodlieſt and richeſt preſent, nature can impart vnto vs. So that even Stoike Philoſophie dareth to affirme, that if <hi>Heracletus</hi> and <hi>Pherecydes</hi> could have changed their wiſedome with health, and by that meanes, the one to have rid himſelfe of the dropſie, and the other of the lowſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evill, which ſo ſore tormented them, they would ſurely have done-it: whereby they alſo yeeld ſo much more honor vnto wiſedome, by comparing and counterpeizing the ſame vnto health, then they do in this other propoſition of theirs, where they ſay, that if <hi>Circes</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>

Well, I allow of this ingenious and voluntarie confeſſion: ſurely they knew thoſe parts, we ſo much labour to pamper, to be meere fantazies. Suppoſe, beaſts had all the vertue, the knowledge, the wiſedome and ſufficiencie of the Stoikes, they ſhould ſtill be beaſts; nor might they ever be compared vnto a miſerable, wretched, and ſenſeleſſe man. For, when all is done, whatſoever is not as we are, is not of any worth. And God to be eſteemed of vs, muſt (as we will ſhew anon) draw ſomewhat neere-it. Whereby it appeareth, that it is not long of a true diſcourſe, but of a fooliſh-hardineſſe, and ſelfe-preſuming obſtinacie, we prefer our ſelves before other creatures, and ſequeſter our ſelves from their condition and ſocietie.

There is nothing more common, than to meet with ſuch paſſages of temeritie: There is not any of vs that will be ſo much offended to ſee himſelfe compared to God, as he will deeme himſelfe wronged to be depreſſed in the ranke of other creatures. So much are we more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of our owne intereſt, than of our Creators. But we muſt tread this fooliſh vanitie vnder foote, and boldly ſhake off, and lively reject thoſe fond-ridiculous foundations, whereon theſe falſe opinions are built. So long as man ſhall be perſwaded to have meanes or power of himſelfe, ſo long will he denie, and never acknowledge what he oweth vnto his Maſter: he ſhall alwaies (as the common ſaying is) make ſhift with his owne: He muſt be ſtripped into his ſhirt. Let vs conſider ſome notable example of the effect of Philoſophie. <hi>Poſſiaonius</hi> having long time been grieved with a painfull-lingring diſeaſe, which with the ſmarting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine made him to wring his hands, and gnaſh his teeth, thought to ſcorne griefe, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming and crying out againſt-it: <hi>Doo what thou liſt, yet will I never ſay that thou arte evill or paine.</hi> He feeleth the ſame paſſions that my lackey doth, but he boaſteth himſelfe, that at leaſt he conteineth his tongue vnder the lawes of his ſect. <hi>Re ſuccumbere non oporte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat verbis gloriantem: It was not for him to yeeld in deeds, who had ſo braved it in words. Arce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilas</hi> lying ſicke of the gowt, <hi>Carneades</hi> comming to viſite him, and ſeeing him to frowne, ſuppoſing he had been angrie, was going away againe, but he called him backe, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his feet and breſt, ſaid vnto him, there is nothing come from thence hither. This hath ſomewhat a better garbe; for he feeleth himſelfe grieved with ſickneſſe, and would faine be rid of it, yet is not his heart vanquiſhed or weakned thereby, the other ſtands vpon his ſtifneſſe (as I feare) more verball then eſſentiall. And <hi>Dionyſius Heracleotes</hi> being tormented with a violent ſmarting in his eies, was at laſt perſwaded to quit theſe Stoicke reſolutions.</p>
                        <p>Be it ſuppoſed that Learning and Knowledge ſhould worke thoſe effects they ſpeake of, that is, to blunt and abate the ſharpneſſe of thoſe accidents or miſchances, that follow and attend vs; doth ſhe any more than what ignorance effecteth much more evidently and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? The Philoſopher <hi>Pyrrho</hi> being at Sea, and by reaſon of a violent ſtorme in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be caſt away, preſented nothing vnto thoſe that were with him in the ſhip, to unitate but the ſecuritie of an Hog which was aboard, who nothing at all diſmaide, ſeemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and out-ſtare the tempeſt. Philoſophie after all her precepts gives vs over to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of a Wreſtler, or of a Muletier, in whom we ordinarilie perceive much leſſe feeling of death, of paine, of griefe, and other inconveniences, and more vndanted conſtancie, then ever Learning or Knowledge could ſtore a man withall, vnleſſe he were borne, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe through ſome naturall habitude, prepared vnto it. What is the cauſe, the tender mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a childe, or limbes of a horſe are much more eaſie, and with leſſe paine cut and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then ours, if it be not ignorance? How many, onely through the power of imagination,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:12117:143"/>
have falne into dangerous diſeaſes? We ordinarily ſee diverſe that will cauſe themſelves to be let bloud, purged, and dieted, becauſe they would be cured of diſeaſes, they never felt but in conceit; when eſſentiall and true maladies faile vs, then Science and knowledge lends-vs hirs: This colour or complexion (ſaid ſhe) preſageth ſome rheumatike defluxion will enſue you: This ſoultring-hote ſeaſon menaceth you with ſome febricant commotion; this cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the vitall line of your left hand warneth you of ſome notable and approaching indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polition. And at laſt ſhe will roundly addreſſe her ſelfe vnto perfect health; ſaying, this youthly vigor and ſuddaine joy can not poſſibly ſtay in one place, her bloud and ſtrength muſt be abated, for feare it turne you to ſome miſchiefe. Compare but the life of a man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe-like imaginations, vnto that of a day-labouring ſwaine, who followes his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appetites, who meaſureth all things onely by the preſent ſenſe, and hath neither learning nor prognoſtications, who feeleth no diſeaſe but when he hath it: whereas the other hath often the ſtone imaginarily, before he have it in his reines: As if it were not time enough to endure the ſickneſſe when it ſhall come, he doth in his fanſie prevent the ſame, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long runneth to meet with it. What I ſpeake of Phiſicke, the ſame may generally be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and drawne to all maner of learning. Thence came this ancient opinion of thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who placed chiefe felicitie in the acknowledging of our judgements weakneſſe. My ignorance affoords me as much cauſe of hope as of feare: and having no other regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my health, then that of other mens examples, and of the events, I ſee elſewhere in like occaſions, whereof I find ſome of all ſorts: And relie vpon the compariſons, that are moſt favourable vnto me. I embrace health with open armes, free, plaine, and full; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my appetite to enjoy-it, by how much more, it is now leſſe ordinarie and more rare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: ſo far is it from me, that I with the bitterneſſe of ſome new and forced kind of life, trouble her reſt, and moleſt her eaſe. Beaſts doe manifeſtly declare vnto vs, how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities our mindes agitation brings vs. That which is told vs of thoſe that inhabite <hi>Breſill,</hi> who die onely through age, which ſome impute to the cleareneſſe and calmeneſſe of their aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I rather aſcribe to the calmeneſſe and cleareneſſe of their minds, void and free from all paſſions, cares, toiling, and vnpleaſant labours, as a people that paſſe their life in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kind of ſimplicitie and ignorance, without letters, or lawes, and without Kings, or any Religion. Whence comes it (as we daily ſee by experience) that the rudeſt and groſſeſt clownes, are more tough-ſtrong, and more deſired in amorous executions: And that the love of a Muletier is often more accepted, then that of a perfumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quaint courtier? But becauſe in the latter, the agitation of his minde doth ſo diſtract, trouble, and wearie the force of his bodie; as it alſo troubleth and wearieth it ſelfe, who doth belie, or more commonly caſt the ſame downe even into madneſſe, but her owne promptitude, her point, her agilitie, and to conclude her proper force? <hi>Whence proceeds the ſubtileſt follie, but from the ſubtileſt wiſedome?</hi> As from the extreameſt friendſhips proceed the extreameſt enmities, and from the ſoundeſt healths, the mortalleſt diſeaſes; ſo from the rareſt and quickeſt agitations of our minds enſue the moſt diſtempered and outragious frenzies. There wants but halfe a pegs turne to paſſe from the one to the other. In mad mens actions, we ſee how fitly follie ſuteth and meets with the ſtrongeſt operations, of our minde. Who knowes not how vnpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable the neighbourhood betweene follie with the livelieſt elevations of a free minde is; and the effects of a ſupreame and extraordinarie vertue? <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, that melancholy minds are more excellent and diſciplinable; So are there none more inclinable vnto follie. Diverſe ſpirits are ſeene to be overthrowne by their owne force, and proper nimbleneſſe. What a ſtart hath one of the moſt judicious, ingenious, and moſt fitted vnto the ayre of true ancient<note place="margin">Torquato Taſſo.</note> poeſie, lately gotten by his owne agitation and ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gladneſſe, above all other Italian Poets that have been of a long time? Hath not he wherewith to be beholding vnto this his killing vivacitie? vnto this cleareneſſe, that hath ſo blinded him? vnto his exact and far-reaching apprehenſion of reaſon, which hath made him voide of reaſon? vnto the curious and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious purſute of Sciences, that have brought him vnto ſottiſhneſſe? vnto this rare aptitude to the exerciſes of the minde, which hath made him without minde or exerciſe? I rather ſpited then pittied him, when I ſaw him at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> in ſo pitteous a plight, that he ſurvived himſelfe; miſacknowledging both himſelfe and his labours, which vnwitting to him, and even to his face, have been publiſhed both vncorrected and maimed.

And if a man ſhall tell me, that the commoditie to have the appetite cold to griefes, and wallowiſh to evils, drawes this incommoditie after-it, it is alſo conſequently the ſame, that makes vs leſſe ſharpe and greedie to the enjoying of good, and of pleaſures: It is true, but the miſerie of our condition beareth, that we have not ſo much to enjoy, as to ſhun, and that extreame voluptuouſneſſe doth not ſo much pinch vs, as a light ſmart: <hi>Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius homines bona quàm mala ſentiunt.

Nay, there is nothing ſo deeply imprinteth any thing in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, as the deſire to forget the ſame: It is a good way to commend to the keeping, and imprint any thing in our minde, to ſolicite her to looſe the ſame.

Of the three actions or faculties of the ſoule, that is to ſay, he imaginative, the concupiſciple, and the conſenting, they allow and conceive the two former; the laſt, they hold and defend to be ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one or other ſide, be it never ſo light, <hi>Zeno</hi> in jeſture painted forth his imagination vpon this diviſion of the ſoules faculties: the open and out-ſtretched hand was apparance; the hand halfe-ſhutte, and fingers ſomewhat bending, conſent: the fiſt cloſe, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: if the fiſt of the left-hand were cloſely clinched together, it ſignified Science. Now this ſituation of their judgement, ſtraight and inflexible, receiving all objects with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or conſent, leades them vnto their Ataraxie; which is the condition of a quiet and ſetled life, exempted from the agitations, which we receive by the impreſſion of the opinion and knowledge, we imagine to have of things; whence proceed, feare, avarice, envie, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deſires, ambition, pride, ſuperſtition, love of novelties, rebellion, diſobedience, obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and the greateſt number of corporall evils: yea by that meane they are exempted from the jealouſie of their owne diſcipline, for they contend but faintly: They feare nor revenge, nor contradiction in the diſputations. When they ſay, that heavy things deſcend downeward, they would be loath to be believed, but deſire to be contradicted, therby to engender doubt, and ſuſpence of judgement, which is their end and drift. They put forth their propoſitions, but to contend with thoſe, they imagine wee holde in out conceipt. If you take theirs, then will they vndertake to maintaine the contrary: all is one to them, nor will they give a penny to chuſe. If you propoſe that ſnow is blacke, they wil argue on the other ſide, that it is white. If you ſay it is neither one nor other, they will maintaine it to be both.

Whatſoever he was demanded of any man, he would ever firſt enquire of him, to give an accompt of his life, both preſent and paſt: which he would ſeriouſly examine and judge of: Deeming all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprentiſhips as ſubſequents and of ſupererogation in regard of that. <hi>Parum mihi place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant eae literaequae advirtutem doctoribus nihil profuerunt.

As for the reſt, ſome have judged <hi>Plato</hi> a Dogmatiſt, others a Doubter, ſome a Dogmatiſt in one thing and ſome a Doubter, in another. <hi>Socrates,</hi> the fore-man of his Dialogues doth ever aske and propoſe his diſputation; yet never conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor ever ſatisfying: and ſaith, he hath no other Science, but that of oppoſing.

His maide ſervant noting this alteration in her maſter, ſmilingly ſaide vnto him, that hee ſhould no more buſie himſelfe about it; the reaſon was, ſhe had laide them in a veſſell, where honny had beene, whereat he ſeemed to be wroth in that ſhee had deprived him of the occaſion of his intended ſearch, and robbed his curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie of matter to worke vpon. Away (quoth he) vnto her, thou haſt much offended mee; yet will I not omit to finde out the cauſe, as if it were naturally ſo.

being blamed for profeſſing that Philoſophie, whereof, in his judgement hee made no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme; anſwered, that that was true Philoſophizing. They have gone about to conſider all, to ballance all, and have found that it was an occupation fitting the naturall curioſitie which is in vs. Some things they have written for the behoofe of common ſocietie, as their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And for this conſideration was it reaſonable, that they would not throughly vnfold common opinions, that ſo they might not breede trouble in the obedience of lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of their countries. <hi>Plato</hi> treateth this myſterie in a very manifeſt kinde of ſport. For, where he writeth according to himſelfe, he preſcribeth nothing for certaintie: When he inſtitutes a Law giuer, he borroweth a very ſwaying and avouching kinde of ſtile: Wherein he boldly entermingleth his moſt fantaſticall opinions; as profitable to perſwade the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſorte, as ridiculous to perſwade himſelfe: Knowing how apt we are to receive all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and chiefly the moſt wicked and enormous. And therefore is he very carefull in his lawes that nothing bee ſung in publike but Poeſies; the fabulous fictions of which tend to ſome profitable end: being ſo apt to imprint all manner of illuſion in mans minde, that it is injuſtice not to feede them rather with commodious lies, then with lies either vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or damageable, He flatly ſaith in his Common-wealth, that for the benefit of men, it is often neceſſarie to deceive them. It is eaſie to diſtinguiſh, how ſome Sects have rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed truth, and ſome profit; by which the latter have gained credit. It is the miſerie of our condition, that often, what offers it ſelfe vnto onr imagination for the likely eſt: preſents not it ſelfe vnto it for the moſt beneficiall vnto our life. The boldeſt ſects, both <hi>Epicurian, Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhonian</hi> and new <hi>Academike,</hi> when they have caſt their acoumpt, are compelled to ſtoope to the civill law. There are other ſubjects, which they have toſſed, ſome on the left and ſome on the right hand, each one labouring and ſtriving to give it ſome ſemblance, were it right or wrong: For, having found nothing ſo ſecret, whereof they have not attempted to ſpeake, they are many times forced to forge divers feeble and fond conjectures: Not that themſelves tooke them for a ground-worke, nor to eſtabliſh a truth, but for an exerciſe of their ſtudie. <hi>Non tam id ſenſiſſe, quod dicerent, quàm exercere ingenia materiae difficultate videntur voluiſſe. They ſeeme not ſo much to have thought as they ſaid, as rather willing to exerciſe their wits in the difficulty of the matter.</hi> And if it were not ſo taken, how ſhould we cloke ſo great an inconſtancie, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and vanity of opinions, which we ſee to have beene produced by theſe excellent and admirable ſpirits? As for example, <hi>What greater vanitie can there be, then to goe about by our proportions and coniectures to gueſſe at God? And to governe both him and the world according to our capacitie and lawes?</hi> And to vſe this ſmall ſcantlin of ſufficiencie, which he hath pleaſed to impart vnto our naturall condition, at the coſt and charges of divinitie? And becauſe we cannot extend our ſight ſo farre as his glorious throne, to haue removed him downe to our corruption and miſeries? Of all-humane and ancient opinions concerning religion, I thinke that to have had more likelyhood and excuſe, which knowledged and confeſſed God to be an incomprehenſible power, chiefe beginning and preſerver of all things; all goodnes, all perfection; accepting in good part the honour and reverence which mortall men did yeeld him, vnder what vſage, name and manner ſoever it was.</p>

Even ſo are ſome of our men falne into like errours by promiſing vnto themſelves after their reſurection a terreſtriall and temporall life, accompanied with al ſorts of pleaſures and worldly commodities. Shall we thinke that <hi>Plato,</hi> who had ſo heavenly conceptions, and was ſo well acquainted with Divinity, as of moſt he purchaſed the ſurname of Divine, was ever of opinion, that man (this ſeely and wretched creature man) had any one thing in him, which might in any ſort be applied, and ſuted to this incomprehenſible and vnſpeakable power? or ever imagined, that our languiſhing hold faſts were capable, or the vertue of our vnderſtanding of force, to participate or be partakers, either of the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or eternall puniſhment?

Happily they have another ſemblance and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther policie. <hi>Epicurus</hi> imagineth them either like or vnlike.

Other Nations there are, that never have vſe of fire? Others whoſe ſperme is of a blacke colour.

as <hi>Plato</hi> prooveth, that there is neither generation nor corruption in nature. <hi>Protagoras</hi> ſaith, there is nothing in Nature, but doubt: That a man may equally diſpute of all things: and of that alſo, whether all things may equally be diſputed of: <hi>Manſiphanes</hi> ſaid, that of things which ſeeme to be, no one thing, is no more, then it is not. That nothing is certaine, but vncertainty. <hi>Parmenides,</hi> that of that which ſeemeth, there is no one thing in Generall. That there is but one <hi>Zeno,</hi> that one ſelfe ſame is not: And that there is nothing. If one were he ſhould either be in another, or in himſelfe: if he be in another, then are they two: If he be in himſelfe, they are alſo two, the comprizing and the comprized. According to theſe rules or doctrines, the Nature of things is but a falſe or vaine ſhadow. I have ever thought, this manner of ſpeech in a Chriſtian, is full of indiſcretion and irreverence; God cannot die, God cannot gaine-ſay himſelfe, God cannot doe this or that. I cannot allow, a man ſhould ſo bound Gods heavenly power vnder the Lawes of our word. And that apparance, which in theſe propoſitions offers it ſelfe vnto vs, ought to be repreſented more reverently and more religiouſly. Our ſpeech hath his infirmities and defects, as all things elſe have. Moſt of the occaſions of this worlds troubles are Grammaticall. Our ſutes and proceſſes proceed but from the canvaſing and debating the interpretation of the Lawes, and moſt of our warres from the want of knowledge in State-counſellors, that could not cleerely diſtinguiſh and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſe the Covenants, and Conditions of accords, betweene Prince and Prince. How many weighty ſtrifes, and important quarrels, bath the doubt of this one ſilable, <hi>Hoc,</hi> brought forth in the world? examine the plaineſt ſentence, that Logike it ſelfe can preſent vnto vs. If you ſay, it is faire Weather, and in ſo ſaying, ſay true; it is faire Weather then. Is not thie a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme of ſpeech? Yet will it deceive vs: That it is ſo; Let vs follow the example: If you ſay, I lie, and that you ſhould ſay true, you lie then. The Arte, the reaſon, the force of the concluſion of this laſt, are like vnto the other; notwithſtanding we are entangled. I ſee the Pyrhonian Phyloſophers, who can by no manner of ſpeech expreſſe their General conceit: for, they had neede of a new language. Ours is altogether compoſed of affirmative propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are directly againſt them. So that, when they ſay, I doubt, you have them faſt by the throte to make them a vow, that at leaſt you are aſſured and know, that they doubt. So have they been compelled to ſave themſelves by this compariſon of Phyſicke, without which their conceite would be inexplicable and intricate. When they pronounce, I know not, or I doubt, they ſay, that this propoſition tranſportes it ſelfe together with the reſt, even as the Rewbarbe doeth, which ſcowred ill humours away, and therewith is carryed away himſelfe. This conceipt is more certainly conceived by an interrogation: What can I tell? As I beare it in an Impreſe of a paire of ballances. Note how ſome prevaile with this kinde of vnreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and vnhallowed ſpeach. In the diſputation, that are now-adayes in our religion, if you overmuch vrge the adverſaries, they will roundly tell you, that it lieth not in the power of God to make his body at once to be in Paradiſe and on earth, and in many other places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And how that ancient skoffer made profitable vſe of it. Atleaſt (ſaith he) it is no ſmall comfort vnto man, to ſee that God cannot doe all things; for he cannot kill himſelfe if he would, which is the greateſt benefite we have in our condition; he cannot make mortall men immortall, nor raiſe the dead to life againe, nor make him that hath lived, never to have lived, and him, who hath had honours, not to have had them, having no other right over what is paſt, but of ſorgetfulneſſe. And that this ſociety betweene God and Man; may alſo be combined with ſome pleaſant examples, he cannot make twiſe ten not to be twenty. See what he ſaith and which a Chriſtian ought to abhor, that ever ſuch and ſo profane words ſhould paſſe his mouth: Whereas on the contrary part, it ſeemeth that fond men endevour to finde out this fooliſh-boldneſſe of ſpeech, that ſo they may turne and winde God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to their meaſure.</p>

Truly there was ſome reaſon, this bridle or reſtraint of our judgements liberty, and this tyrannie over our beliefes ſhould extend it ſelfe even to ſchooles and arts. The God of ſcholaſticall learning,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12117:157"/>
is <hi>Aristotle:</hi> It is religion to debate of his ordinances, as of thoſe of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in <hi>Sparta.</hi> His doctrine is to vs as a canon Law, which peradventure is as falſe as another. I know not why I ſhould or might not, as ſoone, &amp; as eaſie accept, either <hi>Platoes Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atomes and indiviſible things, or the fulneſſe and emptineſſe of <hi>Leucippus</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Thales,</hi> or of <hi>Anaximanders</hi> infinite of nature, or the aire of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> or the numbers or proportion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or the infinite of <hi>Parmenides,</hi> or the ſingle-one of <hi>Muſaeus,</hi> or the water and fire of <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> or the ſimilarie and reſembling parts of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> or the diſcord and concord of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> or the fire of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> or any other opinion (of this infinit confuſion of opinions and ſentences, which this goodly humane reaſon, by her cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie and cleare-ſighted vigilancie brings forth in whatſoever it medleth withall) as I ſhould of <hi>Aristotles</hi> conceit, touching this ſubject of the principles of naturall things; which he frameth of three parts, that is to ſay, <hi>Matter, Forme,</hi> and <hi>Privation.</hi> And what greater vanitie can there be, then to make inanitie it ſelfe the cauſe of the production of things? Privation is a negative: With what humovr could he make it the cauſe and beginning of things that are? Yet durſt no man move that but for an exerciſe of Logike: Wherein nothing is diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put it in doubt, but to deſend the Author of the Schoole from ſtrange objections: His authoritie is the marke, beyond which it is not lawfull to enquire. It is eaſie to frame what one liſt vpon allowed foundations: For, according to the law and ordinance of this poſitive beginning, the other parts of the frame are eaſilie directed without crack or danger. By which way we finde our reaſon well grounded, and we diſcourſe without rub or let in the way: For our maſters preoccupate and gaine afore-hand as much place in our beliefe, as they need to conclude afterward what they pleaſe, as Geometricians doe by their graunted queſtions: The conſent and approbation which we lend them, giving them wherewith to draw vs, either on the right or left hand, and at their pleaſure to winde and turne vs. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is believed in his preſuppoſitions, he is our maſter, and our god: He will lay the plot of his foundations ſo ample and eaſie, that, if he liſt, he will carrie vs vp, even vnto the clouds. In this practiſe or negotiation of learning, we have taken the ſaying of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> for currant payment; which is, that <hi>every expert man ought to be believed in his owne trade.</hi> The Logitian referreth himſelfe to the Grammarian for the ſignification of words: The Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritian borroweth the places of arguments from the Logitian: The Poet his meaſures from the Muſitian: The Geometrician his proportions from the Arithmetician: The Metaphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſikes take the conjectures of the Phiſikes for a ground. For, every art hath her preſuppoſed principles, by which mans judgement is bridled on all parts. If you come to the ſhocke or front of this barre, in which conſiſts the principall error, they immediatly pronounce this ſentence; That <hi>there is no disputing againſt ſuch as denie principles.</hi> There can be no principles in men, except divinitie hath revealed them vnto them: All the reſt, both beginning, midle, and end, is but a dreame and a vapor. Thoſe that argue by preſuppoſition, we muſt preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt them, the verie ſame axiome, which is diſputed of. For, each humane preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and every invention, vnleſſe reaſon make a difference of it, hath as much authoritie as another. So muſt they all be equally balanced, and firſt the generall &amp; thoſe that tyrannize vs. <hi>A perſwaſion of certaintie, is a manifeſt teſtimonie of fooliſhneſſe, and of extreame vncertaintie.</hi> And no people are leſſe Philoſophers and more fooliſh, then <hi>Platoes</hi> Phylodoxes, or lovers of their owne opinions. We muſt know whether fire be hote, whether ſnow be white, whether in our knowledge there be any thing hard or ſoft. And touching the anſweres, whereof they tell old tales, as to him who made a doubt of heat, to whom one replied, that to trie he ſhould caſt himſelfe into the fire; to him that denied the yce to be cold, that he ſhould put ſome in his boſome; they are moſt vnworthie the profeſſion of a Philoſopher. If they had left vs in our owne naturall eſtate, admitting of ſtrange apparances, as they preſent themſelves vnto vs by our ſenſes, and had ſuffred vs to follow our naturall appetites, directed by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our birth, they ſhould then have reaſon to ſpeake ſo. But from them it is that we have learn't to become judges of the world; it is from them we hold this conceit, that mans reaſon is the generall controuller of all that is, both without and within heavens-vault; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all, and can doe all, by meanes whereof, all things are knowne and diſcerned. This anſwere were good among the Canibals, who without any of <hi>Aristotles</hi> precepts, or ſo much as knowing the name of naturall Philoſophie, enjoy moſt happily, a long, a quiet, &amp; a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life. This anſwere might happily availe more, and be of more force, then all thoſe they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:12117:158"/>
can borrow from their reaſon and invention. All living creatures, yea, beaſts and all, where the commaundement of the naturall law is yet pure and ſimple, might with vs be capable of this anſwere; but they have renounced it. They ſhall not need to tell me, it is true, for you both heare and ſee, that it is ſo: They muſt tell me, if what I thinke I feel, I feel the ſame in effect; and if I feel it, then let them tell me, wherefore I feel it, and how and what: Let them tell me the name, the beginning, the tennons, and the abuttings of heat and of cold, with the qualities of him that is agent, or of the patient; or let them quit me their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is neither to admit, nor approve any thing, but by the way of reaſon: It is their touch ſtone, to trie all kinds of Eſſayes. But ſurely it is a touchſtone full of falſehood, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, imperfection and weakneſſe: which way can we better make triall of it, then by it ſelfe? If ſhe may not be credited ſpeaking of hir ſelfe, hardly can ſhe be fit to judge of ſtrange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: If ſhe know any thing, it can be but hir being and domicile. She is in the ſoule, and either a part or effect of the ſame. For, the true and eſſentiall reaſon (whoſe name we ſteal by falſe ſignes) lodgeth in Gods boſome: There is hir home, and there is hir retreat, thence ſhe takes hir flght, when Gods pleaſure is that we ſhall ſee ſome glimps of it: Even as <hi>Pallas</hi> iſſued out of hir fathers head, to communicate and empart hir ſelfe vnto the world. Now let vs ſee what mans reaſon hath taught vs of hir ſelfe and of the ſoule: Not of the ſoule in generall, whereof well nigh all Philoſophie maketh both the celeſtiall and firſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies partakers; nor of that which <hi>Thales</hi> attributed even vnto things, that are reputed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoule or life, drawne therevnto by the conſideration of the Adamant ſtone: But of that which appertaineth to vs, and which we ſhould know beſt.</p>

Behold the Stoickes, fathers of humane wiſedome, who deviſe that the ſoule of man, overwhelmed with any ruine, laboureth and panteth a long time to get out, vnable to free hirſelfe from that charge, even as a Mouſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a trap. Some are of opinion, that the world was made, to give a bodie in lieu of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, vnto the ſpirits, which through their fault were fallen from the puritie, wherin they were created: The firſt creation having been incorporeall. And that according as they have more or leſſe remooved themſelves from their ſpiritualtie, ſo are they more or leſſe merilie and Giovially, or rudely &amp; Saturnally incorporated: Whence proceedeth the infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſo much matter created. But the ſpirit, who for his chaſtizement was inveſted with the bodie of the Sunne, muſt of neceſſitie have a verie rare and particular meaſure of alteration. The extreamities of our curious ſearch turne to a glimmering and all to a dazeling. As <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke</hi> ſaith, of the off-ſpring of Hiſtories, that after the manner of Cardes or Maps, the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt limits of knowne Countries, are ſet downe to be full of thicke marriſh grounds, ſtadie forreſts, deſert and vncouth places. See heer wherefore the groſeſt and moſt Childiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, are more commonly found in theſe which treat of higheſt and furtheſt matters; even confounding &amp; overwhelming themſelves in their owne curioſitie &amp; preſumption. The end and beginning of learning are equally accompted fooliſh. Marke but how <hi>Plato</hi> takethand raiſeth his flight aloft in his Poeticall clouds, or cloudie Poeſies. Behold &amp; read in him the gibbriſh of the Gods. But what dream'd or doted he on, when he defined man, to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with two feet, and without feathers; giving them that were diſpoſed to mocke at him, a pleaſant and ſcopefull occaſion to doe-it? For, having plucked-off the feathers of a live ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, they named him the man of <hi>Plato.</hi> And by what ſimplicitie did the Epicureans firſt imagine, that the Atomes or Motes, which they termed to be bodies, having ſome weight and a naturall mooving downward, had framed the world; vntill ſuch time as they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by their adverſaries, that by this deſcription, it was not poſſible, they ſhould joyne and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:12117:159"/>
take hold one of another; their fall being ſo downe-right and perpendicular, and every way engendring Parallell lines? And therefore was it neceſſarie, they ſhould afterward adde a caſuall moving, ſideling vnto them: And moreover to give their Atomes crooked and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tailes, that ſo they might take hold of any thing and claſpe themſelves. And even then, thoſe that purſue them with this other conſideration, do they not much trouble them? If Atomes have by chance formed ſo many ſorts of figures, why did they never meet together to frame a houſe, or make a ſhooe? Why ſhould we not likewiſe believe that an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of greek Letters confuſedly ſcattred in ſome open place, might one day meet and joine together to the contexture of th'Iliads? That which is capable of reaſon (ſaith <hi>Zeno</hi>) is better than that which is not. <hi>There is nothing better then the world: then the world is capable of reaſon.</hi> By the ſame arguing <hi>Cotta</hi> maketh the world a Mathematician, and by this other arguing of <hi>Zeno,</hi> he makes him a Muſition, and an Organiſt. The whole is more than the part: We are capable of Wiſedome, and we are part of the World: Then the World is wiſe. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit like examples ſeen, not only of falſe, but fooliſh arguments, which cannot hold, &amp; which accuſe their authors not ſo much of ignorance, as of folly, in the reproches that Philoſophers charge one another with, about the diſagreeings in their opinions and Sects. He that ſhould fardle-vp a bundle or huddle of the fooleries of mans wiſedome, might recount wonders. I willingly aſſemble ſome (as a ſhew or patterne) by ſome meanes or byaſe, no leſſe profitable then the moſt moderate inſtructions. Let vs by that judge, what we are to eſteeme of man, of his ſenſe, and of his reaſon; ſince in theſe great men, and who have raiſed mans ſufficiencie ſo high, there are found ſo groſe errors, and ſo apparant defects. As for me, I would rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they have thus caſually treated learning, even as a ſporting childs babie, and have ſported themſelves with reaſon, as of a vaine and frivolous inſtrument, ſetting forth all ſorts of inventions, deviſes, and fantaſies, ſomtimes more outſtretched, and ſomtimes more looſe. The ſame <hi>Plato,</hi> who defineth man like vnto a Capon, ſaith elſewhere after <hi>Socrates,</hi> that in good ſooth, he knoweth not what man is; and that of all parts of the world, there is none ſo hard to be knowne. By this varictie of conceits &amp; inſtabilitie of opinions, they (as it were) leade vs cloſely by the hand to this reſolution of their irreſolution. They make a profeſſion not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to preſent their adviſe manifeſt &amp; vnmasked: they have oft concealed the ſame vnder the fabulous ſhadows of Poeſie, and ſomtimes vnder other vizards. For our imperfection admitteth this alſo, that raw meats are not alwaies good for our ſtomacks: but they muſt be dried, altred and corrupted, and ſo do they, who ſomtimes ſhadow their ſimple opinions and judgements; And that they may the better ſute themſelves vnto common vſe, they many times falſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

They will not make open profeſſion of ignorance, and of the imbecilitie of mans reaſon, becauſe they will not make children afraid: But they manifeſtly declare the ſame vnto vs vnder the ſhew of a troubled Science and vnconſtant learning. I perſwade ſome body in <hi>Italy,</hi> who laboured very much to ſpeak Italian, that alwaies provided, he deſired but to be vnderſtood, and not to ſeek to excell others therein, he ſhould only imploy &amp; vſe ſuch words as came firſt to his mouth, whether they were Latine, French, Spaniſh, or Gaſcoine, and that adding the Italian terminations vnto them, he ſhould never miſſe to fall vpon ſome idiome of the Countrie, either Tuſcan, Roman, Venetian, Piemontoiſe, or Neapolitan; and amongſt ſo many ſeverall formes of ſpeech to take hold of one. The verie ſame I ſay of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie. She hath ſo many faces, and ſo much varietie, and hath ſaid ſo much, that all our dreames and deviſes are found in hir.

Firſt, becauſe we doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely remember what we are taught, and that if memorie did meerely execute hir function, ſhe would at leaſt ſuggeſt vs with ſomething beſides our learning. Secondly, what ſhe knew being in hir puritie, was a true vnderſtanding, knowing things as they are, by hir divine intelligence: Whereas heer, if ſhe be inſtructed, ſhe is made to receive lies and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vice, wherein ſhe cannot imploy hir memorie; this image and conception, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had place in hir.

this ſubject, no more then all the ancients in Generall, who handle the ſame with a verie wavering beliefe: <hi>Rem gratiſſimam promittentium magis quàm probantium. Who rather promiſe then approve a thing moſt acceptable.</hi> He hath hidden himſelfe vnder the clouds of intricare and ambiguous words, and vnintelligible ſenſes, and hath left his Sectaries as much cauſe to diſpute vpon his judgement, as vpon the matter. Two things made this his opinion plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to them: the one, that without the immortalitie of ſoules, there ſhould no meanes be left to ground or ſettle the vaine hopes of glorie; a conſideration of wonderfull credite in the world: the other (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) that it is a moſt profitable impreſſion, that views, when they ſteal away from out the ſight and knowledge of humane juſtice, remaine ever as a blancke before divine juſtice, which even after the death of the guiltie, will ſeverely purſue them. <hi>Man is ever poſſeſſed with an extreame deſtre to prolong his being, and hath to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his skill provided for it,</hi> Toombs and Monuments are for the preſervation of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and glorie for the continuance of his name.

It is to be imagined and firmlie believed (ſaith he) that the ſoules of men, vertuous both according vnto nature and divine Iuſtice, become of Men, Saints, and of Saints, Demi-Gods and after they are once perfectly, as in ſacrifices of purgation, cleanged and purified, being delivered from all paſſibility and mortalitie, they become of Demy-Gods (not by any civill ordinance, but in good truth, and according to manifeſt reaſon) perfect and very-very Gods; receiving a moſt bleſſed and thriſe glorious end.

But to bring this ſeede to effect, how many contrary opinions make they of it? <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> hold, that women have no ſperme, that it is but a ſweate, which by reaſon of the pleaſure, and frication they caſt forth, and availeth nothing in generation.</p>

In my time, ſuch as have any rare excellency above others, or extraordinary vivacity, we ſee them almoſt all ſo laviſh and vnbridled in licence of opinions and maners, as it may be counted a wonder to finde any one ſetled and ſociable. There is great reaſon why the ſpirit of man ſhould be ſo ſtrictly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In his ſtudy, as in all things elſe he muſt have his ſteps numbered and ordered. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites of his purſuite muſt be cut out by Arte.

It is a vaine body, that hath no way about him to be ſeized on, or cut off: a diverſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed body, on which neither knot nor hold may be faſtened. Verily thereare few ſoules, ſo orderly, ſo conſtant, and ſo well borne, as may be truſted with their owne conduct, and may with moderation, and without raſhneſſe, ſaile in the liberty of their judgements beyond common opinions. It is more expedient to give ſome body the charge and tuition of them. <hi>The ſpirit is an outragious glaive, yea even to his owne poſſeſſor, except he have the grace, very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and diſcreetely to arme himſelfe therewith.</hi> And there is no beaſt, to whom one may more juſtly apply a blinding bord, to keepe her ſight in, and force her looke to her foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and keepe from ſtraying here and there, without the tracke which vſe and lawes trace hir out.

And foraſmuch as by the ſame way, faſhion and conduct, errours are received into our ſoule, ſhe hath not wherewithall to diſtinguiſh them, nor whereby to chuſe the truth from falſhood. The Academikes received ſome inclination of judgement, and found it over raw, to ſay, it was no more likely, ſnow ſhould be white then blacke, and that we ſhould be no more aſſured of the moving of a ſtone, which goeth from our hand, then of that of the eight Spheare. And to avoide this difficulty and ſtrangeneſſe, which in trueth can not but hardly lodge in our imagination, how beit they eſtabliſh, that we were no way capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in the deepeſt Abyſſes, where mans ſight can no way enter; yet avowed they ſomethings to be more likely and poſſible then others, and received this faculty in their judgement, that they might rather encline to one apparance then to an other. They allowed hir this propenſion, interdicting hir all reſolution. The Pyrrhoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans adviſe is more hardy, and therewithall more likely. For this Academicall inclination, and this propenſion rather to one then another propoſition, what elſe is it, then a reacknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of ſome apparant truth, in this than in that? If our vnderſtanding be capable of the forme, of the lineaments, of the behaviour and face of truth; it might as well ſee it all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, as but halfe, growing and imperfect. For this apparance of veriſimilitude, which makes them rather take the left then the right hand, doe you augment it; this one ounce of likelyhood, which turnes the ballance, doe you multiply it, by a hundred, nay by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ounces; it will in the end come to paſſe, that the ballance will abſolutely reſolve and conclude one choiſe and perfect truth. But how do they ſuffer themſelves to be made tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by likelyhood if they know not truth? <hi>How know they the ſemblance of that, wherof they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the eſſence?</hi> Either we are able to judge abſolutely, or abſolutly we cannot.

Now if on our part we receive any thing without alteration; if mans hold-faſts were capable and ſuficiently powerfull, by our proper meanes to ſeize on truth, thoſe meanes being common to all; this truth would ſucceſſively remove it ſelfe from one to an other. And of ſo many things as are in the world, at leaſt one ſhould be found, that by an vniverſall conſent ſhould be believed of all. But that no propoſition is feene, which is not controverſied and debated amongſt vs or that may not be, declareth plainly, that our judgment doth not abſolutely and cleerely ſeize on that which it ſeizeth: for my judgement cannot make my fellowes judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive the ſame: which is a ſigne, that I have ſeized vpon it by ſome other meane then by a naturall power in me or other men.

How diverſly judge we of things? How often change we our fantaſies? What I hold and believe this day, I believe and hold with all my beleefe: all my implements, ſprings and motions, embrace and claſpe this opinion, and to the vtmoſt of their power warrant the ſame: I could not poſſibly embrace any verity, nor with more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance keepe it, then I doe this.

                        <p>It is not onely fevers, drinkes and great accidents, that over-whelme our judgment: The leaſt things in the world wil turne it topſiturvie.

If an Apoplexie doth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtupifie, and extinguiſh the ſight of our vnderſtanding, it is not to be doubted but a cold and rhume will likewiſe dazle the ſame. And by conſequence, hardly ſhall a man in all his life finde one houre, wherein our judgement may alwaies be found in his right byaſe, our body being ſubiect to ſo many continuall alterations, and ſtuft with ſo divers ſortes of ginnes and motions, that, giving credit to Phiſitions, it is very hard to finde one in perfect plight, and that doth not alwaies miſtake his marke and ſhute wide.

You relate ſimply your caſe vnto a Lawyer, he anſwers faltring and doubtfully vnto it, whereby you perceive it is indifferent vnto him to defend either this, or that ſide, all is one to him: Have you paid him well, have you given him a good baite or fee, to make him earneſtly apprehend it, beginnes he to be intereſſed in the matter, is his will moved, or his minde enflamed? Then will his reaſon be moved, and his knowledge enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med withall.

Shall I tell you?

Dares nos Philoſophie thinke that men produce their greateſt effects, and neareſt approching to divinitie, when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves, furious, and madde? We amend our ſelves by the privation of reaſon, and by hir drooping. The two naturall waies, to enter the cabinet of the Gods, and there to fore-ſee the courſe of the deſtinies, are furie and ſleepe. This is very pleaſing to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. By the diſlocation, that paſſions bring vnto our reaſon, we become vertuous; by the extirpation, which either furie or the image of death bringeth vs, we become Prophets and Divines. I never beleeved it more willingly. It is a meere divine inſpiration, that ſacred truth hath inſpired in a Philoſophicall ſpirit, which againſt his propoſition exacteth from him; that the quiet ſtate of our ſoule, the beſt-ſettled eſtate, yea the healthfulleſt that Philoſophie can acquire vnto it, is not the beſt eſtate. <hi>Our vigilancie is more drouzie, then ſleepe it ſelfe: Our wiſedome leſſe wiſe, then folly; our dreames of more worth then our diſcourſes.</hi> The worſt place we can take, is in our ſelves. But thinkes it not, that we have the foreſight to marke, that the voyce, which the ſpirit vttereth, when he is gone from man, ſo cleare ſighted, ſo great, and ſo perfect, and whilſt he is in man, ſo earthly, ſo ignorant, and ſo overclouded, is a voyce proceeding from the ſpirit, which is in earthly, ignorant, and over clouded man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a truſtles and not to be-beleeved voyce? I have no great experience in theſe violent agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being of a ſoft and dull complex on; the greateſt part of which, without giving it leaſure to acknowledge hir ſelfe, doe ſodainly ſurpriſe our ſoule. But that paſſion, which in yoong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hartes is ſaid, to be produced by idlenes, although it march but leaſurly, and with a meaſured progreſſe, doth evidently preſent to thoſe, that have aſſaid to oppoſe themſelves againſt hir endevor, the power of the converſion and alteration, which our judgement ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I have ſome times enterpriſed to arme my ſelfe with a reſolution to abide, reſiſt, and ſup preſſe the ſame. For, I am ſo farre from being in their ranke, that call and allure vices, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they entertaine me, I ſcarcely follow them. I felt it, mauger my reſiſtance, to breed, to growe, and to augment; and in the end being in perfect health, and cleare-ſighted, to ſeize-vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and poſſeſſe me; in ſuch ſort, that, as in dronkennes, the image of things, began to appeare vnto me, otherwiſe then it was wont: I ſawe the advantages of the ſubject, I ſought after, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to ſwell and growe greater, and much to encreaſe by the winde of my imagination; and the difficulties of my enterpriſe to become more eaſie and plaine; and my diſcourſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſhrinke and draw-backe.

                        <p>Now by the knowledge of my volubilitie, I have by accidence engendred ſome conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of opinions in my ſelfe; yet have not ſo much altered my firſt and naturall ones. For, what apparance ſoever there be in noveltie, I doe not eaſily change, for feare I ſhould looſe by the bargaine: And ſince I am not capable to chuſe, I take the choiſe from others; and keepe my ſelfe in the ſeate, that God hath placed me in. Elſe could I hardly keepe my ſelfe from continuall rowling. Thus have I by the grace of God preſerved my ſelfe whole (without agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or trouble of conſcience) in the ancient beliefe of our religion, in the middeſt of ſo many ſects and diviſions, which our age hath brought forth. The writings of the ancient fathers (I meane the good, the ſolide, and the ſerious) doe tempt, and in a manner remove me which way they liſt. Him that I heare ſeemeth ever the moſt forcible. I finde them everie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one in his turne to have reaſon, although they contrarie one another. That facilitie, which good wittes have to prove any thing they pleaſe, likely; and that there is nothing ſo ſtrange, but they will vndertake to ſet ſo good a gloſſe on it, as it ſhall eaſily deceive a ſimplicitie like vnto mine, doth manifeſtly ſhew the weakenes of their proofe. The heavens and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets have moved theſe three thouſand yeares, and all the world believed as much, vntill <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes</hi> the <hi>Samian,</hi> or elſe (according to <hi>Thcophraſtus) Nicetas</hi> the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> tooke vpon him to maintaine, it was the earth that moved, by the oblique circle of the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hir axell tree.

told me, that all our forefathers had notoriouſly abuzed themſelves in the nature and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the windes, which, if I would liſten vnto him, he would manifeſtly make me perceve. After I had with ſome patience given attendance to his Arguments, which were indeed full of likely-hood, I demaunded of him, whether they that failed according to <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> his Lawes, went weſtward, when they bent their courſe eaſtward? Or whether they failed ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or backeward? It is fortune, anſwered he, but ſo it is they tooke their marke amiſſe: To whom I then replyed, that I had rather follow the effects, then his reaſon. They are things that often ſhocke together: and it hath beene told me, that in Geometrie (which ſuppoſeth to have gained the high point of certainty amongſt al ſciences) there are found vnavoidable Demonſtrations, and which ſubvert the truth of all experience: As <hi>Iames Peletier</hi> tolde me in mine owne houſe, that he had found out two lines, bending their courſe one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as if they would meete and joyne together; nevertheleſſe he affirmed, that even vnto infinity, they could never come to touch one another. And the Pyrrhonians vſe their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and Reaſon, but to deſtroy the apparance of experience: And it is a wonder to ſee how farre the ſuppleneſſe of our reaſon, hath in this deſigne followed them, to reſiſt the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of effects: For, they affirme, that wee moove not, that we ſpeake not, that there is no weight, nor heate, with the ſame force of arguing, that we averre the moſt likelyeſt things. <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who was an excellent man, had eſtabliſhed the boundes of the world; All anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Phyloſophers have thought they had a perfect meaſure thereof, except it were certaine ſcattered Ilandes, which might eſcape their knowledge: It had bin to Pyrrhonize a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres agoe, had any man gone abut to make a queſtion of the arte of Coſmography: and the opinions that have beene received thereof, of all men in Generall: It had beene flat hereſie to avouch, that there were Antipodes. See how in our age an infinite greatneſſe of firme land hath beene diſcovered, not an Iland onely, nor one particular country, but a parte in greatneſſe verie neere equall vnto that which wee knewe.

The Aegyptian Prieſts, told <hi>Heredotus,</hi> that ſince their firſt King, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven thouſand and odde yeares (when they made him ſee the pictures of all their former Kings, drawne to the life in ſtatues) the Sunne had changed his courſe foure times: That the ſea and the earth do enterchangeably change one into another; that the worldes birth is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined: The like ſaid, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> And ſome one amongſt vs averreth, that it is altogether eternall, mortall, and new reviving againe, by many Viciſſitudes, calling <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> to witneſſe: avoyde theſe oppoſitions, that God hath ſometimes beene a Creator without a creature: that he hath beene idle; that hee hath vnſaide his idleneſſe, by ſetting his hand to this worke, and that by conſequence he is ſubject vnto change. In the moſt famous Schooles of <hi>Greece,</hi> the World is reputed a God, framed by another greater and mightier God, and is compoſed of a body and a ſoule, which abideth in his centre, ſpreading it ſelfe by Muſicall numbers vnto his circumference, divine, thriſe-happy, very great, moſt wiſe and eternall. In it are other Gods, as the Sea, the earth, and plants, which mutually entertaine one another, with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and celeſtial dance; ſomtimes mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, othertimes farre-ſundering themſelves; now hiding then ſhewing themſelves; and changing place, now forward, now backward. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> firmely maintained, that the World was compoſed of fire, and by the deſtinies order, it ſhould one day burſt forth into flames, and be ſo conſumed into cinders, and another day it ſhould be new borne againe.

invention, fit to combine their ſocietie, then in declaring (as he did) to thoſe which ſought the inſtruction of it, by his ſacred Tripos, that the true worſhipping of God, was that, which he found to be obſerved by the cuſtome of the place, where he lived? Oh God, what bond, or dutie is it, that we owe not vnto our Soveraigne Creators benignitie, in that he hath beene pleaſed to cleare and enfranchize our beliefe from thoſe vagabonding and arbitrary devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; fixt it vpon the eternall Baſe of his holy word? What will Philoſophie then ſay to vs in this neceſſity? that we follow the lawes of our country, that is to ſay, this waving ſea of a peoples or of a Princes opinions, which ſhall paint me forth juſtice with as many colours, and reforme the ſame into as many viſages as there are changes and alterations of paſſions in them. I cannot have my judgement ſo flexible. What goodneſſe is that, which but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I ſaw in credite and eſteeme, and to morrow, to have loſt all reputation, and that the croſſing of a River, is made a crime? What truth is that, which theſe Mountaines bound, and is a lie in the World beyond them? But they are pleaſant, when to allow the Laws ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie, they ſay, that there be ſome firme, perpetuall and immoveable, which they call natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and by the condition of their proper eſſence, are imprinted in man-kinde: of which ſome make three in number, ſome, foure ſome more, ſome leſſe: an evident token, that it is a marke as doubtfull as the reſt. Now are they ſo vnfortunate (for, how can I terme that but misfortune, that of ſo infinite a number of lawes, there is not ſo much as one to be found, which the fortune or temeritie of chance hath graunted to be vniverſally received, and by the conſent and vnanimitie of all Nations to be admitted?) They are (I ſay) ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that of theſe three or foure choiſe-ſelected lawes, there is not one alone, that is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned or diſallowed, not by one nation, but by many. Now is the generalitie of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the onely likely enſigne, by which they may argue ſome lawes to be naturall: For, what nature had indeede ordained vs, that ſhould we doubtleſſe follow with one common conſent; and not one onely nation, but every man in particular, ſhould have a feeling of the force and violence, which he ſhould vrge him with, that would incite him to contrary and reſiſt that Law. Let them all (for examples ſake) ſhew me but one of this condition. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras</hi> and <hi>Ariſton</hi> gave the juſtice of the lawes no other eſſence, but the authoritie and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Law-giver, and that excepted, both Good and Honeſt loſt their qualities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but vaine and idle names, of indifferent things. <hi>Thraſymachus</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> thinkes there is no other right, but the commoditie of the ſuperiour.

A man of worth, going about by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to approve the ſearch of the Philoſophers ſtone, (wherein he was overwhelmd) aleaged at leaſt five or ſix ſeveral paſſages out of the holy bible vnto me, vpon which (he ſaid) he had at firſt grounded himſelfe, for the diſcharge of his conſcience (for he is a man of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal profeſſion) &amp; truly, the invention of them, was not only pleaſant, but alſo very fitly applied to the defence of this goodly &amp; mind-inchanting ſcience. This way is the credit of divining fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles attained to. There is no prognoſticator, if he have but this authority, that any one wil but voutſafe to reade him over, and curiouſly to ſearch all the infoldings and luſtres of his words, but a man ſhall make him ſay what he pleaſeth, as the Sibilles.

                           </gap>alitie, or affection, which is hardly to be had among Chriſtians; ſo hapneth it in this: For if he be old, he cannot judge of ages ſenſe; himſelfe being a party in this controverſie: and ſo if he be yoong, healthy, ſicke ſleeping or waking, it is all one: We had need of ſome body void and exempted from all theſe qualities, that without any preoccupation of judgement might judge of theſe propoſitions as indifferent vnto him: By which accoumpt we ſhould have a Iudge, that were no man. To judge of the apparances that we receive of ſubjects, we had neede have a judicatorie inſtrumentito verifie this inſtrument, we ſhould have demonſtration; and to approove demonſtration, an inſtrument: thus are wee ever turning round. Since the ſenſes cannot determine our diſputation, themſelves being ſo ful of vncertaintie, it muſt then be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And no reaſon can be eſtabliſhed without another reaſon: then are we ever going backe vnto infinity. Our fantaſie doth not apply it ſelf to ſtrange things, but is rather conceived by the interpoſition of ſenſes; and ſenſes cannot comprehend a ſtrange ſubject; Nay not ſo much as their owne paſſions; and ſo, nor the fantaſie, nor the apparance is the ſubjects, but rather the paſſions only, and ſufferance of the ſenſe: which paſſion and ſubject are diverſe things: Therefore <hi>who iudgeth by apparances, iudgeth by a thing, different from the ſubiect.</hi> And to ſay, that the ſenſes paſſions referre the qualitie of ſtrange ſubjects by reſemblance vnto the ſoule: How can the ſoule and the vnderſtanding reſt aſſured of that reſemblance, having of itſelfe no commerce with forraigne ſubjects? Even as he that knowes not <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſeeing his picture cannot ſay that it reſembleth him. And would a man judge by apparances, be it by all it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; for by their contraries and differences they hinder one another, as we ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. May it be that ſome choice apparances rule and direct the others? This choyſe muſt be verified by an other choyſe, the ſecond by a third: and ſo ſhall we never make an end. In few, <hi>there is no constant existence, neither of our being, nor of the obiects.</hi> And we, and our judgement, and al mortal things els do vnceſſantly rowle turne and paſſe away. Thus can nothing be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely eſtabliſhed, nor of the one, nor of the other; both the judging and the judged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in continuall alteration and motion. Wee have no communication with being; for every humane nature is ever in the middle betweene being borne and dying; giving nothing of it ſelfe but an obſcure apparance and ſhaddow, and an vncertaine and weake opinion. And if perhappes you fix your thought to take it's being; it would be even, as if one ſhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to graſpe the water: for, how much the more he ſhall cloſe and preſſe that, which by its owne nature is ever gliding, ſo much the more he ſhall looſe what he would hold and faſten. Thus, ſeeing all things are ſubject to paſſe from one change to another; reaſon, which therein ſeeketh a reall ſubſiſtance, findes hir ſelfe deceived as vnable to apprehend any thing ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and permanent: forſomuch as each thing eyther commeth to a being, and is not yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; or beginneth to dy before it be borne. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that bodies had never an exiſtence but in deede a birth, ſuppoſing that <hi>Homer</hi> made the <hi>Ocean</hi> Father, and <hi>Thet is</hi> Mother of the Gods, thereby to ſhew-vs, that all things are in continuall motion, change and variation. As he ſaith, a common opinion amongſt all the Philoſophers before his time; Only <hi>Parmenides,</hi> excepted, who denied any motion to be in things; of whoſe power he maketh no ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that each thing or matter was ever gliding, and labile. The Stoickes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, there is no preſent time, and that which we call preſent, is but conjoyning and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of future time &amp; paſt. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> averreth that no man ever entred twiſe one ſame river. <hi>Epicarmus</hi> avowcheth, that who erewhile borrowed any mony, doth not now owe it: and that he who yeſternight was bidden to dinner this day, commeth to day vnbidden; ſince they are no more themſelves, but are become others: and that one mortall ſubſtance could not twiſe be found in one ſelf ſtate: for by the ſodaineſſe and lightneſſe of change, ſomtimes it waſteth, and othertimes it re-aſſembleth; now it comes and now it goes; in ſuch ſort, that he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be borne, never comes to the perfection of being. For, this being borne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth never to an end, nor ever ſtayeth as being at an end; but after the ſeede proceedeth continually in change and alteration from one to another. As of mans ſeede, there is firſt made a ſhapeleſſe fruit in the Mothers Wombe, than a ſhapen Childe, then being out of the Wombe, a ſucking babe, afterward he becommeth a ladde, then conſequently a ſtriplin, then a full-growne man, then an old man, and in the end an aged decrepite man. So that age and ſubſequent generation goeth ever vndoing and waſting the precedent.</p>

                        <p>And when wee do fooliſhile feare a kinde of death, when as wee have already paſt, and dayly paſſe ſo many others. For, not only (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ſaid) the death of fire is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ayre; and the death of ayre, a generation of Water. But alſo we may moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee it in our ſelves. The flower of age dieth, fadeth and fleeteth, when age comes vpon vs, and youth endeth in the flower of a full growne mans age: Child-hood in youth, and the firſt age, dieth in infancie: and yeſter-day endeth in this day, and to day ſhall die in to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And <hi>nothing remaineth or ever continueth in one ſtate.</hi> For to proove it, if we ſhould ever continue one and the ſame, how is it then, that now we rejoyce at one thing, and now at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? How comes it to paſſe, we love things contrary, or we hate them, or we love them, or we blame them? How is it, that we have different affections, holding no more the ſame ſence in the ſame thought? For it is not likely, that without alteration we ſhould take other paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>What admitteth alterations, continueth not the ſame:</hi> and if it be not one ſelfe ſame, than is it not: but rather with being all one, the ſimple being doth alſo change, ever becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming other from other. And by conſequence Natures ſenſes are deceived and lie falſely; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what appeareth for what is; for want of truely knowing what it is that is. But then what is it, that is indeed? That which is eternall, that is to ſay, that which never had birth, nor ever ſhall have end; and to which no time can bring change or cauſe alteration. For time is a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing, and which appeareth as in a ſhadow, with the matter ever gliding, alwaies fluent, without ever being ſtable or permanent; to whom rightly belong theſe termes, <hi>Before</hi> and <hi>After:</hi> and it <hi>Hath beene,</hi> or <hi>Shall be.</hi> Which at firſt ſight doth manifeſtly ſhew, that it is not a thing, which is; for, it were great ſottiſhneſſe, and apparant falſe-hood, to ſay, that that is which is not yet in being, or that already hath ceaſed from being. And concerning theſe words, <hi>Preſent, Inſtant, Even-now,</hi> by which it ſeemes, that eſpecially we vphold and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ground the intelligence of time; reaſon diſcovering the ſame, doth forth with deſtroy it: for preſently it ſevereth it aſunder and divideth it into future and paſt-time, as willing to ſee it neceſſarily parted in two. As much happeneth vnto nature, which is meaſured according vnto time, which meaſureth hir: for no more is there any thing in hir, that remaineth or is ſubſiſtent: rather all things in hir are either borne or ready to be borne, or dying. By meanes whereof, it were a ſinne to ſay of God, who is the only that is, that he was or ſhalbe: for theſe words are declinations, paſſages, or Viciſſitudes of that, which cannot laſt, nor continue in being. Wherfore we muſt conclude; <hi>that onely God is, not according to any meaſure of time, but according to an immoovable and immutable eternity, not meaſured by time, nor ſubiect to any decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, before whom nothing is, nor nothing ſhall be after, nor more now nor more recent, but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being: which by one onely</hi> Now <hi>or</hi> Preſent, <hi>filleth the</hi> Ever, <hi>and there is nothing that truly is, but the alone:</hi> Without ſaying, he hath beene, or he ſhall be, without beginning, and ſans ending. To this ſo religious concluſion of a heathen man, I will onely adde this word, taken from a teſtimony of the ſame condition, for an end of this long and period of this tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which might well furniſh me with endleſſe matter. <hi>Oh what a vile and abiect thing is man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vnleſſe he raiſe himſelfe aboue humanity!</hi> Obſerve here a notable ſpeech, and a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deſire; but likewiſe abſurd. For to make the handful greater than the hand and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced greater then the arme; and to hope to ſtraddle more than our legs length; is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and monſtious: nor that man ſhould mount over and above himſelfe or humanity; for, he cannot ſee but with his owne eies, nor take hold but with his owne armes. He ſhall raiſe himſelfe vp, if it pleaſe God extraordinarily to lend him his helping hand. He may elevate himſelfe by forſaking and renouncing his owne meanes, and ſuffering himſelfe to be elevated and raiſed by meere heavenly meanes. It is for our Chriſtian faith, not for his Stoicke vertue to pretend or aſpire to this divine Metamorphoſis, or miraculous tranſmutation.</p>

She never ceaſeth to ring in our eares, that others have beene ſicker, and yet have not died; the cauſe is not ſo deſperate as it is taken; and if the worſt happen, God hath done greater wonders.

                        <p>It is a degree of conſtancie, vnto which I have experienced to arrive, as thoſe that caſt themſelves into danger, or into the Sea, with cloſed eyes. In mine opinion, there is nothing more worthy the noting in <hi>Socrates</hi> life, then to have had thirtie whole dayes to ruminate his deaths-decree, to have digeſted it all that while, with an aſſured hope, without diſmay or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and with a courſe of actions and words, rather ſuppreſt; and looſe-hanging, then out-ſtretched and raiſed by the weight of ſuch a cogitation. That <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> to whome <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth, being ſicke, cauſed <hi>Agrippa</hi> his ſonne in lawe, and two or three of his other friends to be called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, to whom he ſaid; that having aſſaied, how he got nothing in going about to be cured, and what he did to prolong his life did alſo lengthen and augment his griefe, he was now determined to make an end of one and other; intreating them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his determination, and that by no meanes, they would looſe their labour to diſſwade him from it. And having choſen to end his life by abſtinence, his ſickenes was cured by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; The remedy he had employed to make himſelfe away, brought him to health againe. The Phyſitions, and his friendes, glad of ſo happy a ſucceſſe, and rejoycing thereof with him, were in the end greatly deceived; for, with all they could doe, they were never able to make him alter his former opinion, ſaying, that as he muſt one day paſſe that cariere, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſo forward, he would remoove the care, another time to beginne againe. This man having with great leaſure apprehended death, is not onely no whit diſcouraged, when hee comes to front it, but reſolutely falles vpon it: for, being ſatisfied of that, for which he was entred the combate, in a braverie he thruſt himſelfe into it, to ſee the end of it. It is farre from fearing death, to goe about to taſte and ſavour the ſame. The hiſtorie of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, is much like to this. His gummes being ſwolne, his Phyſitions perſwaded him to vſe great abſtinence; having faſted two dayes, he was ſo well amended, as they told him he was well, and might returne to his wonted courſe of life. He contrarily, having already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſome ſweetenes in this fainting, reſolveth not to draw backe, but finiſh what he had ſo well begunne, and was ſo farre waded into. <hi>Tullius Marcellinus,</hi> a yoong Romane Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, willing to prevent the houre of his deſtiny, to ridde himſelfe of a diſeaſe, which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him more than he would endure, although Phyſitions promiſed certainely to cure him, howbeit not ſodainely; called his friends vnto him to determine about it: ſome (ſaieth <hi>Seneca</hi>) gave him that counſell, which for weakeneſſe of heart, themſelves would have taken others for flatterie that, which they imagined would be moſt pleaſing vnto him: but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

And for the reſt, there needed neither yron nor blood, he vndertooke to depart from this life, not by running from it: Not to eſcape from death, but to taſte it. And to have leiſure to condition or bargaine with death, having quit all manner of nouriſhment, the third day enſuing, after he had cauſed himſelfe to be ſprinckled over with luke-warme water, by little and little he conſumed away; and (as he ſaid) not without ſome voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pleaſure.

And ſhould I have repreſented him in his prowdeſt ſtate, it ſhould have beene all bloody-gored, tearing his entrailes, and rending his guttes, rather then with a ſword in his hand, as did the Statuaries of his time.

I have ſince added nothing vnto it that way; and I would feare; the ſtrength of it ſhould turne againſt my ſelfe. Seeing a peaceable time will require we ſhall vnfortifie them. It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous not to be able to recover them againe, and it is hard for one to be aſſured of them. For, concerning inteſtine broiles, your owne ſervant may be of that faction you ſtand in feare of. And where religion ſerveth for a pretence, even alliances and conſanguinitie become mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull vnder collour of juſtice. Common rents cannot entertaine our private gariſons. They ſhould all be conſumed. We have not wherewith, nor are we able to do it, without our apparant ruine, or more incommodiouſly, and therewithall injuriouſly, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples deſtruction.

That ſo many ſtrongly-garded houſes have beene loſt, whereas mine continueth ſtill, makes mee ſuſpect they were overthrowne, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo diligently garded. It is that which affoordeth a deſire, and miniſtreth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the aſſailant. All gards beare a ſhew of warre; which if God be ſo pleaſed may light vpon me. But ſo it is, I will never call for it. It is my ſanctuary or retreate to reſt my ſelfe from warres.

                        <p>I ſay for it alone: for, it drawes many commodities after it, by which it may yeeld it ſelfe deſirable: It purchaſeth vs good will: It makes vs leſſe expoſed to others injuries and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch like things. It was alſo one of the principall decrees of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> for, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his Sect, HIDE THY LIFE, which forbiddeth men to meddle with publike charges and negotiations, doth alſo neceſſarily preſuppoſe that a man ſhould deſpiſe glory: which is an approbation the world makes of thoſe actions we give evidence of. He that bids vs to hide our life, and care but for our ſelves, and would not have vs know of others, would alſo have vs not to be honoured and glorified thereby. So doth he counſell <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> by no meanes to order his actions, by the vulgar opinion and publike reputation: vnleſſe it be to avoide other accidentall incommodities, which the contempt of men might bring vnto him. Thoſe diſcourſes (are in mine adviſe) very true and reſonable: But, I wot not how, wee are double in our ſelves, which is the cauſe, that what wee beleeve, wee beleeve it not, and cannot rid our ſelves of that, which we condemne. Let vs conſider the laſt words of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and which hee ſpeaketh as hee is dying: they are notable and woorthy ſuch a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher: but yet they have ſome badge of his names commendations, and of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which by his precepts he had diſauowed. Behold heere a letter, which hee endited a little before hee yeelded vp his ghoſt.. Epicurus <hi>to Hermachus health and greeting: Whilſt I paſſed the happy, and even the last day of my life I writ this, accompanied nevertheleſſe with ſuch paine in my bladder and anguiſh in my entrails, that nothing can be added to the greatneſſe of it; yet was it recompenced with the pleaſure, which the remembrance of my inuentions and diſcourſes brought vnto my ſoule. Now as requireth the affection, which even from the infancie thou haſt borne me and Philoſophy, embrace the protection of</hi> Metrodorus <hi>his children:</hi> Loe here his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And which makes me interpret, that the pleaſure which in his ſoule he ſaith to feele of his inventions, doth in ſome ſort reſpect the reputation, which after his death he thereby hoped to attaine, is the ordinance of his laſt will and teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which he willeth, that <hi>Aminomachus</hi> and <hi>Timocretes</hi> his heires, ſhould for the celebration of his birth-day every month of Ianuary ſupply all ſuch charges as <hi>Hermachus</hi> ſhould appoint: And alſo for the expence hee might bee at vpon the twentieth of every Moone for the feaſting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Philoſophers his familiar friendes, who in the honour of his memorie and of <hi>Metrodorus</hi> ſhould meete together. <hi>Carneades</hi> hath beene chiefe of the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and hath maintained, that glory was in it ſelfe to be deſired, even as we embrace our poſthumes for themſelves, having neither knowledge nor joviſſance of them. This opinion hath not miſſed to be more commonly followed, as are ordinarily thoſe, that fit moſt and come neereſt our inclinations. <hi>Aristotle</hi> amongſt externall goods yeeldeth the firſt ranke vnto it: And avoideth, as two extreame vices, the immoderation, either in ſeeking, or avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. I believe, that had we the bookes which <hi>Cicero</hi> writ vpon this ſubject, wee ſhould heare ſtrange matters of him: for he was ſo fond in this paſſion, as had he dared, he would (as I thinke) have eaſily falne into the exceſſe, that others fell in; which is, that even ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

If that were true, a man needed not to be vertuous but in publike: and we ſhould never neede to keepe the ſoules-operations in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and rule, which is the true feate of vertue, but onely ſo much as they might come to the knowledge of others. Doth then nothing elſe belong vnto it, but craftily to faile, and ſubtilly to cozen? If thou knoweſt a Serpent to be hidden in any place (ſaith <hi>Carneades</hi>) to which, he by whoſe death thou hopeſt to reape commodity, goeth vnawares to ſit vpon, thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt a wicked act if thou warne him not of it: and ſo much the more, becauſe thy action ſhould be known but to thy ſelf. If we take not the law of wel-doing from our ſelves: If im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity be juſtice in vs; to how many kindes of trecheries are we daily to abandon our ſelves? That which <hi>Sp.

I thinke not ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as I would deeme it execrable, if we had not done it. And I think it beneficial we ſhould in our dayes be mindefull of <hi>Publius Sextilius Rufus</hi> his example, whom <hi>Cicero</hi> accuſeth that he had received a great inheritance againſt his conſcience: Not only repugnant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but agreeing with the lawes. And <hi>M. Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Hortenſius,</hi> who by reaſon of their authority and might, having for certaine Quidities beene called by a ſtranger to the ſucceſſion of a forged will, that ſo he might make his ſhare good: they were pleaſed not to be partakers of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, yet refuſed not to take ſome profite of it: Very cloſely had they kept themſelves vnder the countenance of the accuſations, witneſſes and lawes. <hi>Meminerint Deum ſe habere te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem, id eſt (vt Ego arbitror) mentem ſuam. Let them remember they have God to witnſſe, that is, (as I construe it) their owne minde. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue is a vaine and frivolous thing, if it draw hir commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from glorie.</hi> In vaine ſhould we attempt to make hir keepe hir rancke apart, and ſo ſhould we disjoyne it from fortune: for, <hi>What is more caſuall than reputation? Profecto fortuna in omni re dominatur: Ea res cunctas ex libidine magis quàm ex vero celebrat obſcurátque. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune governeth in al things, and either advancethor abaſeth them rather by froward diſpoſition, then vpright iudgement.</hi> To make actions to be knowen and ſeene, is the meere worke of fortune, It is chance that applyeth glory vnto vs, according to her temeritie. I have often ſeene it to goe before deſert; yea and many times to out-goe merite by very much. He that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelfe of the reſemblance betweene ſhadow and glory, did better than he thought of. They are exceeding vaine things. It alſo often goeth before hir body, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by much in length. Thoſe who teach Nobility to ſeeke in valour nothing but honor: <hi>Quaſi non ſit honestum quod nobilitatum non ſit; As though it were not honest, except it were enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi> What gaine they by it? But to inſtruct them never to hazard themſelves, vnleſſe they be ſeene of others; and to be very heedy, whether ſuch witneſſes are by, that may report newes of their valour, whereas a thouſand occaſions, to doe well are dayly offered, and no man by to marke them? How many notable particular actions, are buried in the throng of a Battell? Whoſoever ammuſeth himſelfe to controule others, in ſo confuſed a hurly-burly, is not greatly buſied about it: and produceth the teſtimony which hee giveth of his fellowes proceedings or exploits againſt himſelfe. <hi>Vera &amp; ſapiens animi magnitudo, honestum illud quod maxime naturam ſequitur, in factis poſitum, non in gloria iudicat. A true and wiſe magnanimitie esteemeth that honesty, which especially followeth Nature, to conſist in good actions, and not in glory,</hi> All the glory I pretend in my life, is, that I have lived quietly. Quietly not accord to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorius, Arceſilas,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> but according to my ſelfe. Since Philoſophie could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde any way for tranquility, that might be generally good, let every man in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeeke for it. To whom are <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> beholding for that infinite greatnes of their renowne, but to fortune? How many men hath ſhe ſuppreſſed in the beginning of their progreſſe, of whom we have no knowledge at all, who bare the ſame courage that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, if the il fortune of their chance had not ſtaid them even in the budding of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes? Amongſt ſo many and ſo extreame dangers (to my remembrance) I never read, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> received any hurt. A thouſand have dyed in leſſe danger, than the leaſt of thoſe he

eſcaped. Many worthy exploits and excellent deedes muſt be loſt, before one can come to any good. A man is not alwayes vpon the toppe of a breache, nor in the front of an army, in the ſight of his Generall, as vpon a ſtage. A man may be ſurpriſed betweene a hedge and a ditch. A man is ſometimes put to his ſodaine ſhifts, as to try his fortune againſt a Hens-rooſt, to ferret out foure ſeely ſhotte out of ſome barne, yea and ſometimes ſtraggle alone from his troupes; and enterpriſe, according as neceſſity and occaſion offereth it ſelfe. And if it be well noted (in mine adviſe) it will be found, and experience doth teach it, that the leaſt blazoned occaſions, are the moſt dangerous, and that in our late home-warres, more good men have periſhed in ſlight and little-importing occaſions, and incontention about a ſmall cottage, than in worthy atchievements, and honourable places.

                        <p>THere is another kinde of glorie, which is an over-good opinion we conceive of our worth. It is an inconſiderate affection, wherewith wee cheriſh our ſelves, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents-vs vnto our ſelves other then wee are. As an amorous paſſion addeth beauties, and lendeth graces to the ſubject it embraceth, and maketh ſuch as are therewith poſſeſſed, with a troubled conceite, and diſtracted Iudgement, to deeme what they love, and finde what they affect, to bee other, and ſeeme more perfect, then in trueth it is. Yet would I not have a man, for feare of offending in that point, to miſacknowledge himſelfe, nor thinke to bee leſſe then hee is: A true Iudgement ſhould wholy and in every reſpect maintaine his right. It is reaſon, that as in other things, ſo in this ſubject hee ſee what truth preſenteh vnto him. If hee be <hi>Caesar,</hi> let him hardly deeme himſelfe the greateſt Captaine of the world. We are nought but ceremonie; ceremonie doth tranſport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs, and wee leave the ſubſtance of things; wee hold-faſt by the boughs, and leave the trunke or body. We have taught Ladies to bluſh, onely by hearing that named, which they nothing feare to doe. Wee dare not call our members by their proper names, and feare not to employ them in all kinde of diſſoluteneſſe. Ceremonie forbids vs by words to expreſſe lawfull and naturall things; and we believe it. Reaſon willeth vs to doe no bad or vnlawfull things, and no man giveth credite vnto it. Heare I find my ſelfe entangled in the lawes of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, for it neither allowes a man to ſpeake ill or good of himſelfe. Therefore will wee leave her at this time.

As ſalutations, reverences, or conges, by which ſome doe often purchaſe the honor, (but wrongfully) to be humble, lowly, and courteous: A man may be humble through glory. I am very prodigall of cappings, namely in Summer, and I never receive any from what quality of men ſoever, but I giue them as good and as many as they bring, except he be ſome ſervant of mine. I wiſh that ſome Princes whom I know, would be more ſparing, and impartial diſpencers of them; for, being ſo indiſcreetly employed, they have no force at all: If they be without regard, then are they without effect. Amongeſt diſordered countenaunces, let vs not forget the ſterne looke of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour, who in publike held ever his head bolt-vpright, without turning or bending the ſame on any ſide, no not ſo much as to looke on them that ſaluted him ſideling, holding his body ſo fixt and vnmooveable, that let his Coche ſhake never ſo much, he kept ſtill vp-right: he durſt never ſpit nor wipe his Noſe, nor dry his face before the people. I wot not whether thoſe geſtures, which were noted in me were of this firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and whether in truth I had any ſecret propenſion to this fault, as it may well be: and I cannot anſwer for the motions of my body.

There are two parts in this glory: Which is to ſay, for a man to eſteeme himſelfe overmuch, the other, not ſufficiently to eſteeme of others. For the one, firſt me thinkes, theſe conſiderations ought ſomewhat to be accompted of. I feele my ſelfe ſurcharged with one errour of the minde, which both as bad, and much more as importunate, I vtterly diſlike. I endevour to correct it; but I cannot diſplace it. It is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I abate the juſt value of thoſe things, which I poſſeſſe; and enhance the worth of things, by how much they are more ſtrange, abſent and not mine owne. This humour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe very farre, as doth the prerogative of the authority, wherewith husbands looke vpon their owne wives with a vicious diſdame, and many fathers vpon their children: So doe I, and betweene two like workes would I ever weigh againſt mine. Not ſo much that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of my preferment, and amendment troubleth my judgement, and hindereth me from pleaſing my ſelfe, as that maſtery hirſelfe begets a contempt of that which a man poſſeſſeth and oweth. Policies, far cuſtomes and tongues flatter me; and I perceive the Latine tongue by the favour of hir dignity to deceive me, beyond what belongs vnto hir, as children and the vulgar ſort. My neighbours oeconomie; his houſe, and his horſe, though but of equall value, is more worth then mine, by how much more it is not mine owne. Beſides, becauſe I am moſt ignorant in mine owne matters: I admire the aſſurance, and wonder at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that every man hath of himſelfe: whereas there is almoſt nothing, that I wot I know, nor that I dare warrant my ſelfe to be able to doe. I have not my faculties in propoſition, or by eſtate, and am not inſtructed in them but after the effect: As doubtfull of mine owne ſtrength, as vncertaine of anothers force. Whence it followeth, if commendably I chance vpon any one piece of worke, I rather impute it to my fortune, then aſcribe it to mine indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; foraſmuch as I deſſeigne them all to hazard, and in feare. Likewiſe I have this in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that of all the opinions, which Antiquity hath had of man in groſe, thoſe which I moſt willingly embrace, and whereon I take moſt hold, are ſuch as moſt vilifie, contemne, and annihilate vs. Me thinkes Philoſophy hath never better cardes to Shew, then when ſhe checketh our preſumption, and croſſeth our vanity; when in good ſooth ſhe acknowledgeth hir irreſolution, hir weakeneſſe and hir ignorance. Me ſeemeth the over good conceit, and ſelfe-weening opinion man hath of himſelfe, is the Nurce-mother of the falſeſt opinions, both publike and particular. Thoſe which a cocke-horſe will pearch themſelves vpon the <hi>Epicicle</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſee ſo farre into heaven, they even pull out my teeth. For in the ſtudy which I profeſſe, the ſubject whereof is Man, finding ſo extreame a variety of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo inextricable a laberinth of difficulties one vpon the necke of another, ſo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and ſo much vncertainty, yea even in the ſchoole of wiſedome it ſelfe: you may imagine ſince thoſe men could never be reſolved of the knowledge of themſelves and of their owne condition, which is continually before their eyes, which is ever within them; ſince they know not how that mooveth, which themſelves cauſe to moove, nor how to ſet forth the ſprings, and deſcipher the wards, which themſelves hold and handle, how ſhould I thinke of the true cauſe of the flux and reflux of the river <hi>Nilus?</hi> The curioſity to know things hath beene given to men (as ſaith the holy Scripture) for a ſcourge. But to come to my particular, it is very hard (mee ſeemeth) that ſome other regardeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:12117:185"/>
leſſe, yea and ſome other eſteemeth me leſſe then I eſteeme my ſelfe. I accompt my ſelfe of the comon ſort except in that I deeme myſelfe guiltie of the baſeſt, and culpable of the moſt popular defects: but not diſavowed nor excuſed. And I only priſe my ſelfe, wherein I know my worth. If any glory be in me, it is but ſuperficially infuſed into me; by the treaſon of my complexion: and hath no ſolide body appearing to the ſight of my judgement. I am but ſprinckled over, but not throughly dyed. For in trueth, touching the effects of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, in what manner ſoever, there never came any thing from me, that contented me. And others approbation is no currant payment for me. My judgement is tender and hard eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in mine owne behalfe. I feele my ſelfe to waver and bend through weakeneſſe: I have nothing of mine owne to ſatisfie my judgement. My ſight is indifferently cleare and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but if I take any ſerious worke in hand, it is trobled, and dimmed: as I perceive moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnly in Poeſie: I love it exceedingly: I have ſome inſight or knowledge in other mens Labours, but in trueth I play the Novice when I ſet my hand vnto it: Then can I not abide my ſelfe. A man may play the foole every where elſe, but not in Poeſie.</p>

                        <p>Why have we no ſuch people? <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the father eſteemed nothing in himſelfe ſo much as his poeſie. In the times of the Olimpike games, with chariots exceeding all other in magnificence, he alſo ſent Poets and Muſitians to preſent his verſes, with tents and pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gilt and moſt ſumtuouſly tapiſtred. When they firſt beganne to reherſe them, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and excellencie of the pronuntiation did greatly allure the peoples attention: but when they beganne to conſider the fondneſſe of the compoſition, they fell as ſoone to contemne them: and being more and more exaſperated fell furiouſly into an vprore, and headlong ranne in moſt ſpitefull maner to teare and caſt downe all his pavillions. And foraſmuch as his rich chariets did no good at all in their courſe, and the ſhip which carried his men, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning homeward miſſed the ſhore of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and was by violent ſtormes driven and ſpilt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> they certainly believed, the wrath of the Gods to have beene the cauſe of it, as being greatly offended, both againſt him, and his vile and wicked Poeme: yea and the Mariners themſelves that eſcaped the ſhipwracke did much ſecond the peoples opinion: to which the Oracle that foretold his death ſeemed in ſome ſorte to ſubſcribe: which implied, that <hi>Dioniſius</hi> ſhould be neere his end, at what time he had vanquiſhed thoſe that ſhould be of more worth than himſelfe: Which he interpreted to be the Carthaginians, who exceeded him in might. And having at any time occaſion to fight or grapple with them, that he might not incurre the meaning of this prediction, he would often temper and avoyde the victory. But he miſ-vnderſtoode the matter, for the God obſerved the time of advantage, when as through partiall favour and injuſtice he obtained the victory over the tragicall Poets at <hi>Athens,</hi> who were much better than he was, where he cauſed in contention of them, his Tragedie, entitled the <hi>Lenetens,</hi> to be publikely acted. After which vſurped vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, he preſently deceaſed: And partly through the exceſſive joy, hee thereby conceived. What I finde excuſable in mine, is not of itſelfe, and according to truth: but in compariſon of other compoſitions, worſe than mine, to which I ſee ſome credite given. I envie the good happe of thoſe, which can applaude and gratifie themſelves by their owne labours; for it is an eaſie matter for one to pleaſe himſelfe, ſince he drawes his pleaſure from him ſelfe: Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if one bee ſomewhat conſtant in his owne wilfulneſſe. I knowe a Poetaſter, gainſt whom both weake and ſtrong, in company and at home, both heaven and earth, affirme and ſay, he hath no skill or judgement in Poeſie, who for all that is nothing diſmaied, nor will not abate one jote of that meſure whereunto he hath fitted himſelfe; but is ever begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe, ever conſulting anew, and alwayes perſiſting; by ſo much the more fixed in
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:12117:186"/>
his opinion, by how much the more it concerneth him alone, and he onely is to maintaine it. My compoſitions are ſo farre from applauding mee, that as many times as I looke them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo often am I vexed at them.</p>

Yet is that Idea but of the meaner ſtamp. I thereby conclude, that the productions of thoſe rich and great mindes of former ages, are farre beyond the extreame extention of my wiſh and imagination. Their compoſitions doe not onely ſatisfie and fill me, but they aſtoniſh and wrap me into admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I judge of their beauty, I ſee it, if not to the end, at leaſt ſo far as it is impoſible for me to aſpire vnto it. Whatſoever I vndertake (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſaith of one) I owe a ſacrifice to the Graces, hoping thereby to gaine their favour.</p>

My work manſhip ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no grace vnto the matter. And that's the reaſon I muſt have it ſtrong, with good hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and ſhining of it ſelfe. If I chance to ſeize on any popular and more gay, it is to follow me, who love not a ceremonious prudence and gloomy wiſedome, as doth the world; and to glad my ſelfe, not my ſtile, who would rather have it grave and ſevere: If at leaſt I may call that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The beſt tale in the world comming into my hands, becomes withered and tarniſhed. I cannot ſpeake but in good earneſt, and am altogether barren of that facility which I ſee in many of my companions, to entertaine firſt commers, to keep a whole troupe in talk, to ammuſe a Princes eares with al maner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and never to be weary, and never to want matter, by reaſon of the graces they have in applying their firſt approches, and fitting them to the humour and capacity of thoſe they have to doe withall. Princes loue not greatly ſerious and long diſcourſes, nor I to tell tales. The firſt and eaſieſt reaſons (which are commonly the beſt taken) I can neither employ nor make vſe of them. I am an ill Orator to the common ſort. I ſpeake the vtmoſt I know of all matters. <hi>Cicero</hi> thinkes, in diſcourſes of Philoſophy, the exordium to be the hardeſt part: If it be ſo, I wiſely lay hold on the concluſion. Yet ſhould a man know how to tune his ſtrings to all aires: And the ſharpeſt comes ever laſt in play. There is at laſt as much perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in raiſing vp an empty, as to vphold a waighty thing: A man muſt ſometimes handle matters but ſuperficially, and at other times dive into them. I wot well that moſt men keepe themſelves on this low ſtage, becauſe they conceive not of things but by the outward ſhew. I alſo know, that the greateſt Clarkes, yea <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> are often ſeene to yeelde to this low and popular faſhion, in ſpeaking of matters, vpholding it with thoſe graces, which they never want. As for the reſt, my language hath neither facility nor fluency in it, but is harſh and ſharpe, having free and vnſinnowy diſpoſitions. And ſo it liketh mee, if not by my judgement, yet by my inclination. But yet I perceive that ſometimes I wade to farre into it, and that forcing my ſelfe to avoide arte and affectation, I fall into it another way.</p>

And if my inclination doth rather carrie mee to the imitation of <hi>Senecaes</hi> ſtile, I omit not to eſteeme <hi>Plutarke</hi> much more. As well in ſilence as in ſpeech, I am ſimply my naturall forme, whence happily enſueth, that I am more in ſpeaking than in writing. The motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body, give life vnto words, namely in them that move roundly and without affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, as I doe, and that will be earneſt. Behaviour, the face, the voice, the gowne, and the place, may ſomewhat endeare thoſe things, which in themſelves are but meane, as prating. <hi>Meſſala</hi> complaineth in <hi>Tacitus</hi> of certaine ſtrait garments vſed in his time, and diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the faſhion of the benches whereon the Orators were to ſpeake, ſaying, they weakened their eloquence. My French tongue is corrupted both in the pronuntiation, and elſe-where by the barbariſme of my countrie. I never ſaw man of theſe hither-countries, that did not evidently taſte of his home-ſpeech, and who often did not wound thoſe eares, that are purely French. Yet is it not becauſe I am ſo cunning in my <hi>Perigordin:</hi> For I haue no more vſe of it, than of the Dutch, nor doe I greatly care. It is a language (as are many others round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me) like to that of <hi>Poitou, Xaintogne, Angouleſme, Limoſin,</hi> and <hi>Auergne,</hi> ſquattering, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and filthie. There is about vs, toward the mountaines a Gaſcoine tongue, which I much commend and like, ſinnowie, pithie, ſhort, ſignificant, and in truth man-like and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, more than any other I vnderſtand. As compendious powerfull, and pertinent as the French is gracious, delicate, and copious. As for the Latine, which was given me for my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue, by reaſon of diſcontinuance, I have ſo loſt the promptitude of it, as I cannot well make vſe of it in ſpeech, and ſcarſely in writing, in which I have heerctofore beene ſo ready, that I was called a maſter in it. Loe heere my little ſufficiencie in that behalfe. <hi>Beauty is a part of great commendation in the commerce and ſocietie of men.</hi> It is the chiefe meane of reconciliation betweene one and other. Nor is there any man ſo barbarous, and ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, that in ſome ſort feeleth not himſelfe ſtrucken with her ſweetneſſe. The body hath a great part in our being, and therein keepes a ſpeciall ranke: For, his ſtructure and compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are worthy due conſideration. Such as goe about to ſunder our two principall parts, and ſeparate them one from another, are much to blame: They ought rather to be coupled and joined faſt together. The ſoule muſt be enjoined not to retire her ſelfe to her quarter, nor to entertaine her ſelfe apart, nor to deſpiſe and leave the bodie (which ſhe cannot well doe, except it beby ſome counterfaited apiſh tricke) but ought to combine and cling faſt vnto him, to embrace, to cheriſh, aſſiſt, correct, perſwade and adviſe him, and if he chance to ſwarve or ſtray, then to leade and direct him: In fine, ſhe ſhould wed and ſerve him in ſtead of a husband, that ſo their effects may not ſeeme contrary and divers, but agreeing and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Chriſtians have a particular inſtruction concerning this bond, for they know that Gods juſtice alloweth this ſocietie, and embraceth this conjunction of the body and ſoule, yea ſo farre as to make the body capable of euerlaſting rewards. And that God beholds the whole man to worke, and will have him entirely to receive either the puniſhment, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe, according to his demerits. The Peripatetike Sect (of all Sects the moſt ſociable) attributeth this onely care vnto wiſedome, in common to procure and provide, the good of theſe two aſſociated parts: And declareth other Sects to have partialized overmuch, becauſe they had given themſelves to the full conſideration of this commixture; this one for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, this other for the ſoule, with one like error and overſight, and had miſtaken their ſubject, which is Man; and their guide, which in generall they avouched to be Nature. The firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that hath beene amongſt men, and the firſt conſideration, that gave preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſome over others, it is very likely it was the advantage of beautie.</p>

Is it not a great ſpite, if being amongſt your owne ſervants, a ſtranger commeth to your ſelfe to aske you where your Lord or Maiſter is? And that you have nothing but the remainder of a capping, which is as well put off to your Barber, or to your Secritarie? As it happened to poore <hi>Philopaemen,</hi> who having left his companie behind, and comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone into a houſe where he was expreſly looked-for, his hoſteſſe who knew him not, and ſaw him to be ſo il-favored a fellow, employed him to helpe her maides to drawe water, and to mend the fire for the ſervice of <hi>Philopaemen.</hi> The Gentlemen of his traine being come and finding him ſo buſily at worke (for he failed not to fulfill his hoſteſſes commandement) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him what he did, who anſwered, <hi>I pay the penaltie of my vnhandſomneſſe.</hi> Other beauties are for women. The beautie of a handſome comely tallneſſe is the only beautie of men.

And it is often leſſe harme for one to looſe his farme, than pleade and wrangle for it: <hi>The ſloweſt march, is the ſafeſt.</hi> It is the ſeate of conſtancie.

Remembring himſelfe how much the ſubject of cuckoldry had given him cauſe to ſpeake, and ſcoffe at others; to put himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der covert-baron, he tooke him a wife from out that place, where all men may have them for mony, and with her made his aliance: Good morrow Whoore, Good morrow Cuckold. And there is nothing wherewith he oftner and more openly entertained ſuch as came vnto him, than with this tale; Whereby he brideled the ſecret pratlings of mockers, and blunted the point of this reproch. Concerning ambition, which is next neighbour or rather daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to preſumption, it had beene needefull (to advance me) that fortune had come to take me by the hand: For to put my ſelfe into any care for an vncertaine hope, and to ſubmit my ſelfe to all difficulties, waiting on ſuch as ſeeke to thruſt themſelves into credite and reputation, in the beginning of their progreſſe, I could never have done it.</p>

queſtion, or to ſcape it by ſome winding, nor to diſſemble a truth, nor have I memorie able to continue it ſo fained, nor aſſurance ſufficient to maintaine it; and I play the Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard through feebleneſſe. And therefore I apply my ſelfe to ingenuitie, and ever to ſpeake truth and what I thinke, both by complexion and by intention; leaving the ſucceſſe thereof vnto fortune. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſaid, that the chiefeſt commoditie her reaped by Philoſophie, was, that he ſpake freely and ſincerely to all men: Memory is an inſtrument of great ſervice, and without which, judgement will hardly diſcharge his duty, whereof I have great want. What a man will propoſe vnto me, he muſt doe it by peece-meales: For, to anſwer to a diſcourſe that hath many heads, lieth not in my power. I cannot receive a charge, except I have my writing tables about me: and if I muſt remember a diſcourſe of any conſequence, be it of any length, I am driven to this vile and miſerable neceſſitie, to learne every word I muſt ſpeake, by rote; otherwiſe I ſhould never doe it well or aſſuredly, for feare my memory ſhould in my greateſt need faile me; which is very hard vnto me, for I muſt have three houres to learne three verſes. Moreover in any long diſcourſe, the libertie or authoritie to remoove the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to change a word, vnceſſantly altering the matter, makes it more difficult to bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the authors memory. And the more I diſtruſt it, the more it troubleth me. It ſerveth me better by chance, and I muſt careleſly ſollicite her, for if I vrge her, ſhe is aſtoniſhed; and if it once beginne to waver, the more I ſound her, the more entangled and intricate ſhee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. She will wait vpon me when ſhe liſt, not when I pleaſe. And what I feele in my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I feele in many other parts of mine. I eſchew commandement, duty, and compulſion. What I doe eaſily and naturally, if I reſolve to doe it by expreſſe and preſcribed appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I can then doe it no more. Even in my body, thoſe parts, that have ſome liberty, and more particular juriſdiction, doe ſometimes refuſe to obey me, if at any time I appoint and enjoine them to doe me ſome neceſſary ſervices. This forced and tyrannicall preordinance doth reject them, and they either for ſpight or feare ſhrinke and are quailed. Being once in a place, where it is reputed a barbarous diſcourteſie not to pledge thoſe that drinke to you, where although I were vſed with all liberty, in favour of certaine Ladies that were in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, according to the faſhion of the countrey, I would needs play the good fellow. But it made vs all mery; for the threats and preparation, that I ſhould force my ſelfe beyond my naturall cuſtome, did in ſuch ſort ſtop, and ſtuffe my throat, that I was not able to ſwallow one drop, and was barr'd of drinking all the repaſt. I found my ſelfe glutted and full of drinke by the overmuch ſwilling that my imagination had fore-conceived. This effect is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant in thoſe, whoſe imagination is more vehement and ſtrong: yet it is naturall: and there is no man, but ſhall ſometimes have a feeling of it. An excellent Archer being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, was offered to have his life ſaved, if he would but ſhew any notable triall of his profeſſion, refuſed to make proofe of it; fearing leſt the contention of his will ſhould make him to miſſe-direct his hand, and that in lieu of ſaving his life, hee might alſo loſe the reputation he had gotten in ſhooting in a bow. A man whoſe thoughts are buſie about other matters, ſhall very neere within an inch keepe and alwaies hit one ſelfe ſame number and meaſure of paces, in a place where he walketh; but if heedily hee endevour to meaſure and count them, he ſhall finde that what he did by nature and chance, he cannot doe it ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by deſſeigne. My Library (which for a countrey Library, may paſſe for a very faire one) is ſeated in a corner of my houſe: if any thing come into my minde, that either I muſt goe ſeeke or write in it, for feare I ſhould forget it in croſſing of my Court, I muſt deſire ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body to remember the ſame for me. If ſpeaking, I embolden my ſelfe never ſo little to digreſſe from my Diſcourſe, I doe ever looſe it; which makes mee to keepe my ſelfe in my ſpeech, forced, neere and cloſe. Thoſe that ſerve me, I muſt ever call them, either by their office or countrey: for I finde it very hard to remember names. Well may I ſay, it hath three ſillables, that it's ſound is harſh, or that it beginneth or endeth with ſuch a letter. And ſhould I live long, I doubt not but I might forget mine own name, as ſome others have done hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Meſſala Corvinus</hi> lived two yeeres without any memory at all, which is alſo reported of <hi>George Trapezoncius.</hi> And for mine owne intereſt, I doe often ruminate what manner of life theirs was, and whether wanting that part, I ſhall have ſufficient to maintaine myſelfe in any good ſort: which looking neere vnto, I feare that this defect, if it be perfect, ſhall looſe all the functions of my ſoule.</p>

I helpe my ſelfe to looſe, what I perticularly locke vp. <hi>Memoria certè non modè Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophiam, ſed omnis vitae vſum, omnéſque artes vna maximè continet. Aſſuredly memorie alone, of all other things compriſeth not onely Philoſophy, but the vſe of our whole life, and all the ſciences.</hi> Memorie is the receptacle and caſe of knowledge. Mine being ſo weake, I have no great cauſe to complaine if I know but little. I know the names of Artes in Generall and what they treate of, but nothing further. I turne and toſſe over bookes, but do not ſtudie them; what of them remaines in me, is a thing which I no longer acknowledge to be any bodies elſe. Onely by that hath my judgement profited: and the diſcourſes and imaginations, wherewith it is inſtructed and trained vp. The Authours, the place, the words, and other circumſtances, I ſodainely forget: and am ſo excellent in forgetting, that as much as any thing elſe I forget mine owne writings and compoſitions. Yea, mine owne ſayings are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hand-while alleaged againſt my ſelfe, when God wot I perceive it not. He that would know of me, whence or from whom the verſes or examples, which here I have hudled vp are taken, ſhould greatly put me to my ſhifts, &amp; I could hardly tell it him. Yet have I not beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, but at famous and very well knowen gates: which though they were rich in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did never pleaſe me, vnleſſe they alſo came from rich and honourable hands, and that authority concurre with reaſon. It is no great marvell, if my booke follow the fortune of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes; and my memory forgoe or forget as well what I write, as what I reade: and what I give, as well as what I receive. Beſides the defect of memory, I have others, which much further my ignorance. My wit is dull and ſlow, the leaſt cloud dimmeth it, ſo that (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſake) I never propoſed riddle vnto it (were it never ſo eaſie) that it was able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. There is no ſubtility ſo vaine, but confounds me. In games, wherein wit may beare a part, as of cheſſe, of cards, of tables and others, I could never conceive but the common and plaineſt draughts. My apprehenſion is very ſluggiſh and gloomy; but what it once hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the ſame it keepeth faſt: and for the time it keepes it, the ſame it embraceth generally, ſtrictly and deepely. My ſight is quicke, ſound, perfect and farre-ſeeing, but eaſily wearied, if much charged or emploied. By which occaſion I can haue no great commerce with books, but by others ſervice which reade vnto me. <hi>Plime</hi> the yoonger can inſtruct thoſe that have tri'd it, how much this fore ſlowing importeth thoſe that give themſelves to this occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is no ſpirit ſo wretched or ſo brutiſh, wherein ſome particular facultie is not ſeene to ſhine; and none ſo low buried, but at one hole or other it will ſally out ſometimes. And how it commeth to paſſe, that a minde blinde and ſlumbering in all other things, is in ſome particular effects, lively, cleare and excellent, a man muſt inquire of cunning maſters. But thoſe are the faire ſpirits, which are vniverſall, open, and ready to all, if not inſtructed, at leaſt to be inſtructed. Which I alleage to accuſe mine: For, be it either through weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or retchleſſeneſſe (and to be careleſſe of that which lieth at our feet, which we have in our hands, which neereſt concerneth the vſe of life, is a thing farre from my Dogma or Doctrine) there is none ſo ſimple or ſo ignorant as mine, in divers ſuch common matters, and of which without imputation or ſhame a man ſhould neuer be ignorant; whereof I muſt needs tell ſome examples. I was borne and brought vp in the Countrey, and amidſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: I have ſince my predeceſſours quit me the place and poſſeſſion of the goods I enjoy, both buſineſſe and husbandry in hand. I cannot yet caſt account either with penne or Counters. There are diuers of our French Coines, I know not: nor can I diſtinguiſh of one graine from another, be it in the field or in the barne, vnleſſe it be very apparant: nor do I ſcarcely know the difference betweene the Cabidge or Lettice in my Garden. I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the names of the moſt vſuall tooles about husbandry, nor of the meaneſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of tillage, which moſt children know. I was never skilfull in Mechanicall arts, nor in Traffike or knowledge of Merchandize, nor in the diverſity and nature of fruits, wines, or cates, nor can I make a Hawke, phyſick a Horſe, or teach a Dogge. And ſince I muſt make full ſhew of my ſhame or ignorance, it is not yet a moneth ſince, that I was found to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, whereto Leven ſerued to make bread withall; or what it was to cunne Wine. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were anciently wont to thinke him very apt for the Mathematikes, that could cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly

order or make vp a faggot of bruſn-wood? Verily a man might draw a much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie concluſion from me: For let me have all that may belong to a Kitchin, yet ſhall I be ready to ſtarve for hunger. By theſe partes of my confeſſion, one may imagine divers others, to my coſt and detriment. But howſoever I make my ſelfe knowen, alwaies prouided it be as I am indeede, I have my purpoſe. And I excuſe not my ſelfe, that I dare ſet downe in writing, ſo baſe and frivolous matters as theſe. The baſeneſſe of the ſubject forceth me therevnto. Let who ſo liſt accuſe my project, but not my progreſſe. So it is, that without being warned of others, I ſee very wel, how little this weigheth or is worth, and I perceive the fondneſſe of my purpoſe. It is ſufficient that my judgement is not diſmayed or diſtracted, whereof theſe be the Eſſayes.</p>

Touching my conduct, my wiſedome hath ſmall ſhare therein. I am very eaſily to be directed by the worlds publike order. Oh happie people, that doth what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, better then they which command, without vexing themſelves about cauſes; which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves gently to be rowled on, according to the heavens rowling. Obedience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pure and quiet in him, who talketh, pleadeth and contendeth. In ſome, (to returne to my ſelfe) the onely matter, for which I make ſome accompt of my ſelfe, is that, wherein never man did thinke himſelfe defective. My commendation is vulgar, common and popular; For, who ever thought he wanted wit? It were a propoſition, which in itſelfe would imply contradiction. It is an infirmity, that is never where it is ſeene, it is very ſtrong and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, but yet pierced and diſſipated by the firſt beame of the pacients ſight, as doth the Sunnes raies ſcatter and diſpearce a gloomie miſt. For a man to accuſe himſelfe, were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:12117:191"/>
himſelfe of that ſubject; and to condemne himſelfe, an abſolving of himſelfe. There was never ſo baſe a porter, nor ſo ſilly a woman, but thought he had ſufficient wit for his proviſion. We eaſely know in others, the advantage of courage, of bodily ſtrength, of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of diſpoſition and of beautie, but we never yeelde the advantage of judgement to any body: And the reaſons, which part from the ſimple naturall diſcourſe in others, we thinke, that had we but looked that way, wee had ſurely found them. The skill, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the ſtile and ſuch like partes, which we ſee in ſtrange workes, we eaſily perceive whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they exceede ours; but the meere productions of wit and vnderſtanding, every man dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it lyeth in him to meete with the very like, and doth hardly perceive the weight and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie of it, except (and that verie ſcarſely) in an extreame and incomparable diſtance. And he that ſhould clearely ſee the height of a ſtrangers judgement, would come and bring his vnto it. Thus, is it a kind of exerciſing, whereof a man may hope but for meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and ſmall praiſe, and a maner of compoſition, of little or no harme at all. And then, for whom doe you write? The wiſer ſort, vnto whom belongeth bookiſh juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, know no other price but of doctrine, and avow no other proceeding in our wits, but that of erudition and arte. If you have miſtaken one <hi>Scipio</hi> for an other, what of any worth have you left to ſpeake-of? He that is ignorant of <hi>Aristotle</hi> (according to them) he is there withall ignorant of himſelfe. Popular and ſhallow-headed minds, cannot perceive the grace or comelineſſe, nor judge of a ſmooth and quaint diſcourſe. Now theſe two kindes poſſeſſe the world. The third, vnto whoſe ſhare you fall, of regular wits, and that are ſtrong of themſelves, is ſo rare, that juſtly it hath neither name or ranke amongſt vs; he looſeth halfe his time, that doth aſpire or endevour to pleaſe it.

It may be, the continuall commerce I have with ancient humours, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of thoſe rich mindes of former ages doth bring me out of liking and diſtaſte both of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and of my ſelfe, or that in truth we live in an age, which produceth things but meane and indifferent. So it is, that I know nothing worthy any great admiration. Alſo I know not many men ſo familiarly as I ſhould, to be able to judge of them: and thoſe with whom the quality of my condition doth ordinarily make me converſant, are for the moſt part, ſuch as have little care for the manuring of the ſoule, and to whom nothing is propoſed for chiefe felicitie, but honour; and for abſolute perfection, but valour. Whatſoever I ſee or beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or worthy in any other man, I willingly commend and regard; yea and I often endeare my ſelfe with what I thinke of it, and allow my ſelfe to lie ſo farre forth: For, I cannot invent a falſe ſubject. I willingly witneſſe with my friends what I finde praiſe-worthy in them. And of an inch of valour, I willingly make an inch and a halfe; but to lend them qualities they have not, I cannot; and openly to defend their imperfections, I may not: yea bee they mine enemies, I ſhall ſincerely give them their due, in witneſſing their worth or honour. My affection may change; my judgement never. And I confound not my quarrell with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances, that are impertinent and belong not vnto it. And I am ſo jealous of the liberty of my judgement, that for what paſſion ſo ever I can hardly quit it. I wrong my ſelfe more in lying, than him of whom I lie. This commendable and generous cuſtome of the Perſian nation, is much noted; <hi>They ſpake very honourably and iustly of their mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and with thoſe with whom they were at deadly fude and warre, ſo farre foorth as the merit of their vertue deſerved.</hi> I know divers men who have ſundry noble and worthy parts; ſome wit, ſome courage, ſome dexteritie, ſome conſcience, ſome a readineſſe in ſpeech, ſome one Science, and ſome another; but of a great man in generall, and that hath ſo many excellent parts together, or but one, in ſuch a degree of excellencie, as hee may thereby bee admired, or but compared to thoſe of former ages whom we honour, my fortune hath not permitted me to ſee one. And the greateſt I ever knew living (I meane of naturall parts of the minde, and the beſt borne) was <hi>Stephanus de la Boitie:</hi> Verily it was a compleat minde, and who ſet a good face, and ſhewed a faire countenance vpon all matters: A minde after the old ſtampe, and which, had fortune therewith beene pleaſed, would no doubt have brought forth wondrous effects; having by skill and ſtudy added very much to his rich naturall gifts. But I know not how it comes to paſſe, and ſurely it doth ſo, there is as much vanitie and weakeneſſe of vnderſtanding found in thoſe, that profeſſe to have moſt ſufficiencie, that will entermeddle with learned vacations, and with the charges that depend of bookes, than in any ſort of people; whether it be becauſe there is more required, and expected at their hands, and common faults cannot be excuſed in them, or that the ſelfe-opinion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge emboldeneth them the more to produce and diſcover themſelves over-forward, whereby they looſe and betray themſelves. As an Artificer doeth more manifeſt his ſottiſhneſſe in a rich piece of worke, which he hath in hand, if fooliſhly and againſt the rules of his trade he ſeeke to apply it and entermeddle, than in a vile and baſe one; and men are more offended at a fault or overſight in a ſtatue of gold, than in one of clay.

In framing this pourtraite by my ſelfe, I have ſo often beene faine to frizle and trimme me, that ſo I might the better extract my ſelfe, that the patterne is thereby confirmed, and in ſome ſort formed. Drawing my ſelfe for others, I have drawne my ſelfe with purer and better colours, then were my firſt. I have no more made my booke, then my booke hath made me. A booke conſubſtantiall to his Author: Of a peculiar and fit occupation. A member of my life. Not of an occupation and end, ſtrange and forraine; as all other bookes. Have I miſ-ſpent my time, to have taken an account of my ſelfe ſo continually and ſo curiouſly? For thoſe who onely run themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by fantazy, and by ſpeech for ſom houre, examine not themſelves ſo primely and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor enter they into themſelves, as he doth, who makes his ſtudy, his worke, and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: Who with all his might, and with all his credit engageth himſelfe to a regiſter of continuance.

As

we call mony not onely that which is true and good, but alſo the falſe; ſo it be currant. Our Nation is long ſince taxed with this vice.

Men frame and faſhion themſelves vnto it, as to an exerciſe of honour; for, <hi>diſſimulation is one of the not ableſt qualities of this age.</hi> Thus have I often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidred, whence this cuſtome might ariſe, which wee obſerve ſo religiouſly, that we are more ſharpely offended with the reproach of this vice, ſo ordinary in vs, than with any other; and that it is the extreameſt injurie, may be done vs in words, to vpbraid and reproch vs with a lie. Therein I finde, that it is naturall, for a man to defend himſelfe moſt from ſuch defects as we are moſt tainted with. It ſeemeth that if we but ſhew a motion of revenge, or are but moved at the accuſation, we in ſome ſort diſcharge our ſelves of the blame or imputation; if we have it in effect, at leaſt we condemne it in apparance. May it not alſo be, that this reproch ſeemes to enfold cowardiſe and faintneſſe of hart? Is there any more manifeſt, than for a man to eate and deny his owne Worde? What? To deny his Word wittingly? To lie is a horrible-fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy vice; and which an ancient writer ſetteth forth very ſhamefully, when he ſaith, that <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lieth, witneſſeth that he co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Concerning the ſundry faſhions of our giving the lie, and the lawes of our honour in that and the changes they have received, I will refer to another time, to ſpeake what I thinke and know of it, and if I can, I will in the meane time learne, at what time this cuſtome tooke his beginning, ſo exactly to weigh and precizely to meaſure words, and tie our honour to them: for it is eaſie to judge, that it was not anciently amongſt the Romans and Graecians.

                        <p>IT is ordinarily ſeene, how good intentions being managed without moderation, thruſt men into moſt vicious effects. In this controverſie, by which <hi>France</hi> is at this inſtant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with civill warres, the beſt and ſafeſt ſide, is no doubt, that which maintaineth both the ancient religion and policy of the Country. Nevertheleſſe amongſt the honeſt men that follow it (for my meaning is not to ſpeake of thoſe, who vſe them as a colour, either to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their particular revenges, or to ſupply their greedy avarice, or to follow the favour of Princes: But of ſuch as doe it with a true zeale toward their Religion, and an vnfained holy affection, to maintaine the peace and vphold the ſtate of their Country) of thoſe I ſay, divers

are ſeene, whom paſſion thruſts out of the bounds of reaſon, and often forceth them to take and follow vnjuſt, violent and raſh counſels. Certaine it is, that when firſt our religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to gaine authoritie with the Lawes, it's zeale armed many againſt all ſorts of Pagane bookes, whereof the learned ſort have a great loſſe. My opinion is, that this diſorder hath done more hurt to learning, than all the Barbarian flames. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> is a ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of it: for, howbeit the Emperor <hi>Tacitus</hi> his kinſman had by expreſſe appointment ſtored all the libraries in the World with it, notwithſtanding one onely entire copy could not eſcape the curions ſearch of thoſe, who ſought to aboliſh it, by reaſon of five or ſixe vaine clauſes, contrary to our beleefe. They have alſo had this eaſily to affoord falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to all the Emperours, that made for vs, and vniverſally to condemne all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe, which were our adverſaries, as may plainly be ſeene in <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperor, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Apoſtata; who in truth was a notable-rare-man, as he whoſe mind was lively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the diſcourſes of Philoſophie, vnto which hee profeſſed to conforme all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and truely there is no kind of vertue, wherof he hath not left moſt notable examples. In chaſtity (whereof the whole courſe of his life giveth apparant teſtimony) a like example, vnto that of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>oio</hi> is read of him, which is, that of many wonderfull faire captive Ladies, brought before him, being even in the very prime of his age (for he was ſlaine by the Parthians about the age of one and thirty yeares) he would not ſee one of them. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching juſtice, himſelfe would take the paines to heare all parties: And although for curioſity ſake, he would enquire of ſuch as came before him, what religion they were of, nevertheleſſe the enmitie he bare to ours, did no whit weigh downe the ballance. Himſelfe made ſundrie good Lawes, and revoked diverſe ſubſidies and impoſitions, his Predeceſſours before him had receaved. We have two good Hiſtorians, as eye-witneſſes of his actions. One of which, (who is <hi>Marcellinus</hi>) in ſundry places of his Hiſtorie bitterly reprooveth this ordinance of his, by which he forbade ſchooles, and interdicted all Chriſtian Rhethoricians, and Grama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to teach: Saying, he wiſhed this his action might be buried vnder ſilence. It is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had done any thing elſe more ſharpe or ſevere againſt vs, he would not have forgot it, as he that was well affected to our ſide. Hee was indeede very ſevere againſt vs, yet not a cruell enemie. For, our people themſelves report this Hiſtorie of him, that walking one day about the Citty of <hi>Calcedon, Maris</hi> Biſhop thereof, durſt call him wicked and traitor to Chriſt, to whom he did no other thing, but anſwered thus: Goe wretched man, weepe and deplore the loſſe of thine eyes; to whom the Biſhop replyed, I thanke Ieſus Chriſt, that he hath deprived me of my ſight, that ſo I might not view thy impudent face, affecting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as they ſay) a kind of Philoſophicall patience. So it is, this part cannot be referred to the cruelties, which he is ſaid to have exerciſed againſt vs. He was (ſaith <hi>Eutropius</hi> my other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony) an enemy vnto Chriſtianity, but without ſhedding of bloud. But to returne to his juſtice, he can be accuſed of nothing but of the rigors he vſed in the beginning of his Empire, againſt ſuch as had followed the faction of <hi>Constantius</hi> his Predeceſſour. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſobrietie, he ever lived a Souldiers kinde of life, and in time of peace, would feede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, than one who prepared and enured himſelfe to the auſteritie of warre. Such was his vigilancie, that he divided the night into three or foure parts, the leaſt of which hee allotted vnto ſleepe; the reſt he employed in viſiting the ſtate of his army, and his guardes, or in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for, amongeſt other his rare qualities, he was moſt excellent in all ſorts of learning. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that being laide down to reſt, fearing leſt ſleep ſhould divert him from his thoughts and ſtudies, he cauſed a baſen to be ſet neere his bed ſide, and holding one of his handes out, with a brazen ball in it, that if ſleepe ſhould ſurprize him, looſing his fingers endes, the ball falling into the baſen, might with the noyſe rouze him from out his ſleepe. This man had a mind ſo bent to what he vndertook, and by reaſon of his ſingular ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence ſo little troubled with vapours, that he might well have paſt this deviſe. Touching military ſufficiencie, he was admirable in all partes belonging to a great Captaine. So was he almoſt all his life time in continuall exerciſe of War, and the greater part with vs in <hi>France</hi> againſt the Alemans and French. Wee have no great memorie of any man, that either hath ſeene more dangers, nor that more often hath made triall of his perſon. His death hath ſome affinitie with that of <hi>Epaminoudas,</hi> for being ſtrucken with an arrow, and attempting to pull it out, he had ſurely done it, but that being ſharpe-cutting, it hurt and weakened his hand. In that plight he earneſtly requeſted to bee carryed forth in the middeſt of his army,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:12117:195"/>
that ſo he might encourage his ſouldiers, who without him couragiouſly maintained the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, vntill ſuch time as darke night ſevered the Armies. Hee was beholding to Philoſophie for a ſingular centempt, both of himſelfe and of all humane things. Hee aſſuredly believed the eternitie of ſoules. In matters of religion, he was vicious every-where. He was ſurnamed <hi>Apostata,</hi> becauſe he had forſaken ours; notwithſtanding this opinion ſeemes to mee more likely, that never tooke it to hart, but that for the obedience which he bare to the lawes, he diſſembled til he had gotten the Empire into his hands. He was ſo ſuperſtitious in his, that even ſuch as lived in his time, and were of his owne religion, mocked him for it; and it was ſaide, that if he had gained the Victory of the Parthians, hee would have conſumed the race or breede of Oxen, to ſatisfie his ſacrifices. He was alſo beſetted with the Art of ſooth ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave authoritie to all manner of prognoſtikes. Amongſt other things hee ſpake at his death, he ſaide, he was much beholding to the Gods, and greatly thanked them, that they had not ſuffred him to be ſlaine ſodainely or by ſurprize, as having long before warned him both of the place and houre of his end; nor to die of a baſe and eaſie death, more beſeeming idle and effeminate Perſons, nor of a lingring, languiſhing, and dolorous death; and that they had deemed him worthy to end his life ſo nobly in the courſe of his victories and in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his glory. There had before appeared a viſion vnto him, like vnto that of <hi>Marcus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> which firſt threatned him in <hi>Gaule,</hi> and afterward even at the point of his death, preſented it ſelfe to him in <hi>Perſia.</hi> The ſpeach he is made to ſpeake when he felt himſelfe hurt, <hi>Thou hast vanquiſhed ô Nazaraean;</hi> or as ſome wil have it; <hi>Content thy ſelf oh Nazaraean,</hi> would ſcarce have beene forgotten, had it beene believed of my teſtimonies, who being preſent in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, have noted even the leaſt motions, and wordes at his death, no more than certaine other wonders, which they annex vnto it. But to returne to my theame, he had long before (as ſaith <hi>Marcellinus</hi>) hatched Paganiſme in his hart, but forſomuch as he ſaw all thoſe of his armie to be Chriſtians, he durſt not diſcover him ſelfe. In the end, when he found himſelfe to be ſufficiently ſtrong, and durſt publiſh his minde, he cauſed the Temples of his Gods to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and by all meanes endevoured to advance idolatrie. And to attaine his purpoſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found in <hi>Constantinople</hi> the people very looſe, and at ods with the Prelates of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church, and cauſed them to appeare before him in his pallace, he inſtantly admoniſhed them to appeaſe all their civill diſſentions, and every one without hinderance or feare apply themſelves to follow and ſerve religion. Which he verie carefully ſollicited, hoping this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence might encreaſe the factions, and controverſies of the diviſion, and hinder the people, from growing to any vnity, and by conſequence from fortifying themſelves againſt him, by reaſon of their concord and in one mind-agreeing intelligence: having by the cruelty of ſome Chriſtians found, that <hi>There is no beaſt in the world, ſo much of man to be feared, as man.</hi> Loe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heere his very words, or very neare: Wherin this is worthy conſideration, that the Emperor <hi>Iulian,</hi> vſeth the ſame receipt of libertie of conſcience, to enkindle the trouble of civill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, which our Kings employ to extinguiſh. It may be ſaide on one ſide, that, <hi>To give factions the bridle to entertaine their opinion, is to ſcater contention and ſew diviſion,</hi> and as it were to lend it a hand to augment and encreaſe the ſame: There beeing no Barre or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of Lawes to bridle or hinder hir courſe. But on the other ſide, it might alſo bevr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that to give factions the bridle to vpholde their opinion, is, by that facilitie and eaſe, the readie way to mollifie and releaſe them; and to blunt the edge, which is ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by rareneſſe, noveltie, and difficultie. And if for the honour of our Kings devotion, I believe better; it is, that ſince they could not doe as they would, they have fained to will what they could not.</p>

And Kings ought often to be put in minde of it, to make them feele, that this great charge, which is given them of the commandement over ſo many men, is no idle charge; and that there is nothing may ſo juſtly diſtaſte a ſubject from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe in paine and danger for the ſervice of his Prince, then therewhilſt to ſee him given to lazineſſe, to baſe and vaine occupations, and to have care of his conſervation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo careleſſe of ours. If any ſhall goe about to maintaine, that it is better for a Prince to manage his warres by others, then by himſelfe; Fortune will ſtore him with ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe, whoſe Lieutenants have atchieved great enterpriſes; and alſo of ſome whoſe preſence would have beene more hurtfull, then profitable.

Vnder colour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his head (as the ſtatue of a ſaint) for the good fortune of his eſtate, they degrade him of his office, which is altogether in military actions, and declare him vncapable of it. I know one, would rather chuſe to be beaten, then ſleepe whilſt others fight for him; and who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jelouſie never ſaw his men performe any notable act in his abſence.

No Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote exerciſeth his office ſtanding ſtil. The princes of <hi>Otomans</hi> race (the chefeſt race in the world in warlike fortune) have earneſtly embraced this opinion. And <hi>Baiazeth</hi> the ſecond with his ſonne, who ammuſing themſelves about Sciences, and other private home-matters, neglected the ſame, gave diverſe prejudiciall blowes vnto their Empire. And <hi>Amurath</hi> the third of that name, who now raigneth following their example, beginneth very well to feele their fortune. Was it not the King of <hi>England, Edward</hi> the third, who ſpake theſe words of our King <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth? <hi>There was never King that leſſe armed himſelfe; and yet was never King, that gave me ſo much to doe, and put me to ſo many plunges.</hi> He had reaſon to thinke it ſtrange, as an effect of fortune, rather then of reaſon. And let ſuch as will number the Kings of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> amongſt the warlike and magnanimous conquerors, ſeeke for ſome other adherent then my ſelfe; forſomuch as twelve hundred leagues from their idle reſidence they have made themſelves maſters of both <hi>Indias,</hi> onely by the conduct and direction of their factors; of whom it would be knowne, whether they durſt but goe and enjoy them in perſon. The Emperor <hi>Iuhan</hi> ſaid moreover, that a Philoſopher and gallant minded man ought not ſo much as breath; that is to ſay, not to give corporall neceſſities, but what may not be refuſed them; ever holding both minde and body buſied about notable, great and vertuous matters. He was aſhamed, any man ſhould ſee him ſpitte or ſweat before people (which is alſo ſaid of the Lacedemonian youths, and <hi>Xenphon</hi> reporeth it of the Perſian) foraſmuch as he thought that continuall travel, exerciſe and ſobriety ſhould have concocted and dried vp all ſuch ſuperfluities. What <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith ſhall not impertinently be alleaged here; That <hi>the ancient Romanes kept their youth vpright, and taught their children nothing, that was to be learned ſitting.</hi> It is a generous deſire, to endevor to die both profitable and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: But the effect conſiſteth not ſo much in our good reſolution, as in our good fortune.

Vpon the progreſſe of his victories, <hi>C.

Antiochus</hi> amazed at the rudeneſſe of ſo vrging a commandement, after he had pawſed a while, replyed thus, <hi>I will doe what the Senate commandeth me.</hi> Then <hi>Popilius</hi> ſaluted him as a friend vnto the Roman people. To have renounced ſo great a Monarchy, and forgon the courſe of ſo ſucceſſefull proſperity, by the onely impreſſion of three written lines. He had good reaſon, as afterward he did, by his Ambaſſadors to ſend the Senate word, that he had received their ordinances with the ſame reſpect, as if they had come from the immortall Gods. All the Kingdomes <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſubdued by right of war, he reſtored to thoſe who had loſt them, or preſented ſtrangers with them: And concerning this purpoſe, <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Cogidunus</hi> King of England, by a wonderfull tract makes vs perceive this infinit greatneſſe<note place="margin">Cor.

                        <p>As farre as I remember I have read a like Hiſtory in ſome place of <hi>Appian,</hi> of one who purpoſing to eſcape the proſcriptions of the <hi>Triumutrat</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to conceale himſelfe from the knowledge of thoſe who purſued him, kept himſelfe cloſe and diſguiſed, adding this other invention to it, which was to counter feit blindneſſe in one eye, who when he came ſomewhat to recouer his liberty, and would have left off the plaiſter hee had long time worne over his eye, he found that vnder that maske he had altogether loſt the ſight of it. It may be the action of his ſight was weakened, having ſo long continued without exerciſe and the viſual vertue was wholy converted into the other eie: For, we may plainely perceive, that holding one eye ſhut, it convaieth ſome part of it's effect into his follow; in ſuch ſort as it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:12117:199"/>
will ſwell and growe bigger. As alſo the idlenes, together with the warmth of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments and ſwathing, might very well drawe ſome goutie humor into the legge of <hi>Martials</hi> goutie ſellow. Reading in <hi>Freiſart,</hi> the vowe which a gallant troupe of young Engliſh-men had made, to weare their left eyes hoodwink's, vntill ſuch time as they ſhould paſſe into <hi>France,</hi> and there performe ſome notable exploite of armes vpon vs, I have often laughed with my ſelfe to think what they would have imagined if as to the fore aleaged, it had hapned to them, and had all beene blinde of the left eye, at what time they returned to looke vpon their miſtreſſes, for whoſe ſake they had made their vowe and vndertaken ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Mothers have great reaſon to chide their children when they counterſet to be blind with one eye, crompt backt, ſquint'-eyed, or lame, and ſuch other deformities of the body; for beſides that the body thus tender may eaſily receive ſome ill cuſtome, I know not how, it ſeemeth that fortune is glad to take vs at our word; And I have heard divers examples of ſome, who have falne ſicke in very deede, becauſe they had purpoſed to ſaine ſickenes. I have at all times enured my ſelfe, whether I be on horſebacke or a foote, to carrie a good heavie wand or cudgell in my hand; yea I have endevored to doe it handſomely, and with an effected kinde of countenance to continue ſo. Many have threatned me, that fortune will one time or other turne this my wantonnes into neceſſitie. I preſume vpon this, that I ſhould be the firſt of my race, that ever was troubled with the gowt. But let vs ſomewhat amplifie this chapter, and patch it vp with another piece concerning blindnes. <hi>Plinie</hi> reports of one, who dreaming in his ſleepe, that he was blinde, awaking the next morning, was found to be ſtarke blinde, having never had any precedent ſickenes. The power of imagination may very well further ſuch things, as elſewhere I have ſhewed; And <hi>Plinie</hi> ſeemeth to be of this opinion; but it is more likely, that the motions, which the body ſelt inwardly (whereof Phiſitions, may if they pleaſe, finde out the cauſe) and which tooke away his ſight, and were the occaſion of his dreame. Let vs alſo adde another ſtorie, concerning this purpoſe, which <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth in his Epiſtles. <hi>thou knoweſt</hi> (ſaith he writing vnto <hi>Lucilius</hi>) <hi>that</hi> Harpaſte <hi>my wiues foole, is left vpon me as an hereditarie charge; for by mine owne nature, I am an enemie vnto ſuch monſters, and if I have a deſire to laugh at a foole, I neede not ſeeke one farre; I laugh at my ſelfe. This fooliſh woman hath ſodainly loſt hir ſight. I report a ſirange thing, but yet very true: She will not beleeve ſhe is blind; and vrgeth hir keeper vnceſſantly to lead hir, ſaying ſtill, my houſe is very darke.

What is it that now adaies makes all our qaurrels mortall? And whereas our forefathers had ſome degree of reuenge, we now beginne by the laſt; and at firſt brunt nothing is ſpoken of but killing? What is it, if it be not Cowardiſe? Euery man ſeeth, it is more bravery and diſdaine for one to beare his enemie, than make an end of him; and to keepe him at a bay, than make him die. Moreouer, that the deſire of revenge is thereby alayed, and better contented; for, it aymeth at nothing ſo much as to give or ſhew a motion or feeling of reuenge onely of her ſelfe. And that's thereaſon reaſon we doe not chalenge a beaſt or fall vpon a ſtone, when it hurts vs, becauſe they are incapable to feele our ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And euen as <hi>Bias,</hi> exclaimed vpon a wicked man; <hi>I know that ſoone or late thou ſhalt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for thy lewdnes, but I feare me I ſhall not ſee it:</hi> And moaned the Orchomenians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the penance which <hi>Liciſcus</hi> had for his treaſon committed againſt them, came at ſuch a time, as none of them were living, whome it had concerned, and whom the pleaſure of that puniſhment might moſt delight: So ought revenge to be moaned, when he on whom it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, looſeth the meanes to endure or feel it. For, even as the revenger, will ſee the action of the revenge, that ſo he may feele the pleaſure of it, ſo muſt he on whom he is revenged both ſee and feele that he may hereby receive both repentance and griefe. He ſhall rew it, ſay we, And though he receive a ſtabbe or a blow with a piſtoll on his head, ſhall we thinke he will repent? Contrariwiſe, if we marke him well, we ſhall perceive that in falling, he makes a moe or bob at vs, Hee is farre from repenting, when hee rather ſeemes to be beholding to vs: In aſmuch as we affoord him the favourableſt office of life, which is to make him dye ſpeedily, and as it were inſenſibly. We are left to ſhift vp and downe, runne and trot, and ſquat heere and there, and all to avoy de the Officers, or eſcape the Magiſtrates that purſue vs; and he is at reſt. <hi>To kill a man, is good to eſcape a future offonce, and not revenge the wrougs past.</hi> It is rather an action of feare, than of bravery; Of precaution, than of courage; Of defence, than of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. It is apparant, that by it, we quit both the true end of revenge, and the reſpect of our reputation: If he live we feare he will or may charge vs with the like. It is not againſt him, it is for thee, thou riddeſt thy ſelfe of him. In the Kingdome of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> this expedient would be bootleſſe: There, not onely Souldiers, and ſuch as profeſſe armes, but euery meane Artificer, decide their quarels with the Swordes point. The King neuer refuſeth anie man the combate, that is diſpoſed to fight; And if they be men of qualitie, he will be by in perſon, and reward the Victor with a chaine of Gold: Which, whoſoeuer hath a mind vnto, and will obtaine it, may freely chalenge him that weareth the ſame, and enter combate with him. And hauing overcome one combate hath many following the ſame, If we thought by vertue to be ever ſuperiors vnto our enemy, and at our pleaſure gourmandize him, it would much grieve vs he ſhould eſcape vs, as he doeth in dying. We rather endevor to vanquiſh ſurely, than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably. And in our quarrels we rather ſeeke for the end, than for the glory. <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> for an honeſt man, leſſe excuſable, committed a like fault; Who hauing written certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt <hi>Plancus,</hi> ſtaide vntill he were dead to publiſh them. It was rather to flurt at a blind man, and raile in a dead-mans eare, and to offend a ſenceleſſe man, than incurre the danger of his revenge. And men anſwered in this behalfe, that <hi>it onely belonged to Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins to wrestle with the dead.</hi> He who ſtaieth till the Author be dead, whoſe writings hee will combate, what ſaith he, but that he is weake and quarrellous? It was told <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that ſome body had ſpoken ill of him, to whom he anſwered, <hi>Let him alſo whippe me, ſo my ſelfe be not by. Our forefathers were contented to revenge an iniurie with a lie; a lie with a blowe, a blowe with bloud; and ſo in order.</hi> They were ſufficiently valiant not to feare their adverſary though he lived aud were wronged: Whereas we quake for feare, ſo long as we ſee him a foote. And that it is ſo, doth not our moderne practize, purſue to death, as well him who hath wronged vs, as him whom we have offended? It is alſo a kinde of daſtardlineſſe, which hath brought this faſhion into onr ſingle combates, to accompany vs into the field with ſeconds, thirdes, and fourths.

But now this faſhion is come vp, let any man be engaged whoſoever is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, cannot well containe himſelfe to be a ſpectator, leſt it be imputed vnto him, it is either for want of affection, or lacke of courage. Beſides the injuſtice of ſuch an action and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for your honours protection, to engage other valour and force then your owne, I finde it a diſadvantage in an honeſt and worthie man, and who wholly truſts vnto himſelfe, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle his fortune with a ſecond man: every one runneth ſufficient hazard for himſelfe, and neede not alſo runne it for another: And hath enough to doe to aſſure himſelfe of his owne vertue for the defence of his life, without committing ſo precious a thing into third mens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handes. For, if the contrarie hath not expreſſely beene covenanted of all foure, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined party. If your fellow chance to faile, you have two vpon you, and not without reaſon: And to ſay, it is a Superchiery, as it is indeed: as being wel armed, to charge a man who hath but a piece of a ſword, or being ſound and ſtrong, to ſet vpon a man fore hurt. But if they bee advantages you have gotten fighting, you may vſe them without imputation. Diſparitie is not conſidered, and inequality is not balanced, but by the ſtate wherein the fight is begunne. As for the reſt you muſt rely on fortune: and if alone or ſingle, you chance to have three vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, your other two companions being ſlaine, you have no more wrong done you, than I ſhould offer in Wars in ſtriking an enemie, whom at ſuch an advantage I ſhould finde grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with one of my Fellow Souldiers. The nature of ſocietie beareth, where troupe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt troupe (as where our Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> chalenged <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> one hundred againſt another hundred; three hundred againſt as many, as did the Argians againſt the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians; three to three, as were the <hi>Horatij</hi> againſt the <hi>Curatij</hi>) the pluralitie of either ſide is never reſpected for more than a ſingle man. Wherſoever there is company, the hazard is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and diſordered. I have a private intereſt in this diſcourſe. For, my brother, the Lord of <hi>Matecoulom,</hi> being deſired in <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſecond and accompany a Gentleman, with whom he had no great acquaintance, who was defendant and challenged by another; The fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, my brother by chance found himſelfe confronted with one neerer and better knowne to him (I would faine be reſolved of theſe Lawes of honour, which ſo often ſhocke and trouble thoſe of reaſon) whom after he had vanquiſhed and diſpatched, ſeeing the two principalls of the quarrell yet ſtanding and vnhurt, he went to reskew his fellow. What could he do leſſe? ſhould he have ſtoode ſtill, and (if chance would ſo have had it) ſee him defeated, for whoſe defence he was entred the quarrell? What vntill then he had done was nothing to the purpoſe, and the quarrell was ſtill vndecided. All the curteſie you can, you ought ſurely vſe to your enemy, eſpecially when you have brought him vnder, and to ſome great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; I know not how a man may vſe it, when anothers intereſt depends on it, where you are but acceſſory, and where the quarrell is not yours. Hee could never be juſt nor curteous, in hazard of him vnto whom he had lent himſelfe. So was he preſently delivered out of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian priſons by a ſpeedy and ſolemne letter of commendations from our King. Oh indiſcreete Nation! We are not contented to manifeſt our follies, and bewray our vices to the world by reputation: but wee goe into forraine Nations and there in perſon ſhew them. Place three French-men in the deſerts of <hi>Libia,</hi> and they will never live one moneth together without brawling, falling out and ſcratching one another: you would ſay this peregrination, is a party erected to pleaſe ſtrangers with our tragedies; and thoſe moſt commonly, who reioyce and ſcoffe at our evills. We travell into <hi>Italie</hi> to learne the Arte of fencing, and practiſe it at the coſt of our lives, before we know it; it were requiſite according to the order of true Diſcipline, we ſhould preferre the Theorike before the practike.

                           <hi>Shooting at Buts, Tiltings, Torneyes, Barriers, the true images of martiall combates, were the exerciſes of our forefathers.</hi> This other exerciſe is ſo much the leſſe noble, by how much it reſpecteth but a private end; which againſt the lawes of juſtice, teacheth vs to deſtroy one another, and euery way produceth euer miſchievous effects. <hi>It is much more worthy, and beeter beſeeming, for a man to exerciſe himſelfe in things that aſſure and offend not our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and which reſpect publike ſecuritie and generall glory. Publius Conſus,</hi> was the firſt that ever inſtituted the Souldier to manage his armes by dexteritie and skill, and joyned arte vnto vertue, not for the vſe of private contentions, but for the wars and Roman peoples quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. A popular and civill manner of fencing. And beſides the example of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Souldier, above all things, to aime and ſtrike at the face of <hi>Pompeyes</hi> men in the battell of <hi>Pharſalia:</hi> A thouſand other Chieſtaines and Generals have deviſed new faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of weapons, and new kindes of ſtriking, and covering of themſelves, according as the preſent affaires required. But even as <hi>Philopoemen</hi> condemned wreſtling, wherein hee excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others, forſomuch as the preparations appertaining to this exerciſe differed from thoſe that belong to military diſcipline, to which he ſuppoſed, men of honour ſhould ammuſe and addict themſelves. Me thinkes alſo, that this nimbleneſſe or agilitie, to which men faſhion and enure themſelves, their limbes, their turnings, windings, and timble-quicke motions, wherein youth is inſtructed and trained in this new ſchoole, are not onely vnprofitable, but rather contrary and domageable for the vſe of militarie combate: And we ſee our men doe commonly employ particular weapons, in their fence ſchooles, and peculiarly appointed for that purpoſe. And I have ſeene it diſallowed, that a gentleman chalenged to fight with Rapier and Dagger, ſhould preſent himſelfe in the equipage of a man at armes; or that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould offer to come with his cloake inſteade of a Dagger. It is worthy the noting, that <hi>Lachaz</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> ſpeaking of an apprentiſlage, how to manage armes, conformable to ours, ſaith, he could never ſee any notable warrior come of a ſchoole of fence, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from among the maiſters. As for them our owne experience confirmes as much. And for the reſt we may at leaſt ſay, they are ſufficiencies of no relation or correſpondencie. And in the inſtitution of the children of his Common wealth, <hi>Plato</hi> interdicts the artes of ſtriking or playing with fiſts, deviſed by <hi>Amycus</hi> and <hi>Epeius,</hi> and to wreſtle, invented by <hi>Anthoeus</hi> and <hi>Cecyo:</hi> becauſe they aime at another end, then to adapt youth to warlike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

and have no affinitie with it. But I digreſſe much from my theame. The Emperour <hi>Mauricius,</hi> being forewarned by dreames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſundry prognoſtications, that one <hi>Phocas</hi> a Souldier at that time yet vnknowne, ſhould kill him, demanded of <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne in law, who that <hi>Phocas</hi> was, his nature, his conditions, and cuſtomes, and how amongſt other things <hi>Philip</hi> told him, he was a fainte, cowardly, and timorousfellow: The Emperour thereby preſently concluded, that he was both cruell and a murtherer. What makes tyrants ſo bloud-thirſtie? it is the care of their ſecuritie, and that their faint-hart yeelds them no other meanes to aſſure themſelves, then by rooting out thoſe which may in any ſort offend them; yea ſilly women for feare they ſhould or bite or ſcrach them?</p>

When they are ſo rich of their owne beautie, and may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well vpholde themſelves alone, I am content with a haires end, to fitte or joyne them to my purpoſe. Amongſt others who had beene condemned by <hi>Philip,</hi> was one <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> Prince of the Theſſalians: After whome he cauſed his two ſonnes in lawe to bee put to death; each of them leaving a yoong ſonne behinde him. <hi>Theoxena</hi> and <hi>Arco</hi> were the two widdowes. <hi>Theoxena</hi> although ſhee were inſtantly vrged therevnto, coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be induced to marry againe. <hi>Arco</hi> tooke to husbande <hi>Poris</hi> a chiefe man amongſt the Aenians, and by him had diverſe children, all which ſhe left very yoong. <hi>Theoxena</hi> moved by a motherly charitie toward her yoong nephewes, and ſo to have them in her protection and bringing vp wedded <hi>Poris.</hi> Vpon this came out the proclamation of the Kings Edict. This noble-minded mother, diſtruſting the kings crueltie, and fearing the mercileſnes of his Sate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities or officers towards theſe noble, hopefull and tender youths, feared not to ſay, that ſhee would rather kil them with her owne hands, then deliver them. <hi>Poris</hi> amazed at her proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, promiſeth her ſecretly to convey them to <hi>Athens,</hi> there by ſome of his faithfull friends to be kept ſafely. They take occaſion of an yearely feaſt, which to the honor of <hi>Aeneas</hi> was ſolemnized at <hi>Aenia,</hi> and thither they goe, where having all day-long aſſiſted to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and publike banket: night being come, they convay themſelves iuto a ſhippe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe, in hope to ſave themſelves by Sea. But the winde fell out ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, that the next morning they found themſelves in view of the towne, whence the night before they had hoiſed ſailes, where they were purſued by the guarders and Souldiers of the Porte. Which <hi>Poris</hi> perceiving, laboured to haſten and encourage the Mariners to ſhift away: But <hi>Theoxena,</hi> enraged through love and revenge, remembring her firſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, prepared both weapons and poiſon, and preſenting them to their ſight, thus ſhee beſpake them: Oh my deere children, take a good heart, death is now the onely meane of your defence and libertie, and ſhall be a juſt cauſe vnto the Gods for their holy juſtice. Theſe bright-keene blades, theſe full cuppes ſhall free you the paſſage vnto it. Courage therefore, and thou my eldeſt childe, take this ſworde to die the ſtrongeſt death. Who on the one ſide hauing ſo vndaunted a perſwader, and on the other their enemies ready to cut their throates, in furious manner ranne all to that which came next to his hand. And ſo all goared and panting were throwne into the Sea. <hi>Theoxena,</hi> prowde ſhee had ſo gloriouſlie provided for her childrens ſafety, lovingly embracing her husband, ſaide thus vnto him; Oh my deare heart, let vs follow theſe boyes, and together with them enjoy one ſelfe ſame graue, And ſo cloſe-claſpt-together, they flung themſelves in to the maine: So that the ſhip was brought to ſhoare againe, but emptie of hir Maiſters.

And I wot not, whether in that meane time we bring him to deſpaire: For, what plight can the ſoule of a man be in, that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon wheele, or after the olde faſhion, nailed vpon a Croſſe, and xxiiij. houres together expects his death? <hi>Ioſephus</hi> reporteth, that whileſt the Romane warres continued in <hi>Iurie,</hi> paſſing by a place where certaine Iewes had beene crucified three dayes before, he knew three of his friends amongſt them, and having gotten leave to remoove then, two of them died, but the third lived long after. <hi>Chalcondylas</hi> a man of credite, in the memories he left off matters happened in his time and thereabouts, maketh report of an extreame torment, the Emperor <hi>Mechmed</hi> was often wont to put in practiſe, which was by one onely blow of a Cimitary or broad Perſian Sword, to have men cutte in two parts, by the waſte of the body, about the Diaphragma, which is a membrane lying ouerthwart the lower part of the breaſt, ſeparating the heart and lights from the ſtomake, which cauſed them to dy two deaths at once: and affirmeth that both parts were ſeene full of life, to moove and ſtirre long time after, as if they had beene in lingring torment.

But it is by fits. And in the lives of thoſe Heroes or noble worthies of former ages, are often found wonderfull parts, and which ſeeme greatly to exceede our naturall forces: but they are prankes or parts conſonant to truth: and it may hardly be believed, mans ſoule may ſo be tainted and fed with thoſe ſo high-raiſed conditions, that vnto it they may become as ordinary and naturall.

But it is a kinde of paſſion, which vrgeth, mooveth, agitateth and in ſome ſorte raviſheth her from out her ſelfe: for, that guſt overblowne, and ſtorme paſt, we ſee, it will vnawares vnbend and looſe it ſelfe, if not to the loweſt pitch, at leaſt to be no more the ſame ſhe was, ſo that vpon every ſlight occaſion, for a bird loſt, or for a glaſſe broken, we ſuffer our ſelves to be mooved and diſtempered very neere as one of the vulgar ſort. <hi>Fxcept order, moderation and conſtancie, I imagine all things may bee done by an indifferent and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive man.</hi> Therefore ſay wiſemen, that directly to judge of a man, his common actions muſt ſpecially be controuled, and he muſt every day be ſurpriſed in his worky-day clothes. <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rho,</hi> who framed ſo pleaſant a Science of ignorance, aſſaide (as all other true Philoſophers) to faſhion his life anſwerable to his doctrine. And foraſmuch as hee maintained the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mans judgement, to be ſo extreame, as it could take nor reſolution, nor inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and would perpetually ſuſpend it, ballancing, beholding and receiving all things, as indifferent: It is reported of him, that he ever keept himſelfe after one faſhion, looke and countenance: If he had begunne a diſcourſe, he would end it, though the party to whom he ſpake, were gone: And if he went any where, he would not goe an inche out of his path, what let or obſtacle ſomever came in his way; being kept from falls, from cartes or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents by his friends. For, to feare or ſhunne any thing, had beene to ſhocke his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which remooved all election and certainty from his very ſenſes. He ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelfe to be cut and cautherized, with ſuch conſtancie, as he was never ſeene ſo much as to ſhrug, twitch, move or winke with his eyes. It is ſomething to bring the minde to theſe imaginations, but more to joine the effects vnto it, yet is it not impoſſible. But to joyne them with ſuch preſeverance and conſtancie, as to eſtabliſh it for an ordinary courſe; verily in theſe enterpriſes ſo farre from common vſe, it is almoſt incredible to be done. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, that he was ſometimes found in his houſe, bitterly ſcolding with his ſiſter, for which being reproved, as hee that wronged his indifferencie: What? ſaid hee, <hi>muſt this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman alſo ſerve as a witneſſe to my rules?</hi> Another time, being found to defend himſelfe from a dog: <hi>It is</hi> (replied he) <hi>very hard, altogether to dispoyle and ſhake off man:</hi> And man muſt endevour and enforce himſelfe to reſiſt and confront all things, firſt by effects, but if the worſt befall, by reaſon and by diſcourſe. It is now about ſeaven or eight yeares ſince, that a countrie man, yet living, not above two leagues from this place, having long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beene much vexed and troubled in minde, for his wives jealouſie; one day comming home from his worke, and ſhe after her accuſtomed maner welcomming and entertaining him with brawling and ſcowlding, as one vnable to endure her any longer, fell into ſuch a moodie rage, that ſodainely with a Sickle, which he held in his hand, he cleane cut off thoſe parts, that were the cauſe of her jealouſie, and flung them in her f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>A late Writer affirmeth, that himſelfe hath ſeene this cuſtome highly reputed in the new diſcovered Eaſt Indiaes, where not only the wives are buried with their husbands, but alſo ſuch ſlaves as hee hath enjoyed; which is done after this manner. The husband being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, the widdow may, if ſhe will (but fewe doe it) requeſt two or three Moneths ſpace to diſpoſe of hir buſines. The day come, adorned as a ſumptuous bride, ſhe mounteth on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and with a cheerful countenance, tell eth every body, ſhe is going to lie with hir bride groome, holding in her left hand a looking-glaſſe, and an arrow in the right. Thus having a while rid vp and downe in great pompe and magnificence, accompanied with her friendes and kinſ-men, and much concourſe of people, in feaſt and jolitie, ſhe is brought vnto a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like place, purpoſely appointed for ſuch ſpectacles. Which is a large open place, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt whereof is a pit or grave full of Wood, and neere vnto it an vpraiſed ſcaffold, with foure or five ſteppes to aſcend, vpon which ſhe is brought, and ſerved with a ſtately and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous banket, Which ended, ſhe beginneth to dance and ſing, and when ſhe thinks good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the fire to be kindled. That done, ſhe commeth downe againe, and taking the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of hir Husbands kindred by the hand, they goe together to the nex River, where ſhee ſtrippes hir ſelfe all naked, and diſtributeth hir jewels and clothes among hir friends, then plungeth herſelfe in the Water, as if ſhe meant to waſh away hir ſins; then comming out ſhe enwrappeth herſelfe in a yellow piece of linnen cloth, about the length of fourteene yards; And giving hir hand againe vnto hir Husbands Kinſ-man, they returne vnto the Mount, where ſhe ſpeakes vnto the people, to whom (if ſhe have any) ſhe recommendeth hir Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Betweene the Pitte and Mount, there is commonly a Curtaine drawne, leſt the ſight of that burning furnace might diſmay them: Which many, to ſhew the greater courage, will not have it drawne.

If they be perſons of meane quality, the dead mans body is carried to the place where they intend to bury him, and there he is placed ſitting; his Widdow kneeling before him with hir armes cloſe about his middle, and ſo keepeth hirſelfe, whileſt a Wall is erected vp about them both, which raiſed to the height of her ſhoulders, ſome of her kindred taking her by the head behind, wrings her neck about; and having given the laſt gaſpe, the wall is immediately made vp cloſe over their heades, wherein they remaine buried. In the ſame Country, there was ſomething like to this in their Gymnoſophiſts, or wiſe-men, who not by meanaces-or compulſions of others, nor by the violence of a ſodaine humour but by the expreſſe and voluntary profeſſion of their rule, their maner was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they attained vnto a certaine age, or ſaw themſelves threatned by ſome ſickeneſſe, to cauſe a pile of Wood to be erected, and vpon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a rich bedde; and having cheerefully feaſted their friends and acquaintance, with ſuch a reſolution laide themſelves downe in that bedde, that fire ſet vnto it, they were never ſeene to ſtirre nor hand nor foote? and thus died one of them, named <hi>Calanus,</hi> in the preſence of all the army of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. And who had not ſo made himſelfe away, was neither eſteemed holy nor abſolutely happy amongſt them? ſending his ſoule purged and purified by fire, after it had conſumed whatſoever was mortall and iterreſtriall in it. This conſtant premeditation of al the life, is that which makes the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Amongeſt our other diſputation, that of <hi>Fatum,</hi> hath much entermedled it ſelfe: and to joyne future things, and our will it ſelfe vnto a certaine vnavoidable neceſſity, wee yet ſtand vpon that argument of former times: ſince God foreſeeth all things muſt thus happen as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he doeth: They muſt then neceſſarily happen ſo. To which our Clarks and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters anſwere, that to ſee any thing come to paſſe, as we doe, and likewiſe God (for hee being preſent in full eſſence, rather feeth than foreſeeth) is not to force the ſame to happen: yea we ſee, becauſe things come to paſſe, but things happen not becauſe we ſee. The hapning makes the ſcience or knowledge, and not knowledge the happening. What we ſee come to paſſe, happeneth; but it might come to paſſe otherwiſe. And God in the eternall regiſter of the cauſes of happenings, which he hath in his preſcience, hath alſo thoſe, which are called caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and the voluntary, which depend of the liberty, he hath given vnto our free wil, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth we ſhall faile, becauſe our will ſhall have beene to faile. I have ſeene diverſe encourage their troupes with this fatall neceſſitie: For, if our houre be tied vnto a certaine point neither the musket-ſhottes of our enemies, nor our courage, nor our flight and cowardize, can either advance or recoyle the ſame.</p>
                        <p>This may well be ſaide, but ſeeke you who ſhall effect it: And if it be ſo, that a ſtrong and lively faith, doth likewiſe draw action after it: truely this faith (wherewith wee ſo much fill our mouths) is marvelous light in our times: except the contempt it hath of workes, make her diſdaine their company. So it is, that to the ſame purpoſe, the Lord of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a witneſſe as any other, tells vs of the Bedoins, a nation entermingled with the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, with whom our King Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> had to deale in the holy land, who ſo confidently believed in their religion, the dayes of every one to be prefixed and numbred from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by an inevitable preordinance, that they went all bare and naked to the warres, except a Turkiſh Glaive in their hand, and their body covered but with a white linnen-cloth: And for the the bittereſt curſe, if they chanced to fall out one with another, they had ever in their mouth: <hi>Curſed be thou, as he that armeth himſelfe for feare of death.</hi> Here is another maner of triall or a beliefe or faith, then ours, In this rank may likewiſe be placed that which thoſe two religious men of <hi>Florence,</hi> not long ſince gave vnto their countrymen. Being in ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betweene themſelves about certaine points of learning; they accorded to goe both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, in the preſence of all the people, and in the open market place, each one for the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his opinion; and all preparations were ready made, an execution to be performed, but that by an vnexpected accident it was interrupted.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:12117:205"/>
thus began his ſpeech. <hi>Being one day a hunting, I found a Hare ſitting in her forme, and although I had a brace of excellent good gray-houndes with me in a ſlip or leaſh, I thought it good, becauſe I would be ſure of my game to vſe my bow; for ſhe was a very faire marke I beganne to ſhoot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A notable man, great in yeares, in name, in dignity and in learning, vaunted himſelfe vnto me, that he was induced to a certaine moſt important change of his religion, by a ſtrange and fantaſticall incitation: and in all things ſo il-concluding that I deemed the ſame ſtronger and more forcible, being taken contrary. He termed it a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and ſo did I, but in a different ſenſe. Their hiſtorians ſay, that perſwaſion having po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularly beene ſcattered amongſt the Turkes, of the fatall and inflexible preſcription of their dayes, doth apparantly ayde to warrant and emboulden them in dangers. And I know a great Prince, who happily thrives by it, be it he beleive it, or take it for an excuſe to hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe extraordinarily; provided fortune be not ſoone wearie to favour and backe him. There hath not happened in our memorie a more admirable effect of reſolution, than of thoſe two villaines that conſpired the death of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> It is ſtrange how, the laſt, who perfourmed the ſame could be induced or encouraged to vndergoe ſuch an enterpriſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his fellow (though he had reſolutely attempted it, and had all might be required for ſuch an action) had ſo ill ſucceſſe, and miſcarried. And <hi>in theſe ſteps, and with the ſame weapons, to goe and vndertake a Lord, armed with ſo late an inſtruction of diſtrust; mighty in friends and followers; puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of bodily ſtrength; in his owne hall; amiddeſt his ſervants and guarde; and in a Citty wholy at his devotion. It muſt of force be ſaide, that in perfourming it, he employed a well-directed and reſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lute hand, and a dreadleſſe courage mooved by a vigorous paſſion.</hi> A Poynard is more ſure to wound a man, which forſomuch as it requireth more motion and vigor of the arme, than a piſtole, it's ſtroke is more ſubject to be hindred or avoided. That the firſt ranne not to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured death, I make no great doubt, for the hopes wherewith hee might be entertained could not harbour in a well ſetled and reſolute minde; and the conduct of his exploit, ſheweth, hee wanted no more that, then courage. The motions of ſo forcible a perſwaſion may be diverſe; for, our fantaſie diſpoſeth of her ſelfe and of vs as ſhe pleaſeth. The execution committed neere <hi>Orleans</hi> had no coherence with this, wherein was more hazard, then vigor; the blow was not mortall, had not fortune made it ſo: and the enterpriſe to ſhoote on horſe-backe and farre-off, and to one who mooved ſtill according to the motion of his horſe was the attempt of a man, that rather loved to miſſe of his effect, then faile to ſave himſelfe. What followed did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhew it. For, he was ſo amazed &amp; drunken with the thought of ſo haughty an execution, as he loſt all his ſenſes, both to worke his eſcape, and direct his tongue in his anſweres. What needed he have done more, then recover his friends by croſſing of a river; It is a meane, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have caſt my ſelfe in farre leſſe dangers, and which I thinke of ſmall hazard, how broade ſoever, alwayes provided your horſe finde an eaſie entrance, and on the further ſide you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee an eaſie and ſhallow landing, according to the courſe of the ſtreame of the water. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when the horrible ſentence was pronounced againſt him, anſwered ſtowtly, <hi>I was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it, and I ſhall amaze you with my patience.</hi> The Aſſaſſines, a nation depending of <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> are eſteemed among the Mahometiſts of a ſoveraigne devotion and puritie of maners; they hold, that the readieſt and ſhorteſt way to gaine Paradiſe, is to kill ſome one of a contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: therefore hath it often beene ſeene, that one or two in their bare doublets have vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to aſſault mightie enemies, with the price of an aſſured death, and without any care of their owne danger. And thus was our Earle <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Tripoli</hi> murthered or aſſaſſinated (this word is borrowed from their name) in the middeſt of his Cittie, during the time of our warres in the holy land: And likewiſe <hi>Conrade</hi> Marquis of <hi>Montferrato,</hi> his murtherers being brought to their torture, were ſeene to ſwel with pride, that they had performed ſo worthy an exploit.</p>

I ſawe two dayes ſince a childe, whom two men and a nurce (which named themſelves to be his father, his Vnckle, and his Aunt) carried about with intent to get ſome money with the ſight of him, by reaſon of his ſtrangenes. In all the reſt, he was as other children are, He ſtoode vpon his feete, went and pratled in a maner as all others of his age: Hee would never take nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by his nurces breaſt; and what in my preſence was offred to be put in his mouth, he chewed a little, and put it all out againe. His puling differed ſomewhat from others: He was juſt fourteene moneths olde. Vnder his paps he was faſtned and joyned to an other childe, but had no head, and who had the conduite of his backe ſtopped, the reſt whole.

I looſe my ſelfe in haſtineſſe and violence, but not in trouble: So that, let me ſpend all maner of injurious wordes at random and without all heede, and never reſpect to place my points pertinently, and where they may doe moſt hurt: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly I employ nothing but my tongue. My boyes ſcape better cheape in great matters, then in ſmall trifles. Slight occaſions ſurpriſe me, and the michiefe is, that after you are once falne into the pit, it is no matter who thruſts you in, you never ceaſe till you come to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. The fall preſſeth, haſteneth, mooveth and furthereth it ſelfe. In great occaſions I am pleaſed, that they are ſo juſt. that every body expects a reaſonable anger to inſue. I glorify my ſelfe to deceive their expectation. Againſt theſe I bandy and prepare my ſelfe; they make me ſummon vp my wits, and threaten to carry me very farre, if I would follow them. I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily keepe my ſelfe from falling into them, and if I ſtay for them, I am ſtronge enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the impulſion of this paſſion, what violent cauſe ſoever it hath.

The rage is not engendred but by the concurrencie of cholers, which are eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one of another, and are not borne at one inſtant. Let vs allow every man his courſe, ſo ſhall we ever be in peace. Oh profitable preſcription, but of an hard execution! I ſhall ſome time ſeeme to be angry for the order and direction of my houſe, without any juſt emotion. Accoding as my age yeeldeth my humours more ſharpe or peeviſh, ſo doe I endevour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my ſelfe againſt them, and if I can I will hereafter enforce my ſelfe to be leſſe froward and not ſo teaſty.

Nevertheleſſe I finde him ſomewhat malapert and bolde in that paſſage of his <hi>Methode of Historie,</hi> when he accuſeth <hi>Plutarke,</hi> not onely of ignorance (wherein I woulde have let him ſay his pleaſure, for that is not within my element) but alſo that he often writeth, things, altogether incredible and meerely fabulous (theſe are his very words) If he had ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſaid things otherwiſe than they are, it had beene no great reprehenſion: for, what we have not ſeene, we receive from others and vpon truſt: And I ſee him ſometime, wittingly and in good earneſt report one and ſame ſtory diverſly: As, the judgemenns of three beſt captaines that ever were, ſpoken by <hi>Hanibal,</hi> is otherwiſe in <hi>Flaminius</hi> his life, &amp; otherwiſe in <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> But to taxe him, to have taken incredible and impoſſible things for ready payment, is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the more judicious author of the World of want of judgement. And ſee heere his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: As (ſaith he) when he reports, that a Childe of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> ſuffered all his belly and guttes to be torne out by a Cubbe or yoong Foxe, which he had ſtolne. and kept cloſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his garment, rather than he would diſcouer his theft. Firſt, I finde this example ill cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: Foraſmuch as it is verie heard to limit the powers of the ſoules-faculties, whereas of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

forces, we have more law to limite and know them: And therfore, had I beene to write of ſuch a ſubject I would rather have made choyce of an example of this ſecond kinde. And ſome there be leſſe credible. As amongeſt others, that which he reportes of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who being fore wounded, gave ſo great a blow with a ſword vnto one of his enemies, armed at all aſſayes, and with all pieces, as he cleft him from the Crowne of the head downe to the groine, ſo that the body fell in two pieces. In which example I finde no great wonder, nor doe I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of his excuſe, wherewith he cloaketh <hi>Plutarke,</hi> to have added this Word, (as it is ſaid) to forewarne vs, and reſtraine our beliefe. For, if it be not in things received by authoritie and reverence of antiquity or religion, neither would himſelfe have received, nor propoſed to vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to believe things in themſelves incredible: And that (as it is ſaide) hee doeth not heere ſette downe this phraſe to that purpoſe, may eaſily bee perceived, by what himſelfe in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces telleth vs vpon the ſubject of the Lacedemonian Childrens patience, of examples hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in his time, much harder to be perſwaded: As that which <hi>Cicero</hi> hath alſo witneſſed before him becauſe, (as he ſaith) he had beene there himſelfe: That even in their times there were Children found prepared to endure all maner of patience, whereof they made triall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dianaes</hi> Aulter, and which ſuffered themſelves to bee whipped, till the blood trilled downe all partes of their body, not onely without crying, but alſo without ſobbing: and ſome who voluntarily ſuffered themſelvs to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what <hi>Plutarke</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and a hundreth other witneſſes averre, that aſſiſting at a ſacrifice, a burning coale happened to fall into the ſleeve of a Lacedemonian childe, as he was buſie at incenſing, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his arme to burne ſo long, vntill the ſmell of his burnt fleſh came to all the by-ſtanders. There was nothing according to their cuſtome, ſo much called their reputation in queſtion, and for which they endured more blame and ſhame, than to be ſurpriſed ſtealing. I am ſo well inſtructed of thoſe mens greatneſſe of courage, that this report, doth not onely not ſeeme incredible to mee, as to <hi>Bodine,</hi> but I doe not ſo much as deeme it rare, or ſuppoſe it ſtrange: The Spartane ſtory is full of thouſands of much more rare and cruell examples; then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rate, it containeth nothing but myracle. Concerning this point of ſtealing, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> reporteth, that whileſt hee lived, there could never be found any kinde of torment that might in any ſort compell the Aegyptians ſurprized filching (which was much vſed amongeſt them) to confeſſe and tell but their names. A Spaniſh Peaſant being laide vpon the racke, about the complices of the murther of the Pretor <hi>Lucius Piſo,</hi> in the midſt of his torments cried out, his friends ſhould not ſtir, but with all ſecuritie aſſiſt him, &amp; that it was not in the power of any griefe or paine to wreſt one word of confeſſion from him: and the firſt day nothing elſe could poſſibly be drawne from him: The next morrow as he was led toward the racke, to be tormented a new, he by ſtrong violence freed himſelfe from out his keepers hands, and ſo furiouſly ranne with his head againſt a Wall, that he burſt his braines out, and preſently fell downe dead. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> having glutted &amp; wearied the moody cruelty of <hi>Neroes</hi> Satellites or officers, and ſtoutly endured their fire, their beatings, &amp; their engins a whole day long, without any one voyce, or word of revealing hir conſpiracy, &amp; the next day after, being againe brought to the torture, with hir limbs bruzed &amp; broken, convayed the lace or ſtring of hir Gowne over one of the pillers of the Chaire wherein ſhe ſate, with a ſliding knot in it, into which ſodainely thruſting hir head, ſhe ſtrangled herſelfe with the weight of hir body: Having the courage to dye ſo, and ſteale from the firſt torments; ſeemeth ſhee not purpoſely to have lent hir life to the triall of hir patience of the precedent day, only to mocke that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and encorage others to attempt the like enterprize againſt him? And he that ſhall enquire of our Argolettiers or Free-booters, what experiences they have had in theſe our late Civill wars, ſhall no doubt find effects &amp; examples of patience, of obſtinacy and ſtif-neckedneſſe in theſe our miſerable dayes, and amidſt the effeminate, and puling worldlings farre beyond the Aegyptian, and well worthy to be compared to thoſe already reported of Spartan vertue. I know, there have beene found ſeely boores, who have rather endured to have their feet broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon a Greedyron, their fingers ends cruſht and wrung with the locke of a Piſtole, their eyes all bloody to be thruſt out of their heades with wringing and wreſting of a corde aboute their foreheads, before they would ſo much as be ranſomed. I have ſeene and ſpoken with one, who had beene left all naked in a ditch for dead, his necke all bruſed and ſwolne, with a halter about it, wherewith he had beene dragged a whole night at a horſes taile through thick &amp; thinne, with a hundred thruſts in his body, given him with daggers, not to kil him outright,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:12117:209"/>
but to grieve and terrifie him, and who had patiently endured all that, and loſt both ſpeech and ſenſe, fully reſolved (as himſelfe told me) rather to die a thouſand deaths (as verily, if you apprehend what he ſuffered, he paſt more then one full death) then promiſe any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; yet was he one of the wealthieſt husbandmen in all his countrie. How many have bin ſeene, who have patiently endured to be burnt and roſted for vnknowne and wilful opinions, which they had borrowed of others: My ſelfe have knowne a hundred and a hundred wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for, the ſaying is, Gaskoine heads have ſome prerogative in that) whom you might ſooner have made to bite a red-hot piece of yron, then recant an opinion, they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in anger. They will be exaſperated and growe more fell againſt blowes and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And he who firſt invented the tale of that woman, which by no threates or ſtripes, would leave to call her husband pricke-lowſe, and being caſt into a pond and duckt vnder water, lifted vp her hands, and joyning her two thumbs-nailes in act to kill lice above her head, ſeemed to call him louſie ſtill, deviſed a fable, whereof in truth we dayly ſee the expreſſe image in divers womens obſtinacie and wilfulneſſe.

The other example, he alledgeth of things incredible, and altogether fabulous, reported by <hi>Plutarke,</hi> is, that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Ephories, becauſe he had drawne tee harts and good wills of all his fellow-citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ento himſelfe alone. I knowe not what marke of falſhood, or ſhew of impoſſibiiltie he findes in it; but ſo it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſpeakes there of things which in all likelihood were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne to him, then to vs: And as it was not ſtrange in <hi>Geecce,</hi> to ſee men puniſhed and exiled, onely becauſe they were too popular, and pleaſed the common people over much. Witneſſe the <hi>Oſtraciſme</hi> amongſt the Athenians, and the <hi>Petaliſme</hi> among the Siracuſans. There is another accuſation in the ſame place, which for <hi>Plutarkes</hi> ſake doth ſomewhat touch me, where he ſaieth, that he hath very well and in good trueth ſorted the Romanes with the Romanes, and the Graecians amongſt themselues, but not the Romanes with the Graecians, witneſſe (ſaith he) <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides, Syll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hee is a Philoſopher that teacheth vs vertue. But let vs ſee, whether wee can warrant him from this reproch of prevarication and falſe-hood.

naturall diſpoſitions and their ſufficiencie, then their fortune: I am of a cleane oppoſite opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to <hi>Bodine,</hi> and thinke that <hi>Cicero</hi> and old <hi>Cato</hi> are much behinde or ſhort of their paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels. For this purpoſe, I would rather have choſen the example of yong <hi>Cato</hi> compared to <hi>Phocion:</hi> for in that paire might well be found a more likely diſparitie for the Romanes advantage. As for <hi>Marcellus, Sylla</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> I ſee very well, how their exploites of warre, be more ſwolne, glorious and pompous, then the Craecians, whom <hi>Plutarke</hi> compareth vnto them; but the moſt vertuous, and faireſt actions, no more in warre, then elſewhere, are not alwayes the moſt famous. I often ſee the names of ſome Captaines ſmothered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the brightneſſe of other names of leſſer deſert: witneſſe <hi>Labienus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entidius, Teleſinus</hi> and diverſe others.

When <hi>Plutarke</hi> compares them, he doth not for all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall them. Who could more eloquently, and with more conſcience note their differences? Doth he compare the victories, the exploites of armes, the power of the armies conducted by <hi>Pompey</hi> and his triumphs vnto thoſe of <hi>Ageſilaus?</hi> I doe not believe (ſaith he) that <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> himſelfe (were he living) though it were granted him to write his pleaſure for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> durſt ever dare to admit any compariſon betweene them. Seemeth he to equall <hi>Lyſander</hi> to <hi>Sylla?</hi> There is no compariſon (ſaith he) neither in number of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor in hazard of battels betweene them: for, <hi>Lyſander</hi> onely obtained two ſea-battels, &amp;c. This is no derogation from the Romanes. If he have but ſimply preſented them vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Graecians, what ever diſparitie may be betweene them, he hath not in any ſort wronged them. And <hi>Plutarke</hi> doth not directly counterpoiſe them. In ſome there is none perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before others; He compareth the parts and the circumſtances one after another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally judgeth of them. If therefore any would goe about to convince him of favour, hee ſhould narrowly ſift out ſome particular judgement; or in generall and plaine termes ſay, he hath miſſed in ſorting ſuch a Graecian to ſuch a Romane, foraſmuch as there are other more ſortable and correſpondent, and might better be compared, as having more reference one vnto another.</p>

                        <p>PHiloſophy thinketh, ſhe hath not ill employed hir meanes, having yeelded the ſoveraine rule of our minde, and the authoritie to reſtraine our appetites, vnto reaſon. Amongeſt which, thoſe who judge there is none more violent, than thoſe which love begetteth, have this for their opinion, that they holde both of body and ſoule; and man is wholy poſſeſſed with them: ſo that health it ſelfe depended of them, and phiſike is ſometimes conſtrained to ſerve them inſteede of a Panderſhip. But contrariwiſe, a man might alſo ſay, that the commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body doth bring abatement and weakeneſſe vnto them; becauſe ſuch deſires are ſubject to ſacietie and capable of materiall remedies. Many who have endevored to free and exempt their mindes from the continuall alarumes, which this appetite did aſſaile them with, have vſed inciſions, yea and cut-off the mooving, turbulent and vnruly parts. Others have alayed the force and fervency of them by frequent applications of cold things, as ſnow and vineger. The haire-cloths which our forefathers vſed to weare for this purpoſe, wherof ſome made ſhirts, and ſome waſte-bands or girdles, to torment their reignes.

aſſayed the ſtrongeſt: For, experience ſheweth vs, that ſuch emotion doth often maintaine it ſelfe vnderbaſe, rude and ſlovenly cloathes: and haire-cloathes doe not ever make thoſe poore that weare them. <hi>Zenocrates</hi> proceeded more rigorouſly? for, his Diſciples to make triall of his continencie, having convayed that beauteous and famous curtizan <hi>Lais</hi> naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bed, ſaving the weapons of hir beauty, wanton alurements, and amorous or love-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing pocions, feeling that maugre all Philoſophicall diſcourſes, and ſtrict rules, his skit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh body beganne to mutinie, he cauſed thoſe members to be burned, which had liſtened to that rebellion. Whereas the paſſions that are in the minde, as ambition, covetouſneſſe and others, trouble reaſon much more: for, it can have no ayde but from it's owne meanes; nor are thoſe appetites capable of ſacietie, but rather ſharpened by enjoying, and augmented by poſſeſſion. The example alone of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> may ſuffice to ſhew vs the diſparitie of theſe appetites, for neuer was man more given to amorous delights. The curious and exact care he had of his body, is an authenticall witneſſe of it, forſomuch as hee vſed the moſt laſcivious meanes that then were in vſe, as to have the haires of his body ſmeered and perfumed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with an extreame and labored curioſitie; being of himſelfe a goodly perſonage, white, of a tall and comely ſtature, of a cheerfull and ſeemly countenance, his face full and round, and his eies browne lively; if at leaſt <hi>Suetonius</hi> may be believed: For, the ſtatues which now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes are to be ſeene of him in <hi>Rome,</hi> anſwer not altogether this portraiture wee ſpeake of.

Thus, (as me ſeemeth) have I good reaſon to deeme him a man extreamelie addicted to all amorous licenciouſneſſe, and of a wanton-laſcivious complexion. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other paſſion of ambition, wherewith he was infinitely infected, and much tainted, when he came once to withſtand the ſame, it made him preſently to give ground. And touching this point, when I call <hi>Mahomet</hi> to remembrance (I meane him that ſubdued <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and who brought the final extermination of the name of Graecians) I know not where theſe two paſſions are more equall ballanced: equally an indefatigable letcher, and a never-tired ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. But when in his life they ſeeme to ſtrive and concurre one with another, the mutinous heate, doeth ever gourmandize the amorous flame. And the latter, although out of naturall ſeaſon did never attaine to a ful and abſolute authority, but when he perceived himſelfe to be ſo aged, that he was vtterly vnable longer to vndergoe the burthen of Warre.

So was his death: Having by a continuall tedious ſiege brought the Citty of <hi>Florence</hi> to ſo narrow a pinch, that the inhabitantes were ready to yeeld him the victory, he yeelded the ſame to them, vpon condition they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver into his hands a wench of excellent beauty that was in the city, of whom he had heard great commendations; which they were enforced to graunt him, and ſo by a private injury to warrant the publike ruine of the Citty.

This Handkercher ſtrongly empoyſoned according to the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:12117:210"/>
cunning skill of his Art, comming to wipe both their enflamed ſecret parts and open pores, did ſo readily convay and diſperſe it's poyſon, that having ſodainely changed their heate into colde, they immediately deceaſed one in anothers aimes. But I will now returne to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> His pleaſures could never make him looſe one minute of an houre, nor turne one ſtep from the occaſions, that might any way further his advancement. This paſſion did ſo ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly overſway all others, and poſſeſſed his minde with ſo vncontrouled an authority, that ſhe carryed him whither ſhe liſt. Truely I am grieued, when in other things I conſider this mans greatneſſe, and the wondrous partes that were in him; ſo great ſufficiencie in all maner of knowledge and learning, as there is almoſt no ſcience wherein he hath not written; He was ſo good an Orator, that diverſe have preferred his eloquence before <hi>Ciceroes:</hi> And himſelfe (in mine opinion) in that facultie thought himſelfe nothing ſhort of him. And his two <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Catoes,</hi> were eſpecially written to over-ballance the eloquence which <hi>Cicero</hi> had emploied in his <hi>Cato.</hi> And for all other matters; was ever minde ſo vigilant, ſo active, and ſo patient of labour as his? And doubtleſſe, it was alſo embelliſhed with ſundry rare ſeedes of vertue. I meane lively, natural and not counterſets. He was exceeding ſober, and ſo homely in his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that <hi>Oppius</hi> reporteth: how vppon a time, through a certaine Cookes negligence, his meat being dreſſed with a kinde of medicinable Oyle, in ſtead of Olive-oyle, and ſo brought to the boorde, although he found it yet he fed hartily of it, only becauſe hee would not ſhame his Hoſte. Another time he cauſed his Baker to bee whipped, becauſe hee had ſerved him with other, than common houſhold bread, <hi>Cato</hi> himſelfe was wont to ſay of him, that hee <hi>was the firſt ſober man, had addreſt himſelf to the ruine of his country.</hi> And wheras the ſame <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> called him one day drunkard, it hapned in this maner, Being both together in the Senate houſe, where <hi>Catilines</hi> conſpiracie was much ſpoken of, wherein <hi>Caeſar</hi> was greatly ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have a hand; a note was by a friend of his brought, &amp; in very ſecret ſort delivered him, which <hi>Cato</hi> perceiving, ſuppoſing it might be ſomething, that the Conſpiratours advertized him of, inſtantly ſummoned him to ſhew it, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> to avoide a greater ſuſpition, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not: It was by chance an amorous letter, which <hi>Servilia Catoes</hi> ſiſter writ to him: <hi>Cato</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read-it, threw it at him, ſaying, hold it againe thou drunkard. I ſay, it was rather a word of diſdaine and anger, than an expreſſe reproch of this vice; as often we nicke-name thoſe that anger vs, with the firſt nicke-names of reproaches, that come into our mouth, though meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent to thoſe with whom we fall out. Conſidering, that the vice wherewith <hi>Cato</hi> charged him, hath neare coherencie vnto that, wherein he had ſurpriſed <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> (as the vulgar Proverb ſaith) agree well together; but with me <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> is much more blithe and game-ſome, being accompanied with ſobrietie.</p>
                        <p>The examples of his mildneſſe and clemencie, towards ſuch as had offended him, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: I meane, beſides thoſe he ſhewed during the civill warres, which (as by his owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings may plainely appeare) he vſed to blandiſh and allurehis enemies, to make them feare his future domination and victorie the leſſe. But if any ſhall ſay, thoſe examples are not of validitie to witnes his genuine and naturall affabilitie, we may lawfully anſwere, that at leaſt they ſhew vs a wonderfull confidence, and greatneſſe of courage to have beene in him. It hath often befalne him, to ſend whole armies backe againe to his enemies, after he had vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, without dayning to binde them ſo much, as with an oth, if not to favour, at leaſt not to beare armes againſt him. He hath three or foure times taken ſome of <hi>Pompeys</hi> chiefe Captaines priſoners, and as often ſet them at libertie againe. <hi>Pompey</hi> declared all ſuch as would not follow and accompanie him in his wars, to be his enemies; and he cauſed thoſe to be proclamed as friends, who either would not ſtirre at all, or not effectually arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt him. To ſuch of his Captaines as fled from him, to procure other conditions, he ſent them their weapons, their horſes and all other furniture. The Citties he had taken by maine force, he freed to follow what faction they would, giving them no other gariſon, then the memorie of his clemencie and mildnes. In the day of his great battaile of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he expreſly inhibited, that vnleſſe they were driven to vnavoidable extremitie, no man ſhould lay hands vpon any Romane cittizen. In my judgement theſe are very hazardous partes, and it is no wonder, if in the civill warres or tumultuous broiles, we have now on foote, thoſe that fight for the ancient lawes and ſtate of their countrie, as he did, doe not follow and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example. They are extraordinarie meanes, and which onelye belongs to <hi>Caeſars</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to his admirable fore-ſight, ſuccesfully to direct, and happily to conduct them.

When I conſider the incomparable greatneſſe and vnvaluable worth of his minde, I excuſe Victorie, in that ſhee could not well give him over, in this moſt vnjuſt and vnnaturall cauſe. But to returne to his clemencie; wee have divers genuine and lively examples, even in the time of his al-ſwaying gouernment, when all things were reduced into his handes, and hee needed no longer to diſſemble. <hi>Caius Memmius,</hi> had written certaine detracting and railing orations againſt him, which hee at full and moſt ſharpely had anſwered, nevertheleſſe hee ſhortly after helped to make him Conſull. <hi>Caius Calvus,</hi> who had compoſed divers moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Epigrams againſt him having employed ſundrie of his friendes to bee reconciled to him againe, <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſcended to write firſt vnto him. And our good <hi>Catullus,</hi> who vnder the name of <hi>Mamurra</hi> had ſo rudely and bitterly railed againſt him, at laſt comming to excuſe himſelfe, <hi>Caeſar</hi> that very night made him to ſuppe at his owne table. Having beene adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed how ſome were overlaviſh in rayling againſt him, all hee did was but in a publike ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to declare how hee was advertiſed of it. His enemies, he feared leſſe then he hated them. Certaine conſpiracies and conventicles were made againſt his life, which being diſcovered vnto him, he was contented by an edict to publiſh, how he was throughly enformed of them, and never proſecuted the Authors. Touching the reſpect hee ever bare vnto his friendes; <hi>Caius Oppius</hi> traveling with him, and falling very ſicke, having but one chamber he reſigned the ſame vnto him, and himſelfe was concented to lie all night abroade and vpon the bare ground. Concerning his juſtice, he cauſed a ſervant of his whom hee exceedingly loved, to be executed, for ſomuch as he had laine with the wife of a Roman Knight, although noe man ſued or complained of him. Never was man, that ſhewed more moderation in his victorie, or more reſolution in his adverſe fortune. But all theſe noble inclinations, rich giftes, woorthy qualities, were altered ſmoothered and eclipſed by this furious paſſion of ambition; by which he ſuffered himſelfe to be ſo farre miſ-ledde, that it may be well affirmed, ſhe onely ruled the Sterne of all his actions.

To conclude, this onely vice (in mine opinion) loſt, and overthrew in him the faireſt naturall and richeſt in genuitie that ever was; and hath made his memorie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable to all honeſt mindes, inſomuch as by the ruine of his countrey, and ſubverſion of the mightieſt State and moſt flouriſhing Common-wealth, that ever the worlde ſhall ſee, hee went about to procure his glorie. A man might contrariewiſe finde diverſe examples of greate perſons, whome pleaſure hath made to forget the conduct of their owne affaires, as <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> and others: but where love and ambition ſhould be in one equall balance. and with like forces mate one another, I will never doubt, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> would gaine the prize and gole of the victorle.

                        <p>IT is reported of divers chiefe Generals in warre, that they have particularly affected ſome peculiar booke or other: as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great highly eſteemed <hi>Homer; Scipio Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eanus, Xenophon: Marcus Brutus, Polybius; Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Philip de Comines:</hi> And it is lately averred, that in ſome places, and with ſome men, <hi>Machiavell</hi> is much accompted of: But our late Marſhall <hi>Strozzi,</hi> who had made eſpeciall choiſe to love <hi>Caeſar;</hi> without doubt, I thinke of all other choſe beſt: for truely he ought to be the Breviarie of all true Souldiers, as beeing the abſolute and perfect chiefe patterne of Military profeſſion And God hee knowes with what grace, and with what decorum, hee hath embelliſhed this rich ſubject, with ſo pure a kinde of ſpeech, ſo pleaſing and ſo abſolutely perfect, that to my taſte, there are no writing in the world, which in this ſubject may bee compared to his. I will heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter certaine particular and rare parts concerning his maner of warre, which yet remaine in my memory. His Armie beeing ſome what afrighted, vpon the report that ranne of the great forces, which king <hi>Iuba</hi> brought againſt him, inſtead of abating the opinion his ſoldiers had conceived of it, and to diminiſh the meanes or forces of his enemie, having cauſed them
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:12117:212"/>
to be aſſembled altogether, thereby to aſſure and incourage them, he tooke a cleane contrary courſe, to that which in like caſes we are accuſtomed to do: for he bad them troble themſelves no more to finde out the number of the forces, which his enemies brought againſt him, for himſelfe had already true knowledge &amp; certaine intelligence of them: and told them a number farre exceeding both the truth and report of them: following what <hi>Cyrus</hi> commandeth in <hi>Xenophon.</hi> For a ſmuch as the deceipt is not of like interreſt, for a man to finde his enemies in effect weaker then he hoped, then ſtronger indeede, having once conceived an opinion of their weakeneſſe. He enured all his Souldiers ſimply to obey, without controling, gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, or ſpeaking of their captaines deſſeignes, which he never communicated vnto them, but vpon the laſt point of execution: and was pleaſed, if by chance they had any inkling of them, ſo to deceive them, preſently to change his opinion: And having prefixt a place to quarter-in at night, hee hath often beene ſeene to march further, and lengthen his journey, namely if the weather were foule, or if it rained. The Swizzers in the beginning of his warres in <hi>Gaule,</hi> having ſent toward him to give them free paſſage through the Roman coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and he being reſolved by force to empeach them, did notwithſtanding ſhew them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good lookes, and tooke, certaine dayes reſpit to give them an anſwere, during which time he might have leaſure to aſſemble his Armie together. Theſe poore people knew not how well he could husband time: For he often repeated, that <hi>the skill to embrace occaſisons in the nicke, is the chiefeſt parte of an abſolute Captaine:</hi> And truely the diligence he vſed in all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, is incredible; and the like was never heard of. If he were not over conſciencious in that vnder colour of ſome treatie, parlie or accord, to take any advantage of his enemies: hee was as little ſcrupulous, in that <hi>he required no other vertue in his Souldiers but valour;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept mutinie and diſobedience, he puniſhed not grealy other vices. After his victories, hee often gave them the reines to all licentiouſneſſe, for a while diſpenſing them from all rules of military diſcipline; ſaying moreover his ſouldiers were ſo well inſtructed, that though they were in theit gayeſt clothes, pranked vp, musked and perfumed, they would notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding runne furiouſly to any combate. And in truth hee loved to ſee them richly armed, and made them weare gilt, graven and ſilvered armours, that their care to keepe them cleane and bright, might make them more fierce, and readie to defend themſelves. Speaking to them, hee ever called them by the name of Fellow-ſouldiers; a name vſed at this day by ſome Captaines; which his ſucceſſour <hi>Augustus</hi> afterward reformed, eſteeming hee had done it for the neceſſitie of his affaires, and to flatter the hearts of thoſe which followed him but voluntarily;</p>

To this curteſie, <hi>Caeſar</hi> did notwithſtanding intermixe a great ſeverity, to ſuppreſſe &amp; keep them humble. His ninth Legion having mutined neere vnto <hi>Placentia,</hi> hee preſently caſſiered the ſame with great ignominie vnto it, notwithſtanding that <hi>Pompey</hi> were yet on foote and ſtrong; and would not receive it into favour, but with humble petitions and entreatie. Hee did more appeaſe them by authoritie and audacitie, then by mildeneſſe and affabilitie. Where hee ſpeaketh of his paſſage over the river of <hi>Rheine,</hi> towardes <hi>Germanie,</hi> hee ſaith, that dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it vnworthy the honour of the Romane people, his Army ſhould paſſe over in ſhippes, he cauſed a bridge to be built, that ſo it might paſſe over drie-foote.

I have alſo noted this in his booke, that hee much accompteth of his exhortations he made to his Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers before any fight: for where he would ſhew to have beene either ſurpriſed or vrged, he ever alledgeth this, that hee had ſo much leaſure as to make an oration to his Souldiers or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: Before that great battell againſt thoſe of <hi>Tournay; Caeſar</hi> (ſaith he) having diſpoſed of the reſt, ranne ſodainely whither fortune carried him, to exhort his men: and meeting with the tenth Legion hee had not leaſure to ſay any thing elſe vnto them, but that <hi>they ſhould</hi>

Verely his tongue hath indivers places much beſtead, and done him notable ſervice, and even whilſt hee lived, his militarie eloquence was ſo highly regarded, that many of his Armie were ſeene to copie and keepe his orations; by which meanes divers volumes were filled with them, and continued many ages after his death, His ſpeech had particular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that his familiar friends, and namely <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> hearing that rehearſed, which had beene collected of his, knew by the Phraſes and words, what was his or not.

Having croſſed the way to <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> with verie few forces, and perceiving the reſt of his Armie (the Conduct whereof hee had left vnto <hi>Antonius,</hi>) to bee ſomewhat ſlowe in comming, hee vndertooke all alone, to repaſſe the Sea, notwithſtanding a violent and raging Tempeſt; and ſecretly ſtole himſelfe away to fetch the reſt of his forces: All the havens on that ſide, yea and all the Sea being poſſeſſed by <hi>Pompey,</hi> And concerning the enterpriſes hee vnder-went with armed hand, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, which in reſpect of the hazard, exceede all diſcourſe of militarie reaſon: for, with how weake meanes vndertooke hee to ſubdue the Kingdome of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and afterward to front the forces of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Iuta,</hi> which were tenne partes greater than his? Mee thinkes ſuch men have had a kinde of more than humane confidence of their fortune: And himſelfe was wont to ſay, that <hi>Haughtie enterpriſes were to be executed and not conſulted vpon.</hi> After the battell of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> having ſent his Armie before into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and himſelfe with onely one ſhip paſſing through the ſtraite of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> hee mette on the Seas with <hi>Lucius Caſſius,</hi> attended on with tenne tall ſhips of Warre; he was ſo farre from ſhunning him, that hee durſt not onely ſtay for him but with all haſte make toward and ſummon him, to yeeld himſelfe to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; which hee did.

Which hee notwithſtanding vnder went: And after he had obtained ſo notable a battell of thoſe which were without, hee ſoone reduced thoſe that were beſieged in the Towne to his mercy. The verie like happened to <hi>Lucullus</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> againſt King <hi>Tigranes</hi> but with an vnlike condition, ſeeing his enemies demiſſeneſſe, with whom <hi>Lucullus</hi> was to deale. I will heere note two rare and extraordinarie events, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſiege of <hi>Alexia;</hi> the one, that the French men beeing all aſſembled together with a purpoſe to meete with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> having diligently ſurvaied and exactly numbred all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, reſolved in their counſell, to cutte-off a great part of this huge multitude for feare they might breede a confuſion. This example is new, to feare to bee over many; yet if it be well taken, it is very likely, that <hi>The bodie of an Armie ought to have a well proportioned greatneſſe, and ordered to indifferent bounds.</hi> Whether it be for the difficulty to feed the ſame, or to lead it in order and keepe it in awe. And we may eaſily verifie by examples, that <hi>Theſe numerous and infinite Armies haue ſeldome brought any not able thing to paſſe:</hi> According to <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Xenophon. It is not the multitude of men, but the number of good men that cauſeth an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:</hi>

The reſt rather breeding confuſion and trouble, than helpe or availe. And <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth</hi> tooke the chiefeſt foundation of his reſolution, againſt the adviſe of all his Captaines, to joyne fight with <hi>Tamburlane,</hi> onely becauſe the innumerable number of men, which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie brought into the field, gave him an aſſured hope of route and confuſion. <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> a ſufficient and moſt expert Iudge in ſuch a caſe, was wont to ſay, that tenne or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand truſty and reſolute fighting men, ought to ſuffice any ſufficient Chieftaine of Warre, to warrant his reputation in any kinde of military exploite. The other point, which ſeemeth to be repugnant both vnto cuſtome and reaſon of Warre, is, that <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ercingentorix,</hi> who was appointed chiefe Generall of all the forces of the revolted <hi>Gaules,</hi> vndertooke to immure and ſhutte himſelfe into <hi>Alexia.</hi> For, <hi>He that hath the commaundement of a whole Countrie. ought never to engage himſelfe, except in caſes of extreamitie,</hi> and where all his reſt and laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge goeth on it, and hath no other hope leſt him, but the defence of ſuch a place. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ought to keepe himſelfe free, that ſo he may have meanes to provide in all partes of his Government. But to returne to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> hee became in time ſomewhat more ſlow, hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and conſiderate, as witneſſeth his familiar friend <hi>Oppius;</hi> deeming, he ſhould not ſo eaſily hazard the honour of ſo many Victories which one onely diſaſter, or miſ-encounter, might make him looſe. It is that the Italians are wont to ſay, when they will or blame or reproach any man with this overdaring, or raſh fond-hardineſle, which is often ſeene in yoong men, calling them, <hi>Biſognoſid honore,</hi> as much to ſay as needie of honour: And that being yet hungrie, greedy and voyde of reputation, they have reaſon to ſeeke after it, whatſoever it may coſt them; Which they ſhould never doe, that have already acquired the ſame. There may be ſome juſt moderation in this deſire of glory, and ſome ſacietie in this appetite, as well as in others; Divers doe ſo practize it. He was farre from that religion of the auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who in their Warres would never prevaile but with meere and genuine vertue: But rather joyned more conſcience vnto it, than now-adayes wee ſhould doe; And would never allow of all meanes, were he never ſo certaine to get the victory. In his Warres againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riovistus,</hi> whileſt he was in Parly with him, ſome tumult or inſurrection happened betweene the two armies, which beganne by the fault or negligence of ſome of <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> horſmen.

At what time ſoever hee went to fight, he was accuſtomed to weare a verie rich garment, and of a ſheene and gariſh colour, that ſo he might the better be marked. When his Souldiers were neereſt vnto their enemies, he reſtrained and kept them very ſhort. When the ancient Graecians would accuſe or tax any man of extreame inſufficiencie, they vſed this common Proverbe; <hi>That he could neyther read nor ſwimme:</hi> And himſelfe was of this opinion, that the arte of ſwimming was moſt neceſſary and beneficiall in Warre, and a Souldier might reape divers commodities by it. If hee were in haſte, and to make ſpeede, he would ordinarily ſwimme over al the Rivers hee met withal: and loved greatly to travell on foote, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was wont. In <hi>Aegypt</hi> being on a time forced (to ſave himſelfe) to leape into a little Whirry or Boate, and ſo many of his people following him, that he was in danger to ſinke, hee rather choſe to fling himſelfe into the Sea, which he did; and ſwimming came into his fleete, that was more than two hundred paces from him, holding his writing-Tables in his left hand out of the Water, and with his teeth drawing his Coate of Armes after him, that his enemies might not enjoy it: and this did hee being well ſtrucken in yeares. No Generall of Warre had ever ſo much credit with his Souldiers. In the beginning of his civill warres, his Centeniers offered him every one, at their owne charges to pay and finde him a man at Armes, and his foote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men to ſerve him for nothing and thoſe that were beſt able, to defray the poore and needie.</p>
                        <p>Our late Admirall of <hi>France</hi> Lord <hi>Chaſtillion,</hi> in our late civill warres ſhewed ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: For, the French-men of his armie, at their proper coſt and charges helped to pay ſuch ſtrangers as followed him.

neere vnto <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> his Souldiers came voluntarily before him, and offred themſelves to be puniſhed; ſo that he was more troubled to comfort, then to chide them. One onely of his <hi>Cohortes</hi> (whereof ten went to a Legion) held fight above foure howres with foure of <hi>Pompeies</hi> whole Legions, vntill it was well-nigh all defeated with the multitude and force of arrowes: And in his trenches were afterward found one hundred and thirtie thouſand ſhafts. A Souldier of his, named <hi>Scava,</hi> who commanded one of the entrances, did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly defend and keepe himſelfe, that he had one of his eyes thruſt out, and one ſhoulder and one thigh thruſt through, and his ſheild flawed and pearced in two hundred and thirtie ſeverall places. It hath befalne to many of his Souldiers, being taken priſoners, to chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die then promiſe to follow any other faction, or receive any other entertainement. <hi>Granius Petronius</hi> taken by <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Affricke:</hi> After <hi>Scipio</hi> had cauſed all his fellowes to bee put to death, ſent him word that hee gave him his life, forſomuch as hee was a man of ranke and a Queſtor: <hi>Petronius</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Caeſars Souldiers were wont to give life to others, and not accept it themſelves;</hi> And therewithall with his owne handes killed himſelfe.

And although men have ſomewhat a better condition in the ſame, yet have they much to doe. The touchſtone and perfect triall of a good mariage, reſpects the time that the ſocietie continueth; whether it have conſtantly beene milde loyall and commodious. In our age, they more commonly reſerve to enſtall their good offices, and ſet foorth the vehemence of their affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their loſt husbands: And then ſeeke they at leaſt to yeeld ſome teſtimonie of their good wil. Oh late teſtimony &amp; out of ſeaſon, whereby they rather ſhew, they never love them but when they are dead. Our life is full of combuſtion and ſcolding, but our diſeaſe full of love and of curteſie.

His wife perceiving him to droope and languiſh away, entreated him ſhe might leaſurely ſearch and neerely view the qualitie of his diſeaſe, and ſhe would more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then any other tell him what hee was to hope for: Which having obtained, and curiouſly conſidered the ſame, ſhee found it impoſſible ever to be cured, and all he might expect was but to lead a long, dolorous, and languiſhing life; and therefore for his more ſafetie and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne remedie, perſwaded him to kill himſelfe. And finding him ſomewhat nice and backeward to effect ſo rude an enterpriſe: Thinke not my deare friend (quoth ſhee) but that the ſorrowes and griefes, I ſee thee feele, touch me as neere and more, if more may be, as they ſelfe, and that to be rid of them, I will applie the ſame remedie to my ſelfe, which I preſcribe to thee.

The third, and in my judgement, moſt excellent man, is <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> Of glorie he hath not ſo much as ſome, and is farre ſhort of diverſe (which well conſidered is no ſubſtantiall part of the thing) of reſolution and true valour, not of that which is ſet-on by ambition, but of that, which wiſedome and reaſon may ſettle in a well diſpoſed minde, hee had as much as may be imagined or wiſhed for. Hee hath in mine opinion, made as great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his vertues, as ever did <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for although his exploites of warre bee not ſo frequent, and ſo high-raiſed, yet being throughly conſidered, they are as weightie, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, as conſtant, yea and as authenticall a teſtimonie of hardines and militarie ſufficiencie, as any mans elſe. The Graecians, without any contradiction affoorded him the honour, to entitle him the chiefe and firſt man among themſelves: and <hi>to be the firſt and chiefe man of Greece is without all queſtion to bee chiefe and firſt man of the world.</hi> Touching his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worth, this ancient judgement doth yet remaine amongſt vs, that <hi>never was man who know ſo much, nor never man that ſpake leſſe then he.</hi> For he was by Sect a Pythagorian; and what he ſpake, no man ever ſpake better: An excellent and moſt perſwaſive Orator was hee.

And concerning his manners and conſcience therein hee farre outwent all that ever medled with managing affaires: For in this one part, which ought eſpecially to bee noted, and which alone declareth what we are, and which onely I counter poiſe to all others together, he giveth place to no Philoſopher; no not to <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelfe. In whom innocencie is a qualitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, chiefe, conſtant, vniforme and incorruptible. In compariſon of which, it ſeemeth in <hi>Alexander</hi> ſubalternall, vncertaine, variable, effeminate and accidentall. Antiquine judged that preciſely to ſift out, and curiouſly to prie into all other famous Captaines, there is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſeverally ſome ſpeciall qualitie, which makes him renowmed and famous. In this man alone, it is a vertue and ſufficiencie, every where compleate and alike; which in all offices of humane life, leaveth nothing more to bee wiſhed-for. Bee it in publike or private; in peaceable negotiations or warlike occupations; be it to live or die, greatly or gloriouſly, I know no forme or fortune of man, that I admire or regard, with ſo much honour, with ſo much love. True it is, I finde this obſtinacie in povertie, ſomewhat ſcrupulous; and ſo have his beſt friends pourtrayed-it.

The pangs and fittes thereof doe ſo often aſſaile mee, that in a manner I have no more feeling of perfect health. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I hitherto keepe my ſpirite ſo ſeated, as if I can but joyne conſtancy vnto it, I finde my ſelfe to be in a much better ſtate of life, than a thouſand others, who have neither ague nor other infirmitie, but ſuch as for want of diſcourſe they give themſelves. There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faſhion of ſubtile humilitie, which proceedeth of preſumption: As this: That in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things wee acknowledge our ignorance, and are ſo curteous to avowe, that in Natures workes, there are ſome qualities and conditions, which to vs are imperceptible, and whereof our ſufficiencie cannot diſcover the meanes, nor finde out the cauſes. By this honeſt and conſcientious declaration, wee hope to gaine, that wee ſhall alſo be beleeved in thoſe, we ſhall ſay to vnderſtand. Wee neede not goe to cull out myracles, and chuſe ſtrange difficulties: mee ſeemeth, that amongſt thoſe things wee ordinarily ſee, there are ſuch incomprehenſible rarities, as they exceede all difficulty of myracles. What monſter is it, that this teare or drop of ſeed, wherof we are ingendred brings with it; and in it the impreſſions, not only of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall forme, but even of the very thoughts and inclinations of our fathers? Where dooth this droppe of water containe or lodge this infinite number of formes? And how beare they theſe reſemblances, of ſo raſh, and vnruly a progreſſe, that the childes childe ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his grandfather, and the nephew to his vnckle? In the family of <hi>Lepidus</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, there have beene three, not ſucceſſively, but ſome between, that were borne with one ſame eye covered with a cartilage or griſtle. There was a race in <hi>Thebes,</hi> which from their mothers wombe, bare the forme of a burre, or yron of a launce; and ſuch as had it not, were judged as miſ-begotten and deemed vnlawfull. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reporteth of a certaine Nation, with whome all women were common, where children were alloted their fathers, only by their reſemblances. It may bee ſuppoſed, that I am indebted to my father for this ſtonie qualitie; for he died exeeedingly tormented with a great ſtone in his bladder. He never felt himſelfe troubled with the diſeaſe, but at the age of ſixtie ſeaven yeares: before which time hee had never felt any likelihoode or motion of it, nor in his reines, nor in his ſides, nor elſewhere: and vntill then had lived in very proſperous health, and little ſubject to infirmities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeven yeares and more with that diſeaſe training a very dolorous lives-end. I was borne five and twenty yeares before his ſickeneſſe, and during the courſe of his healthy ſtate his third child. Where was al this while the propenſion or inclination to this defect, hatched? And when he was ſo farre from ſuch a diſeaſe, that light part of his ſubſtance wherewith he compoſed me, how could it for hir part, beare ſo great an impreſſion of it? And how ſo

cloſely covered, that fortie five yeares after, I have begunne to have a feeling of it? And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto alone, among ſo many brethren and ſiſters, and all of one mother. He that ſhall reſolve me of this progreſſe, I will believe him as many other miracles as he ſhall pleaſe to tell mee: alwayes provided (as commonly they doe) hee goe not about to pay me, with a doctrine much more difficult and fantaſticall, then is the thing it ſelfe (let Phyſitians ſomewhat excuſe my libertie:) for by the ſame infuſion and fatall infinuation, I have received the hate and contempt of their doctrine. The Antipathie, which is betweene me and their arte, is to me hereditarie. My father lived three ſcore and foureteene yeares: My grandfather three ſcore and nine; my great grandfather very neere foure ſcore, and never faſted or tooke any kinde of Phyſicke. And whatſoever was not in ordinary vſe amongſt them, was deemed a drug. <hi>Phiſicke is grounded vpon experience and examples.</hi> So is mine opinion. Is not this a manifeſt kinde of experience and very advantageous? I know not whether in all their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they are able to finde me three more, borne, bred, brought vp, and diceaſed, vnder one roofe, in one ſame chimnie, that by their owne direction and regiment have lived ſo long. Wherein they muſt needes grant me, that if it be not reaſon, at leaſt it is Fortune that is on my ſide. Whereas among Phiſitions fortune is of more conſequence, then reaſon.

The Lord of <hi>Buſſaguet</hi> laſt of the brethren (for they were foure) and by much the laſt, he alone ſubmitted himſelfe to that arte, as I imagine by reaſon of the frequence he had in other Sciences; for he was a Counſellor in the Court of Parliament, which proſpered ſo ill with him, that though he were in ſhew of a very ſtrong complexion, he died long before the others, except one, the Lord of Saint <hi>Michaell.</hi> It may well be, I have received of them that naturall dyſpathie vnto Phiſicke. Yet if there had beene no other conſideration but this, I would have endevoured to force it. For, all theſe conditions, which without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are borne in vs, ate vicious. It is a kinde of maladie a man muſt fight withall. It may be I had ſuch a propenſion, but I have ſettled and ſtrongthned the ſame by diſcourſes, which in me have confirmed the opinion I have of it.

They have a like conſtancie about the counſels they giue vs, touching the regiment of our life. It is good to make water often; for by experience we ſee, that permitting the ſame idlely to lie ſtill, we give it leiſure to diſcharge it ſelfe of her lees and excrements, which may ſerve to breed the ſtone in the bladder: It is good to make water but ſeldome, for the weightie dregs it drawes with it, are not eaſily caried away, except by violence: as by experience is ſeene in a torrent that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very ſwift, which ſweepeth and clenſeth the place through which he paſſeth, much more then doth a ſlow-gliding ſtreame. Likewiſe it is good to have often copulation with women; for that openeth the paſſages, and convaieth the gravell away: It is alſo hurtfull; for it heateth, wearieth, and weakneth the reines. It is good for one to bathe himſelfe in warme water; for ſo much as that looſeth and moiſtneth the places where the gravel and ſtone lurketh: It is alſo bad; becauſe this application of externall heat helpeth the reines to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct, to harden and petrifie the matter diſpoſed vnto it. To ſuch as are at the bathes, it is more healthfull to eat but little at night, that the water they are to drinke the next morning, finding the ſtomacke empty, and without any obſtacle, it may worke the greater operation: on the other ſide, it is better to eat but a little at dinner, leſt a man might hinder the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the water, which is not yet perfect, and not to charge the ſtomacke ſo ſuddenly, after this other travell, and leave the office of digeſting vnto the night, which can better do it then the day; the body and ſpirit being then in continuall motion and action. Loe heere how they in all their diſcourſes juggle, dally, and trifle at our charge, and are never able to bring mee a propoſition, but I can preſently frame another to the contrary, of like force &amp; conſequence. Let them then no longer raile againſt thoſe who in any ſickneſſe, ſuffer themſelves gently to be directed by their owne appetite, and by the counſell of nature; and who remit themſelves to common fortune. I have by occaſion of my travels ſeene almoſt all the famous Bathes of Chriſtendome, and ſome yeers ſince haue begun to vſe them: For, in generall I deeme bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be very good and healthy, and I am perſwaded, we incurre no ſmall incommodities in our health, by having neglected and loſt this cuſtome, which in former times were generally obſerved very neere amongſt all Nations, and is yet with divers at this time to wath their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies every day: And I cannot imagine but that we are much the worſe with keeping our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies all over-cruſted, and our pores ſtopt with greaſe and filth. And touching the drinking of them, fortune hath firſt made it to agree very well with my taſte: ſecondly it is naturall and ſimple; and though vaine, nothing dangerous: whereof this infinitie of people of all ſorts and complexions, and of all nations that come to them, doth warrant mee. And although I have as yet found no extraordinary good or wondrous effect in them, but rather having
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:12117:223"/>
ſomewhat curiouſly examined the matter, I finde all the reports of ſuch operations, which in ſuch places are reported, and of many believed, to be falſe and fabulous. <hi>So eaſily doth the world deceive it ſelfe, namely in things it deſireth, or faine would have come to paſſe.</hi> Yet have I ſeene but few or none at all, whom theſe waters have made worſe; and no man can without malice denie, but that they ſtirre vp a mans appetite, make eaſie digeſtion, and except a man goe to them overweake and faint (which I would have none doe) they will adde a kinde of new mirth vnto him. They have not the power to raiſe men from deſperate diſeaſes. They may ſtay ſome light accident, or prevent the threates of ſome alteration. Whoſoever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them, and reſolveth not to be merry, that ſo hee may enjoy the pleaſure of the good company reſorts to them, and of the pleaſant walkes or exerciſes, which the beauty of thoſe places, where bathes are commonly ſeated, doth affoord and delight men withall; he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt looſeth the better part and moſt aſſured of their effect. And therefore have I hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto choſen to ſtay my ſelfe and make vſe of thoſe, where I found the pleaſure of the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation moſt delightſome, moſt conveniencie of lodging, of victuals and companie, as are in <hi>France</hi> the bathes of <hi>Banieres;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Plombieres,</hi> on the frontiers of <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Loraine;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Baden</hi> in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Lucea</hi> in <hi>Tuſcanie;</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Della villa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Every nation hath ſome particular opinion concerning their vſe, and ſeverall lawes and formes how to vſe them, and all different: And as I have found by experience the effect in a maner all one. In <hi>Germanie</hi> they never vſe to drinke of their waters; but bathe themſelves for all diſeaſes, and will lie pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, all moſt from Sunne to Sunne. In <hi>Italie</hi> if they drinke nine dayes of the water, they waſh themſelves other thirtie dayes with it. And commonly they drincke it mixed with other drugges, thereby to helpe the operation. Heere our Phiſitions appoint vs when wee have drunke to walke vpon it, that ſo wee may helpe to digeſt it: There, ſo ſoone as they have drunke, they make them lie a bed, vntill they have voided the ſame out againe, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually warming their ſtomake and feete with warme clothes.

The Baron of <hi>Caupene</hi> in <hi>Chaloſſe</hi> and I, have both in common the right of the patronage of a benifice, which is of a very large pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, ſituated at the feet of our Mountaines, named <hi>Lohontan.</hi> It is with the inhabitants of
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:12117:224"/>
that corner, as it is ſaid to be with thoſe of the valley of <hi>Angrougne.</hi> They lead a kind of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar life; their attire, and their cuſtomes apart and ſeverall. They were directed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by certaine particular policies and cuſtomes, received by tradition from Father to Child: Whereto, without other Lawes or Compulſion, except the reverence and awe of their cuſtome and vſe, they awefully tied and bound themſelves. This petty ſtate had from all antiquity continued in ſo happy a condition, that no neighbouring ſevere judge had ever beene troubled to enquire of their life and affaires, nor was ever Atturny or Pety fogging Lawyer called for, to give them adviſe or counſell; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They alwaies avoided commerce and ſhunned alliances with the other World, leaſt they ſhould alter the purity of their orders and policy; vntill ſuch time (as they ſay) that one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, in their fathers daies, having a minde pufft vp with a noble ambition, to bring his name and credit in reputation, deviſed to make one of his Children Sir <hi>Iohn Lacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> or Maſter <hi>Peter-an-Oake:</hi> And having made him learne to write in ſome neighbour Towne not farre off, at laſt procured him to be a Country Notary, or Petty-fogging Clarke. This fellow having gotten ſome pelfe and become great, began to diſdaine their ancient cuſtomes, and put the pompe and ſtatelineſſe of our higher regions into their heads. It fortuned that a chiefe Goſſip of his had a Goate diſhorned, whom he importunately ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to ſue the Treſpaſſer, and demand law and right at the Iudge or Iuſticers hands, that dwelt there-abouts; And ſo never ceaſing to ſow ſedition and breed ſutes amongeſt his neighbours, he never left till he had confounded and marred all. After this corruption or intruſion of law (they ſay) there enſued preſently another miſchiefe of worſe conſequence, by meanes of a Quacke-ſalver, or Empirike Phyſition that dwelt amongeſt them, who would needes be married to one of their daughters, and ſo endenizon and ſettle himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
                        <p>This gallant began firſt to teach and inſtruct them in the names of agewes, rheumes and impoſtumes; then the ſcituation of the heart, of the liver and other entrailes: A Science vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then never knowen or heard of among them. And in ſtead of garlike, wherewith they had learned to expell, and were wont to cure all diſeaſes, of what qualitie and how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſoever they were, he induced and inured them, were it but for a cough or cold, to take ſtrange compoſitions and potions: And thus beganne to trafficke not onely their health, but alſo their deaths. They ſweare, that even from that time, they haue apparantly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the evening Sereine or night-calme bred the head-ach and blaſted them; that to drinke being hot or in a ſweat empaired their helthes; that Autumne windes were more vnwholeſome and dangerous, then thoſe of the Springe-time: And that ſince his ſlibber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawces, potions and phyſicke came firſt in vſe; they finde themſelues moleſted and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Legions of vnaccuſtomed malladies and vnknowen diſeaſes; and plainely feele and ſenſibly perceive a generall weakeneſſe and declination in their antient vigor; and that their lives are nothing ſo long, as before they were. Loe heere the firſt of my tales. The other is, that before I was troubled with the ſtone-chollicke and gravell in the bladder, hearing diuers make eſpeciall account of a hee-goats blood, as of an heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> ſent in theſe latter-ages for the good and preſervation of mans life: and hearing men of good vnder ſtanding ſpeake of it, as of an admirable and much-good-working drugge, and of an infallible operation: I, who have ever thought my ſelfe ſubject to all accidents, that may in any ſort fall on man, being yet in perfect health, beganne to take pleaſure to provide my ſelfe of this myracle, and foorthwith gave order (according to the receipt) to have a Bucke-goate gotten, and carefully fed in mine owne houſe. For the blood muſt be drawne from him in the hotteſt moneth of Summer, and he muſt onely be fed with ſoluble hearbes, and drincke nothing but White-wine. It was my fortune to come to mine owne houſe the very ſame day the Goate ſhould be killed; where ſome of my people came in haſte to tell mee, that my Cooke found two or three great bowles in his paunch, which in his maw amongſt his meat ſhocked one againſt another. I was ſo curious as I would needes have all his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage brought before me; the thicke and large skinne whereof I cauſed to be opened, out of which came three great lumpes or bodies, as light as any ſpunge, ſo framed as they ſeemed to be hollow, yet outwardly hard and very firme, bemotled with divers dead and wanniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> colours: The one perfectly as round as any bowle, the other two ſomewhat leſſer, and not
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:12117:224"/>
ſo round, yet ſeemed to grow towards it. I have found (after I had made diligent inquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch as were wont to open ſuch beaſts) that it was a ſeld-ſeene and vnheard of accident. It is very likely they were ſuch ſtones as ours be, and cozen-germanes to them; which if it be, it is but vaine for ſuch as be troubled with the ſtone or gravell to hope to be cured, by meanes of a beaſts-blood, that was drawing neere vnto death, and ſuffered the ſame diſeaſe. For, to aleadge the blood cannot participate of that contagion', and doth no whit thereby alter his accuſtomed vertue, it may rather be inferred, that nothing ingendreth in a body, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and communication of all the parts. The whole maſſe doth worke, and the whole frame agitate altogether, although one part, according to the diverſitie of operations, doth contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more or leſſe than another; whereby it manifeſtly appeareth, that in all parts of this bucke-goate, there was ſome grettie or petrificant qualitie. It was not ſo much for feare of any future chaunce, or in regard of my ſelfe, that I was ſo curious of this experiment; as in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that as well in mine owne houſe, as elſe-where in ſundry other places, it commeth to paſſe, that many women doe often gather and lay vp in ſtore, divers ſuch kindes of ſlight drugges to help their neighbours, and other people with them, in time of neceſſitie; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſame remedy to an hundred ſeverall diſeaſes: yea many times ſuch as they would be very loath to take themſelves; with which they often have good lucke, and well thrives it with them. As for mee I honour Phyſitions, not according to the common-received rule, for neceſſitie ſake (for to this paſſage another of the Prophet may be alleaged, who reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved King <hi>Aſa,</hi> becauſe hee had recourſe vnto Phyſitions) but rather for love I beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves; having ſeene ſome, and knowne diverſe honeſt men amongſt them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy all love and eſteeme. <hi>It is not them I blame, but their Arte;</hi> yet doe I not greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them for ſeeking to profit by our fooliſhneſſe (for moſt men doe ſo) and it is a thing common to all worldlings. <hi>Diverſe profeſſious and many vacations, both more and leſſe worthie than theirs, ſubſist and are grounded onely vpon publike abuſes and popular errours.</hi> I ſend for them when I am ſicke, if they may conveniently be found; and love to be entertained by them, rewarding them as other men doe. I give them authoritie to enjoyne me to keepe my ſelfe warme, if I love it better ſo than otherwiſe. They may chuſe, be it either leekes or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, what my broth ſhall be made withall, and appoynt mee either white or clarer to drinke; and ſo of other things elſe, indifferent to my taſte, humor or cuſtome. I know well it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, forſomuch as <hi>Sharpeneſſe and Strangeneſſe are accidents of Phyſickes proper eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Lycurgus</hi> allowed and appoynted the ſicke men of <hi>Sparta</hi> to drinke wine. Why did he ſo? Becauſe being in health, they hated the vſe of it. Even as a Gentleman who dwelleth not farre from mee, vſeth wine as a ſoveraigne remedie againg agews, becauſe being in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, he hateth the taſte thereof as death. How many of them ſee wee to be of my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? That is, to diſdaine all Phyſicke for their owne behoofe, and live a kinde of formall free life, and altogether contrarie to that, which they preſcribe to others? And what is that, but a manifeſt abuſing of our ſimplicitie? For, they holde their life as deare, and eſteeme their health as pretious as wee doe ours, and would apply their effects to their skill, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves knew not the vncertaintie and falſehood of it. It is the feare of paine and death; the impatience of the diſeaſe and griefe; and indiſcreete deſire and headlong thirſt of health, that ſo blindeth them, and vs. It is meere faintnes that makes our conceit; and puſillanimitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth our credulitie, to bee ſo yeelding and pliable. The greater parte of whome doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding not beleeve ſo much, as they endure and ſuffer of others: For I heare them complaine, and ſpeake of it no otherwiſe than wee doe. Yet in the ende are they reſolved. What ſhould I doe then? As if impatience were in itſelfe a better remedie than patience Is there any of them, that hath yeelded to this miſerable ſubjection, that doth not likewiſe yeelde to all manner of impoſtures? or dooth not ſubject himſelfe to the mercie of whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath the impudencie to promiſe him recoverie, and warrant him health?</p>
                        <p>The Babilonians were wont to carry their ſicke people into the open ſtreetes; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort were their phyſitions: where all ſuch as paſſed by were by humanitie and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to enquire of their ſtate and maladie, and according to their skill or experience, give them ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as for mee, were I to buy any medicine, I would rather ſpend my money in this kinde of phyſicke, than in any other; becauſe therein is no danger or hurt

                        <p>I was not long ſince in a company, where I wot not who of my fraternity, brought newes of a kinde of pilles, by true accompt, compoſed of a hundered and odde ſeverall ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; Whereat we laughed very heartily, and made our ſelves good ſport: For, what rocke ſo hard were able to reſiſt the ſhocke, or withſtand the force of ſo thicke and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a battery? I vnderſtand nevertheleſſe, of ſuch as tooke of them, that the leaſt graine gravell dained not to ſtirre at all. I cannot ſo ſoone give over writing of this ſubject, but I muſt needes ſay a word or two, concerning the experience they have made of their preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they would have vs take as a warrantize or aſſurance of the certainty of their drugges and potions. The greateſt number, and as I deeme, more than the two thirds of medicinable vertues, conſiſt in the quinteſſence or ſecret propriety of ſimples, whereof we can have no other inſtruction but vſe and cuſtome. For, <hi>Quinteſſence is no other thing than a quality, whereof we cannot with our reaſon finde out the cauſe.</hi> In ſuch trials or experiments, thoſe which they affirme to have acquired by the inſpiration of ſome Daemon, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to receive and allow of them (for, touching myracles, I meddle not with them) or be it the experiments drawne from things, which for other reſpects fall often in vſe with vs: As if in Wooll, wherewith we wont to cloth our ſelves, ſome ſecret exſiccating or drying quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have by accident beene found, that cureth kibes or chilblaines in the heeles; and if in reddiſhes, we eat for nouriſhment, ſome opening or aperitive operation have beene diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that a Leprous man chanced to be cured, by meanes of a Cuppe of Wine he had drunke, forſomuch as a Viper was by fortune fallen into the Wine caske. In which example we finde the meane, and a very likely directory to this experience. As alſo in thoſe, to which Phyſitions affirme, to have beene addreſſed by the examples of ſome beaſts. But in moſt of other experiences, to which they ſay they came by fortune, and had no other guide but hazard, I finde the progreſſe of this information incredible. I imagine man, heedfully viewing about him the infinite number of things, creatures, plants and met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. I wot not where to make him beginne his Eſſay; And ſuppoſe he caſt his firſt fantaſie vpon an Elkes-Horne, to which an eaſie and gentle credulity muſt be given; he will be as farre to ſeeke, and as much troubled in his ſecond operation: So, many diſeaſes and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall circumſtances are propoſed vnto him, that before he come to the certainty of this point, vnto which the perfection of his experience ſhould arrive, mans wit ſhall be to ſeeke, and not know where to turne himſelfe; And before (amiddeſt this infinity of things) hee finde out what this Horne is: Amongſt the numberleſſe diſeaſes that are, what an Epilepſie is; the ſundrie and manifolde complexions in a melancholy man; So many ſeaſons in Winter: So diverſe Nations amongſt French-men; So many ages in age; So diverſe coeleſtiall changes and alterations, in the conjunction of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Saturne;</hi> So ſeverall and many partes in a mans body, nay in one of his fingers. To all which being neyther guided by argument, nor by conjecture, nor by example, or divine inſpiration, but by the one ly motion of fortune; it were moſt neceſſary, it ſhould be by a perfectly artificiall, well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and methodicall fortune. Moreover, ſuppoſe the diſeaſe thorowly cured, how ſhall he reſt aſſured, but that eyther the evill was come to his vtmoſt period, or that an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the hazard, cauſed the ſame health? Or the operation of ſome other thing, which that day he had eyther eaten, drunke or touched? or whether it were by the merite of his Grand-mothers prayers? Beſides, ſuppoſe this experiment to have beene perfect, how many times was it applied and begun a new; And how often was this long and tedious web of fortunes and encounters woven over againe, before a certaine rule might be concluded? And being concluded, by whom is it I pray you? <hi>Amongſt ſo many millions of men, you ſhall ſcarſe meete with three or foure, that well duely obſerve, and carefully keepe a Regiſter of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments;</hi> ſhall it be your, or his happe, to light truely, or hit juſt with one of them three or foure? What if another man? Nay what if a hundred other men have had and made contrary experiments, and cleane oppoſite concluſions, and yet have ſorted well? We ſhould peradventure diſcerne ſome ſhew of light, if all the judgements and conſultations of men were knowne vnto vs. But <hi>That three Witneſſes and three Doctors ſhall ſway all mankind, there</hi>

                        <head>To my Lady of Duras.</head>
                        <p>MAdame, the laſt time it pleaſed you to come and viſite me, you found me vpon this point. And becauſe it may be, theſe toyes of mine may happily come to your hands: I would have them witneſſe, their Authour reputeth himſelfe highly honoured, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it ſhall pleaſe you to ſhew them. Wherein you ſhall diſcerne the very ſame demeanor and ſelfe-countenance, you have ſeene in his converſaſion. And could I have aſſumed vnto my ſelfe any other faſhion, than mine owne accuſtomed, or more honourable and better forme, I would not have done it: For, all I ſeeke to reape by my writings, is, they will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repreſent and to the life, pourtray me to your remembrance. The very ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and faculties, it pleaſed your Lady-ſhip to frequent and receive, with much more honor and curteſie, than they any way deſerve, I will place and reduce (but without alteration and change) into a ſolide body, which may happily continue ſome daies and yeares after mee: Where, when ſoever it ſhall pleaſe you to refreſh your memory with them, you may eaſily finde them, without calling them to remembrance; which they ſcarſely deſerve. I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to continue the favour of your Friend-ſhip towards mee, by the ſame qualities, through whoſe meanes it was produced. I labour not to be beloved more and eſteemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being dead, than alive. The humour of <hi>Tyberius</hi> is ridiculous and common, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured more to extinguiſh his glory in future ages, than yeeld himſelfe regardfull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to men of his times. If I were one of thoſe, to whom the World my be indebted for praiſe, I would quit it for the one moytie, on condition it would pay me before-hand: And that the ſame would haſten, and in great heapes environ me about, more thicke than long, and more full than laſting. And let it hardly vaniſh with my knowledge, and when this ſweet alluring ſound ſhall no more tickle mine eares. It were a fond conceite, now I am ready to leave the commerce of men, by new commendations, to goe about, anew to beget my ſelfe vnto them.</p>
                        <p>I make no account of goods, which I could not employ to the vſe of my life. Such as I am ſo would I be elſewhere then in Paper. Mine arte and induſtry have beene emploied to make my ſelfe of ſome worth. My ſtudy and endevour to doe, and not to write. I have applied all my skill and devoire to frame my life. Lo-heere mine occupation and my worke. I am a leſſe maker of books, then of any thing elſe. I have deſired and aimed at ſufficiencie, rather for the benefite of my preſent and eſſentiall commodities, then to make a Store-houſe, and hoard it vp for mine heires. Whoſoever hath any worth in him, let him ſhew it in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, maners and ordinary diſcourſes; be it to treat of love or of quarrels, of ſport and play or bed-matters, at board or elſe-where; or be it in the conduct of his owne affaires, or private houſhold matters. Thoſe whom I ſee make good bookes, having tattered hoſen and ragged clothes on, had they believed mee they ſhould firſt have gotten themſelves good clothes. Demand a Spartan, whether he would rather be a cunning Rhethorician, then an excellent Souldier: nay were I asked, I would ſay, a good Cooke, had I not ſome to ſerve me. Good Lord (Madame) how I would hate ſuch a commendation, to be a ſufficient man in writing, and a fooliſh-ſhallow-headed braine or coxcombe in all things elſe: yet had I rather be a foole; both here and there, then to have made ſo bad a choiſe, wherein to imploy my worth. So farre am I alſo from expecting, by ſuch trifles to gaine new honour to my ſelfe: as I ſhal think I make a good bargaine, if I looſe not a part of that little, I had already gained. For, beſides that this dombe and dead picture, ſhall derogate and ſteale from my naturall being, it fadgeth not and hath no reference vnto my better ſtate, but is much falne from my firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and naturall jollity, enclining to a kinde of drooping or mouldineſſe. I am now come to the bottome of the veſſell, which beginneth to taſte of his dregs and lees. Otherwiſe (good Madame) I ſhould not have dared ſo boldly to have ripped vp the myſteries of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,

ſicke, conſidering the eſteeme and credite your ſelfe, and ſo many others, aſcribe vnto it, and hold it in; had I not been directed therunto by the authors of the ſame. I thinke they have but two ancient ones in Latine, to wit <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Celſus.</hi> If you fortune at any time to looke into them, you ſhall finde them to ſpeake much more rudely of their Art, then I doe. I but pinch it gently, they cut the throate of it. <hi>Pliny</hi> amongſt other things, doth much ſcoffe at them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as when they are at their wits end, and can goe no further, they have found out this goodly ſhift, to ſend their long-turmoiled, and to no end much tormented patient, with their drugs and diets, ſome to the help of their vowes and myracles, and ſome others to hot Baths and waters. (Be not offended noble Lady, he meaneth not thoſe on this ſide, vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of your houſe, and all <hi>Gramontoiſes.</hi>) They have a third kinde of ſhift or evaſion to ſhake vs off and diſcharge themſelves of the imputations or reproaches, we may juſtly charge them with, for the ſmall amendment of our infirmities; whereof they have ſo long had the ſurvay and governement, as they have no more inventions or deviſes left them, to ammuſe vs with; that is, to ſend vs, to ſeeke and take the good aire of ſome other Country. Madam, we have harped long enough vpon one ſtring; I hope you will give me leave to come to my former diſcourſes againe, from which for your better entertainement, I had ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</p>
                        <p>It was (as farre as I remember) <hi>Pericles,</hi> who being demanded, how he did; you may (ſaid he) judge it by this, ſhewing certain ſcroules or briefes he had tied about his necke and armes. He would infer, that he was very ſicke, ſince he was forced to have recourſe to ſuch vanities, and had ſuffered himſelfe to be ſo dreſt. I affirme not, but I may one day be drawne to ſuch fond opinions, and yeeld my life and health to the mercy, diſcretion and regiment of Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I may happily fall into this fond madneſſe; I dare not warrant my future conſtancy. And even then if any aske me how I doe, I may anſwer him as did <hi>Pericles;</hi> You may judge, by ſhewing my hands fraughted with ſix drammes of Opium. It will be an evident token of a violent ſickeneſſe. My judgement ſhal be exceedingly out of temper. If impacience or feare get that advantage vpon me, you may thereby conclude ſome quelling fever hath ſeized vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my minde. I have taken the paines to plead this cauſe, whereof I have but ſmall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſomewhat to ſtrengthen and comfort naturall propenſion, againſt the drugs and practiſe of our Phiſicke, which is derived into me from mine anceſtors: leſt it might onely be a ſtupid and raſh inclination; and that it might have a little more forme. and that alſo thoſe, who ſee me ſo conſtant againſt the exhortations and threates, which are made againſt me, when ſickneſſe commeth vpon me, may not thinke it to be a meere conceit, and ſimple wilfulneſſe; And alſo, leſt there be any ſo peeviſh, as to judge it to be ſome motive of vaine glory. <hi>It were a ſtrange deſire, to ſeeke to draw honour from an action, common both to me, to my Gardiner, or to my Groome.</hi> Surely my heart is not ſo pufft vp, nor ſo windy, that a ſolide, fleſhy and marrowy pleaſure, as health is; I ſhould change it for an imaginary, ſpirituall and airy delight. Renowme or glory (were it that of <hi>Aymons</hi> foure ſons) is over-deerely bought by a man of my humour, if it coſt him but three violent fits of the chollike. Give me health a Gods name. Thoſe that love our Phyſicke, may likewiſe have their conſiderations good, great and ſtrong. I hate no fantaſies contrary to mine. I am ſo far from vexing myſelfe, to ſee my judgement differ from other mens, or to grow incompatible of the ſociety or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of men, to be of any other faction or opinion then mine owne; that contrariwiſe (as variety is the moſt generall faſhion that nature hath followed, and more in the mindes, then in the bodies; forſomuch as they are of a more ſupple and yeelding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſuſceptible or admitting of formes) I finde it more rare to ſee our humor or deſſeignes agree in one. And never were there two opinions in the world alike, no more than two haires, or two graines. <hi>Diverſity is the most vniverſall quality.</hi>

When an vrgent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, or any violent and vnexpected accident, induceth a Prince for the neceſſitie of his eſtate, or as thay ſay for ſtate matters, to breake his worde and faith, or otherwiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him out of his ordinary dutie, hee is to aſcribe that neceſſitie vnto a laſh of Gods rod: It is no vice, for hee hath quit his reaſon, vnto a reaſon more publike, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but ſurely t'is ill fortune. So that to one, who asked mee what remedie? I replyde, none; were hee trulie rackt betweene theſe two extreames (<hi>Sed videat ne quaeratur latebra periurio. But let him take heede hee ſeeke not a ſtarting hole for periurie</hi>) hee muſt have done it;<note place="margin">Cic. off. l. 3.</note> but if hee did it ſans regret or ſcruple, if it greeued him not to doe it, t'is an argument his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is but in ill tearmes. Now were there any one of ſo tender or cheuerell a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to whome no cure might ſeeme worthie of ſo extreame a remedie: I ſhould priſe or regard him no whit the leſſe. Hee cannot looſe himſelfe more handſomelie nor more excuſable. <hi>Wee cannot doe every thing, nor bee in euery place.</hi> When all is done, thus and thus, muſt wee often, as vnto our laſt Anker and ſole refuge, reſigne the protection of our veſſellvnto the onely conduct of heauen. To what juſter neceſſitie can hee reſerue himſelfe? What is leſſe poſſible for him to doe, then what hee cannot effect, without charge vnto his faith, and imputation to his honour? things which peradventure ſhould bee dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to him, then his owne ſaluation, and the ſafety of his people. When with enfoulded armes hee ſhall deuoutly call on God for his ayde, may hee not hope, that his fatherlie mercie ſhall not refuſe the extraordinarie fauour, and ſinne-forgiuing grace of his all powerfull hand, vnto a pure and righteous hand? They are dangerous exemples, rare and craſed exceptions to our naturall rules: wee muſt yeelde vnto them, but with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and heedie circumſpection.

ſhould offer our conſcience this wrong the common-wealth may, when it is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and important. <hi>Timoleon</hi> did fitlie warrant and warde the ſtrangeneſſe of his exploite by the teares hee ſhed, remembring it was with a brotherlie hand hee ſlew the tyrant, And it neerelie pinched his ſelfe-gnawne conſcience, that hee was compelled to purchaſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, at the rate of his honeſtie. The ſacred Senate it ſelfe, by his meanes deliuered from thraldome, durſt not definitively decide of ſo haughtie an action, and rend in two ſo vrgent and different ſemblances. But the Siracuſans having opportunelie and at that very inſtant ſent to the Corinthians, to require their protection, and a gouernour able to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their towne in former maieſtie, and deliuer <hi>Sicilie</hi> from a number of pettie tyrants, which greeuouſhe oppreſſed the ſame: they appointed <hi>Timoleon,</hi> with this new caucat and declaration: That according as hee ſhould well or ill demeane himſelfe in his charge, their ſentence ſhould encline, either to grace him as the redeemer of his country, or diſgrace him, as the murtherer of his brother. This fantaſticall concluſion, hath ſome excuſe vpon the danger of the example, and importance of an act ſo different. and they did well, to diſcharge their iudgement of it, or to embarke him ſome where elſe, and on their conſiderations Now the proceedings of <hi>Timoleon</hi> in his renowned iournie did ſoone yeelde his cauſe the cleerer, ſo worthily and vertuouſly did hee euery way beare himſelfe therein. And the good hap, which euer accompanied him in the encombrances and difficulties hee was to ſubdue in the atchieuement of his noble enterpriſe, ſeemed to bee ſent him by the Gods, conſpiring to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and conſenting to favour his juſtification: This mans end is excuſable, if euer any could bee. But the encreaſe and profit of the publike revenues, which ſerued the Roman Senate for a pretext of the enſuing-foule concluſion I purpoſe to relate, is not of ſufficient force to warrant ſuch injuſtice. Certaine citties had by the order and permiſſion of the Senate, with mony purchaſed their libertie, at the hands of <hi>L. Sylla.</hi> The matter comming in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Senate condemned them, to bee fineable and taxed as before: and the mony they had employed for their ranſome, ſhould bee deemed as loſt and forfetted. Ciuill warres doe often produce ſuch enormous examples: That we puniſh priuate men, for ſomuch as they have beleeved vs, when wee were other then now wee are. And one ſame magiſtrate doth laie the penaltie of his change on ſuch as cannot do withall. The Schoolemaſter whippeth his ſcholler for his docilitie, and the guide ſtreeketh the blind man he leadeth. A horrible image, of juſtice. Some rules in Philoſophie are both falſe and fainte. The example propoſed vnto vs, of reſpecting priuate vtilitie before faith giuen, hath not ſufficient power by the circumſtance they adde vnto it. Theeves have taken you, and on your oath to pay them a certaine ſum of money, haue ſet you at libertie againe: They erre, that ſay, an honeſt man is quit of his worde and faith without paying, beeing out of them handes; There is noe ſuch matter, <hi>What feare and danger hath once forced mee to will and conſent vnto, I am bound to will and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme boing out of danger and feare.</hi> And although it have but forced my tongue, and not my will, yet am I bound to make my worde good, and keepe my promiſe. For my part, when it hath ſometimes vnaduiſedly ouer-runne my thought, yet haue I made a conſcience to diſavowe the ſame. Otherwiſe wee ſhould by degrees come to aboliſh all the right a third man taketh and may challenge of our promiſes. <hi>Quaſi verò forti viro vis poſſit adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri.</hi>

For, <hi>the right of vertue ought to over-rule the right of our bonde.</hi> I have heretofore placed <hi>Fpaminondas</hi> in the firſt ranke of excellent men, and now recant it not. Vnto what high pitch raiſed hee the conſideration of his particular dutie? who never ſlew man hee had vanquiſhed; who for that vnvaluable good of reſtoring his countrie hir liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, made it a matter of conſcience, to murther a Tyrant or his complices, without a due and formal courſe of lawe: and who judged him a bad man, how good a cittizen ſoever, that amongeſt his enemies and in the furie of a battle, ſpared not his friend, or his hoſte. Loc here a minde of a riche compoſition. Hee matched vnto the moſt violent and rude actions of men, goodneſſe and courteſie, yea and the moſt choiſe and delicate, that may bee found in the ſchoole of Philoſophie. This ſo high-raiſed courage, ſo ſwelling and ſo obſtinate againſt ſorow, death and povertie, was it nature or arte, made it relent, even to the vtmoſt ſtraine of exceedeng tenderneſſe and debonaretie of complexion? Being cloathed in the dreadfull liuerie of ſteele and blood, hee goeth on cruſhing and bruſing a nation, inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to all others, but to himſelfe: yet mildely relenteth in the midſt of a combat or confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when hee meets with his hoſt or with his friend. Verily, this man was deſervedly fit to command in warre, which in the extremeſt furie of his innated rage, made him to feele the ſting of courteſie, and remorſe of gentleneſſe: then when all enflamed, it foamed with furie, and burned with murder. T'is a miracle, to be able to joine any ſhew of juſtice with ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. But it only belongeth to the vnmatched courage of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> in that confuſed plight, to joine mildneſſe and facilitie of the moſt gentle behaviour that ever was, vnto them, yea and pure innocencie it ſelfe. And whereas one told the <hi>Mamertins,</hi> that ſtatutes were of no force againſt armed men: another to the Tribune of the people, that the time of juſtice and warre, were two: a third, that the confuſed noiſe of warre and clang of armes, hindred him from vnderſtanding the ſober voice of the lawes: This man was not ſo much as empea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from conceiving the milde ſound of civilitie and kindneſſe. Borrowed hee of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the cuſtome of ſacrificing to the Muſes (when hee went to the warres) to qualifie by their ſweetneſſe and mildneſſe, that martiall furie, and hoſtile ſurlineſſe?

                        </argument>
                        <p>OThers faſhion man, I repeat him; and repreſent a particular one, but ill made; and whom were I to forme a new, he ſhould be far other then he is; but he is now made. And though the lines of my picture change and vary, yet looſe they not themſelves. The world runnes all on wheeles: All things therein moove without entermiſſion; yea the earth, the rockes of <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and the Pyramides of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> both with the publike and their owne motion. <hi>Constancy it ſelfe is nothing but a languiſhing and wauering dance.</hi> I cannot ſettle my obiect; it goeth ſo vnquietly and ſtaggering, with a naturall drunkenneſſe. I take it in this plight, as it is at th'inſtant I ammuſe my ſelfe about it. I deſcribe not the eſſence, but the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; not a paſſage from age to age, or as the people reckon, from ſeaven yeares to ſeaven, but from day to day, from minute to minute. My hiſtory muſt be fitted to the preſent. I may ſoone change, not onely fortune, but intention. It is a counter-roule of divers and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accidents, and irreſolute imaginations, and ſometimes contrary: whether it be that my ſelfe am other, or that I apprehend ſubiects, by other circumſtances and conſiderations. Howſoever, I may perhaps gaine ſay my ſelfe, but truth (as <hi>Demades</hi> ſaid) I never gaine-ſay: Were my minde ſetled, I would not eſſay, but reſolue my ſelfe. It is ſtill a Prentiſe and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer. I propoſe a meane life, and without luſter: T'is all one. They faſten all morall Philoſophy as well to a popular and priuate life, as to one of richer ſtuffe. <hi>Every man beareth the whole ſtampe of humane condition.</hi> Authors communicate themſelves vnto the world by ſome ſpeciall and ſtrange marke; I the firſt, by my generall diſpoſition; as <hi>Michael de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne;</hi> not as a Grammarian, or a Poet, or a Lawyer. If the world complaine, I ſpeake too much of my ſelfe, I complaine, it thinkes no more of it ſelfe. But is it reaſon, that being ſo private in vſe, I ſhould pretend to make my ſelfe publike in knowledge? Or is it reaſon, I ſhould produce into the world, where faſhion and arte have ſuch ſway and command, the raw and ſimple effects of nature; and of a nature as yet exceeding weake? <hi>To write bookes without learning, is it not to make a wall without ſtone or ſuch like thing?</hi> Conceites of muſicke are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by arte; mine by hap. Yet have I this according to learning, that never man handled ſubject, he vnderſtood or knew, better then I doe this I have vndertaken; being therein the cunningeſt man alive.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that never man waded further into his matter, nor more diſtinctly ſifted the partes and dependances of it, nor arrived more exactly and fully to the end he propoſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe. To finiſh the ſame, I have need of naught but faithfulneſſe: which is therein as ſincere and pure as may be found. I ſpeake truth, not my belly-full, but as much as I dare; and I dare the more, the more I grow into yeares: for it ſeemeth, cuſtome alloweth old age more liberty to babbell, and indiſcretion to talke of it ſelfe. It cannot herein be, as in trades; where the Crafts-man and his worke doe often differ. Being a man of ſo ſound and honeſt conuerſation, write he ſo fooliſhly? Are ſuch learned writings come from a man of ſo weake a converſation? who hath but an ordinary conceite, and writeth excellently, one may ſay his capacity is borrowed, not of himſelfe. A skilfull man, is not skilfull in all things: But a ſufficient man, is ſufficient euery where, even vnto ignorance. Heere my booke and my ſelfe march together, and keepe one pace. Elſe-where one may commend or condemne the worke, without the worke-man; heere not: who toucheth one, toucheth the other. He who ſhall iudge of it without knowing him, ſhall wrong himſelfe more then me: he that knowes it,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:12117:232"/>
hath wholly ſatisfied mee. Happie beyond my merite, If I get this onely portion of publike approbation, as I may cauſe men of vnderſtanding to thinke, I had beene able to make vſe and benefit of learning, had I beene endowed with any: and deſerued better helpe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. excuſe wee heere what I often ſay, that I ſeldome repent my ſelfe, and that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is contented with it ſelfe; not of an Angels or a horſes conſcience, but as of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Adding euer this clauſe, not of ceremonie, but of true and eſſentiall ſubmiſſion; that <hi>I ſpeake inquiring and doubting, meerely and ſimply referring my ſelfe, from reſolution, vnto common and lawfull opinions.</hi> I teach not; I report: Noe vice is abſolutely vice, which offendeth not, and a ſound iudgement accuſeth not: For, the deformitie and incommoditie thereof is ſo palpable, as peraduenture they haue reaſon, who ſay, it is chiefly produced by ſottiſhneſſe and brought forth by ignorance; ſo hard is it, to imagine one ſhould know it without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it. <hi>Malice ſucks vp the greateſt part of her owne venome, and therewith impoyſoneth herſelfe. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice, leaueth, as an vlcer in the fleſh, a repentance in the ſoule, which ſtill ſcratcheth, and bloodieth it ſelfe.</hi> For reaſon effaceth other griefes and ſorrowes, but engendereth thoſe of repentance: the more yrkeſome, becauſe inwarde: As the colde and heate of agues is more offenſiue then that which comes outward. I account vice (but each according to their meaſure) not onely thoſe which reaſon diſalowes, and nature condemnes, but ſuch as mans opinion bath forged as falſe and erronious, if lawes and cuſtome authorize the ſame. In like manner there is not goodneſſe but gladdeth an honeſt diſpoſition. There is truely I wot not what kinde or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, of well doing, which reioyceth in our ſelues, and a generous jollitie, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth a good conſcience. A minde couragiouſlie vicious, may happily furniſh it ſelfe with ſecurity, but ſhee cannot bee fraught, with this ſelfe-ioyning delight and ſatisfaction. It is noe ſmall pleaſure, for one to feele himſelfe preſerued from the contagion of an age ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as ours, and to ſay to himſelfe; could a man enter and ſee euen into my ſoule, yet ſhould he not finde me guilty, either of the affliction or ruine of any body, nor culpable of enuie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, nor of publike offence againſt the lawes, nor tainted with innouation, trouble or ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor ſpotted with falſifying of my worde; and although the libertie of times alowed and taught it every man, yet could I neuer bee induced to touch the goods or diue into the purſe of any <hi>French</hi> man; and haue alwayes liued vpon mine own, as well in time of war, as of peace: nor did I euer make vſe of any pooremans labour, without reward. Theſe teſtimonies of an vnſpotted conſcience are very pleaſing, which naturall ioy is a great benefit vnto vs; and the onely payment neuer faileth vs. To ground the recompence of vertuous actions, vpon the approbation of others, is to vndertake a moſt vncertaine or troubled foundation, namely in an age ſo corrupt and times ſo ignorant, as this is: <hi>the vulgar peoples good opinion is iniurious.</hi> Whom truſt you in ſeeing what is commendable; God keepe mee from beeing an honeſt man, according to the deſcription I dayly ſee made of honour, each one by himſelfe. <hi>Quae fuerant vitia, mores ſunt. What earſt were vices, are now growne faſhious.</hi> Some of my friendes, have ſometimes attempted to ſchoole me roundly, and ſift mee plainely, either of their owne motion, or envited by me, as to an office, which to a well compoſed minde, both in profit and lovingneſſe, exceedeth all the duties of ſincere amity. Such have I euer entertained with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen armes of curteſie, and kinde acknowledgement. But now to ſpeake from my conſcience, I often found ſo much falſe meaſure in their reproches and praiſes, that I had not greatly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if I had rather erred, then done well after their faſhion. Such as wee eſpecially, who live a private life not expoſed to any gaze but our owne, ought in our hartes eſtabliſh a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and thereto touch our deedes and try our actions; and accordingly, now cheriſh, and now chaſtiſe our ſelues. I haue my owne lawes and tribunall, to iudge of mee, whether I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe my ſelfe more then any where els. I reſtraine my actions according to other, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them according to my ſelfe. None but your ſelf knowes rightly whether you be demiſſe and cruel, or loyall and deuout. Others ſee you not, but gheſſe you by vncertaine coniectures: They ſee not ſo much your nature, as your arte.

Not onely being accidentall, and out of ſinne, as in thefts, but even in the very excerciſe of it, as in the acquaintance, or copulation with women; where the prouocation is ſo violent, and as they ſay, ſometime vnreſiſtable, In a towne of a kinſman of mine; the other day, beeing in <hi>Armignac,</hi> I ſawe a country man, commonly ſirnemed the Theefe: who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reported his life to haue beene thus. Beeing borne a begger, and perceiuing, that to get his bread by the ſweate of his brow and labour of his handes, would neuer ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arme him againſt penury, he reſolued to become a Theefe; and that trade had employed all his youth ſafely, by meanes of his bodily ſtrength: for he euer made vp Harueſt and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in other mens groundes; but ſo farre off, and in ſo great heapes, that it was beyond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, one man ſhould in one night carry away ſo much vpon his ſhoulders: and was ſo carefull to equall the pray, and diſperce the miſchiefe he did, that the ſpoile was of leſſe import to euery particular man.</p>

By this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, bee it true or falſe, hee reſpecteth theaft, as a diſhoneſt and vnlawfull action, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame: yet leſſe then pinching want: Hee repents but ſimplie; for in regarde it was ſo counterballanced and recompenced, hee repenteth not. That is not that habit which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates vs vnto vice, and confirmeth our vnderſtanding in it; nor is it that boyſterous winde, which by violent blaſtes dazeleth and troubleth our mindes, and at that time confoundes, and ouerwhelmes both vs, our iudgement, and all into the power of vice. What I doe, is ordinarily full and compleate, and I march (as wee ſay) all in one piece: I haue not many motions, that hide themſelves and ſlinke away from my reaſon, or which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neare are not guided by the conſent of all my partes, without diuiſion, or inteſtine ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: my iudgement hath the whole blame, or commendation; and the blame it hath once, it hath euer: for, almoſt from it's birth, it hath beene one, of the ſame inclination, courſe and force. And in matters of generall opinions, euen from my infancie, I ranged my ſelfe to the point I was to hold. Some ſinnes there are outragious, violent and ſuddaine; leaue we them.</p>
                        <p>But thoſe other ſinnes, ſo often reaſſumed, determined and aduiſed vpon, whether they bee of complexion, or of profeſſion and calling, I cannot conceiue how they ſhould ſo long bee ſettled in one ſame courage, vnleſſe the reaſon and conſcience of the ſinner were thervnto inwardly priuie and conſtantly willing.

noe more then mine arme becommeth ſtronger, or my wit more excellent, by conceiuing ſome others to be ſo. If to ſuppoſe &amp; wiſh a more nobler working then ours, might produce the repentance of our owne, wee ſhould then repent vs of our moſt innocent actions: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as wee iudge that in a more excellent nature, they had heene directed with greater perfection and dignity; and our ſelves would doe the like. When I conſult with my age of my youthes proceedings, I finde that commonly, (according to my opinion) I mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in order. This is all my reſiſtance is able to performe. I flatter not my ſelfe: in like circumſtances, I ſhould euer bee the ſame. It is not a ſpot, but a whole dye, that ſtaynes mee. I acknowledge noe repentance, that is ſuperficiall, meane and ceremoious. It muſt touch mee on all ſides, before I can terme it repentance. It muſt pinch my entrailes, and afflict them as deepely and throughly, as God himſelfe beholdes mee. When in negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, many good fortunes haue ſlipt mee for want of good diſcretion, yet did my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects make good choyce, according to the occurrences preſented vnto them. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is euer to take the eaſier and ſurer ſide. I finde that in my former deliberations, I proceeded, after my rules, diſcreetely, for the ſubiects ſtate propounded to mee; and in like occaſions, would proceede a like; a hundred yeares, hence. I reſpect not what now it is, but what it was, when I conſulted of it. <hi>The conſequence of all deſſignes conſiſtes in the ſeaſons; occaſions paſſe, and matters change vnceſſantlie.</hi> I have in my time runne into ſome groſſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde and important errors; not for want of good aduiſe, but of good happe. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and indiuinable partes in the obiects men doe handle; eſpeciallie in the nature of men and mute conditions, without ſhew, and ſometimes vnknowne of the very poſſeſſours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and ſtirred vp by ſuddaine occaſions. If my wit coulde neyther finde nor preſage them, I am not offended with it; the function thereof is contained within it's owne limits. If the ſucceſſe beate mee, and favour the ſide I refuſed; there is noe remedy; I fall not out with my ſelfe; I accuſe my fortune, not my endeuour: that's not called repentance. <hi>Phocion</hi> had giuen the Athenians ſome counſell, which was not followed; the matter, againſt his opinion, ſucceeding happily; How now <hi>Phocion,</hi> (quoth one) art thou pleaſed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath thriued ſo well? yea (ſaide hee) and I am glad of it, yet repent not the aduiſe I gaue.</p>
                        <p>When any of my friends come to mee for counſell, I beſtowe it francklie and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, not as (well nigh all the worlde doth) wavering at the hazard of the matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the contrary of my meaning may happen, that ſo they may juſtly finde fault with my aduiſe: for which I care not greatly. For they ſhall doe mee wrong, and it became nor mee to refuſe them that dutie. I haue no body to blame for my faultes or misfortunes, but my ſelfe. For in effect I ſeldome vſe the aduiſe of other vnleſſe it be for complements ſake, and where I haue need of inſtruction or knowledge of the fact. Marry in things wherin nought but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to bee employed; ſtrange reaſons may ſerve to ſuſtaine, but not to divert me. I lende a favourable and curteous eare vnto them all. But (to my remembrance) I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued any but mine owne. With mee they are but Flyes and Moathes, which diſtract my will. I little regarde mine owne opinions, other mens I eſteeme as little: Fortune payes mee accordingly. If I take no counſell I give as little. I am not much ſought after for it and leſſe credited when I give it: Neither knowe I any enterpriſe, either private or publike, that my aduiſe hath directed and brought to concluſion. Euen thoſe whome fortune had ſome-way tyde therevnto, have more willingly admitted the direction of others conceites, then mine. As one that am a jealous of the rights of my quiet, as of thoſe of my authoritie; I would rather haue it thus.</p>
                        <p>Where leaving me, they iumpe with my profeſſion, which is, wholly to ſettle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mee in my ſelfe. It is a pleaſure vnto mee, to bee diſintereſſed of other mens affayres, and diſingaged from their contentions. When ſutes or buſineſſes bee ouer-paſt, how-ſo-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it bee, I greeve little at them. For, the imagination that they muſt neceſſarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-ſo, puts mee out of paine; behould them in the courſe of the Vniuerſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained in Stoy call cauſes. Your fantazie cannot by wiſhe or imagination, remooue one point of them, but the whole order of things muſt reverſe both what is paſt, and what is to come.

                        <p>Wee muſt not ſuffer our ſelues ſo fully to be carried into naturall alterations, as to corrupt or adulterate our iudgement by them. Youth and pleaſure haue not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prevailed ſo much ouer me, but I could ever (even in the midſt of ſenſualities) diſcerne the vgly face of ſinne: nor can the diſtaſte which yeares bring on me, at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, keepe mee from diſcerning that of voluptuouſneſſe in vice. Now I am no longer in it, I judge of it as if I were ſtill there. I who lively and attentively examine my reaſon, finde it to be the ſame that poſſeſſed me in my moſt diſſolute and licentious age; vnleſſe perhaps, they being enfeebled and empayred by yeares, doe make ſome difference: And finde, that what delight it refuſeth to affoorde mee in regarde of my bodilie health, it would no more denie mee, then in times paſt, for the health of my ſoule. To ſee it out of combate, I holde it not the more couragious. My temptations are ſo mortified and crazed, as they are not worthy of it's oppoſitions; holding but my hand before me, I be-calme them. Should one preſent that former concupiſcence vnto it, I feare it would be of leſſe power to ſuſtance it than heretofore it hath beene. I ſee in it, by it ſelfe no encreaſe of iudgement, nor acceſſe of brightneſſe, what it now iudgeth, it did then. Wherefore if there be any amendment, t'is but diſeaſed. <hi>Oh miſerable kinde of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to be beholden vnto ſickneſſe for our health.</hi> It is not for our miſhap, but for the good ſucceſſe of our iudgement to performe this office. Croſſes and afflictions, make me doe nothing but curſſe them. They are for people, that cannot be awaked but by the whip. The courſe of my reaſon is the nimbler in proſperitie; It is much more diſtracted and buſied in the digeſting of miſchiefes, than of delights. I ſee much cleare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> in faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Health forewarneth me, as with more pleaſure, ſo to better purpoſe than ſickneſſe. I approached the neareſt I could vnto amendment and regularity, when I ſhould have enioyed the ſame; I ſhould be aſhamed and vexed, that the miſery and miſhap of my old age could exceede the helth, attention and vigor of my youth: and that I ſhould be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not for what I have beene, but for what I am leaft to be. The happy life (in my opinion) not (as ſaid <hi>Antiſthenes</hi>) the happy death, is it that makes mans happineſſe in this world.</p>
                        <p>I have not prepoſterouſly buſied my ſelfe to tie the taile of a Philoſopher, vnto the head and bodie of a varlet: nor that this paultrie end, ſhould diſavow and belie the faireſt, ſoundeſt, and longeſt part of my life. I will preſent my ſelfe, and make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall muſter of my whole, every where vniformally. Were I to live againe, it ſhould bee as I have already lived. I neither deplore what is paſt, nor dread what is to come: and if I be not deceived, the inward parts have neerely reſembled the outward. It is one of the chiefeſt points wherein I am beholden to fortune, that in the courſe of my bodies eſtate, each thing hath beene carried in ſeaſon. I have ſeene the leaves, the bloſſomes, and the fruit; and now ſee the drooping and withering of it. Happily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe naturally. I beare my preſent miſeries the more gently, becauſe they are in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and with greater favour make mee remember the long happineſſe of my former life. In like manner, my diſcretion may well bee of like proportion in the one and the other time: but ſure it was of much more performance, and had a better grace, being freſh, iolly and full of ſpirit, then now that it is worne, decrepite and toyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                        <p>I therefore renounce theſe caſuall and dolourous reformations. <hi>God must touch our heartes; our conſcience must amende of it ſelfe,</hi> and not by re-inforcement of our reaſon, nor by the enfeebling of our appetites. Voluptuouſneſſe in it ſelfe is neither pale nor diſcouloured, to be diſcerned by bleare and troubled eyes. Wee ſhould affect tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and chaſtity for it ſelfe, and for Gods cauſe, who hath ordained them vnto vs:
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:12117:235"/>
that which Catars beſtow vpon vs, and which I am beholden to my chollicke for, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temperance nor chaſtitie. A man cannot boaſt of contemning or combating ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if hee ſee her not, or know not her grace, her force and moſt attractive beauties. I know them both, and therefore may ſpeake it. But mee thinkes our ſoules in age are ſubject vnto more importunate diſeaſes and imperfections, then they are in youth. I ſaid ſo being young, when my beardleſſe chinne was vpbraided mee; and I ſay it againe, now that my gray beard gives me authoritie. We entitle wiſdome, the frowardneſſe of our humours, and the diſtaſte of preſent things; but in truth wee abandon not vices, ſo much as wee change them; and in mine opinion for the worſe. Beſides a ſillie and ruinous pride, comberſome tattle, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and vnſociable humours, ſuperſtition and a ridiculous carking for wealth, when the vſe of it is well nigh loſt, I finde the more enuie, injuſtice and leaudneſſe in it. It ſets more wrinckles in our mindes, then on our foreheads: nor are there any ſpirits, or very rare ones, which in growing old taſte not ſowrely and muſtily. Man marcheth entirely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his encreaſe and decreaſe. View but the wiſedome of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and divers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his condemnation, I dare ſay he ſomething lent himſelfe vnto it by prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of purpoſe: being ſo neere, and at the age of ſeventie, to endure the benumming of his ſpirits richeſt pace, and the dimming of his accuſtomed brightneſſe.

and fortifieth. It hath of it ſelfe to awaken the faculties of it: Nature having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it, as vnto all other, matter of it's owne for advantage, and ſubiects fit enough where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deviſe and determine. Meditation is a large and powerfull ſtudie to ſuch as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly can taſte and employ themſelues therein. I had rather forge then furniſh my minde.</p>
                        <p>There is no office or occupation either weaker or ſtronger, then that of entertaining of ones thoughts according to the minde, whatſoever it be. The greateſt make it their vacation, <hi>Quibus viuere eſt cogitare, to whom it is all one to liue and to meditate.</hi> Nature hath alſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with this priuilege, that there is nothing we can doe ſo long; nor action, whereto wee give our ſelves more ordinarily and eaſily. It is the worke of Gods (ſaith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) whence both their happineſſe and ours proceedeth. Reading ſerves mee eſpecially, to awake my conceit by divers objects; to buſie my judgement, not my memorie. Few entertainments then, ſtay mee without vigour and force. T'is true that courteſie and beautie poſſeſſe mee, as much or more, then waight and depth. And becauſe I ſlumber in all other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and lend but the ſuperficiall parts of my attention vnto them, it often befalleth mee, in ſuch kinde of weake and abſurd diſcourſes, (diſcourſes of countenance) to blurt out and anſwer ridiculous toies, and fond abſurdities, vnworthie a childe; or wilfully to hold my peace; therewithall more fooliſhly and incivilly. I have a kinde of raving fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie-full behaviour, that retireth mee into my ſelfe; and on the other ſide, a groſſe and childiſh ignorance of many ordinarie things; by meanes of which two qualities, I have in my daies committed five or ſix as ſottiſh trickes, as any one whoſoever; which to my derogation may bee reported. But to follow my purpoſe, this harſh comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of mine makes me nice in conuerſing with men (whom I muſt picke and cull out for the nonce) and vnfit for common actions. Wee liue and negotiate with the people: If their behaviour importune vs, if wee diſdaine to lend our ſelves to baſe and vulgar ſpirits, which often are as regular as thoſe of a finer mould; and <hi>all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is vaſavourie, that is not conformed to common inſipience.</hi> Wee are no longer to intermeddle either with our, or other mens affaires: and both publike and private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſuch kinde of people.</p>
                        <p>The leaſt wreſted, and moſt naturall proceedings of our minde, are the faireſt; the beſt occupations, thoſe which are leaſt forced. Good God, how good an office doth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnto thoſe, whoſe deſires ſhee ſquareth according to their power! There is no ſcience more profitable. <hi>As one may,</hi> was the burden and favoured ſaying of <hi>Socrates:</hi> A ſentence of great ſubſtance. Wee muſt addreſſe and ſtay our deſires, to things moſt eaſie and neereſt. Is it not a fond-peeviſh humour in mee, to diſagree from a thouſand; to whom my fortune joineth mee, without whom I cannot live, to adhere vnto one or two, that are out of my commerce and conuerſation; or rather to a fantaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or fancie-full deſire, for a thing I cannot obtaine? My ſoft behaviours and milde manners, enemies to all ſharpneſſe and foes to all bitterneſſe, may eaſily have diſcharged mee from envie and contention. To bee beloved, I ſay not, but not to bee hated, never did man give more occaſion. But the coldneſſe of my conuerſation, hath with reaſon robd mee of the good will of many; which may bee excuſed, if they interpret the ſame to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or worſe ſenſe. I am moſt capable of getting rare amities, and continuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite acquaintances. For ſo much as with ſo greedie hunger I ſnatch at ſuch acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances as anſwer my taſte and ſquare with my humour. I ſo greedily produce and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long caſt my ſelfe vpon them, that I doe not eaſily miſſe to cleaue vnto them, and where I light-on, to make a ſteadie impreſſion; I have often made happie and ſucceſſefull triall of it.</p>
                        <p>In vulgar worldly friendſhips, I am ſomewhat cold and barren; for my proceeding is not naturall, if not vnreſiſted and with hoiſed-full ſailes. Moreover, my fortune ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enured and allured mee, even from my infancie, to one ſole-ſingular and perfect amitie, hath verily, in ſome ſort, diſtaſted mee from others: and over-deeply imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my fantaſie, that it is a beaſt ſociable and for companie, and not of troupe, as ſaid an ancient writer. So that it is naturally a paine vnto mee, to communicate my ſelfe by halves, and with modification; and that ſervile or ſuſpicious wiſedome, which in the converſation of theſe numerous and imperfect amities, is ordained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

                        <p>I ſhould commend a high-rayſed minde, that could both bende and diſcharge it ſelfe: that where-ever hir fortune might tranſporte hir, ſhee might continue conſtant: that could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with hir neyghbour of all matters, as of hir building, of hir hunting and of any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; and entertaine with delight a Carpenter or a Gardiner.

into their minde, hath ſtaid on their tongues. If the well borne will give any credit vnto me, they ſhall be pleaſed to make their owne and naturall riches to prevaile and be of worth: They hide and ſhroud their formes vnder fortaine and borrowed beawties: <hi>It is great ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, for any body to ſmoother and conceale his owne brightneſſe, to ſhine with a borrowed light:</hi> They are buried and entombed vnder the Arte of <hi>CAPS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LA TOTAE,</hi> It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not ſufficiently know themſelves: the World containes nothing of more beauty: It is for them to honour Artes, and to beawtifie embelliſhment.

For, what other excuſe can I deviſe for them? It is ſufficient, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs, they may frame, or roule the grace of their eyes, vnto cheerefulneſſe, vnto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and vnto mildeneſſe: and ſeaſon a <hi>No</hi> with frowardneſſe, with doubt and with favour; and require not an interpretor in diſcourſes made for their ſervice. With this learning they command without controule, and over-rule both Regents and Schooles. Yet if it offend them to yeeld vs any preheminence, and would for curioſity ſake have part in bookes alſo: Poeſie is a ſtudy fit for their purpoſe: being a wanton, ammuſing, ſubtill, diſguiſed, and pratling Arte; all in delight, all in ſhew, like to themſelves. They may alſo ſelect diverſe commodities out of Hiſtory. In Morall Philoſophy, they may take the diſcourſes which enable them to judge of our humours, to cenſure our conditions, and to avoide our guiles and treacheries; to temper the raſhneſſe of their owne deſires. to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band their liberty: lengthen the delights of life; gently to beare the inconſtancy of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, the peeviſhneſſe or rudeneſſe of a husband, the importunity of yeares, the vnwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comneſſe of wrinckles, and ſuch like minde-troubling accidents. Loe heare the moſt and greateſt ſhare of learning I would aſſigne them. There are ſome particular, retired and cloſe diſpoſitions.</p>
                        <p>My eſſentiall forme is fit for communication, and proper for production: I am all outward and in apparance; borne for ſociety and vnto friendſhip. The ſolitude I love and commend, is eſpecially but to retire my affections and redeeme my thoughts vnto my ſelfe; to reſtraine and cloſevp, not my ſteppes, but my deſires and my eares, reſigning all forraigne ſolicitude and trouble, and mortally ſhunning all manner of ſeruitude and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; and not ſo much the throng of men as the importunity of affaires. Locall ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe (to ſay trueth) doth rather extend and enlarge mee outwardly; I give my ſelfe to State-buſineſſe, and to the world, more willingly when I am all alone. At the Court, and in preſſe of people, I cloſe and ſlinke into mine owne skinne. Aſſemblies thruſt mee againe into my ſelfe. And I never entertaine my ſelfe ſo fondly, ſo licenciouſly, and ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as in places of reſpect, and ceremonious diſcretion. Our follies make mee not laugh, but our wiſdomes doe. Of mine owne complexion, I am no enemy to the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtirrings of our Courts: I have there paſt great part of my life: and am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to bee merry in great aſſemblies; ſo it beeby entermiſſion, and ſutable to my humour.</p>
                        <p>But this tenderneſſe and coineſſe of judgement (whereof I ſpeake) doth perforce tie mee vnto ſolitarineſſe. Yea even in mine owne houſe, in the middeſt of a numerous familie and moſt frequented houſes, I ſee people more then a good many, but ſeldome ſuch as I love to converſe or communicate withall. And there I reſerve, both for my ſelfe, and others, an vnaccuſtomed libertie; making truce with ceremonies, aſſiſtance, and invitings, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubleſome ordinances of our courteſie (O ſervile cuſtome and importunate manner) there every man demeaneth himſelfe as hee pleaſeth, and entertaineth what his thoughts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; whereas I keepe my ſelfe ſilent, meditating and cloſe, without offence to my gueſts or friends.</p>
                        <p>The men whoſe familiaritie and ſocietie I hunt after, are thoſe which are called honeſt, vertuous and ſufficient: the image of whom doth diſtaſte and divert mee from others. It
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:12117:237"/>

                        <p>The end or ſcope of this commerce, is principally and ſimply familiarity, conference and frequentation: the exerciſe of mindes, without other fruite. In our diſcourſes, all ſubiects are alike to mee: I care not though they want either waight or depth; grace and pertmency are never wanting; all therein is tainted with a ripe and conſtant iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and commixt with goodneſſe, liberty, cheerefulneſſe, and kindneſſe. It is not onely in the ſubiect of Lawes and affaires of Princes, that our ſpirit ſheweth it's beautie, grace and vigor: It ſheweth them as much in priuate conferences. I know my people by their very ſilence and ſmyling, and peraduenture diſcover them better at a Table, then ſitting in ſerious counſell.</p>

of their matrimoniall parts vnto the people aſſembled, to ſee if thereby at leaſt they might get them husbands. By conſequence there is not one of them, but vpon the firſt oath one maketh to ſerve her, will very eaſily bee perſwaded to thinke well of her ſelfe. Now this common treaſon and ordinary proteſtations of men in theſe daies, muſt needes produce the effects, experience already diſcovereth: which is, that either they joine together, and caſt away themſelves on themſelves, to avoid vs, or on their ſide follow alſo the example wee give them; acting their part of the play, without paſſion; without care, and without love, lending themſelves to this entercourſe: <hi>Neque affectui ſuo aut alieno obnoxiae: Neither liable to their owne nor other folkes affection.</hi> Thinking, according to <hi>Lyſias</hi> perſwaſions in <hi>Plato,</hi> they may ſo much the more profitably and commodiouſly yeeld vnto vs; by how much leſſe we love them: Wherein it will happen as in Comedies, the ſpectators ſhall have as much or more pleaſure, as the Comedians.

Thus doth this cozening rebound on him that vſeth it; and as it coſts him little, ſo gets he not much by it. Thoſe which made <hi>Venus</hi> a Goddeſſe, have reſpected that her principall beautie was incorporeall and ſpirituall. But ſhee whom theſe kinde of people hunt after, is not ſo much as humane, nor alſo brutall; but ſuch as wilde beaſts, would not have her ſo filthy and terreſtriall. We ſee that imagination enflames them, and deſire or luſt vrgeth them, before the body: Wee ſee in one and other ſex, even in whole heards, choiſe and diſtinctions in their affections, and amongſt themſelves acquaintances of long continued good-will and liking. And even thoſe to whom age denieth bodily ſtrength, doe yet bray, neigh, roare, skip and wince for love. Before the deed wee ſee them full of hope and heat; and when the body hath plaid his part, even tickle and tingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſweetneſſe of that remembrance: ſome of them ſwell with pride at parting from it, others all weary and glutted, ring out ſongs of glee and triumph. Who makes no more of it but to diſcharge his body of ſome naturall neceſſitie, hath no cauſe to trouble others with ſo curious preparation. <hi>It is no food for a greedie and clowniſh hunger.</hi> As one that would not be accounted better then I am, thus much I will diſplay of my youths wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-errours: Not onely for the danger of ones health that followes that game (yet could I not avoid two, though light and curſorie aſſaults) but alſo for contempt, I have not much beene given to mercenarie and common acquaintances.

Surely glittering pearles and ſilken cloathes adde ſome thing vnto it, and ſo doe titles, nobilitie and a worthie traine. Beſides which, I made high eſteeme of the minde, yet ſo as the body might not iuſtly be found fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: For, to ſpeake my conſcience, if either of the two beauties were neceſſarily to bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I would rather have choſen to want the mentall, whoſe vſe is to be emploied in better things. But in the ſubject of love; a ſubject that chiefly hath reference vnto the two ſenſes of ſeeing and touching, ſome thing may be done without the graces of the minde, but little or nothing without the corporall. <hi>Beautie is the true auailefull advantage of women:</hi> It is ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly theirs, that ours though it require ſome features and different allurements, is not in her right kue, or true bias, vnleſſe confuſed with theirs; childiſh and beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. It is reported, that ſuch as ſerve the great <hi>Turke</hi> vnder the title of beautie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the number is infinite) are diſmiſſed at furtheſt when they once come to the age of two and twenty yeeres. <hi>Diſcourſe, diſcretion, together with the offices of true amitie, are better found amongst men: and therefore governe they the worlds affaires.</hi> Theſe two commerces or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are accidentall and depending of others; the one is troubleſome and tedious for it's raritie; the other withers with old age: nor could they have ſufficiently provided for my liues neceſſities. That of bookes, which is the third, is much more ſolid-ſure and much more ours; ſome other advantages it yeeldeth to the two former; but hath for her ſhare conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and the facilitie of her ſervice. This accoſteth and ſecondeth all my courſe, and every where aſſiſteth me: It comforts mee in age, and ſolaceth me in ſolitarineſſe: It eaſeth mee of the burden of a weary-ſome ſloth; and at all times rids mee of tedious companies; it abateth
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:12117:238"/>
the edge of fretting ſorrow, on condition it bee not extreme and over-inſolent. <hi>To divert me from any importunate imagination or inſinuating conceit, there is no better way then to have recourſe vnto bookes:</hi> with eaſe they allure mee to them, and with facilitie they remoove them all. And though they perceive I neither frequent nor ſeeke them, but wanting other more eſſentiall, lively, and more naturall commodities, they never mutinie or murmure at mee; but ſtill entertaine mee with one and ſelfe-ſame viſage. <hi>Hee may well walke a foot, that leades his horſe by the bridle,</hi> ſaith the proverbe. And our <hi>Iames</hi> king of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilie,</hi> who being faire, yoong, healthy and in good plight, cauſed himſelfe to bee caried abroad in a plaine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon or skreene, lying vpon an homely pillow of courſe feathers, cloathed in a ſute of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpunne gray, and a bonet of the ſame, yet royally attended on by a gallant troupe of Nobles, of Litters, Coches, and of all ſorts of choice led-horſes, a number of gentlemen, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, repreſented a tender and wavering auſteritie. <hi>The ſicke man is not to be moaned, that hath his health in his ſleeve.</hi> In the experience and vſe of this ſentence, which is moſt true, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the commoditie I reape of bookes. In effect I make no other vſe of them, then thoſe who know them not. I enioy them, as a miſer doth his gold; to know, that I may enioy them when I liſt; my minde is ſetled and ſatisfied with the right of poſſeſſion. I never travell without bookes, nor in peace nor in warre; yet doe I paſſe many daies and moneths with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vſing them. It ſhall be anon, ſay I or to morrow, or when I pleaſe; in the meane while the time runnes away, and paſſeth without hurting mee. For it is wonderfull, what repoſe I take, and how I continue in this conſideration, that they are at my elbow to delight me when time ſhall ſerve: and in acknowledging what aſſiſtance they give vnto my life. This is the beſt munition I have found in this humane peregrination; and I extremely bewaile thoſe men of vnderſtanding that want the ſame. I accept with better will all otehr kindes of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, how ſlight ſoever, forſomuch as this cannot faile me. At home I betake me ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the oftner to my Librarie, whence all at once I command and ſurvay all my houſhold; It is ſeated in the chiefe entrie of my houſe, thence I behold vnder mee my garden, my baſe court, my yard, and looke even into moſt roomes of my houſe. There without order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out method, and by peece-meales I turne over and ranſacke, now one booke and now ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes I muſe and rave; and walking vp and downe I endight and enregiſter theſe my humours, theſe my conceits. It is placed on the third ſtorie of a tower. The lowermoſt is my Chapell; the ſecond a chamber with other lodgings, where I often lie, becauſe I would bee alone. Above it is a great ward-robe. It was in times paſt the moſt vnprofitable place of all my houſe. There I paſſe the greateſt part of my lives daies, and weare out moſt houres of the day. I am never there a nights: Next vnto it is a handſome neat cabinet, able and large enough to receive fire in winter, and very pleaſantly windowed. And if I feared not care, more then coſt; (care which drives and diverts mee from all buſineſſe) I might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ione a convenient gallerie of a hundred paces long, and twelve broad, on each ſide of it, and vpon one floore; having already, for ſome other purpoſe, found all the walles raiſed vnto a convenient height. Each retired place requireth a walke. My thoughts are prone to ſleepe, if I ſit long. My minde goes not alone as if legges did moove it. Thoſe that ſtudie without bookes, are all in the ſame caſe. The forme of it is round, and hath no flat ſide, but what ſerveth for my table and chaire: In which bending or circling manner, at one looke it offreth mee the full ſight of all my bookes, ſet round about vpon ſhelves or desks, five rankes one vpon anotehr. It hath three bay-windowes, of a farre-extending, rich and vnreſiſted proſpect, and is in diameter ſixteene paces void. In winter I am leſſe continually there: for my houſe (as the name of it importeth) is pearched vpon an over-pearing hillocke; and hath no part more ſubject to all wethers then this: which pleaſeth me the more, both becauſe the acceſſe vnto it is ſomwhat troubleſome and remote, and for the benefit of the exerciſe, which is to be reſpected; and that I may the better ſeclude my ſelfe from companie, and keepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochers from mee: There is my ſeat, that is my throne. I endevour to make my rule therein abſolute, and to ſequeſter that onely corner from the communitie of wife, of children and of acquaintance. Elſe-where I have but a verball authoritie, of confuſed eſſence. Miſerable, in my minde is hee, who in his owne home, hath no where to be to himſelfe; where hee may particularly court, and at his pleaſure hide or with-draw himſelfe.

I live from hand to mouth, and with reverence bee it ſpoken, I live but to my ſelfe: there end all my deſignes. Being young I ſtudied for oſtentation; then a little to enable my ſelfe and become wiſer; now for delight and recreation; never for gaine.

Ivnperceaueably remooved thoſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full humours from hir; ſo that as long as I was with hir, ſo long I kept hir in cheerefull countenance,, and vntroubled faſhion; wherein I vſed diverſion. Thoſe which in the ſame ſeruice ſucceded mee, found hir no whit amended: the reaſon was, I had not yet driven my wedge to the roote. I haue peraduenture elſe where, glaunced at ſome kindes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diuerſions. And the militarie cuſtomes vſed by <hi>Pericles</hi> in the Peloponenſian warre, and a thouſand others elſe-where, to diuert or withdrawe the armie of an enemie from their owne countrie, is too frequent in hiſtories. It was an ingenious diuerting, where-with the Lord of <hi>Himbercourt</hi> ſaved both himſelfe and others in the towne of <hi>Liege,</hi> into which the Duke of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> who beleagred the ſame, had cauſed him to enter, to performe the covenants of their accorded yeelding. The inhabitants thereof, to provide for it, aſſembled by night, and began to mutinie againſt their former agreement, determining vpon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſet vpon the Negotiators, now in their power. Hee perceiuing their intent, and noiſe of this ſhoure readie to fall vpon him, and the danger his lodging was in, forth-with ruſhed out vpon them two cittizens (whereof hee had diuers with him) furniſhed with moſt plauſible and new offers to bee propounded to their counſell; but indeed forged at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to ſerue his turne withall, and to ammuſe them. Theſe two ſtayed the firſt approching ſtorme, and carryed this incenſed Hydra-headed-monſter multitude backe to the towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to heare their charge, and accordingly to determine of it. The conſultation was ſhort; when loe a ſecond tempeſt came ruſhing on, more furiouſlie inraged then the former; to whom he immediatly diſpatched foure new and ſemblable interceſſors, with proteſtations, that now they were in earneſt to propoſe and declare newe and farre more ample conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto them, wholly to their content and ſatisfaction; whereby this diſordered rout was againe drawen to their Conclaue and Senate-houſe. In ſumme, he by ſuch a diſpenſation of amuſements, diuerting their headlong fury, and diſſipating the ſame with vaine and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſultations, at length lulled them into ſo ſecure a ſleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he gained the day, which was his chiefeſt drift and only aimed ſcope.

This other leſſon is too high, and over-hard. It is for them of the firſt ranke, meerely to ſtay vpon the thing it ſelfe, to examine and iudge it. It belongeth to one onely <hi>Socrates,</hi> to accoſt and entertaine death with an vndaunted ordinary viſage, to become familiar and play with it.

He ſeeketh for no comfort out of the thing it ſelfe. To die ſeemeth vnto him a naturall and indifferent accident: thereon he wiſhly fixeth his ſight, and thereon he reſolueth without looking elſe-where. <hi>Hegoſias</hi> his diſciples, who with hunger ſtarued themſelues to death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed therevnto with the perſwading diſcourſes of his leſſons; and that ſo thicke as King <hi>Ptolomey</hi> forbad him any longer to entertaine his ſchoole with ſuch murtherous precepts.

One may well commend their religion, but not properly their conſtancy. They ſhunne the brunt; they divert their conſideration from death; as we vſe to dandle and buſie children, when we would lance them or let them bloud. I have ſeene ſome, who if by fortune they chanced to caſt their eies towards the dreadfull preparations of death, which were round about them, fall into trances, and with fury caſt their cogitations elſe-where. We teach thoſe that are to paſſe-over ſome ſteepy downe fall or dreadfull abiſſe, to ſhut or turne aſide their eies. <hi>Subrius Flauius,</hi> being by the appointment of <hi>Nero</hi> to be put to death by the hands of <hi>Niger,</hi> both chiefe commanders in war: when he was brought vnto the place where the execution ſhould be performed, ſeeing the pit <hi>Niger</hi> had cauſed to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for him vneuen and vnhandſomely made; <hi>Nor is this pit</hi> (quoth he to the ſouldiers that ſtood about him) <hi>according to the true diſcipline of war:</hi> And to <hi>Niger,</hi> who willed him to hold his head ſteddy, <hi>I wiſh thou wouldest ſtricke as ſteddily.</hi> He gueſſed right; for <hi>Nigers</hi> arme trembling, he had divers blowes at him before he could ſtrike it off. This man ſeemeth to haue fixed his thoughts ſurely and directly on the matter. He that dies in the fury of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with weapons in hand thinkes not then on death, and neither feeleth nor conſidereth the ſame: the heate of the fight tranſports him. An honeſt man of my acquaintance, falling downe in a ſingle combat, and feeling himſelfe ſtab'd nine or ten times by his enemy, was called vnto by the by-ſtanders to call on God and remember his conſcience: but he tould me after, that albeit thoſe voices came vnto his eares, they had no whit mooued him, and that he thought on nothing, but how to diſcharge and reuenge himſelfe. In which combat he vanquiſhed and ſlew his aduerſary.</p>
                        <p>He who brought <hi>L.

We euer thinke on ſomewhat elſe: either the hope of a better life doth ſettle and ſupport vs, or the confidence of our childrens worth; or the future glory of our name; or the auoyding of theſe liues miſchieues; or the reuenge hanging ouer their heads that have cauſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured our death:</p>

                        <p>I was once neerely touched with a heavie diſpleaſure, according to my complexion; and yet more juſt then heavie: I had peradventure loſt my ſelfe in it, had I only relied vpon mine owne ſtrength. Needing a vehement diverſion to with-draw me from it; I did by Art and ſtudie make my ſelfe a Lover, whereto my age aſſiſted mee; love diſcharged and diverted me from the inconvenience, which good-will and amitie had cauſed in mee. So is it in all things elſe. A ſharpe conceit poſſeſſeth, and a violent imagination holdeth mee: I finde it a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe to alter and divert, then to tame and vanquiſh the ſame: if I cannot ſubſtitute a contrary vnto it, at leaſt I preſent another vnto it. <hi>Change ever eaſeth, varietie diſſolveth, and ſhifting diſſipateth.</hi> If I cannot buckle with it, I ſlip from it: and in ſhunning it, I ſtray and double from it. Shifting of place, exerciſe and company, I ſave my ſelfe amid the throng of other ſtudies and ammuſements, where it loſeth my tracke, and ſo I ſlip away. Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth thus, by the benefit of inconſtancie: For, the time it hath beſtowed on vs, as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Phyſitian of our paſſions, chiefly obtaines his purpoſe that way, when fraughting our conceits with other and different affaires, it diſſolveth and corrupteth that firſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how forcible ſoever it be. A wiſe man ſeeth little leſſe his friend dying at the end of five and twenty yeeres, then at the beginning of the firſt yeere; and according to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe: for he aſcribed no qualification of perplexities, either to the foreſight or antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them. But ſo many other cogitations croſſe this, that it languiſheth, and in the end groweth weary. To divert the inclination of vulgar reports, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> cut off his faire dogges cares and taile, and ſo drove him into the market place; that giuing this ſubject of prattle to the people, they might not meddle with his other actions. I have alſo ſeen ſome women, who to divert the opinions and coniectures of the babling people, and to divert the fond tatling of ſome, did by counterfet and diſſembled affections, ouerſhadow and cloake true affections.

How often doe wee peſter our ſpirits with anger or ſadneſſe by ſuch ſhaddowes, and entangle our ſelues into fantaſticall paſſions which alter both our mynde and bodye? what aſtoniſhed, flearing and confuſed mumpes and mowes doth this dotage ſtirre vp in our viſages? what skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and agitations of members and voyce, ſeemes it not by this man alone, that hee hath falſe viſions of a multitude of other men with whome hee dooth negotiate; or ſome inwarde Goblin that torments him? Enquire of your ſelfe, where is the object of this alteration? Is there any thing but vs in nature, except ſubſiſting nullitye? ouer whome it hath any power? Becauſe <hi>Cambyſes</hi> dreamed that his brother ſhould bee King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> hee put him to death; a brother whom he loued, and euer truſted. <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> King of the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; vpon a conceite he tooke of ſome ill preſage, by, I know not what howling of his Dogs, And King <hi>Midas</hi> did aſmuch, beeing troubled and vexed by a certaine vnpleaſing dreame of his owne. It is the right way to prize ones life at the right worth of it, to forgo it for a dreame. Heare notwithſtanding our mindes triumph ouer the bodies weakeneſſes and miſery; in that it is the prey and marke of all wrongs and alterations, to ſeede on and aime at. It hath ſurely much reaſon to ſpeake of it.</p>

But to a minde of the common ſtampe; it muſt be with intermiſſion and moderation; it groweth weake, by being continually over-wreſted: When I was young, I had neede to be aduertiſed and ſollicited to keepe my ſelfe in office: Mirth and health (ſaies one) ſute not ſo well with theſe ſerious and grave diſcourſes.

I am now but too much ſetled; too heavy and too ripe. My yeares read me daily a leſſon of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and temperance. My body ſhunneth diſorder, and feares it: it hath his turne to direct the minde toward reformation; his turne alſo to rule and ſway; and that more rudely and imperiouſly.

For my part I am reſoluted to dare ſpeake whatſoeuer I dare doe: And am diſpleaſed with thoughts not to be publiſhed.

Therfore is it, that they muſt often a day be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and violently be opened and rent from out the hollow of our boſome. As in the caſe of good; ſo of bad offices, onely confeſſion is ſometimes a ſatisfaction. Is there any deformitie in the error, which diſpenſeth vs to confeſſe the ſame? It is a paine for mee to diſſemble: ſo that I refuſe to take charge of other mens ſecrets, as wanting hart to diſauow my knowledge. I cannot conceale it; but deny it I cannot, without much a do and ſome trouble. <hi>To be perfectly ſecret, one muſt be ſo by nature; not by obligation.</hi> It is a ſmal matter to be ſecret in the Princes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, if one be not alſo a liar.

Yet was not his counſell ſo much the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as multiplication of vice. Wherevpon we ſometimes vſe this by-word, that we deale well with a man of conſcience, when in counterpoiſe of vice we propoſe ſome difficulty vnto him? but when he is incloſed between two vices, he is put to a hard choiſe. As <hi>Origen</hi> was dealt with al, either to commit idolatry, or ſuffer himſelf to be Sodomaticaly abuſed by a filthy Egiptian ſlave, that was preſented vnto him; he yeilded to the firſt condition, and viciouſly, ſaith one. Therfore ſhould not thoſe women be diſtaſted, according to their error, who of late proteſt, that they had rather charge their conſcience with ten men, then one Maſſe. If it bee indiſcretion ſo to divulge ones errors, ther is no danger though it come into example and vſe, For <hi>Ariſton</hi> ſaid, that <hi>The winds men feare moſt, are thoſe which diſcouer them.</hi> We muſt tuck vp this homely rag, that cloaketh our maners.

It vexeth me, that my Eſſayes ſerue Ladies in liew of common ware and ſtuffe for their hall: this Chapter will preferre me to their cabinet: I love their ſocietie ſome what private; their publike familiaritie wants fauor and ſauor.

to rob, to murther, to betray; and this we dare not but betweene our teeth. Are we to gather by it, that the leſſe wee breath out in words the more we are allowed to furniſh our thoughtes with? For words leaſt vſed leaſt writen and leaſt concealed ſhould beſt be vnderſtood, and moſt generally knowne. No age, no condition are more ignorant of it, then of their bread. They are imprinted in each one, without expreſſing, without voice or figure. And the ſexe that doth it moſt, is moſt bound to ſuppreſſe it. It is an action we have put in the precincts of ſilence, whence to draw it were an offence: not to accuſe or iudge it. Nor dare we beate it but in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution and picture.

                           <hi>I ſee no mariages faile ſooner, or more troubled, then ſuch as are concluded for beauties ſake, and hudled vp for amorous deſires.</hi> There are required more ſolide foundations, and more conſtant grounds, and a more warie marching to it: this earneſt youthly heate ſerueth to no purpoſe. Thoſe who thinke to honour marriage, by ioyning love vnto it (in mine opinion) doe as thoſe, who to doe vertue a fauour, holde, that Nobilitie is noe other thing then Vertue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe things have ſome affinitie; but therewithall great difference: their names and titles ſhould not thus be commixt: both are wronged ſo to bee confounded. <hi>Nobilitie is a worthy, goodly qualitie, aud introduced with good reaſon; but in as much as it dependeth on others, and may fall to the ſhare of my vicious and worthleſſe fellowe, it is in eſtimation farre ſhorte of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> If it be a vertue, it is artificiall and viſible; relying both on time and fortune; diuers in forme, according vnto countries; living and mortall; without birth, as the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogicall and common; by ſucceſſion and ſimilitude; drawne along by conſequence, but a very weake one. Knowledge, ſtrength, goodneſſe, beautie, wealth and all other qualities fall within compaſſe of commerce and communication: whereas this conſumeth it ſelfe in it ſelfe, of no employment for the ſeruice of others. One propoſed to one of our Kinges the choiſe of two competitors in one office, the one a Gentleman, the other a Yeoman: hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that without reſpect vnto that qualitie, hee who deſerued beſt ſhould be elected; but were their valour or worth fully a-like, the Gentleman ſhould be regarded: this was iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to give nobilitie hir right and ranke. <hi>Antigonus,</hi> to an vnknowne young-man, who ſued

vnto him for his fathers charge, a man of valour and who was lately deceaſed: My friend (quoth hee) in ſuch good turnes, <hi>I waigh not my ſouldiers noble birth, ſo much as their ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> Of truth it ſhould not be herein, as with the officers of Spartan kings; Trumpetors, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, Cookes, in whoſe roome their children ſucceded, how ignorant ſoeuer, before the beſt experienced in the trade. Thoſe of <hi>Calicut</hi> make of their nobility a degree aboue humane. Marriage is interdicted them, and all other vocations, ſauing warre. Of Concubines they may haue as many as they liſt, and women as many lechardes, without Jealouſie one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it is a capitall crime, and vnremiſſible offence to contract or marry with any of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition: Nay they deeme themſelues diſparaged and polluted, if they haue but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in paſſing by. And as if their honour were much iniuried and interreſſed by it, they kil thoſe who but approach ſome what to neare them. In ſuch ſort, that the ignoble are bound to cry as they walke along, like the <hi>Gondoliers</hi> or Water-men of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> along the ſtreetes, leaſt they ſhould iuſtle with them: and the nobles command them to what ſide of the way they pleaſe. Thereby doe theſe auoyde an obloquie which they eſteeme perpetuall; and thoſe an aſſured death. <hi>No continuance of time, no fauour of Prince, no office, no vertue, nor any wealth can make a clowne to become a gentleman.</hi> Which is much furthered by this cuſtome, that mariages of one trade with another are ſtricktlie for bidden. A Shoo-maker cannot marry with the race of a Carpenter; and parents are preciſely bounde to traine vp orphanes in their fathers trade, and in no other. Whereby the difference, the diſtinction and continuance, of their fortune is maintained. A good marriage (if any there be) refuſeth the company and conditions of loue; it endeuoureth to preſent thoſe of amity. It is a ſweete ſociety of life, full of conſtancie, of truſt, &amp; an infinite number of profitable and ſolid offices, and mutuall obligations: No woman that throughly and impartially taſteth the ſame,</p>

This is as they ſay, <hi>to beray the panier, and then put it on your head.</hi> My ſelfe have ſeene in ſome good place, love, ſhamefully and diſhoneſtly cured by mariage: the conſiderations are to much different.

Every one loved to come thither, to walke and paſſe away the time: but none affected to wed it: that is to ſay, to endeniſon, to dwell and habituate himſelfe therein. I have (and that to my ſpight and griefe) ſeene husbands hate their wives, onely becauſe themſelves wronged them: Howſoever, wee ſhould not love them leſſe for our faults; at leaſt for repentance and compaſſion they ought to be dearer vnto vs. Theſe are different ends (ſaith hee) and yet in ſome ſort compatible. Wedlocke hath for his ſhare honour, juſtice, profit and conſtancie: a plaine, but more generall delight. Love melts in onely pleaſure; and truly it hath it more tickliſh, more lively, more quaint, and more ſharpe: a pleaſure inflamed by difficulty: there muſt be a kinde of ſtinging, tingling and ſmarting. <hi>It is no longer loue, be it once without Arrowes, or without fire.</hi> The liberality of Ladies is to profuſe in marriage, and blunts the edge of affection and deſire.

So have they allotted women another as inſulting, wilde and fierce; in nature like a greedie, devouring, and rebellious creature, who if when hee cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, hee bee refuſed nouriſhment, as impatient of delay, it enrageth; and infuſing that rage into their bodies, ſtoppeth their conduicts, hindreth their reſpiration, and cauſeth a thouſand kindes of inconveniences; vntill ſucking vp the fruit of the generall thirſt, it have largely bedewed and enſeeded the bottome of their matrix. Now my law-giver ſhould alſo have conſidered, that peradventure it were a more chaſte and commodiouſly fruitfull vſe, betimes to give them a knowledge and taſte of the quicke; then according to the liberty and heat of their fantaſie, ſuffer them to gheſſe and imagine the ſame.

Now let vs confeſſe, that the knot of the iudgement of this duty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth principally in the will.

This is no place to extend theſe examples: they are too high and over-rich, to be preſented in this luſter: let vs therefore reſerve them for a nobler ſeat.

As ſome are ſeene complaine becauſe they vowed chaſtitie before yeeres of diſcretion or knowledge: ſo have I ſeene others vnfainedly bewaile and truly lament that they were vowed to licentiouſneſſe and diſſoluteneſſe before the age of iudgement and diſtinction. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents leaudneſſe may be the cauſe of it; or the force of impulſive neceſſitie, which is a ſhrewd counſellor, and a violent perſwader. Though chaſtitie were in the Eaſt Indias of ſingular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, yet the cuſtome permitted, that a maried wife might freely betake her ſelfe to what man ſoever did preſent her an Elephant: and that which ſome glory, to have beene valued at ſo high a rate. <hi>Phedon</hi> the Philoſopher, of a noble houſe, after the taking of his country <hi>Elis,</hi> profeſſed to proſtitute the beauty of his youth to all commers, ſo long as it ſhould continue, for money to live with and beare his charges.

                        <p>For, to what friend dare you entruſt your greevances, who, if hee laugh not at them, will not make vſe of them, as a direction and inſtruction to take a ſhare of the quarie or boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to himſelfe? As well the ſowreneſſe and inconveniences, as the ſweetneſſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures incident to mariage, are ſecretly concealed by the wiſer ſort. And amongſt other importunate conditions belonging to wedlocke, this one, vnto a babling fellow as I am, is of the chiefeſt; that tyrannous cuſtome makes it vncomely and hurtfull, for a man to communicate with any one all hee knowes and thinkes of it. To give women advice to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte them from jealouſie, were but time loſt or labour ſpent in vaine. Their eſſence is ſo infected with ſuſpicion, with vanitie and curioſitie, that we may not hope to cure them by any lawfull meane. They often recover of this infirmitie by a forme of health, much more to be feared, then the diſeaſe it ſelfe. For even as ſome inchantment cannot ridde away an evill, but with laying it on another, ſo when they loſe it, they transferre and beſtow this maladie on their husbands. And to ſay truth, I wot not whether a man can endure any thing at their hands worſe then jealouſie: of all their conditions it is moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as the head of all their members. <hi>Pittaeus</hi> ſaid, that <hi>every man had one imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or other: his wives curst pate was his;</hi> and but for that, he ſhould eſteeme himſelfe moſt happy. It muſt needs be a weightie inconvenience, wherewith ſo juſt, ſo wiſe and worthie a man, felt the ſtate of his whole life diſtempered: what ſhall wee petie fellowes doe then? The Senate of <hi>Marceille</hi> had reaſon to grant and enroll his requeſt, who demanded leave to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:12117:250"/>
kill himſelfe, thereby to free and exempt himſelfe from his wives tempeſtuous ſcolding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; for <hi>it is an evill, that is never cleane rid away, but by remooving the whole peece:</hi> and hath no other compoſition of worth, but flight or ſufferance; both too-too hard, God knowes. And in my conceit, he vnderſtood it right, that ſaid, <hi>a good mariage might be made betweene a blinde woman and a deafe man.</hi> Let vs alſo take heed, leſt this great and violent ſtrictneſſe of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we enioine them, produce not two effects contrary to our end: that is to wit, to ſet an edge vpon their ſuiters ſtomacks, and make women more eaſie to yeeld. For, as concerning the firſt point, <hi>enhancing the price of the place, we raiſe the price and endeare the deſire of the conquest.</hi> Might it not be <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe, who ſo cunningly enhanced the market of her ware, by the brokage or panderizing of the lawes? knowing how ſottiſh and taſtleſſe a delight it is, were it enabled by opinion, and endeared by deareneſſe? To conclude, <hi>it is all but hogges fleſh, varied by ſauce,</hi> as ſaid <hi>Flaminius</hi> his hoaſt. <hi>Cupid</hi> is a roguiſh God; his ſport is to wreſtle with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and to contend with juſtice. It is his glory, that his power checketh and copes all other might, and that all other rules give place to his.</p>

                        <p>What better interpretation can we finde concerning <hi>Meſſalinas</hi> demeanor? In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe made her ſilly husband Cuckold, ſecretly and by ſtealth (as the faſhion is) but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how vncontrolled and eaſily ſhe went on with her matches, by reaſon of the ſtupidity that poſſeſſed him, ſhee preſently contemned and forſooke that courſe, and began openly to make love, to avouch her ſervants, to entertaine and favour them in open view of all men; and would have him take notice of it, and ſeeme to be diſtaſted with it: but the ſilly gull and ſenſeleſſe coxombe awaked not for all this, and by his over-baſe facilitie, by which hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to authorize and legitimate her humors, yeelding her pleaſures weeriſh, and her amours taſteleſſe: what did ſhee? Being the wife of an Emperour, luſtie, in health and living; and where? In <hi>Rome,</hi> on the worlds chiefe Theater, at high noone-day, at a ſtately feaſt, in a publike ceremonie; and which is more, with one <hi>Silius,</hi> whom long time before ſhe had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enioied, ſhe was ſolemnly maried one day that her husband was out of the Citie. Seemes it not that ſhee tooke a direct courſe to become chaſte, by the retchleſneſſe of her husband? or that ſhe ſought another husband, who by jealouſie might whet her appetite, and who inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting might incite her? But the firſt difficultie ſhe met with, was alſo the laſt.

To thoſe well-meaning people, there needed no ſharpe encounter or witty equivocation: Their ſpeech is altogether full and maſſie, with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and conſtant vigor: They are all epigram; not only taile, but head, ſtomacke and feet. There is nothing forced, nothing wreſted, nothing limping; all marcheth with like tenour. <hi>Contextus totus virilis eſt, non ſunt circa floſculos occupati. The whole compoſition or text is manly, they are not bebuſied about Rhetorike flowers.</hi> This is not a ſoft quaint eloquence, and only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, it is ſinnowie, materiall, and ſolid; not ſo much delighting, as filling and raviſhing, and raviſheth moſt the ſtrongeſt wits, the wittieſt conceits. When I behold theſe gallant formes of expreſſing, ſo lively, ſo nimble, ſo deepe: I ſay not this is to ſpeake wel, but to thinke well. It is the quaintneſſe or livelineſſe of the conceit, that elevateth and puffes vp the words. <hi>Pectus eſt quod diſertum facit. It is a mans owne breſt, that makes him eloquent.</hi> Our people terme judgement, language; and full conceptions, fine words. This pourtraiture is directed not ſo much by the hands dexteritie, as by having the object more lively printed in the minde. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſpeakes plainly, becauſe he conceiveth plainly. <hi>Horace</hi> is not pleaſed with a ſleight or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall expreſſing, it would betray him; he ſeeth more cleere and further into matters: his ſpirit pickes and ranſacketh the whole ſtore-houſe of words and figures, to ſhew and preſent himſelfe; and he muſt have them more then ordinary, as his conceit is beyond ordinary. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſaith, that he diſcerned the Latine tongue by things. Heere likewiſe the ſenſe enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and produceth the words: no longer windie or ſpungie, but of fleſh and bone. They ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie more then they vtter. Even weake ones ſhew ſome image of this. For, in <hi>Italie,</hi> I ſpake what I liſted in ordinary diſcourſes, but in more ſerious and pithy, I durſt not have dared to truſt to an Idiome, which I could not winde or turne beyond it's common grace, or vulgar bias. I will bee able to adde and vſe in it ſomewhat of mine owne. The managing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment of good wits, endeareth and giveth grace vnto a tongue: Not ſo much innovating as filling the ſame with more forcible and divers ſervices, wreſting, ſtraining and enfolding it. They bring no words vnto it, but enrich their owne, waigh-downe and cramme-in their ſignification and cuſtome; teaching it vnwonted motions; but wiſely and ingenuouſly. Which skill how little it is given to all, may plainly bee diſcerned by moſt of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne French Writers. They are over-bold and ſcornefull, to ſhunne the common trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den path: but want of invention and lacke of diſcretion looſeth them. There is nothing to be ſeene in them but a miſerable ſtrained affectation of ſtrange Inke-pot termes; harſh, cold and abſurd diſguiſements, which in ſtead of raiſing, pull downe the matter. So they may gallantize and fluſh it in noueltie, they care not for efficacie. To take hold of a new farre-fetcht word, they neglect the vſuall, which often are more ſignificant, forcible and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:12117:251"/>
ſinnowy. I finde ſufficient ſtore of ſtuffe in our language, but ſome defect of faſhion. For there is nothing but could be framed of our Hunters gibbriſh words or ſtrange phraſes, and of our Warriours peculiar tearmes; a fruitfull and rich ſoyle to borrow off. And <hi>as hearbes and trees are bettered and fortified by being tranſplanted, ſo formes of ſpeach are embelliſhed and graced by variation.</hi> I finde it ſufficiently plenteous, but not ſufficiently plyable and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. It commonly faileth and ſhrinketh vnder a pithy and powerfull conception. If your march therein be far extended, you often feele it droope and languiſh vnder you, vnto whoſe default the Latine doth now and then preſent his helping hand, and the Greeke to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

As in our ordinary language, we ſhall ſometimes meete with excellent phraſes, and quaint metaphors, whoſe blithneſſe fadeth through age, and colour is tarniſh by to common vſing them. But that doth nothing diſtaſte thoſe of ſound judgement, nor derogate from the glory of thoſe ancient Authours, who, as it is likely were the firſt that brought theſe words into luſter, and raiſed them to that ſtraine. The Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences handle this ouer finely, with an artificiall maner, and different from the vulgar and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall forme. My Page makes loue, and vnderſtands it feelingly; Read <hi>Leon Hebraeus</hi> or <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> vnto him; you ſpeake of him, of his thoughts and of his actions, yet vnderſtands he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what you meane. I nor acknowledg nor diſcerne in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the moſt part of my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary motions. They are clothed with other robes, and ſhrouded vnder other veſtures, for the vſe of Academicall ſchooles. God ſend them well to ſpeed: but were I of the trade, I would naturalize Arte, as much as they Artize nature. <hi>Benbo</hi> and <hi>Equicola.</hi> When I write, I can well omit the company, and ſpare the remembrance of bookes; for feare they interrupt my forme. And in truth good Authours deiect me too-toomuch, and quaile my courage. I willingly imitate that Painter, who having bungler-like drawne, and fondly repreſented ſome Cockes, forbad his boies to ſuffer any live Cocke to come into his ſhop. And to give my ſelfe ſome luſter or grace haue rather neede of ſome of <hi>Antinonydes</hi> the Muſicions inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who when he was to play any muſicke, gave order that before or after him, ſome other bad muſicions ſhould cloy and ſurfet his auditory. But I can very hardly be without <hi>Plutarke;</hi> he is ſo vniuerſal and ſo full, that vpon all occaſions, and whatſoever extravagant ſubiect you haue vndertaken, he intrudeth himſelfe into your worke, and gently reacheth you a helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affording hand, fraught with rare embeliſhments, and inexauſtible of precious riches. It ſpights me, that he is ſo much expoſed vnto the pillage of thoſe which haunt him. He can no ſooner come in my ſight, or if I caſt but a glance vpon him, but I pull ſome legge or wing from him. For this my diſſignement, it much fitteth my purpoſe, that I write in mine owne houſe, in a wilde country, where no man helpeth or releeveth me; where I converſe with no body that vnderſtands the Latine of his <hi>Paternoſter</hi> and as little of French. I ſhould no doubt have done it better elſe where, but then the worke had beene leſſe mine: whoſe principall drift and perfection, is to be exactly mine; I could mend an accidentall errour, whereof I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in mine vnwary courſe; but it were a kinde of treaſon to remoove the imperfections from me, which in me are ordinary and conſtant. When any body elſe, or my ſelfe have ſaid vnto my ſelfe: Thou art to full of figures or allegories; here is a word meerely-bred Gaskoyne; that's a dangerous phraſe: (I refuſe none that are vſed in the frequented ſtreets of <hi>France;</hi> thoſe that wil combat vſe and cuſtome by the ſtrict rules of Grammar do but ieſt) there's an ignorant diſcourſe, that's a paradoxical relation; or there's a fooliſh conceit: thou doeſt often but dally: one will thinke thou ſpeakeſt in earneſt, what thou haſt but ſpoken in ieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea (ſay I) but I correct vnaduiſed, not coſtumarie errors. Speake I not ſo euery where? Doe I not liuely diſplay my ſelfe? that ſufficeth; I have my will; All the world my know me by my booke, and my booke by me: But I am of an Apiſh and imitating condition. When I medled with making of verſes (and I neuer made any but in Latine) they euidently accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Poet I came laſt from reading: And of my firſt Eſſayes, ſome taſte a little of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

And vices more: Becauſe they pricke mee, they take faſt hold vpon mee, and leaue mee not, vnleſſe I ſhake them off. I have more often beene heard to ſweare by imitation, then by

complexion. Oh iniurious and dead-killing imitation: like that of thoſe huge in greatneſſe and matchleſſe in ſtrength Apes, which <hi>Alexander</hi> met withall in a certaine part of <hi>India:</hi> which otherwiſe it had beene hard to vanquiſh. But by this their inclination to counterfeit whatſoever they ſaw done, they afforded the meanes. For, thereby the Hunters learn't in their ſight to put on ſhooes, and tie them with many ſtrings and knots; to dreſſe their heads with divers ſtrange attires, full of ſliding-knots; and diſſemblingly to rub their eyes with Glew, or Birde-lime.

When I ſweare after mine owne faſhion, it is onely by God; the directeſt of all oathes. They report that <hi>Socrates</hi> ſwore by a Dogge; <hi>Zeno</hi> by that interiection (now a daies vſed amongſt the Italies) <hi>Cappari;</hi> and <hi>Pithagoras</hi> by water and by aire. I am ſo apt at vnawares to entertaine theſe ſuperficiall impreſſions, that if but for three daies together I vſe my ſelfe to ſpeake to any Prince with your Grace or your Highneſſe, for eight daies after I ſo forget my ſelfe, that I ſhall ſtill vſe them for your Honour or your Worſhip: and what I am wont to ſpeake in ſport or ieſt the next day after I ſhall ſpeake in good ſerious earneſt. Therefore in writing I aſſume more vnwillingly much beaten arguments, for feare I handle them at others char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. All arguments are alike fertile to me. I take them vpon any trifle. And I pray God this were not vndertaken by the commandement of a minde as fleeting. Let me begin with that likes me beſt for all matters are linked one to another. But my conceit diſpleaſeth me, for ſomuch as it commonly produceth moſt fooliſh dotages from deepeſt ſtudies; and ſuch as content me on a ſuddaine, and when I leaſt looke for them; which as faſt fleete away, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at that inſtant ſome holde faſt. On horſe-backe, at the table, in my bed; but moſt on horſe-backe, where my ampleſt meditations and my fartheſt reaching conceites are. My ſpeach is ſomewhat nicely iealous of attention and ſilence; if I be in any earneſt talke, who interrupteth me, cuts me off. In travell, even the neceſſity of waies breakes off diſcourſes. Beſides that I moſt commonly travell without company, which is a great helpe for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſonings; whereby I have ſufficient leaſure to entertaine my ſelfe. I thereby have that ſucceſſe I have in dreames; In dreaming I commend them to my memory (for what I dream I doe it willingly) but the next morning, I can well call to minde what colour they were of, whether blith, ſad or ſtrange; but what in ſubſtance, the more I labour to finde out, the more I overwhelme them in oblivion. So of caſuall and vnpremeditated conceits that come into my braine, nought but a vaine image of them remaineth in my memory; ſo much onely, as ſufficeth vnprofitably to make me chafe, ſpight and fret in purſuite of them. Well then, leaving bookes aſide and ſpeaking more materially and ſimply; when all is done, I finde that <hi>love is nothing elſe but an inſatiate chirst of enioying a greedily deſired ſubiect.</hi> Nor <hi>Venus</hi> that good huſwife, other, then a tickling delight of emptying ones ſeminary veſſels: as is the pleaſure which nature giveth vs to diſcharge other parts: which becommeth faulty by immoderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defectiue by indiſcretion. To <hi>Socrates, loue is an appetite of generation by the mediation of beauty.</hi> Now conſidering oftentimes the rediculous tickling, or titilation of this pleaſure, the abſurd, giddy and hare-braind motions wherwith it toſſeth <hi>Zeno,</hi> and agitates <hi>Cratippus;</hi> that vnadviſed rage, that furious and with cruelty enflamed viſage in loues luſtfull and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt effects: and then a graue, ſterne, ſeuere ſurly countenance in ſo fond-fond an action, that one hath pell-mell lodged our ioyes and filthes together: and that the ſupremeſt voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe both raviſheth and plaineth, as doth ſorrow: I beleeve that which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaies to be true, that <hi>man was made by the Gods for them to toy and play withall.</hi>

We feed full well, and drinke like beaſtes; but they are not actions that hinder the offices of our minde. In thoſe, we hold good our aduantage ouer them; whereas this brings each other thought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſubiection, and by it's imperious authority make-brutiſh and dulleth all <hi>Platoes</hi> philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie and diuinity; and yet he complaines not of it. In al other things you may obſerue decorum and maintaine ſome decencie: all other operations admit ſome rules of honeſty: this cannot onely be imagined, but vicious or ridiculous. See whether for example ſake, you can but find a wiſe or diſcreete proceeding in it. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid, that he knew himſelfe mortall chiefly by this action, and by ſleeping: ſleepe doth ſtifle, and ſuppreſſeth the faculties of our ſoule; and that, both endeuoureth and diſſipates them. Surely it is an argument not onely of our originall corruption, but a badge of our vanity and deformity. On the one ſide nature vrgeth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; hauing thereunto combined, yea faſtned, the moſt noble, the moſt profitable, and the moſt ſenſually-pleaſing, of all her functions; and on the other ſuffereth vs to accuſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and to ſhunne it, as inſolent, as diſhoneſt and as lewder to bluſh at it, and allow, yea and to commend abſtinence. <hi>Are not we moſt brutiſh, to terme that worke beaſtly which begets, and which maketh vs?</hi> Moſt people haue concurred in diuers cerimonies of religion, as ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, luminaries, faſtings, incenſings, offrings; and amongſt others, in condemning of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All opinions agree in that, beſides the ſo farre extended vſe of circumciſion. Wee haue perad venture reaſon to blame our ſelues, for making ſo fooliſh a production as man, and to entitle both the deed and parts thereto belonging, ſhamful (mine are properly ſo at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant). The <hi>Eſſeniens,</hi> of whom <hi>Plinte</hi> ſpeaketh, maintained themſelues a long time without nurces, or ſwathling clothes, by the arriual of ſtrangers that came to their ſhoares, who ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their fond humor, did often viſit them. A whole nation hazarding rather to conſume, then engage themſelues to feminine embracements; and rather looſe the ſucceſſion of all men, then forge one. They report that <hi>Zeno</hi> neuer dealt with woman but once in all his life; which hee did for ciuilitie, leaſt he ſhould ouer obſtinately ſeeme to contemne the ſex. <hi>Each one auoideth to ſee a man borne, but all runne haſtily to ſee him dye.</hi> To deſtroy him wee ſeeke a ſpacious field and a full light; but to conſtruct him, we hide our ſelues in ſome darke corner, and worke as cloſe as we may. It is our dutie to conceale our ſelues in making him; it is our glory, and the orginall of many vertues to deſtroy him, being framed. The one is a manifeſt iniurie, the other a greater fauor; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that in a certaine phraſe where he was borne, to bonifie or benefit, was as much to ſay as to kill one. The Athenians, to equall the diſgrace of theſe two actions being to cleanſe the Ile of <hi>Delos,</hi> and iuſtifie themſelues vnto <hi>Apollo,</hi> forbad within that precinct all buriall and births. <hi>Noſtri noſmet poenitet, We are weary of our ſelues.</hi> There are ſome nations that when they are eating, they cover themſelues. I know a Lady (yea one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) who is of opinion that to chew is an vnſeemly thing, which much empaireth their grace<note place="margin">Ter.

And a man that cannot endure one ſhould ſee him eate; and ſhunneth all company more when he filleth, then when he emptieth himſelfe. In the Turkiſh Empire there are many, who to excell the reſt, will not be ſeene when they are feeding, and who make but one meale in a weeke: who mangle their face and cut their limmes; and who neuer ſpeake to any body; who thinke to honour their nature, by diſnaturing themſelues: oh fantaſticall people, that prize themſelues by their contempt, and mend their empairing.

It is no ſufficient teſtimonie of true affection: therein may lurke treaſon, as elſe-where: they ſometime goe but faintlie to worke, and as they ſay with one buttocke;</p>

And t'is ſaid to be a kinde of diſcourteſie, to refuſe it a gentleman. I have obſerued (for, <hi>ſo many houſes ſo many ſeuer all formes and orders</hi>) that ſuch Ladies as haue gone about to giue their waiting women, the moſt auſtere rules, have not had the beſt ſucceſſe. There is required more then ordinary moderation: a great part of their government muſt bee left to the conduct of their diſcretion: For, when all comes to all no diſcipline can bridle them in each point. True it is, that ſhee who eſcapeth ſafe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted from out the ſchoole of freedome, giveth more confidence of hirſelfe, then ſhee who commeth ſound out of the ſchoole of ſeveritie and reſtraint. Our forefathers framed their daughters countenances vnto ſhamefaſtneſſe and feare, (their inclinations and deſires alwaies alike) wee vnto aſſurance. We vnderſtand not the matter. That belongeth to the Sarmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wenches, who by their lawes may lie with noe man, except with their owne hands they have before killed another man in warre.

I loue gradation and prolonging, in the diſtribution of their fauours. <hi>Plato</hi> ſheweth, that in all kinds of love, facilitie and readineſſe is forbidden to defendants. T'is a trick of greedineſſe, which it behoueth them to cloake with their arte, ſo raſhly and fond-hardily to yeeld themſelues in groſſe. In their diſtributions of fauours, holding a regular and moderate courſe, they much better deceiue our deſires, and conceale theirs. Let them ever bee flying before vs: I meane euen thoſe that intend to bee ouertaken as the Scithians are wont, though they ſeeme to runne away, they beate vs more, and ſooner put vs to route. Verily according to the lawe which nature giueth them, it is not fit for them to will and deſire: their part is to beare, to obay and to conſent. Therefore hath nature beſtowed a perpetuall capacitie; on vs a ſeld and vncertaine abilitie. They haue
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:12117:254"/>
alwayes their houre, that they may euer be ready to let vs enter. And whereas ſhe hath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our appetites ſhould make apparant ſhew and declaration, ſhe cauſed theirs to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed and inward: and hath furniſhed them with parts vnfit for oſtentation; and onely for defence. Such prankes as this, we muſt leave to the Amazonian libertie. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great marching through <hi>Hircania, Thaleſtris</hi> Queen of the Amazones came to meet him with three hundred lances of her ſex, all well mounted and compleately armed; having left the reſidue of a great armie, that followed hir, beyond the neighbouring mountaines. And thus aloud, that all might heare ſhe beſpake him; That the farre-reſounding fame of his victories, and matchleſſe valour, had brought hir thither to ſee him, and to offer him hir meanes and forces, for the aduancing and furthering of his enterpriſes. And finding him ſo faire, ſo young and ſtrong, ſhe, who was perfectly accompliſhed in all his qualities, aduiſed him to ly with hir that ſo there might be borne of the moſt valiant woman in the world, and onely valiat man then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſome great and rare creature for poſteritie. <hi>Alexander</hi> thanked hir for the reſt; but to take leaſure for hir laſt demands accompliſhment, he ſtaide thirteene dayes in that place, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which, he reuelled with as much glee, and feaſted with as great iollitie as poſſibly could be deuiſed, in honour and fauour of ſo couragious a Princes. Wee are well-nigh-in all things parciall and corrupted Iudges of their action, as no doubt they are of ours. I allow of truth as well when it hurts me, as when it helpes me. It is a foule diſorder, that ſo often vrgeth them vnto change, and hinders them from ſetling their affection on any one ſubiect: as wee ſee in this Goddeſſe, to whom they impute ſo many changes and ſeverall friends. But withall <hi>it is againſt the nature of loue, not to be violent, and againſt the condition of violence, to be constant.</hi> And thoſe who wonder at it, exclaime againſt it, and in women ſearch for the cauſes of this infirmitie, as incredible and vnnatural: why ſee they not how often, without any amazement and exclaiming, themſelues are poſſeſſed and infected with it? I might happily ſeeme more ſtrange to find any conſtant ſtay in them. It is not a paſſion meerely corporeall. <hi>If no end be found in coueteouſneſſe, nor limit in ambition, aſſure your ſelfe there is nor end nor limit in letchery,</hi> It yet continueth after ſacietie: nor can any man preſcribe it or end or conſtant ſatisfaction: it ever goeth on beyond it's poſſeſſion, beyond it's bounds. And if conſtancie bee peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſome ſort more pardonable in them then in vs: They may readily alleage againſt vs, our ready inclination vnto day lie variety and new ware: And ſecondly alleage without vs, that they buy a pigge in a poake. <hi>Ione</hi> Queene of <hi>Naples</hi> cauſed <hi>Andreoſſe</hi> her firſt husband to be ſtrangled and hang'd out of the barres of his window, with a corde of Silke and golde wouen with her owne handes; becauſe in bed-buſineſſe ſhee found neither his members nor ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours anſwerable the hope ſhee had conceiued of him, by viewing his ſtature, beauty, youth, and diſpoſition, by which ſhe had formerly beene ſurpriſed and abuſed. That action hath in it more violence then paſſion: ſo that on their part at leaſt neceſſitie is ever prouided for: on our behalfe it may happen otherwiſe. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> by his lawes did very wiſely eſtabliſh, that before marriages the better to decide it's opportunity, competent Iudges might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to take view of yong men which pretended the ſame, al naked: and of maidens but to the waſte: in making triall of vs, they happily find vs not worthy their choiſe:</p>

But a caſuall touch, and that but in a ſhoulder, to enflame, to diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and to diſtract a minde, enfeebled, tamed and cooled through age; and of all humane mindes the moſt reformed. And why not I pray you? <hi>Socrates</hi> was but a man, and would neither bee nor ſeeme to bee other. Philoſophie contends not againſt naturall delights, ſo that due meaſure bee ioined therewith; and alloweth the moderation, not the ſhunning of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:12117:256"/>
them. The efforts of her reſiſtance are employed againſt ſtrange and baſtard or lawleſſe ones. She ſaith, that <hi>the bodyes appetites ought not to be encreaſed by the minde.</hi> And wittily aduiſeth vs, that we ſhould not excite our hunger by ſacietie; not to ſtuffe, inſteed of filling our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: to auoide all jouiſſance that may bring vs to want: and ſhunne all meat and drink, which may make vs hungry or thirſtie. As in the ſeruice of love, ſhe appoints vs to take an obiect, that onely may ſatisfie the bodies neede, without once moouing the mind: which is not there to have any doing, but onely to follow and ſimply to aſſiſt the body. But have I not reaſon to thinke, that theſe precepts, which (in mine opinion are elſewhere ſomewhat rigorous) haue reference vnto a body which doth his office; and that a dejected one, as a weakned ſtomacke may be excuſed if he cheriſh and ſuſtaine the ſame by arte, and by the entercouſe of fantazie, to reſtore it the deſires, the delights and blithneſſe, which of it ſelfe it hath loſt? May we not ſay, that there is nothing in vs, during this earthly priſon, ſimply corporall, or purely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall? and that iniuriouſlie we diſmember a living man? that there is reaſon wee ſhould carrie our ſelues in the vſe of pleaſure, at leaſt as fauourablie as we doe in the pangs of griefe? For example, it was vehement, even vnto perfection, in the ſoules of Saints, by repentance. The body had naturally a part therein, by the right of their combination, and yet might haue but little ſhare in the cauſe: and were not contented that it ſhould ſimply follow and aſſiſt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſoule: they haue tormented the body it ſelfe with conuenient and ſharpe puniſhments; to the end that one with the other, the body and the ſoule might a vie plunge man into ſorrow; ſo much the more ſaving, by how much the more ſmarting. In like caſe, in corporall pleaſures, is it not iniuſtice to quaile and coole the minde and, ſay, it muſt thereunto be entrained, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a forced bond, or ſervile neceſſitie? Shee ſhould rather hatch and cheriſh them, and offer and invite it ſelfe vnto them; the charge of ſwaying rightly belonging to her. Even as in my conceit, it is her part, in her proper delights, to inſpire and infuſe into the body all ſenſe or feeling which his condition may beare, and indevour that they may be both ſweet and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for him. For, as they ſay, tis good reaſon; that the body follow not his appetites to the mindes preiudice or dammage. But why is it not likewiſe reaſon, that the minde ſhould not follow hers to the bodies danger and hurt? I have no other paſſion that keepes mee in breath. What avarice, ambition, quarels, ſutes in law, or other contentions worke and effect in others, who as my ſelfe have no aſſigned vacation, or certaine leiſure, love would performe more commodiouſly: It would reſtore me the vigilancie, ſobrietie, grace and care of my perſon; and aſſure my countenance againſt the wrinckled frowns of age (thoſe deformed and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frownes) which elſe would blemiſh and deface the ſame; It would reduce me to ſerious, to ſound and wiſe ſtudies, whereby I might procure more love, and purchaſe more eſtimation: It would purge my minde from deſpaire of it ſelfe, and of its vſe, acquainting the ſame againe with it ſelfe: It would divert me from thouſands of irkſome tedious thoughts, and melancholie carking cares, wherewith the doting idleneſſe and crazed condition of our age doth charge and comber vs: It would reſtore and heat, though but in a dreame, the blood which nature forſaketh: It would vphold the drooping chinne, and ſomewhat ſtrengthen or lengthen the ſhrunken finewes, decaied vigour, and dulled lives-blitheneſſe of ſilly wretched man, who gallops apace to his ruine. But I am not ignorant how hard a matter it is to attaine to ſuch a commoditie: Through weakeneſſe and long experience, our taſte is growne more tender, more choiſe and more exquiſite. We challenge moſt, when we bring leaſt; we are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to chooſe, when we leaſt deſerve to be accepted: And knowing our ſelves to bee ſuch, we are leſſe hardy and more diſtruſtfull: Nothing can aſſure vs to be beloved, ſeeing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and their quality. I am aſhamed to be in the companie of this greene, blooming and boyling youth;</p>

                           <hi>the leſſe danger there is.</hi> Our people is to blame, to ſay, ſuch a one feareth death, when it would ſignifie, that he thinkes on it, and doth foreſee the ſame. Foreſight doth equally belong as well to that which concerneth vs in good, as touche vs in euill. <hi>To conſider and iudge danger, is in ſome ſort, not to bee danted at it.</hi> I doe not finde my ſelfe ſufficiently ſtrong to withſtand the blow and violence of this paſſion of feare, or of any other impetuoſity, were I once therewith vanquiſhed and deterred, I could never ſafely recouer my ſelfe. Hee that ſhould make my minde forgoe hir footing, could never bring her vnto her place againe. She doth ouer liuely ſound, and ouer deepely ſearch into hirſelfe: And therefore neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the wound which pierced the ſame, to be throughly cured and conſolidated. It hath beene happy for me: that no infirmity could euer yet diſplace her. I oppoſe and preſent my ſelfe in the beſt warde I have, againſt all charges and aſſaults that beſet mee. Thus the firſt that ſhould beare mee away, would make mee vnrecouerable. I encounter not two: which way ſoeuer ſpoile ſhould enter my holde, there am I open, and remedileſly drowned. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> ſaith, that a <hi>wiſe man can neuer paſſe from one ſtate to its contrary.</hi> I have ſome opinion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his ſentence, that <hi>hee who hath once beene a very foole, ſhall at no time prooue very wiſe.</hi> God ſends my colde anſwerable to my clothes, and paſſions anſwering the meanes I haue to indure them. Nature hauing diſcouered me on one ſide, hath couered me one the other. Hauing diſarmed me of ſtrength, ſhe hath armed me with inſenſibility, and a regular or ſoft apprehenſion. I cannot long endure (and leſſe could in my youth) to ride either in coach or litter, or to go in a boate; and both in the Citty and country I hate all manner of riding, but a horſe-back: And can leſſe endure a litter, then a coach, and by the ſame reaſon, more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily a rough agitation vpon the water, whence commonly proceedeth feare, then the ſoft ſtirring a man ſhall feele in calme weather. By the ſame eaſie gentle motion, which the oares giue, conuaying the boate vnder vs, I wot not how, I feele both my head intoxicated and my ſtomacke diſtempered: as I cannot likewiſe abide a ſhaking ſtoole vnder me. When as either the ſaile, or the gliding courſe of the water doth equally carry vs away, or that wee are but towed, that gently, gliding and euen agitation, doth no whit diſtemper or hurte mee. It is an interrupted and broken motion, that offendes mee; and more when it is lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing. I am not able to diſplaye it's forme. Phiſitions haue taught mee to binde and gird my ſelfe with a napkin or ſwath round about the lower part of my belly, as a remedy for this accident; which as yet I haue not tride, being accuſtomed to wreſtle and with ſtand ſuch defects as are in me; and tame them by my ſelfe. Were my memory ſufficientlye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of them, I would not thinke my time loſt, heere to ſet downe the infinite variety, which hiſtories preſent vnto vs, of the vſe of coaches in the ſeruice of warre: diuers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nations, and different according to the ages: to my ſeeming of great effect and neceſſitye. So that it is wondrouſlye ſtrange, how wee haue loſt all true knowledge of them; I will onely aleadge this, that euen lately in our fathers time, the Hungarians did very auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bring them into faſhion, and profitablie ſet them a worke againſt the Turkes; euery one of them containing a Targattier and a Muskettier, with a certaine number of harquebuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They made the front of their battaile with three thouſand ſuch coaches: and after the Cannon had playde, cauſed them to diſcharge and ſhoote off volie of ſmale ſhotte vppon their enemies, before they ſhoulde know or feele, what the reſt of their forces could doe: which was no ſmale aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement; or if not this, they mainely droue thoſe coaches amidde the thickeſt of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſquadrons, with purpoſe to breake, diſroute and make waye through them. Beſides the benefit and helpe they might make of them, in any ſuſpicious or dangerous place, to flanke their troupes marching from place to place: or in haſt to encompaſſe, to embarrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, to couer or fortifie any lodgement or quarter. In my time, a gentleman of quality, in one of our frontieres, vnwealdy and ſo burly of bodye, that hee coulde finde no horſe able to beare his waight, and hauing a quarrell or deadly fude in hand, was wont to trauaile vp and downe in a coach made after this faſhion, and found much eaſe and good in it. But leaue wee theſe warlike coaches, as if their nullity were not ſufficiently knowne by better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens; The laſtkings of our firſt race were wont to trauell in chariors drawne by foure oxen. <hi>Marke Antonie</hi> was the firſt, that cauſed himſelfe, accompanied with a minſterell harlot to bee drawne by Lyons fitted to a coach. So did <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> after him, naming himſelfe <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele</hi>

the mother of the Gods; and alſo by Tigers, counterfetting God <hi>Bacchus:</hi> who ſometimes would alſo bee drawne in a coach by two Stagges: and an-other time by foure maſtiue Dogs: and by foure naked wenches, cauſing himſelfe to bee drawne by them in pompe and ſtate, hee being all naked. The emperour <hi>Firmus,</hi> made his coach to bee drawne by Eſtriges of exceeding greatneſſe, ſo that hee rather ſeemed to flye, then to roule on wheeles. The ſtrangeneſſe of theſe inuentions, doth bring this other thing vnto my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie. That it is a kinde of puſilanimity in Monarkes, and a teſtimony that they doe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently know what they are, when they labour to ſhew their worth, and endeuour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto the world, by exceſſiue and intolerable expences. A thing, which in a ſtrange country might ſomewhat bee excuſed; but amongſt his natiue ſubiects, where hee ſwayeth all in all, hee draweth from his dignity the extreameſt degree of honour, that hee may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attaine vnto. As for a gentleman, in his owne priuate houſe to apparrell himſelfe rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and curiouſly, I deeme it a matter vaine and ſuperfluous; his houſe, his houſhold, his traine and his kitchin doe ſufficiently anſwere for him. The counſell which <hi>Iſocrates</hi> giueth to his King (in my conceite) ſeemeth to carry ſome reaſon: when hee willeth him to bee richly-ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſtately adorned with mooueables and houſholde-ſtuffe, forſomuch as it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of continuance, and which deſcendeth euen to his poſterity or heires: And to auoyde all magnificences, which preſently vaniſh both from cuſtome and memory. I loued when I was a yonger brother to ſet my ſelfe foorth and bee gaye in cloathes, though I wanted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries; and it became mee well: There are ſome on whoſe backes their ritch Robes weepe, or as wee ſay their rich cloathes are lyned with heauye debts. We haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſtrange tales of our auncient Kings frugalitie about their owne perſons, and in their gifts: great and farre renouned Kings both in credit, in valour and in fortune. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> mainely combates the law of his Cittie, who aſſigned their publique money to be imployed about the ſtately ſetting forth of their playes and feaſtes: He willeth that their magnificence ſhould bee ſeene in the quantity of tall ſhips well manned and appointed, and armies well furniſhed. And they haue reaſon to accuſe <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> who in his booke of riches eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a contrarie opinion, and vpholdeth ſuch a quality of expences, to be the true friute of wealth and plenty. They are pleaſures (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) that onely touch the vulgar and baſeſt communalty, which as ſoone as a man is ſatisfied with them, vaniſh out of minde; and whereof no man of ſound judgement of gravity can make any eſteeme. The imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, as more profitable, juſt and durable would ſeeme more royall, worthy and commendable, about portes, heauens, fortifications and walles; in ſumptuous buildings, in churches, hoſpitales, colledges, mending of heighwayes and ſtreetes, and ſuch like monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: in which things Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth ſhall leaue aye-laſting and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble memory vnto his name: and wherein our Queene <hi>Catherin</hi> ſhould witnes vnto ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages her naturall liberality and exceeding bounty, if her meanes were anſwarable to her affection. Fortune hath much ſpighted mee to hinder the ſtructure and brake-off the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our new-bridge in our great Citty; and before my death to depriue mee of all hope to ſee the great neceſſity of it ſet forwarde againe. Moreouer, it appeareth vnto ſubjects, ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of theſe triumphs, that they haue a ſhow made them of their owne riches, and that they are feaſted at their proper charges: For, the people doe eaſily preſume of their kings, as wee doe of our ſeruants; that they ſhould take care plenteouſly to provide vs of whatſoeuer wee ſtand in neede of, but that on their behalfe they ſhould no way lay handes on it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor <hi>Galba,</hi> ſitting at ſupper, hauing taken pleaſure to heare a muſicion play and ſing before him, ſent for his casket, out of which he tooke a handful of Crowns and put them into his hand, with theſe wordes; <hi>Take this, not as a guift of the publique money, but of mine owne priuate ſtore.</hi> So is it, that it often commeth to paſſe, that the common people haue reaſon to grudge, and that their eyes are fedde, with that which he ſhould feede their belly. Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it ſelfe, in a ſoueraigne hand is not in her owne luſter: priuate men haue more right, and may challenge more intereſt in her. For, taking the matter exactlye as it is, <hi>a King hath nothing that is properlye his owne; hee oweth euen himſelfe to others. Authority is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in fauour of the authoriſing, but rather in fauour of the authoriſed. A ſuperiour is neuer created for his owne profit, but rather for the benefit of the inferiour: And a Phiſition is inſtituted for the ſicke, not for himſelfe. All Magiſtracie, euen as each arte, reiecteth her end out of her ſelfe. Nulla ars in ſe verſatur. No arte is all in it ſelfe.</hi> Wherefore the gouernours and

                        <p>Why did not ſo glorious a conqueſt happen vnder <hi>Alexander,</hi> or during the time of the ancient Greekes and Romanes? or why befell not ſo great a change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Empires and people, vnder ſuch handes as would gently haue poliſhed, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and incivilized, what in them they deemed to be barbarous and rude: or would haue nouriſhed and foſtered thoſe good ſeedes, which nature had there brought foorth: adding not onely to the manuring of their grounds and ornaments of their citties ſuch artes as wee had; and that no further then had beene neceſſary for them, but therewithall ioy ning vnto the originall vertues of the country, thoſe of the ancient Grecians and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes? What reputation and what reformation would all that farre-ſpredding worlde haue found, if the examples, demeanors and pollicies, wherewith wee firſt preſented them, had called and allured thoſe vncorrupted nations, to the admiration and imitation of vertue, and had eſtabliſhed betweene them and vs a brotherly ſociety and mutuall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencie? How eaſie a matter had it beene, profitably to reforme, and chriſtianly to inſtruct, mindes yet ſo pure and new, ſo willing to bee taught, beeing for the moſt part endowed with ſo docile, ſo apt and ſo yeelding naturall beginnings? whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, wee have made vſe of their ignorance and inexperience, drawe them more eaſily vnto treaſon, fraude, luxurie, auarice and all manner of inhumanitie and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the example of our life, and patterne of our cuſtomes. Who ever raiſed the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of marchandize and benefit of trafficke to ſo high a rate? So many goodly cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ranſacked and razed; ſo many nations deſtroyed and made deſolate; ſo infinite millions of harmeleſſe people of all ſexes, ſtates and ages, maſſacred, ravaged and put to the ſworde; and the richeſt, the fayreſt and the beſt part of the world topſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turuied, ruined and defaced for the trafficke of Pearles and Pepper: Oh mecanicall victoryes, oh baſe conqueſt. Never did blinde ambition, never did greedy revenge, publike wrongs or generall enmities, ſo moodily enrage, and ſo paſſionately incenſe men againſt men, vnto ſo horrible hoſtilities, bloody diſſipation, and miſerable calamities.</p>
                        <p>Certaine Spaniardes coaſting alongſt the Sea in ſearch of mines, fortued to land in a very fertile, pleaſant and well peopled country: vnto the inhabitants whereof they declared their intent, and ſhewed their accuſtomed perſwaſions; ſaying: That they were quiet and well meaning-men, comming from farre-countries, being ſent from the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the greateſt king of the habitable earth, vnto whom the Pope, repreſenting God on earth, had given the principalitie of all the <hi>Indies.</hi> That if they would become tributaries to him, they ſhould bee moſt kindly vſed aud courteouſly entreated: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them victualles for their nouriſhment; and ſome golde for the behoofe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Phyſicall experiments. Moreover, they declared vnto them, the beleeuing in one
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:12117:262"/>
onely God, and the trueth of our religion, which they perſwaded them to embrace, adding thereto ſome minatorie threates. Whoſe anſwer was this: That <hi>happily they might be quiet and well-meaning, but their countenance ſhewed them to be otherwiſe: As concerning their King, ſince he ſeemed to begge, he ſhewed to be poore and needie: And for the Pope, who had made that diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he expreſſed himſelfe a man louing diſſention, in going about to give vnto a third man, a thing which was not his owne: ſo to make it queſtionable and litigious amongst the auncient poſſeſſors of it. As for victualles, they ſhould haue part of their ſtore: And for golde, they had but little, and that it was a thing they made very ſmall accoumpt of, as meerely vnprofitable for the ſeruice of their life, whereas all their care was but how to paſſe it happily and pleaſantly: and therefore, what quantity ſoever they ſhould finde, that onely excepted which was employed about the ſeruice of their Gods, they might bouldly take it. As touching one onely God, the diſcourſe of him had very well pleaſed them: but they would by no meanes change their religion, vnder which they had for ſo long time liued ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily: and that they were not accuſtomed to take any counſell, but of their friendes and acquaintance. As concerning their menaces, it was a ſigne of want of iudgement, to threaten thoſe, whoſe nature, condition, power and meanes was to them vnknowne. And therefore they ſhould with all ſpeed haſten to auoyd their dominions, forſomuch as they were wont to admit or take in good part the kindeneſſes and remonſtrances of armed people, namely of ſtrangers, otherwiſe they would deale with them, as they had done with ſuch others, ſhewing them the heads of certaine men ſticking vpon ſtakes about their Cittie, which had lately beene executed.</hi> Loe here an example of the ſtammering of this infancy.</p>
                        <p>But ſo it is, neither in this, nor in infinite other places, where the Spaniards found not the marchandiſe they ſought for, neither made ſtay or attempted any violence, whatſoeuer other commodity the place yeelded: witneſſe my Canibales. Of two the moſt mighty and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarkes of that world, and peraduenture of all our Weſterne partes, Kings ouer ſo many Kings: the laſt they depoſed and ouercame: He of <hi>Peru,</hi> hauing by them beene taken in a battell, and ſet at ſo exceſſiue a ranſome, that it exceedeth all beliefe, and that truely paide: and by his conuerſation hauing giuen them apparant ſignes of a free, liberall, vndant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſtant courage, and declared to be of a pure, noble, and well compoſed vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a humour poſſeſſed the conquerors, after they had moſt inſolently exacted from him a Million, three hundred fiue and twenty thouſand, and fiue hundred waights of golde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſiluer and other precious things, which amounted to no leſſe a ſumme (ſo that their horſes were all ſhood of maſſive golde) to diſcouer what diſloyalty or treachery ſoever it might coſt them) what the remainder of this kings treaſure might be, and without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enioy what euer he might haue hidden or concealed from them. Which to compaſſe, they forged a falſe accuſation and proofe againſt him; That he practiſed to raiſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, and intended to induce his ſubiects to ſome inſurrection, ſo to procure his liberty. Whereupon, by the very iudgement of thoſe who had complotted this forgery and treaſon againſt him, hee was condemned to be publikely hanged and ſtrangled: hauing firſt made him to redeeme the torment of being burned aliue, by the baptiſme which at the inſtant of his execution in charity they beſtowed vpon him. A horrible and the like neuer heard of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident: which nevertheleſſe he vndiſmayedly endured with an vnmooued manner, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-royall grauity, without euer contradicting himſelfe eyther in countenance or ſpeech. And then, ſomewhat to mittigate and circumvent thoſe ſilly vnſuſpecting people amazed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at ſo ſtrange a ſpectacle, they counterfetted a great mourning and lamentation for his death and appointed his funeralls to be ſolemnly and ſumptuouſly celebrated.</p>
                        <p>The other King of <hi>Mexico,</hi> having a long time manfully defended his beſieged Citie, and in that tedious ſiege, ſhewed what ever pinching-ſufferance and reſolute-perſeverance can effect, if ever any courageous Prince or warre-like people ſhewed the ſame; and his diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſucceſſe having delivered him alive into his enemies hands, vpon conditions to bee vſed as beſeemed a King: who during the time of his impriſoment, did neuer make the leaſt ſhew of any thing vnworthy that glorious title.

outrages, that contrary to all law of nations, and againſt their ſolemne vowes and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they condemned the King himſelfe and one of the chiefeſt Princes of his Court, to the Racke, one in preſence of another: The Prince, environed round with hot burning coales, being ouercome with the exceeding torment, at laſt in moſt pittious ſort turning his dreary eyes toward his Maſter, as if hee asked mercy of him for that hee could endure no longer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The king fixing rigorouſly and fiercely his lookes vpon him, ſeeming to vpbraide him with his remiſneſſe and puſilanimity, with a ſterne and ſetled voyce vttered theſe few wordes vnto him; <hi>What? ſuppoſeſt thou I am in a colde bath? am I at more eaſe then thou art?</hi> Where at the ſilly wretch immediately fainted vnder the torture, and yeelded vp the ghoſt. The king halfe roſted, was carryed away: Not ſo much for pitty (for what ruth could euer enter ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mindes, who vpon the ſurmiſed information of ſome odde peece or veſſell of golde, they intended to get, would broyle a man before their eyes, and not a man onely, but a king, ſo great in fortune and ſo renouned in deſert?) but forſomuch as his vnmatched conſtancie did more and more make their inhumane cruelty aſhamed: They afterward hanged him, becauſe he had couragiouſly attempted by armes to deliuer himſelfe out of ſo long captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and miſerable ſubiection; where he end ed his wretched life, worthy an high minded and neuer danted Prince. At another time, in one ſame fire, they cauſed to be burned all aliue foure hundred common men, and three ſcore principall Lordes of a prouince, whom by the fortune of warre they had taken priſoners. Theſe narrations we have out of their owne bookes: for they doe not onely auouche, but vauntingly publiſh them. <hi>May it be, they doe it for a teſtimony of their iuſtice or zeale toward their religion?</hi> verily they are wayes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and enemies to ſo ſacred an ende. Had they propoſed vnto themſelues to enlarge and propagate our religion, they would haue conſidered, that it is not amplified by poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of landes, but of men: and would have beene ſatisfied with ſuch ſlaughters, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of warre bringeth, without indifferently adding therevnto ſo bloody a butchery, as vpon ſavage beaſtes; and ſo vniverſall as fire or ſword could ever attaine vnto; having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely preſerued no more then ſo many miſerable bond ſlaues, as they deemed might ſuffice for the digging, working and ſeruice of their mines: So that diuers of their chieftaines have beene executed to death, even in the places they had conquered, by the appointment of the Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> iuſtly offended at the ſeld-ſeene horror of their barbarous demeanours, and well nigh all diſeſteemed, contemned and hated. God hath meritoriouſly permitted, that many of their great pillages, and ill gotten goods, have eyther beene ſwallowed vp by the revenging Seas in tranſporting them, or conſumed by the inteſtine warres and ciuill broyles, wherewith themſelues have devoured one another; and the greateſt part of them have beene ouer-whelmed and buryed in the bowels of the earth, in the very places they found them, without any fruite of their victory. Touching the obiection which ſome make, that the receipte, namely in the handes of ſo thrifty, wary and wiſe a Prince, doth ſo little anſwer the fore-conceaved hope, which was given vnto his predeceſſors and the ſaid former aboundance of riches, they mette withall at the firſt diſcovery of this new-found world, (for although they bring home great quantitye of gold and ſiluer, we perceiue the ſame to be nothing, in reſpect of what might bee expected thence) it may bee anſwered, that the vſe of mony was there altogether vnknowne; and conſequently, that all their golde was gathered together, ſeruing to no other purpoſe, then for ſhew, ſtate and ornament, as a mooveable reſerued from father to ſonne by many puiſſant Kings, who exhauſted all their mines; to collect ſo huge a heape of veſſels and ſtatues for the ornament of their Temples, and embelliſhing of their Pallaces: whereas all our golde employed in commerce and trafficke betweene man and man. Wee mince and alter it into a thouſand formes: wee ſpend, wee ſcatter and diſperce the ſame to ſeverall vſes. Suppoſe our Kings ſhould thus gather and heape vp all the golde they might for many ages hoarde vp together, and keepe it cloſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch't. Thoſe of the kingdome of <hi>Mexico</hi> were ſomewhat more encivilized, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter artiſtes, then other nations of that worlde. And as wee doe, ſo judged they, that this Vniuers was neare his end: and tooke the deſolation wee brought amongſt them as an infallible ſigne of it. They beleeued the ſtate of the worlde, to bee divided into fiue ages, and in the life of fiue ſucceeding Sunnes, whereof foure had already ended their courſe or time; and the ſame which now ſhined vpon them, was the fifth and laſt. The firſt periſhed together with all other creatures, by an vniverſall inundation of waters. The

ſecond by the fall of the heavens vpon vs which ſtifled and ouerwhelmed euery living thing: in which age they affirme the Giants to haue beene, and ſhewed the Spaniards certaine bones of them, according to whoſe proportion the ſtature of men came to bee of the height of twenty handfuls. The third, was conſumed by a violent fire, which burned and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all. The fourth by a whirling emotion of the ayre and windes, which with the violent fury of it ſelfe, remooued and ouerthrew diuers high mountaines: ſaying, that men dyed not of it, but were tranſformed into Munkeis. (<hi>Oh what impreſſions doth not the weakeneſſe of mans beliefe admit?</hi>) After the conſummation of this fourth Sunne, the world continued fiue and twenty yeares in perpetuall darkeneſſe: in the fifteenth of which one man and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were created, who renewed the race of man-kinde. Ten yeares after, vpon a certaine day, the Sunne appeared as newly created: from which day beginneth euer ſince the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their yeares. On the third day of whoſe creation, died their ancient Gods, their new ones haue day by day beene borne ſince. In what manner this laſt Sunne ſhall periſh, my aucthor could not learne of them. But their number of this fourth change, doth iumpe and meete with that great coniunction of the Starres, which eight hundred and odde yeares ſince, according to the Aſtrologians ſuppoſition, produced diuers great alterations and ſtrange novelties in the world. Concerning the proud pompe and glorious magnificence, by occaſion of which I am fallen into this diſcourſe, nor <hi>Greece,</hi> nor <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Aegipt,</hi> can (bee it in profit, or difficultie or nobility) equall or compare ſundrie and diuers of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. The cawcy or high-way which is yet to bee ſeene in <hi>Peru,</hi> errected by the Kings of that countrie, ſtretching from the citty of <hi>Quito,</hi> vnto that of <hi>Cuſco</hi> (containing three hundred leagues in length) ſtraight, euen, and fine, and twentie paces in breadth, curiouſly paved, rayſed on both ſides with goodly, high maſonrie-walles, all along which, on the inner ſide there are two continuall running ſtreames, pleaſantly beſet with beautious trees, which they call <hi>Moly.</hi> In framing of which, where they mette any mountaines or rockes, they haue cut, raiſed and leuelled them, and filled all hollow places with lime and ſtone. At the ende of euery dayes journey, as ſtations, there are built ſtately great pallaces, plentiouſly ſtored with all manner of good victuals, apparrell and armes, as well for daylie way-fairing men, as for ſuch armies that might happen to paſſe that way. In the eſtimation of which worke I haue eſpecially conſidered the difficulty, which in that place is particvlarly to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. For they built with no ſtones that were leſſe then ten foote ſquare: They had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to cary or tranſport them, then by meere ſtrength of armes to draw and dragge the carriage they needed: they had not ſo much as the arte to make ſcaffolds; nor knew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuiſe, then to raiſe ſo much earth or rubiſh, againſt their building, according as the worke riſeth, and afterwarde to take it a way againe. But returne we to our coaches. In ſteade of them, and of all other carrying beaſtes they cauſed themſelues to be carryed by men, and vpon their ſhoulders. This laſt King of <hi>Peru,</hi> the ſame day hee was taken, was thus carried vpon rafters or beames of maſſiue Golde, ſitting in a faire chaire of ſtate, likewiſe all of golde, in the middle of his battaile. Looke how may of his porters as were ſlaine, to make him fall (for all their endeuour was to take him aliue) ſo many others, and as it were auye, tooke and vnder-went preſently the place of the dead: ſo that he could never be brought down or made to fall, what ſlaughter ſo ever was made of thoſe kinde of people, vntill ſuch time as a horſeman furiouſly ranne to take him by ſome parte of his body, and ſo pulled him to the ground.</p>

I have as much to wiſh for as another, and leave my wiſhes as much liberty and indiſcretion: but yet, it never came into my minde, to wiſh for Empire, for royalty or eminency of high and commanding fortunes. I aime not that way: I love my ſelfe too well. When I thinke to grow, it is but meanely; with a forced and coward aduancement; fit for me: yea in reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in wiſedome, in health, in beauty and alſo in riches. But this credite, this aſpiring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, this overſwaying authority, ſuppreſſeth my imagination.

And have ſhewed by the conduct of my life and courſe of my enterpriſes, that I have rather ſought to avoid, then otherwiſe to embrace beyond the degree of fortune that at my birth it pleaſed God to call me vnto. <hi>Each naturall conſtitution, is equally iuſt and eaſie.</hi> My minde is ſo dull and ſlowe, that I meaſure not good fortune according to her height, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to her facility.

That to this I cannot attaine but by veneration; and to the other I would willingly attaine by cuſtome. But returne we to our temporall greatneſſe, whence we have digreſſed.

Superioritie and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie, maiſtrie and ſubiection, are joyntly tied vnto a naturall kinde of enuie and conteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they muſt perpetually enter-ſpoile one another. I beleeue neither the one nor the other, concerning hir companions rights: let vs ſuffer reaſon to ſpeake of it, which is inflexible and impaſſible, when or how wee ſhall make an end. I was not long ſince reading of two Scottiſh bookes ſtriuing vpon this ſubiect. The popular makes the King to bee of worſe condition then a Carter: and hee that extolleth Monarchie, placeth him both in power and ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many ſteps aboue the Gods. Now the incommoditie of greatneſſe, which heere I have vndertaken to note and ſpeake of, (vpon ſome occaſion lately befalne mee) is this. There is peraduenture nothing more pleaſing to the commerce of men, then the <hi>Eſſayes,</hi> which wee through iealouſie of honour or valour, make one againſt another, bee it in the exerciſe of the body or of the minde: wherein ſoueraigne greatneſſe, hath no true or eſſentiall part. Verily, it hath often ſeemed vnto mee, that through over much reſpect, Princes are therein vſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefully and treated iniuriouſhe: For, the thing whereat (in my youth) I was infinitely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, was, that thoſe which were trained and ſchooled with mee, ſhould for beare to doe it in good earneſt, becauſe they found mee vnworthy to bee withſtood or to reſiſt their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. It is that wee dayly ſee to happen vnto them; euery man finding himſelfe vnworthy to force himſelfe againſt them. If one perceive them never ſo little affected to have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, there is none but will ſtriue to yeelde it them, and that will not rather wrong his glory, then offend theirs: No man imployeth more diligence then needes hee muſt to ſerue their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. What ſhare haue Princes in the throng, where all are for them? Mee thinkes I ſee thoſe <hi>Paladines</hi> of former ages, preſenting themſelues in iouſtes, tiltings and combates, with bodies and armes enchanted. <hi>Briſſon</hi> running againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> counterfetted his courſe: <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> chid him for it: but hee ſhould haue cauſed him to bee whipt. For this conſideration, was <hi>Carneades</hi> wont to ſay, that <hi>Prince children learn't nothing aright but to mannage and ride horſes; for ſomuch as in all other exerciſes, euery manyeeldeth, and giueth them the victory: but a horſe who is neither a flatterer nor a Courtier, will as ſoone throw the childe of a king as the ſonne of a baſe porter. Homer</hi> hath beene forced to conſent that <hi>Venus</hi> (ſo ſweete a ſaint and delicate a Goddeſſe) ſhould be hurt at the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> thereby to aſcribe courage and hardineſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her qualities neuer ſeene in thoſe that are exempted from danger. The Gods themſelues are fained to bee angry, to feare, to bee jealous, to greeue, to ſhew paſſion, and bee ſubiect to mortall ſence, thereby to honour them with the vertues which Poets deuiſe and Philoſophers inuent amongſt vs: Nay, they are ſuppoſed to runne away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to haue a feeling of all our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. <hi>Who doth not participate both hazard and difficulties, cannot iuſtly pretend intereſt in the honour, or challenge ſhare in the pleaſure, that followeth dangerous actions or hazardous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps.</hi> It is pitty a man ſhould bee ſo powerfull, that all things muſt yeeld and giue place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Such as are in ſo high eminencie of greatneſſe, their fortune reiects ſociety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation too farre from them; ſhee placeth them in over remote and vncouth places. This eaſefull life and plauſible facilitie to bring all vnder, and ſubiect mens mindes, is an enemy to all manner of pleaſure. It is a kinde of ſliding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not a going<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is to ſleepe, and not to liue. Conceaue man accompanied with omnipotencie, you ouerwhelme him: hee muſt in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging manner craue ſome empeachment and reſiſtance of you. His beeing and his good, is in want and indigence. Their good qualities are dead and loſt: for, they are not heard but by compariſon, and they are excluded: they haue little knowledge of true praiſe, beeing bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſo continuall and vniforme an approbation. Have they to doe with the ſimpleſt of their ſubiects? thy haue no meane to take aduantage of him, if hee but ſay; It is becauſe hee is my King, hee ſuppoſeth to haue ſufficiently expreſſed, and you muſt vnderſtand, that in ſo ſaying, hee hath lent a helping hand to ouerthrow himſelfe. This qualitie ſuppreſſeth and conſumeth all other true and eſſentiall qualities: they are euen drowned in the Royaltie; which gives them no leave, to make the offices of their charge to preuaile, except in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as directly concerne and ſtead the ſame. <hi>To be a King, is a matter of that conſequence,</hi>
                           <pb n="518" facs="tcp:12117:265"/>
                           <hi>that onely by it he is ſo.</hi> That ſtrange glimmering and eye-dazeling light, which round about enuironeth, overcaſteth and hideth him from vs: our weake ſight is thereby bleared and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, as being filled and obſcured by that greater and further-ſpredding brightnes. The Senate allotted the honor and priſe of eloquence vnto <hi>Tiberius;</hi> he refuſed it, ſuppoſing that if it had beene true, he could not revenge himſelfe of ſo limited and partiall iudgement. As we yeeld Princes all aduantages of honor, ſo we aucthorize their defects and ſooth-vp their vices: not onely by approbation, but alſo by imitation. All <hi>Alexanders</hi> followers bare their heads ſideling, as he did. And ſuch as flattered <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> in his owne preſence did run and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle one another, and either ſtumbled at, or over-threw what euer ſtood before their feete, to inferre; that they were as ſhort-ſighted or ſpur-blinde, as hee was. Naturall imperfections haue ſometimes ſerued for commendation and fauour. Nay I haue ſeene deafneſle affected. And becauſe the maiſter hated his wife, <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath ſeen courtiers to ſue a diuorce of theirs, whom they loued very well. And which is more paillardiſe and all maner of diſſolution hath thereby beene held in credit; as alſo diſloyaltie, blaſphemy, cruelty, hereſie, ſuperſtition, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, wantonneſſe and worſe, if worſe may be. Yea by an example more dangerous, then that of <hi>Mithridates</hi> his flatterers, who forſomuch as their maiſter pretended to haue skill in phiſicke, and aſpired to the honour of a good Phyſition, came to him to haue their members incized and cauterized. For, theſe others ſuffer to haue their ſoules cauterized; a much more precious and nobler part then the body. But to end where I began: <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with <hi>Fauorinus</hi> the Philoſopher about the interpretation of ſome word; <hi>Fauorinus</hi> did ſoone yeeld the victory vnto him, his friends finding fault with him for it; you but jeſt, my maiſters (quoth hee) <hi>would you not haue him to bee much wiſer then I, who hath the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command ouer thirty legions? Auguſtus</hi> writ ſome verſes againſt <hi>Aſinius Pollio,</hi> which <hi>Pollio</hi> hearing, he ſaid, I will hould my peace; for, <hi>it is no wiſedome to contend in writing with him, who may proſcribe.</hi> And they had reaſon: For, <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> becauſe he could not equall <hi>Philoxenus</hi> in Poeſie, nor match <hi>Plato</hi> in diſcourſe, condemned the one to the ſtone-quaries, and ſent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſould as a ſlave in the Ile of <hi>Aegina.</hi>

The horror of cruelty drawes me neerer vnto clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then any patterne of clemencie can poſſibly win mee. A cunning rider or skilfull horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth not ſo properly teach mee, to ſit well on horſe-backe, as doth one of our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, or a Venetian by ſeeing him ride. And an ill manner of ſpeech doth better reforme mine, then any well-poliſhed forme of ſpeaking. The ſottiſh countenance of another, doth dayly advertiſe and forewarne me. That which pricketh, toucheth and rouzeth better, then that which delighteth. Theſe times are fit to reforme vs backward, more by diſſenting, then by conſenting; more by difference then by accord. Being but little inſtructed by good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I make vſe of bad: the leſſon of which is ordinary. I haue endeuoured, nay I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to yeeld my ſelfe as pleaſing and affable, as I ſaw others peeviſh and froward: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as I ſaw others variable; as gentle and milde, as I perceived others intractable and wild: and as good and honeſt, as I diſcerned others wicked and diſhoneſt. But I propoſed certaine invincible meaſures vnto my ſelfe. The moſt fruitful and natural exerciſe of our ſpirit, is, in my ſelfe-plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The vſe whereof, I finde to bee more delightſome, then any other action of our life: And that's the reaſon, why, if I were now forced to chooſe, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the minde I now am in) I would rather yeeld to looſe my ſight, then fogoe my hearing or my ſpeech. The Athenians and alſo the Romans, did ever hold this exerciſe in high honor and reputation, namely in their <hi>Academies.</hi> And at this day, the Italians doe yet keepe a kinde of forme and trace of it, to their great profit, as may apparantly bee diſcerned by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their wits vnto ours. The ſtudy and plodding on bookes, is a languiſhing and weake kinde of motion, and which heateth or earneſteth nothing; whereas conference doth both learne, teach and exerciſe at once.

Ielouſie, glory and contention, driue, caſt and raiſe me aboue my ſelfe. And an vniſon or conſent, is a qualitie altogether te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and weariſome in conference. But as our minde is fortified by the communication of regular and vigorous ſpirits; it cannot well be expreſſed, how much it looſeth and is baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized, by the continuall commerce and frequentation, we have with baſe, weake and dull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. No contagion ſpreds it ſelfe further then that. I know by long experience what an ell of it is worth. I love to conteſt and diſcourſe, but not with many, and only for my ſelfe. For, to ſerue as a ſpectacle vnto great men, and by way of contention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one to make a glorious ſhew of his ready wit and running tongue; I deeme it a profeſſion farre vnfitting a man of honor. Sottiſhnes is an ill quality, but not to be able to endure it, and to fret and vex at it, as it hapneth to me, is another kinde of imperfection, which in opportunity is not much behinde ſottiſhnes: and that's it I will now accuſe in my ſelfe: I doe with great liberty and facilitie, enter into conference and diſputation: forſomuch as opinion findes but a hard ſoile to enter and take any deepe roote in me. No propoſitions amaze me, no conceit woundeth me, what contrarietie ſoever they have to mine. There is no fantazie ſo frivolous or humour ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, that in mine opinion is not ſortable to the production, of humane wit. We others, who debarre our judgement of the right to make concluſions, regard but negligently the diuerſe opinions: and if wee lend it not our judgement, wee eaſily affoord it our eares. Where one ſcale of the ballance is altogether empty. I let the other waver too and fro, vnder an old wiues dreames. And me ſeemeth, I may well be excuſed, if I rather accept an odde number, then an even: Thurſday in reſpect of Friday, if I had rather make a twelfth or fourteenth at a table, then a thirteenth: if when I am trauelling I would rather ſee a Hare coaſting, then croſſing my way: and rather reach my left, then my right foote, to be ſhod. All ſuch fond conceits, now in credit about vs, deſerue at feaſt to be liſtned vnto. As for me, they only beare away inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſurely they do ſo. Vulgar and caſuall opinions are yet of ſome waight, which in nature are ſomthing els then nothing. And who wadeth not ſo far into them, to auoide the vice of ſuperſtition, falleth happily into the blame of wilfulneſſe. The contradictions then of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:12117:266"/>
doe neither offend nor moove, but awaken and exerciſe me. Wee commonly ſhunne correction whereas we ſhould rather ſeeke and preſent our ſelves vnto it, chiefly when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the way of conference, and not of regency. At every oppoſition, wee conſider not whether it be iuſt; but be it right or wrong, how we may avoide it: In ſteede of reaching our armes, we ſtretch forth our clawes vnto it. I ſhould endure to be rudely handled and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my friends, though they ſhould call me foole, coxcombe or ſay I raved. I love a man that doth ſtoutly expreſſe himſelfe, amongſt honeſt and worthy men and whoſe wordes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his thoughts. We ſhould fortifie and harden our hearing, againſt the tenderneſſe of the cerimonious ſound of wordes. I love a friendly ſociety and a virile and conſtant familiarity: An amitie, which in the earneſtneſſe and vigor of it's commerce, flattereth it ſelfe: as love in bitings and bloody ſcratchings. It is not ſufficiently generous or vigorous, except it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and quarelous: If ſhe be civiliſed and a skilfull artiſte: if it feare a ſhocke or free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and have hir ſtarting hoales or forced by-wayes. <hi>Neque enim diſputari ſine repreher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione poteſt. Diſputation cannot be held without reprehenſion.</hi> When I am impugned or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, then is mine attention and not mine anger, ſtirred vp; I advance my ſelfe toward him, that doth gaineſay and inſtruct me. <hi>The cauſe of truth, ought to be the common cauſe, both to one and other:</hi> What can he anſwer? The paſſion of choller hath already wounded his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: trouble, before reaſon hath ſeazed vpon it. It were both profitable and neceſſary, that the determining of our diſputations, might be decided by way of wagers; and that there were a materiall marke of our loſſes: that we might better remember and make more accoumpt of it: and that my boy might ſay vnto me: Sir, if you call to minde; your conteſtation, your ignorance and your ſelfe-wilfulneſſe, at ſeverall times, coſt you a hundred crownes the laſt yeare: I feaſt, I cherriſh and I embrace truth, where and in whom ſoever I finde it, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and merily yeeld my ſelfe vnto hir; as ſoone as I ſee but hir approach, though it bee a farre-off, I lay downe my weapons and yeeld my ſelfe vanquiſhed. And alwayes provided, one perſiſt not or proceede therein, with an over imperious ſtiffneſſe or commanding ſurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; I am well pleaſed to be reprooved. And I often accomodate my ſelfe vnto my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, more by reaſon of civilitie, then by occaſion of amendment: loving by the facilitie of yeelding, to gratifie and foſter their liberty, to teach or advertiſe mee. It is notwithſtanding no eaſie matter to draw men of my times vnto it. They have not the courage to correct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want the hart to endure correction: And ever ſpeake with diſſimulation in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence one of another. I take ſo great a pleaſure to bee judged and knowne, that it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to me, in whether of the two formes I be ſo. Mine owne imagination doth ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and condemne it ſelfe, that if another doe it, all is one vnto me; eſpecially ſeeing, I give his reprehenſion no other aucthoritie then I liſt. But I ſhall breake a ſtraw or fall at ods with him, that keepes himſelfe ſo aloſt; as I know ſome, that will fret and chafe if their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be not believed, and who take it as an iniury, yea and fall out with their beſt friends, if they will not follow it. And that <hi>Socrates</hi> ever ſmiling, made a collection of ſuch contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were oppoſed to his diſcourſe, one might ſay, his force was cauſe of it; and that the advantage being aſſuredly to fall on his ſide, he tooke them as a ſubject of a new victory. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe we ſee on the contrary, that nothing doth ſo nicely yeeld our ſence vnto it as the opinion of preheminence and diſdaine of the adverſary. And that by reaſon, it rather befits the weakeſt to accept of oppoſitions in good part, which reſtore and repaire him. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſeeke more the converſation of ſuch as curbe me, then of thoſe that feare me. It is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory and hurtfull pleaſure, to have to doe with men, who admire and give vs place. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> commanded his children, never to bee boholding vnto, or thanke any that ſhould command them. I feele my ſelfe more luſtie and cranke for the victory I gaine over my ſelfe, when in the heate or fury of the combate, I perceive to bend and fall vnder the power of my adverſaries reaſon, then I am pleaſed with the victory, I obtaine of him by his weakeneſſe. To conclude, I receave all blowes and allow all attaints given directly, how weake ſoever: but am very impacient at ſuch as are ſtrucken at randan and without order, I care but little for the matter, and with me opinions are all one, and the victory of the ſubject in a manner in different. I ſhall quietly conteſt a whole day, if the conduct of the controveſie be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with order and decorum. It is not force nor ſubtiltie, that I ſo much require, as forme and order. The forme and order, dayly ſeene in the altercations of Shepheards, or contentions
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:12117:266"/>
of ſhop-prentiſe-boyes; but never amongſt vs; If they part or give one another over, it is with incivility: and ſo doe we. But their wrangling, their brawling and impacience, cannot make them to forgoe or forget their theame.</p>
                        <p>Their diſcourſe holdes on his courſe. If they prevent one another, if they ſtay not for, at leaſt they vnderſtand one another. A man doth ever anſwere ſufficiently well for mee, if hee anſwere what I ſay. But when the diſputation is confounded and orderleſſe, I quit the matter, and betake me to the forme, with ſpight and indiſcretion: and embrace a kinde of debating, teaſty, headlong, malicious and imperious, whereat I afterward bluſh. <hi>It is impoſſible to treate quietly and diſpute orderly with a foole.</hi> My judgement is not onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted vnder the hand of ſo imperious a maiſter, but my conſcience alſo. Our diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be forbidden and puniſhed, as other verball crimes. What vice raiſe they not, and heape vp together, beeing ever ſwayed and commaunded by choller? Firſt wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into enmity with the reaſons, and then with the men. Wee learne not to diſpute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to contradict: and every man contradicting and being contradicted, it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth, that the fruit of diſputing, is to looſe and to diſanull the trueth. So <hi>Plato</hi> in his common wealth, forbiddeth fooliſh, vnapt and baſe-minded ſpirits, to vndertake that exerciſe. To what purpoſe goe you about to queſt or enquire that which is with him, who hath neither good pace nor proceeding of woorth? No man wrongs the ſubject, when he quits the ſame, for want of meanes to treat or mannage it. I meane not a ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and artiſt meane, but intend a naturall meane, and of a ſound vnderſtanding. What will the end bee? one goeth Eaſtward, and another Weſtward: They looſe the principall, and ſtray it in the throng of incidents. At the end of an houres wrangling, they wot not what they ſeeke for: one is high, another low, and another wide. Some take holde of a word, ſome of a ſimilitude. Some forget what was obiected againſt them, ſo much are they engaged in the purſuite and thinke to follow themſelues, and not you. Some finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues weake-backt, feare all, refuſe all, and at the very entrance mingle the ſubiect and confound the purpoſe: or in the heate of the diſputation, mutine to holde their peace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: through a ſpightfull ignorance, affecting a proud kinde of contempt, or a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh modeſty auoydiug of contention. Prouided that one ſtrike and hit, hee careth not how open hee lie. Another compteth his wordes, and wayeth them for reaſons; Another em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth no thing but the aduantage of his voyce and winde. Here one concludeth againſt himſelfe; here another wearieth you with idle prefaces, and friuolous digreſſions. Another armeth himſelfe afore hand with iniuries, and ſeekes after a Dutch quarrell, to rid himſelfe of the ſociety, and ſhake off the conference of a ſpirite, that preſſeth and ouer beareth his.

Take you a maiſter of artes, and conferre with him, why doth hee not make vs perceive his artificiall exceliencie, and by the admiration of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons-conſtancie, or with the beauty of his quaint order, and grace of his method, raviſh ſilly women, and bleare ignorant men as wee are? Why doth hee not ſway, winde, and perſwade vs as he liſt? Why ſhould one ſo advantageous in matter and conduct, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe injuries, indiſcretion and chollericke rage with his fence? Let him pull-of his two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced hoode, his gowne and his latine, let him not fill our eares with meerely beleeved <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> you will diſcover and take him for one of vs, and worſe if worſe my bee. Mee thinkes this implication and entangling of ſpeech, wherewith they doe ſo much importune vs, may fitly bee compared vnto juglers play of faſt and looſe: their nimbleneſſe combates and forceth our ſences, but it nothing ſhaketh our beliefe: Take away their jugling, what they doe is but baſe, common and ſlight. Though they bee more wittie and nimble ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are not the leſſe fooliſh, ſimple and vnapt. I love wit, and honour wiſedome, as
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:12117:267"/>
much as them that have it. And being rightly vſed, it is the nobleſt, the moſt forcible, yea and richeſt purchaſe men can make. But in ſuch (of which kinde the number is infinite) that vpon it eſtabliſh their fundamentall ſufficiency and worth: that from their wit refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their memory, <hi>ſub aliena vmbra latentes: repoſing them vnder another mans protection;</hi> and can do nothing but by the booke (if I may be bold to ſay ſo) I hate the ſame, a little more then ſottiſhnes. <hi>In my country, and in my daies, learning and bookiſhnes, doth much mend purſes, but minds nothing at all.</hi> If it chance to finde them empty light and dry, it filleth, it over-burthens and ſwelleth them: a raw and indigeſted maſſe: if thinne, it doth eaſily purifie, clarifie, exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and ſubtilize them, even vnto exinanition or evacuation. It is a thing of aquality ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neare indifferent: a moſt profitable acceſſory or ornament vnto a well borne minde, but pernicious and hurtfully domagable vnto any other. Or rather a thing of moſt precious vſe, that wil not baſely be gotten, nor vilie poſſeſſed. In ſome hands a royal ſcepter, in other ſome a rude mattocke. But let vs proceed. <hi>What greater or more glorious victory can you expect, then teach your enemy, that he cannot withſtand you?</hi> When you gaine the advantage of your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it is Truth that winneth: when you get the advantage of the order and conduct, it is you that winne. I am of opinion, that both in <hi>Plato</hi> and in <hi>Xenophon, Socrates</hi> diſputeth more in favour of the diſputers, then in grace of the diſputation: and more to inſtruct <hi>Euthydemus</hi> and <hi>Protagoras</hi> with the knowledge of their impertinency, then with the impertinency of their arte. He takes hold of the firſt matter, as he who hath a more profitable end, then to cleare it; that is, to cleare the ſpirits he vndertaketh to manage and to exerciſe. Agitation, ſtirring and hunting is properly belonging to our ſubject or drift; we are not excuſable to conduct the ſame ill and impertinently, but to miſſe the game, and faile in taking, that's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter. <hi>For wee are borne to queſt and ſeeke after trueth; to poſſeſſe it belongs to a greater power.</hi> It is not (as <hi>Democritus</hi> ſaid) hidden in the deepes of abiſſe: but rather eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in infinite height of diuine knowledge. <hi>The world is but a Schoole of inquiſition.</hi> The matter is not who ſhall put in, but who ſhall runne the faireſt courſes. As well may hee play the foole that ſpeaketh truely, as hee that ſpeaketh falſely: for wee are vpon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not vppon the matter of ſpeaking. My humour is, to haue as great aregarde to the forme, as to the ſubſtance; as much reſpect to the Aduocate, as to the cauſe; as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> appointed wee ſhould doe. And I day lie ammuſe my ſelfe to reade in authors, without care of their learning: therein ſeeking their manner, not their ſubiect. Euen as I purſue the communication of ſome famous wit, not that hee ſhould teach mee, but that I may know him; and knowing him (if he deſerue it) I may imitate him. Every one may ſpeake truely, but to ſpeake orderly, methodically, wiſely and ſufficiently, few can doe it. So falſehood proceeding of ignorance doth not offend mee; ineptneſſe and trifling doth. I haue broken-off diuers bargaines, that would haue beene very commodious vnto me, by the impertinencie of their conteſtation, with whome I did bargaine. I am not mooued once a yeare, with the faults or ouerſights of thoſe, over whom I have power: but touching the point of the ſottiſhineſſe and fooliſhneſſe of their allegations, excuſes, and defences, rude and brutiſh, wee are every day ready to goe by the eares. They neyther vnderſtand what is ſaid nor wherefore, and even ſo they anſwer; a thing able to make one diſpaire. I feele not my head to ſhock hard but by being hit with another. And I rather enter into compoſition with my peoples vices, then with their raſhneſſe, importunity and fooliſhneſſe. Let them doe leſſe, prouided they be capable to doe. You liue in hope to enflame their will: But <hi>of a block there is nothing to bee hoped for, nor any thing of worth to bee enioyed.</hi> Now, what if I take things otherwiſe then they are? So it may bee: And therefore I accuſe my impatience. And firſt I hould, that it is equally vicious in him, who is in the right, as in him, that is in the wrong: For, it is ever a kinde of tyrannicall ſharpeneſſe, not to be able to endure a forme different from his: and verily, ſince there is not a greater fondneſſe, a more conſtant gulliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or more heteroclite inſipidity then for one to move or vex himſelfe at the fondneſſe, at the gulliſhneſſe, or inſipidity of the world: For it principally formalizeth and moveth vs againſt our ſelves: and that Philoſopher of former ages ſhould never have wanted occaſion to weepe, ſo long as he had conſidered himſelfe. <hi>Miſo,</hi> one of the ſeaven ſages (a man of a Timonian diſpoſition and Democraticall humour) being demanded, where-at hee laughed alone; he anſwered, becauſe I laugh alone; How many follies doe I ſpeake and anſwer every day, according to my ſelfe; and then how much more frequent according to others? And if
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:12117:267"/>
I bite mine owne lips at them, what ought others to doe? <hi>In fine, wee muſt live with the quicke, and let the water runne vnder the bridge, without any care, or at leaſt without alteration to vs.</hi> In good ſooth, why meet we ſometimes with crooked, deformed, and in body miſhapen men, without falling into rage and diſcontent, and cannot endure to light-vpon a froward, skit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, and ill-ranged ſpirit, without falling into anger and vexation? This vicious auſteritie is rather in the Iudge, then in the fault. Let vs ever have that ſaying of <hi>Plato</hi> in our mouthes: <hi>What I finde vnwholſome, is it not to be vnhealthy my ſelfe? Am not I in fault my ſelfe? May not mine owne advertiſement be retorted againſt my ſelfe?</hi> Oh wiſe and divine reſtraint, that curbeth the moſt vniverſall and common errour of men: Not only the reproches, we doe one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but our reaſons, our arguments and matters controverſed, are ordinarily retortable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: and we pinch our ſelves vp in our owne armes. Whereof antiquitie hath left me divers grave examples. It was ingeniouſly ſpoken and fit to the purpoſe, by him that firſt deviſed the ſame.</p>

If this precept take his tune ſomewhat too high: it ſhould at leaſt be firſt preſented to the puniſhment of ones owne conſcience. Our ſenſes are our proper and firſt iudges, who diſtinguiſh not things, but by externall accidents; and no marvell, if in all parts of the ſervice belonging to our ſocietie, there is ſo perpetuall and vniverſall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of ceremonies and ſuperficiall apparances: ſo that the beſt and moſt effectuall part of policies, conſiſts in that.

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:12117:268"/>
and ſo redoubted, have not ſome ſufficiencie within him, more then popular: and that a man ſo ſullen ſo grim aud ſo diſdainfull, to whom ſo many commiſſions, charges and aucthorities are given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not more ſufficient and worthy, then another, who ſaluteth and vaileth to him ſo farre-off, and whom no man employeth. Not onely the wordes, but the powtings of ſuch people, are conſidered and regiſtred, every one applying himſelfe to give them ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſolide interpretation. If they ſloope to common conference, and that a man affoord or ſhew them other then reverence and approbation, they ouerthrow you with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of their experience: they haue read, they haue heard, ſeene and done goodly things, you are cleane ouerwhelmed with examples. I would faine tell them, that the fruit of a Chirurgions experience, is not the ſtorie of his practiſes, or the remembrance that hee hath cured foure who had the plague, and healed as many that had the Goute, except he know and haue the wit, from his vſe and experience, to draw a methode how to frame his judgements and by his skill and practiſe make vs perceaue, hee is become wiſer in his arte. As in a conſort of inſtruments, one heares not ſeuerally a Lute, a Vyol, a Flute, or a paire of Virginalles, but a perfect-full harmonie: the aſſemblie and fruit of all thoſe inſtruments in one. If their travels and charges have amended them, it is in the production of their vnderſtanding to make it appeare. It ſufficeth not to number the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments; they ought to be well poiſed and orderly ſorted: and to extract the reaſons and concluſions they containe, they ſhould bee well diſgeſted and thorowly diſtilled.

Dignities, charges and places, are neceſſarily given, more by fortune then by merit: and they are often to blame, that for it lay the blame on Kings. Contrariwiſe it is a wonder, that being ſo vntoward, they ſhould therein have ſo good lucke: <hi>Principis eſt virtus maxima, noſſe ſuos. Chiefe vertue it is knowne, In Kings to know their owne.</hi> For Nature hath not given them ſo perfect a ſight, that it might extend it ſelfe and overlooke ſo many people, to diſcerne their pre-excellency; and enter their breaſts, where lodgeth the knowledge of our will and better worth. It is by coniectures, and as it were groping they muſt try vs: by our race, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, dependences, riches learning, and the peoples voice: all over-weake arguments. <hi>He that could deviſe a meane, how men might be iudged by law, choſen by reaſon, and advanced by deſert, ſhould eſtabliſh a perfect forme of a Commonwealth.</hi> Yea but he hath brought that great buſineſſe vnto a good paſſe.

And the Roman people hath often refuſed triumphes too famous, ſuccesfull and moſt profitable victories, forſomuch as the Generals conduct, anſwered not his good fortune. It is commonly perceived by the worldes actions, that fortune, to teach vs, how farre hir power extendeth vnto all things; and who taketh pleaſure to abate our preſumption, having not beene able to make ſilly men wiſe, ſhe hath made them fortunate, in enuie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: And commonly gives hir ſelfe to favour executions, when as their complot and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe is meerely hirs.

                        <p>Good and bad fortune, are in my conceit two ſoveraigne powers T'is folly to thinke, that humane wiſedome may act the full part of fortune.

There was neuer more circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and militaty wiſedome, then is ſometimes ſeene amongſt vs: May it bee that manfeareth to looſe himſelfe by the way, reſeruing himſelfe to the cataſtrophe of that play? I ſay moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that euen our wiſedome and conſultation for the moſt part followeth the conduct of hazard. My will and my diſcourſe, is ſometimes mooued by one ayre, and ſometimes by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and there be many of theſe motions, that are governed without me.

                        <p>Wherefore I ſay well, that howſoeuer, events are but weake teſtimonies of our worth and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. I was now vpon this point, that we need but looke vpon a man aduanced to dignity; had we but three dayes before knowne him to bee of little or no worth at all: an image of greatneſſe, and an Idea of ſufficiencie, doth inſenſibly glide and creepe into our opinions; and wee perſwade our ſelues, that increaſing in ſtate and credit and followers, hee is alſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in merit. Wee iudge of him, not according to his worth; but after the manner of caſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, according to the prerogatiue of his ranke. But let fortune turne hir wheele, let him againe decline and come downe amongſt the vulgar multitude; euery one with admiration enquireth of the cauſe, and how he was raiſed ſo high. Good Lord, is that he? will ſome ſay. What? knew he no more? had he no other skill when hee was ſo aloft? Are Princes pleaſed with ſo little? Now in good ſooth wee were in very good hands, will others ſay. It is a thing my ſelfe have often ſeene in my dayes. Yea the very maske of greatneſſe, or habite of maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, repreſented in Tragedies, doth in ſome ſort touch and beguile vs. The thing I adore in Kings, is the throng of their adoratores. All inclination and ſubmiſſion is due vnto them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the mindes. My reaſon is not framed to bend or ſtoope; my knees are. <hi>Melanthius</hi> being demanded, what he thought of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his tragedy, anſwered, I haue not ſeene it, ſo much was it over-clouded with language. So ſhould thoſe ſay, that judge of great mens diſcourſes: I haue not vnderſtood his diſcourſe, ſo was it ouerdarkned with grauity, with greatnes and with maieſty. <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> one day perſwaded the Athenians, to command, that their aſſes ſhould as well be employed about the manuring of grounds, as were their horſes: who anſwered him, that the Aſſe was not borne for ſuch ſeruice: that's all one (quoth he) there needs but your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for it: for the moſt ignorant and incapable men you imploy about the directing of
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:12117:269"/>
your warres, leaue not to become out of hand moſt worthy, onely becauſe you employ them. Wherevpon depends the cuſtome of ſo many men, who canonize the king, whom they haue made amongſt them, and are not contented to honour him, vnleſſe they alſo adore him. Thoſe of <hi>Mexico,</hi> after the cerimonies of his conſecration are finiſhed, dare no more looke him in the face: but as if by his royalty, they had deified him, they afterward deeme him to bee a God: amongſt the oathes, they make him ſweare <hi>to maintain their religion, to keepe their lawes, to deſend their liberties, to be valiant, iuſt and debonaire;</hi> hee is alſo ſworne to make the Sunne march in his accuſtomed light: in time of need to cauſe the cloudes ſhowre downe their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; to enforce riuers to runne in their right wonted chanels; and compell the earth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all neceſſary things for his people. I differ from this common faſhion, and more diſtruſt ſufficiencie, when I ſee it accompanied with the greatnes of fortune, and applanded by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commendation. We ſhould heedfully marke, of what conſequence it is, for a man to ſpeake in due time, to chooſe fit opportunity, to breake or change his diſcourſe with a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrale authority: to defend himſelfe from others oppoſitions, by a nod or moouing of the head, by a ſmile, a ſhrug or a ſilence, before an aſſembly, trembling with reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. A man of monſtrous fortune, chancing to ſhoote his boult, and giue his opinion vpon a frivolous ſubiect, which but jeſtingly was toſſed too and fro at his table, beganne ever thus; he cannot chooſe but be a lyer, or an ignorant aſſe, that will ſay otherwiſe then, &amp;c. Follow this Philoſophicall point, out commeth a dagger, and there is ſome miſchiefe. Loe here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduertiſment; from whence I reape good vſe; Which is, that in diſputations and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, all good ſeeming wordes, ought not preſently to be allowed and accepted. Moſt men are rich of a ſtrange ſufficiency. Some may chance to ſpeake a notable ſaying, to give a good anſwere, to vſe a witty ſentence, and to propound it, without knowing the force of it. That a man holdeth not all he borroweth, may peraduenture be verified in my ſelfe. A man ſhould not alwayes yeeld, what truth or goodnes ſoever it ſeemeth to containe. A man muſt either combat the ſame in good earneſt, or draw-backe, vnder colour of not vnderſtanding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: to try on all parts, how it is placed in it's author. It may fortune, that we ſhut our ſelues vp, and further the ſtroake, beyond its bearing. I haue ſometimes in neceſſity and throng of the combat, employed ſome reuiradoes or turnings, which beyond my intent, have prooved falſe offers. I but gave them by tale, and they were received by waight. Euen as when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with a vigorous man; I pleaſe my ſelfe to anticipate his concluſions: I eaſe him the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to interpret himſelfe, I endeuour to preuent his imperfect and yet budding imagination: the order and pertinencie of his vnderſtanding for warneth and menaceth a farre off: of theſe others I doe cleane contrary; a man muſt vnderſtand or preſuppoſe nothing but by them. If they judge in generall termes: <hi>This is good; that's naught:</hi> and that they iump right; ſee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fortune, that iumpeth for them. Let them a little circumſcribe and reſtraine their ſentence; wherefore it is, and which way it is. Theſe vniuerſall judgements, I ſee ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſay nothing at all. They are men, that ſalute a whole multitude, in throng and troupe. Such as have true knowledge of the ſame, ſalute and marke it by name and particularly. But it is a hazardous enterpriſe. Whence I haue oftner and dayly ſeen, to happen that wits weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded, intending to ſhew themſelues ingenious, by obſeruing in the reading of ſome worke, the point of beaury: ſtay their admiration with ſo bad a choiſe, that in liew of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs the authors excellencie, they ſhew vs their owne ignorance.

them goe-on: they will handle this matter as men affraide to bewray themſelues, they dare neither change her ſeate or light, nor enter into it. Shake it neuer ſo little, it eſcapeth them; quit the ſame how ſtrong and goodly ſoeuer it bee. They are hand-ſome weapons, but ill hafted. How often haue I ſeene the experience of it? Now if you come to expound and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them, they take hold of you, and preſently ſteale the aduantage of your interpretation from you. <hi>It was that which I was about to ſay: It was iuſt my conceite: if I have not ſo expreſt it, it is but for want of ſpeech.</hi> Handy-dandy, what is this? Malice it ſelfe muſt be employed to correct this fierce rudeneſſe. <hi>Hegeſias</hi> his poſition, that <hi>a man muſt neither hate nor accuſe, but inſtruct,</hi> hath ſome reaſon elſe where. But heere, it is iniuſtice to affiſt, and inhumanity to raiſe him vp againe, that hath nothing to doe with it, and is thereby of leſſer worth. I love to have them entangle and bemire themſelues more then they are and if it bee poſſible, to wade ſo deepe into the gulfe of error, that in the end they may recall and aduiſe themſelues. <hi>Sottiſhneſſe and diſtraction of the ſences, is no diſeaſe curable by a tricke of aduertiſment.</hi> And wee may fitly ſay of this reparation, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> anſwered one, who vrged him to exhort his army in the nicke when the battell ſhould beginne; That <hi>men are not made warlike and couragious in the field, by an excellent oration; no more then one becommeth a ready cunning muſition, by hearing a good ſong.</hi> They are prentiſages that muſt bee learnt a forehand, by long and conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. This care wee owe to ours, and this aſſiduitie of correction and inſtruction: but to preach to him that firſt paſſeth by, or ſway the ignorance or fondneſſe of him wee meete next, is a cuſtome I cannot well away with. I ſeldome vſe it, even in ſuch diſcourſes as are made to mee; and I rather quit all, then come to theſe far-fetcht and magiſtrale inſtructions. My humour is no more proper to ſpeake, then to write, namely for beginners. But in things commonly ſpoken, or amongſt others, how falſ and abſurd ſoever I iudge them, I neuer croſſe or gibe them, neither by word nor ſigne. Further, nothing doth more ſpight mee in ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then that it pleaſeth it ſelfe more, then any reaſon may iuſtly be ſatisfied. It is ill lucke, that wiſedome forbids you to pleaſe and truſt your ſelfe, and ſends you alwayes away diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and fearefull: whereas wilfulnes and raſhneſſe, fill their gueſts with gratulation and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. It is for the ſimpleſt and leaſt able, to looke at other men ouer their ſhoulders, ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the combatful of glory and gladnes. And moſt often alſo, this outrecuidance of ſpeech and cheerefulneſſe of countenance, giueth them the victory ouer the by-ſtanders, who are commonly weake, and incapable to iudge aright and diſcerne true aduantage. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie and earneſtneſſe in opinion, is the ſureſt tryall of folly and ſelfe conceite.</hi> Is there any thing ſo aſſured, ſo reſolute, ſo diſdainefull, ſo contemplatiue, ſo ſerious and ſo grave, as the Aſſe; May wee not commixe with the title of conference and communication, the ſharpe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted diſcourſes, which mirth and familiaritie introduceth amongſt friends, pleaſantly dallying and wittily ieſting one with another? An exerciſe, to which my naturall blitheneſſe makes me very apt. And if it be not ſo wire-drawne and ſerious, as this other exerciſe I now ſpeake of, yet is it no leſſe ſharpe or ingenious, no leſſe profitable, as it ſeemed to <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> For my regard I bring more liberty then wit vnto it, and have there in more lucke then inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but I am perfect in ſufferance; for I endure the revenge, not onely ſharpe but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreete, without any alteration. And to any aſſault giuen me, if I have not preſently or ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wherewith to worke mine own amends, I ammuſe not my ſelf to follow that ward or point, with a tedious and ſelfe-wil'd conteſtation, enclining to pertinacie: I let it paſſe, and hanging downe mine eares, remit my ſelfe to a better houre to right my ſelfe. <hi>He is not a marchant that ever gaineth.</hi> Moſt men change both voice and countenance, where might faileth them: And by an importunate rage, inſtead of avenging themſelues, they accuſe their weakeneſſe and therewith bewray their impacience.

I come lately from reading ouer, (and that without any intermiſſion) the ſtory of <hi>Tacitus</hi> (a matter not vſuall with me; it is now twenty yeares, I never ſpent one whole houre together vpon a booke) and I have now done it, at the inſtant requeſt of a gentleman, whom <hi>France</hi> holdeth in high eſteeme; as well for his owne worth and valour, as for a conſtant forme of ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and goodnes, apparantly ſeene in divers brethren of his. I know no author, that in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like regiſter entermixeth ſo many conſiderations of manners, and particular inclinations. And I deeme cleane contrary, to what hee thinketh: who being eſpecially to follow the lives of the Emperours of his time, ſo divers and extreme in all manner of forme, ſo many notable and great actions, which, namely their crueltie produced in their ſubiects: he had a more powerfull and attractiue matter, to diſcourſe and relate, then if hee had beene to ſpeake or treat of battles and vniverſall agitations. So that I often finde him barren, ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie running-over thoſe glorious deaths, as if he feared to attediate and moleſt vs with their multitude and continuance. This forme of hiſtorie is much more profitable: <hi>Publike inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, depend more on the conduct of fortune: priuate on ours.</hi> It is rather a iudgement, then

a deduction of an hiſtory: therein are more precepts, then narrations: It is not a booke to reade, but a volume to ſtudy and to learne: It is ſo fraught with ſentences, that right or wrong they are hudled vp: It is a ſeminary of mortall, and a magazine of pollitique diſcourſes, for the prouiſion and ornament of thoſe, that poſſeſſe ſome place in the managing of the world. He ever pleadeth with ſolide and forcible reaſons; after a ſharpe and witty faſhion: follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected and laboured ſtile of his age: They ſo much loved to raiſe and puffe themſelues vp, that where they found neither ſharpeneſſe nor ſubtility in things, they would borrow it of wordes. He draweth ſomewhat neare to <hi>Senecas</hi> writing. I deeme <hi>Tacitus</hi> more ſinnowy, <hi>Seneca</hi> more ſharpe. His ſeruice is more proper to a crazed troubled ſtate, as is ours at this preſent: you would often ſay, hee pourtrayeth and toucheth vs to the quicke. Such as doubt of his faith, doe many feſtly accuſe themſelues to hate him for ſomewhat elſe. His opinions be ſound, and encl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I am neuertheleſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greeued, that he hath more bitterly iudged of <hi>Pompey,</hi> then honeſt mens opinions, who lived and conuerſed with him, doe well allow-off: to have eſteemed him altogether equall to <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla,</hi> ſaving that he was more cloſe and ſecret. His intention and canuaſing for the gouernment of affaires, hath not beene exempted from ambition, nor cleared from revenge: and his owne friends haue feared, that had he gotten the victory, it would have tranſported him beyond the limites of reaſon; but not vnto an vnbridled and raging mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There is nothing in his life that hath threatned vs with ſo many feſt a cruelty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tyranny. Yet muſt not the ſuſpition be counterpoiſed to the euidence: So doe not I beleeue him.</p>
                        <p>That his narrations are naturall and right, might happily be argued by this: That they doe not alwayes exactly apply themſelues to the concluſions of his iudgments; which hee purſueth according to the courſe hee hath taken, often beyond the matter hee ſheweth vs; which hee hath dained to ſtoope vnto with one only glance. He needeth no excuſe to have approoved the religion of his times, according to the lawes which commaunded him, and beene ignorant of the true and perfect worſhip of God. That's his ill fortune, not his defect. I have principally conſidered his iudgement, whereof I am not every where throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued.

I dare not onely ſpeake of my ſelfe: but ſpeake alone of my ſelfe. I ſtragle when I write of any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and digreſſe from my ſubiect. I doe not ſo diſcreetly love my ſelfe, and am ſo tide and commixt to my ſelfe, as that I can not diſtinguiſh and conſider my ſelfe a part: as a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; as a tree. it is an equall error, eyther not to ſee how farre a mans worth ſtretcheth, or to ſay more of it then one ſeeth good cauſe. <hi>We owe more love to God, then to our ſelues, and know him leſſe, and yet we talke our fill of him.</hi> If his writings relate any thing of his conditions: he was a notable man, vpright and couragious; not with a ſuperſtitious vertue, but Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall and generous: He may be found over-hardy in his teſtimonies: As where hee hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a ſouldier carrying a burden of wood, his hands were ſo ſtifly benummed with cold, that they ſtucke to his woode, and remayned ſo faſt vnto it, that as dead fleſh they were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his armes.

I can keepe no regiſter of my life by my actions: fortune placeth them too Iowe: I hould them of my fantaſies.

As if good fortune were incompatible with a good conſcience, men neuer become honeſt but by aduerſe and croſſe chances.

doe better for him, I would performe it. I glory his will is at this day practiſed by mee, and doth yet worke in me. God forbid I ſhould ever ſuffer any image of life to periſh vnder my hands, that I may yeeld vnto ſo good and ſo kinde a father. If I have vndertaken to finiſh any old peece of wall, or repaire any building either imperfect or decaied: it hath certainly beene, becauſe I had rather a reſpect to his intention, then a regard to my contentment. And I blame my negligence or litherneſſe, that I have not continued to perfect the foundations he had laid, or beginnings he had left in his houſe: by ſo much the more, becauſe I am in great likelihood to be the laſt poſſeſſor of it, namely of my race, and ſet the laſt hand vnto it. For, concerning my particular application, neither the pleaſure of building, which is ſaid to be ſo bewitching, nor hunting, nor hauking, nor gardens, nor ſuch other delights of a retired life, can much embuſie or greatly ammuſe me. It is a thing for which I hate my ſelfe, as of all other opinions, that are incommodious to me. I care not ſo much to have them vigorous and learned, as I labour to have them eaſie and commodious vnto life. They are indeed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently true and ſound, if they be profitable and pleaſing. Thoſe, who hearing mee relate mine owne inſufficiencie in matters pertaining to husbandry or thrift, are ſtill whiſpering in mine eares, that it is but a kinde of diſdaine, and that I neglect to know the implements or tooles belonging to husbandry or tillage, their ſeaſons and orders; how my wines are made, how they graft; and vnderſtand or know the names and formes of hearbes, of ſimples, of fruits, and what belongs to the dreſſing of meats wherewith I live and whereon I feede; the names and prizes of ſuch ſtuffes I cloath my ſelfe withall, only becauſe I doe more ſeriouſly take to heart ſome higher knowledge; bring me in a manner to deaths doore.

Whoſoever hath the charge of my purſe when I travell, hath it freely and without controll: as well might hee deceive me in keeping of reckonings. And if he be not a Divell, I bind him to deale well and honeſtly, by my careleſſe confidence. <hi>Multi fallere docuerunt, dum timent falli, &amp; alies ius peccands ſuſpicando fecerunt. Many have taught others to deceive, while themſelves feare to be deceived, and have given them iuſt cauſe to offend, by ſuſpecting them vniuſtly.</hi> The moſt ordinary aſſurance I take of my people, is a kinde of diſacknowledge or neglect: I never preſume vices, but after I have ſeene them: and truſt more yoong men, ſuch as I imagine to be leaſt debauſhed and corrupted by ill examples. I had rather heare at two moneths end, that I have ſpent foure hundred crownes, then every night when I ſhould goe to my quiet bed, have mine eares tired and my minde vexed with three, five, or ſeven. Yet in this kinde of ſtealing, have I had as little ſtolne from mee as any other: True it is, I lend a helping hand to ignorance. I wittingly entertaine a kinde of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and vncertaine knowledge of my money: vntill it come to a certaine meaſure I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to doubt of it. It is not amiſſe if you allow your boy or ſervant ſome ſmall ſcope for his diſloyalty and indiſcretion. If in groſſe we have ſufficiently left to bring our matters to paſſe, this exceſſe of fortunes-liberalitie, let vs ſomewhat more ſuffer it to ſtand to her mercie: It is the gleaners fee. After all, I eſteeme not ſo much my peoples fidelitie, as I diſeſteeme their iniurie. Oh baſe and abſurd ſtudy, for a man to ſtudy his money, and pleaſe himſelfe with handling and counting the ſame: for that's the way whereby covetouſneſſe maketh her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches. Since eighteene yeeres, that I have had the full diſpoſing of my goods in mine owne hands, I could never yet be brought to over-looke, neither titles nor bookes, no not ſo much as the principall affaires, that ſhould neceſſarily paſſe thorow my knowledge and care.</p>
                        <p>It is no Philoſophicall contempt, to neglect worldly and tranſitorie things: my taſte is not ſo exquiſitly nice; for I value them according to their worth at leaſt: but truly it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable ſlothfulneſſe and childiſh negligence. What would I not rather doe, then reade a contract? And more willingly, as a ſlave to my buſineſſe, with carke to over-looke, and care to ſurvay a company of old-duſtie bookes, and plod vpon muſtie writings? and which is worſe, other mens, as ſo many doe daily for money? I have nothing ſo deare as care and paine: and I only endevour to become careleſſe and retchleſſe. I had, in mine opinion, beene fitter (if it might be) to live by others fortune, without bounden dutie or bondage. And yet I wot not (the matter being thorowly ſifted) whether according to my humour and fortune, what I muſt endure with my affaires, and pocket vp at my ſervants and familiars hands, hath not more abiection, importunitie and ſharpneſſe, then the following of another man ſhould have, better borne then my ſelfe, and who ſhould guide me ſomewhat at mine eaſe. <hi>Servitus obedientia eſt fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>well nigh as much as plentie: In mine owne houſe I exactly looke vnto neceſſitie, little vnto ſtate, and leſſe vnto ornament. If your neighbours ſervant be fighting with his companion, if a diſh be overthrowen, you but laugh at it: you ſleepe quietly whileſt Sir ſuch a one is buſie caſting vp of accounts, and over-ſeeing his ſtocke with his ſteward, and all about your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for to morrow. I ſpeake according to mine opinion: omitting not in generall to thinke, how pleaſing an ammuſement it is to certaine natures, to ſee a quiet and proſperous houſhold, directed by a formall and guided by a regular order. But not intending to faſten mine owne errours and inconveniences to the matter: Nor to gaine-ſay <hi>Plato,</hi> who deemeth that the happieſt occupation any man can follow, is, to apply himſelfe to his owne private buſineſſe, without injuſtice. When I iourney, I have nothing to care for but my ſelfe, and how my money is laid out: which is diſpoſed with one onely precept. Over-many parts are required in hoarding and gathering of goods: I have no skill in it. In ſpending, I have ſome knowledge, and how to give my expences day; which indeed is it's principall vſe. But I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it over-ambitiouſly, which makes it both vnequall and deformed: and beſides that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate in one and other viſage. If it appeare and make a good ſhew, if it ſerve the turne, I indiſcreetly goe after it; and as indiſcreetly reſtraine my ſelfe, if it ſhine or ſmile not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee. Whatſoever it bee, either Art or nature, that imprints this condition of life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by relation to others, it doth vs much more hurt then good. In going about to frame apparances according to the common opinion, wee defraud our ſelves of our owne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profits. Wee care not ſo much, what our ſtate, or how our being is, in vs and in effect, as wee doe how and what it is, in the publike knowledge of others. Even the goods of the minde, and wiſedome it ſelfe, ſeeme fruitleſſe vnto vs, if onely enioied by vs: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee ſet foorth to the open view and approbation of ſtrangers. There are ſome, whoſe gold runnes by ſtreames in places vnder ground, and that imperceptible: others extend the ſame in plates and leaves: So that to ſome, pence are worth crownes, to others the contrary: the world iudging the employment and value, according to the outward ſhew. All over-nice care and curious heed about riches, hath a touch or a taſte of avarice. Even their diſpending and over regular and artificiall liberalities are not worth a warie heede-taking, and countervaile not a painefull diligence. Who ſo will make his expence even and juſt, makes it ſtrict and forced. Either cloſe-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or employing of money, are in themſelves things indifferent; and admit no colour of good or evill, but according to the application of our will. The other cauſe that drawes mee to theſe iourneies or vagaries, is the diſſent or diſparitie in the preſent manners of our ſtate: I could eaſily comfort my ſelfe with this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard of the publike intereſt;</p>

                        <p>To conclude, I ſee by our example, that the ſocietie of men doth hold and is ſewed together, at what rate ſoever it be: where ever they be placed, in mooving and cloſing, they are ranged and ſtowed together; as vneven and rugged bodies, that orderleſſe are hudled in ſome cloſe place, of themſelves finde the way to be vnited and ioined together one with another: and many times better, then Art could have diſpoſed them. King <hi>Philip</hi> aſſembled a rabble of the moſt leaud, reprobate and incorrigible men he could finde out, all which he placed in a Citie, which of purpoſe he had cauſed to be built for them, of whom it bare the name. I imagine, that even of their vices, they erected a politike contexture amongſt themſelves, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and iuſt ſocietie. I ſee not one action, or three, or a hundred, but even divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, admitted and commonly vſed: ſo extravagant (namely in diſloyaltie) and ſo barbarous in inhumanitie, which in my conceit, are the worſt and moſt execrable kinde of vices, that I have not the heart ſo much as to conceive them without horrour: All which I in a manner admire as much as I deteſt. The exerciſe of theſe egregious villanies, beareth a brand of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and hardineſſe of minde, as much as of error and irregular confuſion. <hi>Neceſſitie compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and aſſembleth men together.</hi> This caſuall combining is afterward framed into lawes. For, there have beene ſome as barbarouſly-ſavage, as humane opinion could poſſible produce, which notwithſtanding have kept their bodies in as good health and ſtate, in long life, as thoſe of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could doe. And to ſay true, all theſe deſcriptions of policie, fained by Art and ſuppoſition, are found ridiculous and fooliſh, to bee put in practiſe. Theſe great and long-continuing altercations, about the beſt forme of ſocietie, and moſt commodious rules to vnite vs together, are altercations onely proper for the exerciſe of our wit: As in arts, divers ſubiects are found, that have no eſſence but in agitation and diſputing, without which they have no life at all. Such an Idea of policie, or picture of government, were to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in a new world; but we take a world already made and formed to certaine cuſtomes: wee engender not the ſame as <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> nor beget it as <hi>Cadmus.</hi> By what meanes ſoever we have the privilege to re-erect and range the ſame anew, wee can very hardly wreſt it from the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med habit and fold it hath taken, except we breake all. <hi>Solon</hi> being demanded, whether hee had eſtabliſhed the beſt lawes he could for the Athenians: anſwered, yea of thoſe they would have received: with ſuch a ſhift doth <hi>Varre</hi> excuſe himſelfe; ſaying, that if hee were newly to beginne to write of religion, he would plainly tell what his beleefe were of it: But being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die received, he will ſpeake more of it according to cuſtome, then to nature. Not to ſpeake by opinion, but conſonant to truth, the moſt excellent and beſt policie, for any nation to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is that vnder which it hath maintained it ſelfe. It's forme and eſſentiall commoditie doth much depend of cuſtome. We are eaſily diſpleaſed with the preſent condition: yet doe I hold that to wiſh the government of few, in a popular eſtate: or in a Monarchie, another kinde of policie, it is a manifeſt vice and meere follie.</p>

                        <p>So was the good Lord of <hi>Pibrac</hi> wont to ſpeake of it, whom we have lately loſt: a man of ſo quaint and rare wit, of ſo ſound iudgement, and of ſo milde and affable behaviour. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely loſſe of whom, with that of the Lord of <hi>Foix,</hi> both fatally hapning to vs at one time, are ſurely loſſes of great conſequence vnto our crowne.

They were two mindes diverſly faire; and verily, if we reſpect the corrupted age wherein we live, both rare and gloriouſly-ſhining, every one in her forme. But alas, what deſtinie had placed them on the Theater of this age, ſo diſſonant and different in proportion from our deplorable corruption, and ſo farre from agreeing with our tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſtormes? Nothing doth ſo neerely touch and ſo much overlay an eſtate, as innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Only change doth give forme to iniuſtice, and ſcope to tyrannie.</hi> If ſome one peece be out of ſquare, it may be vnderpropt: one may oppoſe himſelfe againſt that, which the alteration, incident, and corruption, naturall to all things, doth not too much elonge and draw vs from our beginnings and grounded principles: But to vndertake to re-erect and found againe ſo huge a maſſe, and change or remoove the foundations of ſo vaſt a frame, belongeth only to them, who in ſtead of purging, deface; and in lieu of cleanſing, ſcrape out: that will amend particular faults by an vniverſall confuſion, and cure diſeaſes by death: <hi>Non tam commutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darum quàm overtendarum rerum cupidi. Not ſo deſiroús to have things altered, as overthrowen.</hi> The world is fondly vnapt to cure it ſelfe: So impatient with that which vexeth or grieveth it, that it only aimeth to ridde it ſelfe of it, never regarding at what rate. Wee ſee by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand examples, that it doth ordinarily cure it ſelfe at it's owne charges: <hi>To be freed from a preſent evill, is no perfect cure, except there be a generall amendment of condition.</hi> The end of a skilfull Chirurgion, is not to mortifie the bad fleſh, it is but the beginning and addreſſing of his cure: he aimeth further, that is, to make the naturall to grow againe, and reduce the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his due being and qualitie. Whoever propoſeth onely to remoove what gnaweth him, ſhall be to ſeeke: for <hi>good doth not neceſſarily ſucceed evill:</hi> another, yea a worſe evill may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it. As it hapned vnto <hi>Ceſars</hi> murderers, who brought the common-wealth to ſo diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a plunge, that they repented themſelves they ever medled with the ſame. The like hath ſince fortuned to divers, yea in our daies. The French that live in my times, know very well what to ſpeake of ſuch matters. <hi>All violent changes and great alterations, diſorder, diſtemper and ſhake a ſtate very much.</hi> He that ſhould rightly reſpect a ſound recovery or abſolute cure, and before al other things thorowly conſult about it, might happily grow ſlaoke in the buſineſſe, and beware how he ſet his hand vnto it. <hi>Pacuvius Calavius</hi> corrected the vice of this manner of proceeding by a notable example. His fellow Citizens had mutined againſt their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; He being a man of eminent authoritie in the City of <hi>Capua,</hi> found one day the means to ſhut vp the Senate in the Guildhall or Palace, then calling the people together in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, told them; That the day was now come, wherein with full and vnreſiſted libertie, they might take vengeance of the tyrants, that had ſo long and ſo many waies oppreſſed them, all which he had now at his mercy, alone and vnarmed. His opinion was, that orderly by lots, they ſhould be drawen out one after another: which done, they might particularly diſpoſe of every one: and whatſoever ſhould be decreed of them, ſhould immediately be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted vpon the place; provided they ſhould therewithall preſently adviſe and reſolve to nominate and eſtabliſh ſome honeſt and vndetected man, to ſupply the roome of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, leſt their Citie ſhould remaine void of due officers. To which they granted, and heard no ſooner the name of a Senatour read, but a loud exclamation of a generall diſcontent was raiſed againſt him: which <hi>Pacuvius</hi> perceiving, hee requeſted ſilence, and thus beſpake them. My countrey-men, I ſee very well, that man muſt be cut off, hee is a pernicious and wicked member; but let vs have another ſound-good man in his place; and whom would you name for that purpoſe? This vnexpected ſpeech bred a diſtracted ſilence; each one finding himſelfe to ſeeke and much confounded in the choiſe. Yet one,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:12117:276"/>
who was the boldeſt-impudent amongſt them, nominated one whom he thought fitteſt; who was no ſooner heard, but a generall conſent of voices, louder then the firſt, followed, all refuſing him: as one taxed with a hundred imperfections, lawfull cauſes and iuſt obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vtterly to reject him. Theſe contradicting humours growing more violent and hot, every one following his private grudge or affection, there enſued a farre greater confuſion and hurly-burly in drawing of the ſecond and third Senatour, and in naming and chooſing their ſucceſſours; about which they could never agree. As much diſorder and more conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about the election, as mutuall conſent and agreement about the demiſſion and diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. About which tumultuous trouble, when they had long and to no end laboured and wearied themſelves, they began, ſome heere, ſome there, to ſcatter and ſteale away from the aſſemblie: every one with this reſolution in his minde, that <hi>the oldeſt and beſt knowen evill, is ever more tolerable, then a freſh and vnexperienced miſchiefe.</hi> By ſeeing our ſelves piteouſly toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in continuall agitation: for what have we not done?</p>

To be bound and tied doth ſomewhat diſtract me: namely when I am wholly to relie and depend on ſo weake an inſtrument, as is my memorie. I never read this ſtory, but I feele a certaine proper and naturall offence. <hi>Lyncestez</hi> being accuſed of a conſpiracie againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> the very ſame day, that according to cuſtome, he was led forth in preſence of all the armie, to be heard in his owne defence, had in his minde a premeditated oration, which he had ſtudiouſly learn't by rote, whereof, ſtammering and faltring, hauing vttered ſome words: And wreſtling with his memory, and ſtriving to run-it ouer againe, he was ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged by the ſoldiers that were about him and ſlaine with pikes; as they who held him to be conuicted. His amazement and ſilence, ſerued them as a confeſſion. For they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that hauing had ſo long leaſure in priſon to prepare himſelfe, it was not (as they thought his memory failed him, but his guilty conſcience bridled ſo his tongue and depriued him of his wonted faculties. It was truly wel ſpoken. The very place, the company and expectation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonieth a man, when he moſt aimeth at an ambition of well-ſpeaking. What can a man doe, when a meere oration ſhall bring his life into conſequence? As for mee, if I bee tide vnto a preſcript kinde of ſpenking, what bindes mee to it, doth alſo looſe me from it, when I haue committed and wholly aſſigned my ſelfe vnto my memory; I ſo ſtrongly depend on the ſame, that I ouerwhelme it: ſhe faints vnder her owne burthen. So much as I refer my ſelfe vnto her, ſo much am I diuided from my ſelfe: vntill I make tryall of my countenance. And I have ſometimes beene in paine, in concealing the bondage wherevnto I was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: whereas my deſſigne, in ſpeaking, to repreſent a maine careleſneſſe of accent and countenance, ſuddaine and vnpremeditated, or ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſtraine or addition of the reſt of my pictures peeces. I adde, but I correct not: Firſt, becauſe he who hath hypothekiſed or engaged his labour to the world, I finde apparance, that he hath no longer right in the ſame: let him, if hee be able, ſpeake better els where, and not corrupt the worke he hath already madeſale-off; Of ſuch people, a man ſhould buy nothing, but after they are dead: let them throughly thinke on it, before they produce the ſame. Who haſtens them? My booke is alwaies one: except that according as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goes about to renew it, that the buyers depart not altogether empty-handed, I give my ſelfe law to adde thereto (as it is but vncoherent chocky, or ill joined in-laid-worke) ſome ſupernumeral embleme. They are but over-waights, which diſgrace not the firſt forme, but give ſome particular price vnto every one of the ſucceeding, by an ambitious pety ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whence notwith ſtanding, it may eaſily happen, that ſome tranſpoſition of chronology is thereto commixt: my reportes taking place according to their opportunity, and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver according to their age. Secondly, forſomuch as in regard of my ſelfe, I feare to looſe by the exchange: My vnderſtanding doth not alwayes goe forward, it ſometimes goes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo backeward: I in a manner diſtruſt mine owne fantaſies as much, though ſecond or third as I doe when they are the firſt; or preſent, as paſt. <hi>We many times correct our ſelves as fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as we taxe others vnadviſedly.</hi> I am growne aged by a number of yeares ſince my firſt publications, which were in a thouſand five hundred and foure ſcore. But I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be encreaſed one inch in wiſedome. My ſelfe now, and my ſelfe anon, are indeede two; but when better; in good ſooth I cannot tell. <hi>It were a goodly thing to be old, if wee did onely march towards amendment.</hi> It is the motion of a drunkard, ſtumbling, reeling, giddie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd, formeles; or of reedes, which the ayre dooth cauſually waue to and fro, what way it bloweth. <hi>Antiochus</hi> in his youth, had ſtoutly and vehemently written in fauor of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but being olde hee changed copy, and writ as violently againſt it: which of the two I ſhould follow, ſhould I not ever follow <hi>Antiochus?</hi> Hauing once eſtabliſhed a doubt, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to confirme the certainty of humane opinions, were it not an eſtabliſhing of a doubt, and not of the certainty? and promiſe, that had he had another age given him with aſſurance to liue, hee ſhould euer haue beene in termes of new agitations; not ſo much better, as other and different? Publike fauor hath given me ſome more bouldnes, then I hoped for: but the thing I feare moſt, is to breed a glutting ſaciety. I would rather ſpur, then bee weary. As a wiſeman of my time hath done. Commendation is ever pleaſing, from whom, from whence, or wherefore ſo ever it come: yet ought a man to be informed of the cauſe, if he will iuſtly pleaſe and applaud himſelfe therewith. Imperfections themſelues haue their meanes to be recommended. Vulgar and common eſtimation, is little happy if it come to encounter: And I am deceiued, if in my dayes, the worſt compoſitions and abſurdeſt bookes have not gained the credit of popular breath. Verily I am much beholding to diuers honeſt men, and I thanke them, that vouchſafe to take my endeuours in good parte. There is no place where the deffects of the faſhion doe ſo much appeare, as in a matter, that in it ſelfe hath nothing to recommend it. Good reader blame not me, for thoſe that paſſe here, either by the fantazie or vnwarineſſe of others: for every hand, each workman, brings his owne vnto them. I neither medle with orthography (and would onely have them follow the ancient) nor with curious pointing: I have ſmall experience in either. Where they altogether breake the ſence, I little trouble my ſelfe therewith; for at leaſt they diſcharge me. But where they will wreſt-in and ſubſtitute a falſe ſence (as often they doe) and wyre-draw me to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, then they ſpoile me. Nevertheleſſe, when the ſentence is not ſtrong or ſinnowie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meaning, an honeſt man may reject it to be mine. Hee that ſhall know how little laborious I am and how framed after mine owne faſhion, will eaſily beleeve, I would rather endite anew, as many more other Eſſayes, then ſubject my ſelfe to trace theſe over againe, for this childiſh correction. I was ſaying erewhile, that being plunged in the deepeſt mine of this new kinde of mettall, I am not onely deprived of great familiarity with men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cuſtome from mine; and other opinions, by which they holde together by a knot, commanding all other knots: but am not alſo without ſome hazard, amongſt thoſe, with whom all things are equally lawfull: moſt of which cannot now adayes empaire their market towarde our juſtice: whence the extreame degree of licenciouſneſſe proceedeth. Caſting ouer all the particular circumſtances that concerne mee, I finde no one man of ours, to whome the inhibition of our lawes coſteth any thing, eyther in gaine ceaſing, or
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:12117:278"/>
in loſſe appearing (as Lawyers ſay) more then vnto my ſelfe. And ſome there bee, that in chollericke heate and humourous fury will cracke and vaunt much, that will performe a great deale leſſe then my ſelfe, if once wee come to an equall ballance. As a houſe at all times freely open, much frequented, of great haunt and officious in entertaining all ſortes of people (for I could never bee induced, to make an implement of warre thereof: which I perceive much more willingly to bee ſought-out and flocked vnto, where it is furtheſt from my neighbours) my houſe hath merited much popular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And it were a hard matter to gourmandize my ſelfe vpon mine owne dung-hill: And I repute it a wonderfull and exemplar ſtrangeneſſe, that having vndergone ſo many ſtormie-wrackes, ſo divers changes and tumultuous-neighbour agitations, it doth yet to this day continue free, and (as I may ſay) an vndefiled virgine from ſhedding of blood, ſpoile or ſacking. For, to ſay true, it was poſſible for a man of my diſpoſition to eſcape from a conſtant and continuall forme, whatſoever it was. But the contrary invaſions, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile incurſions, alternations and viciſſitudes of fortune, round about me, have hetherto more exaſperated, then mollified the humor of the country: and recharge mee with dangers and invincible difficulties. I have eſcaped. But it greeveth me that it is rather by fortune: yea and by my diſcretion then by juſtice: And it vexeth me, to bee without the protection of the lawes and vnder any other ſafegard, then theirs. As things now ſtand, I live more then halfe by the favour of others; which is a ſevere obligation. I would not bee endebted for my ſafety, neither to the goodneſſe, nor to the goodwill of other great men, which applaude themſelves with my liberty and legalitie; nor to the facilitie of my predeceſſours or mine owne manners: for, what if I were other then I am? If my demeanour, the libertie of my converſation, or happily alliance, binde my neighbours: It is a cruelty, that they ſhould acquit themſelves of it, in ſuffring mee to live, and that they may ſay; wee give him a free and and vndiſturbed continuation of divine ſeruice, in the chaple of his houſe, whilſt all other Churches round about him are by vs prophaned and deſerted; and wee freely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and pardon him the fruition of his goods and vſe of his life, as hee maintaineth our wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and in time of neede keepeth our cattle. It is long ſince, that in my houſe, wee have a ſhare in <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Athenians praiſe, who was the generall ſtorier, depoſitary and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of his fellow-cittizens goods and purſes. I am now of opinion, that a man muſt live by lawe and authoritie, and not by recompence or grace. How many gallant men have rather made choiſe to looſe their life, then be endebted for the ſame? I ſhunne to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe to any manner of obligation. But aboue all, to which bindes mee by dutye of bondes of honour. <hi>I finde nothing ſo deare, as what is given mee: and that becauſe my will remaines engaged by a title of ingratitude:</hi> And I more willinglye receaue ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as are to bee ſould. A thing eaſie to bee beleeved; for theſe I give nothing but money; but for thoſe, I give my ſelfe. The bonde that houldes mee by the lawe of honeſtie, ſeemeth to mee much more vrgent and forcible, then that of ciuill compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I am more gentlye tide by a Notarie, then by my ſelfe. Is it not reaſon, that my conſcience bee much more engaged to that, wherein ſhee hath ſimplie and onely beene truſted? Els, my faith oweth nothing; for ſhee had nothing lent hir. Let one helpe himſelfe with the confidence or aſſurance hee hath taken from mee. I would much rather breake the priſon of a wall or of the lawes, then the bonde of my worde. I am nicely ſcrupulous in keeping of my promiſes, nay almoſt ſuperſticious; and in all ſubiects I commonly paſſe them vncertaine and conditionall. To ſuch as are of no waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſequence, I adde force with the jealouſie of my rule: ſhee rackes and chargeth mee with hir owne intereſt. Yea, in ſuch enterpriſes as are altogether mine owne and free, if I ſpeake the word, or name the point, mee thinkes I preſcribe the ſame vnto mee: and that to give it to anothers knowledge, it is to preordaine it vnto himſelfe. Me ſeemes I abſolutely promiſe, when I ſpeake. Thus I make but ſmall bragge of my propoſitions. The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I make of my ſelfe, is more mooving, forcible and ſevere, then that of the judges, who onely take me by the countenance of common obligation: the conſtraint of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is more rigorous and more ſtrictly ſevere: I faintly follow thoſe duties, to which I ſhould bee haled, if I did not goe to them. <hi>Hoc ipſum it a iuſtum eſt quod rectè fit, ſi volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarium.

I love ſo much to diſoblige and diſcharge my ſelfe, that I have ſomtimes eſteemed as profit, the ingratitudes, the offences, and indignities I had receiued of thoſe, to whom either by nature or accidents, I was by way of friendſhip ſomewhat behoulding: ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king the occaſion of their fault for a quittance and diſcharge of my debt.

Oh how much am I beholding to God, forſomuch as it hath pleaſed him, that whatſoever I enioy, I have immediately received the ſame from his grace: that he hath particularly reſerved all my debt vnto himſelfe. I moſt inſtantly beſeech his ſacred mercy, that I may never owe any man ſo much as one eſſentiall God-a-mercie. Oh thriſe fortunate libertie, that hath brought me ſo farre. May it end ſucceſſefully. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to have no manner of need of any man. <hi>In me omnis ſpes eſt mihi. All my hope for all my helpe is my ſelfe.</hi> It is a thing that every man may effect in himſelfe: but they more eaſily, whom God hath protected and ſheltred from naturall and vrgent neceſſities. Indeed it is both lamentable and dangerous, to depend of others. Our ſelves, which is the ſafeſt and moſt lawfull refuge, are not very ſure vnder our ſelves. I have nothing that is mine owne, but my ſelfe: yet is the poſſeſſion thereof partly defective and borrowed. I manure my ſelfe, both in courage (which is the ſtronger) and alſo in fortune, that if all things elſe ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, I might finde ſomething, wherewith to pleaſe and ſatisfie my ſelfe. <hi>Eleus Hippias</hi> did not onely ſtore himſelfe with learning, that in time of need hee might ioifully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe amongſt the Muſes, and be ſequeſtred from all other company: nor onely with the knowledge of Philoſophie, to teach his minde to be contented with her, and when his chance ſhould ſo diſpoſe of him, manfully to paſſe over ſuch incommodities, as exterior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie might come vnto him. But moreover he was ſo curious in learning to dreſſe his meat, to notte his haire, to make his clothes, breeches and ſhoes, that as much as could poſſibly be, he might wholly relie &amp; truſt to himſelfe, &amp; be freed from all ſorraine helpe. A man doth more freely and more blithely enioy borrowed goods: when it is not a bounden ioviſſance and
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:12117:279"/>
conſtrained through neede: and that a man hath in his will the power, and in his fortune the meanes to live without them. I know my ſelfe well. But it is very hard for mee to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any liberalitie of another body ſo pure towards me, or ſuppoſe any hoſpitalitie ſo free. ſo hartie and genuine, as would not ſeeme affected, tyrranicall, diſgraced and attended on by reproach, if ſo were that neceſſitie had forced and tied me vnto it. <hi>As to give is an ambici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualitie, and of prerogative, ſo is taking a qualitie of ſubmiſſion.</hi> Witnes the injurious and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanke refuſall, that <hi>Baiazeth</hi> made of the preſents which <hi>Themir</hi> had ſent him. And thoſe which in the behalfe of <hi>Soliman</hi> the Emperor were ſent to the Emperour of <hi>Calicut,</hi> did ſo vex him at the hart, that hee did not onely vtterly reject and ſcornfully refuſe them; ſaying, that neither himſelfe nor his predeceſſors before him, were accuſtomed to take any thing, and that their office was rather to give; but beſides he cauſed the Ambaſſadors, to that end ſent vnto him, to be caſt into a deepe dungeon. When <hi>Thetis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) flattereth <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> when the Lacedemonians flatter the Athenians, they doe not thereby intend to put them in minde of the good they have done them, which is ever hatefull, but of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they have received of them. Thoſe I ſee familiarly to employ and make vſe of all men, to begge and borrow of all men, and engage themſelves to all men, would doubtleſſe never doe it, knew they as I doe, or taſted they as I have done, the ſweete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a pure and vndepending libertie: and if therewithall (as a wiſeman ought) they did duly ponder what it is for a man to engage himſelfe into ſuch an obligation, or libertie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving bond. It may happily be paide ſometimes, But it can never be vtterly diſſolved. It is a cruell bondage, to him that loveth, throughly and by all meanes to have the free ſcope of his libertie. Such as are beſt and moſt acquainted with mee, know, whether ever they ſaw any man living, leſſe ſoliciting, leſſe craving, leſſe inportuning or leſſe begging, then I am, or that leſſe employeth or chargeth others, which if I be, and that beyond all moderne example, it is no great wonder, ſithence ſo many parts of my humours or manners contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereunto. As a naturall kinde of ſtubborneſſe; an impatience to be denied; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of my deſires and deſſeignes; and an inſufficiencie or vntowardlineſſe in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of affaires; but aboue all, my moſt fauoured qualities, lethall ſloathfulneſſe, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine liberty. By all which meanes, I have framed an habite, mortally to hate, to be behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any creature els, or to depend of other, then vnto and of my ſelfe. True it is, that before I employ the beneficence or liberalitie of an other, in any light or waighty occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſmall or vrgent neede ſoever: I doe to the vtmoſt power employ all that ever I am able, to auoide and forbeare it. My friends doe ſtrangelie importune and moleſt me, when they ſolicite and vrge mee to entreate a third man. And I deeme it a matter of no leſſe charge and imputation, to diſingage him that is endebted vnto mee, by making vſe of him, then to engage my ſelfe vnto him that oweth mee nothing. Both which conditions being removed, let them not looke for any comberſome, negotious and carefull matter at my hands (for I have denounced open warre vnto all manner of carke and care) I am commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly eaſie and ready in times of any bodies neceſſitie. And I have alſo more avoyded to receave, then ſought to giue: which (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) is alſo more facile. My fortune hath afforded me ſmall meanes to benefit others and that little ſhe hath beſtowed on me, the ſame hath ſhee alſo meanely and indifferently placed. Had ſhee made mee to bee ſo borne that I might have kept ſome ranke amongſt men, I would then have beene ambicious in procuring to bee beloved, but never to bee feared or admired. Shall I expreſſe it more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie? I would have had as much regarde vnto pleaſing, as vnto profiting. <hi>Cyrus</hi> doth moſt wiſelye, and by the mouth of an excellent Captaine and alſo a better Philoſopher, eſteeme his bountie and priſe his good deedes, farre beyonde his valour and aboue his warlike conqueſts. And <hi>Scipio</hi> the elder, whereſoever hee ſeeketh to prevaile and ſet forth himſelfe, rateth his debonairitie and valueth his humanitie above his courage and beyond his victories: and hath ever this glorious ſaying in his mouth: <hi>That hee hath left his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as much cauſe to love him, as his friends.</hi> I will therefore ſay, that if a man muſt thus owe any thing, it ought to bee vnder a more lawfull title, then that whereof I ſpeake, to which the law of this miſerable warre dooth engage me; and not of ſo great a debt, as that of my totall preſervation and whole eſtate: which dooth vnreparablie over-whelme mee.

It often befulleth me, with ſome pleaſure, to imagine what mortall dangers are, and to expect them.

And in theſe ſhort, ſudden or violent deaths, the conſequence I fore-ſee of them, affoords me more comfort, then the effect of feare. They ſay, that <hi>even an life is not the beſt, becauſe it is long, ſo death is the beſt, becauſe it is ſhort.</hi> I eſtrange not my ſelfe ſo much by being dead, as I enter into confidence with dying. I enwrap and ſhrowd my ſelfe in that ſtorme, which ſhall blinde and furiooſly wrap me, with a ready and inſenſible charge. Vea if it hapned (as ſome gardners ſay) that thoſe Roſes and Violets are ever the ſweeter and more odoriferous, that grow neere vnto Garlike and Onions, forſomuch as they ſucke and draw all the ill ſavours of the ground vnto them: ſo that theſe depraved natures would draw and ſucke all the venome of mine aire, and infection of my climate; and by their neereneſſe vnto me, make me ſo much the better and purer; that I might not loſe all. That is not; but of this, ſomething may be, forſomuch as goodneſſe is the fairer and more attracting when it is rare, and that contrarietie ſtifneth, and diverſitie encloſeth well-doing in it ſelfe, and by the jealouſie of oppoſition and glory, it doth inflame it.

I love that Cittie for hir owne ſake, and more in hir onely ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and owne being, then when it is full-fraught and embelliſhed with forraine pompe and borrowed gariſh ornaments: I love hir ſo tenderly, that even hir ſpots, hir blemiſhes and hir warts are deare vnto me. I am no perfect French-men, but by this great-matchleſſe Cittie, great in people, great in regard of the felicitie of hir ſituation; but above all, great and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable in varietie and diverſitie of commodities: The glory of <hi>France,</hi> and one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and chiefe ornaments of the world.

And ſurely, I am in as great feare for hir, as for any other part of our ſtate. So long as ſhe ſhall continue, ſo long ſhall I never want a home or retreat, to retire and ſhrowd my ſelfe at all times: a thing able to make me for get the regret of all other retreates. Not becauſe <hi>Socrates</hi> hath ſaid it, but becauſe ſuch is in truth my humour, and peradventure not without ſome excuſe, to eſteeme all men as my country-men; and as I kindly embrace a Polonian as a Frenchman; poſtpoſing this naturall bond, to vniverſall and common. I am not greatly ſtrucken with the pleaſantneſſe of naturall aire.

The change either of aire or climate doth nothing diſtemper mee. All heavens are alike to me, I am never vexed or beaten, but with internall alterations, ſuch as I produce my ſelfe, which ſurpriſe and poſſeſſe me leaſt in times of way-fairing. It is a hard matter to make mee reſolve of any iourney: but if I be once on the way, I hold out as long and as farre, as another. I ſtrive as much in ſmall, as I labour in great enterpriſes: and to prepare my ſelfe for a ſhort journey or to viſit a friend, as to vndertake a farre-ſet voiage. I have learn't to frame my journies after the Spaniſh faſhion, all at once and out-right; great and reaſonable. And in extreme heats, I travell by night, from Sunne-ſet to Sunne-riſing. The other faſhion, confuſedly and in haſte to bait by the way and dine, eſpecially in Winter, when the daies are ſo ſhort, is both troubleſome for man, and incommodious for horſe. My Iades are the better, and hold out longer. No horſe did ever faile me, that held out the firſt daies iourney with me. I water them in all waters; and onely take care of their laſt watering, that before I come to mine Inne they have way enough to beat their water. My ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to riſe in the morning, alloweth ſuch as follow mee ſufficient leaſure to dine, before wee take horſe. As for me, I never feed over-late: I commonly get an appetite in eating, and no otherwiſe: Iam never hungry but at the table. Some complaine, that being maried, and well ſtrucken in yeeres, I have enured my ſelfe, and beene pleaſed to continue this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. They doe me wrong: The beſt time for a man to leave his houſe, is when hee hath ſo ordered and ſettled the ſame, that it may continue without him: and when he hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his affaires, that they may anſwer the ancient courſe and wonted forme. It is much more indiſcretion, and an argument of want of judgement, to goe from home, and leave no truſtie guard in his houſe, and which for lacke of care may be ſlow or forgetfull in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for ſuch neceſſities, as in your abſence it may ſtand in need of. <hi>The moſt profitable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and honourableſt occupation for a matron or mother of a familie, is the occupation and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of huſwiferie. I ſee divers covetous, but few huſwives.</hi> It is the miſtreſſe-qualitie that all men ſhould ſeeke after, and above all other endevour to finde: as the only dowry, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, either to ruine and overthrow, or to ſave and enrich our houſes. Let no man ſpeake to me of it; according as experience hath taught me, I require in a maried woman the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall vertue above all others. Wherein I would have her abſolutely skilfull, ſince by my abſence I commit the whole charge, and bequeath the full government of my houſhold to her.</p>

It is a thing onely fitting Queenes or Princes; whereof ſome doubt might be made. <hi>It is ridiculous that the idleneſſe, and vniust that the litherneſſe of our wives ſhould be foſtered with our ſweat, and maintained by our travell:</hi> No man (as neere as I can) ſhall fortune to have a more free and more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute vſe, or a more quiet and more liquid fruition of his goods, then I have. <hi>If the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band bring matter; nature her ſelfe would have women to bring forme.</hi> Concerning duties of wedlocke-friendſhip, which ſome happily imagine to be intereſſed or preiudiced by the husbands abſence, I beleeve it not.

If not glee and mirth, at leaſt an orderly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled countenance of the by-ſtanders and aſſiſtants, is ſufficiently-convenient to a wiſe and diſcreet ſicke-man, who though he ſee himſelfe in a contrary ſtate, he will not picke a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with health.

Though he feele and finde himſelfe to faint and ſinke downe, he doth not altogether reject the conceits and imaginations of life, nor doth he avoid common entertainments. I will ſtudie ſickneſſe when I am in health: when it comes, it will really enough make her impreſſion, without the helpe of my imagination.

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:12117:282"/>
of them is ſomewhat new and ſtrange, and out of vſe, it giveth detraction to faire play. Yet is it true, that to him, who will goe about loyally to iniure me, me thinkes I doe ſufficiently affoord him matter, whereby he may detract and ſnarle at my avowed and knowen imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and wherewith hee may be ſatisfied, without vaine contending and idle skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If my ſelfe by preoccupating his diſcovery and accuſation, hee thinkes I barre him of his ſnarling, it is good reaſon hee take his right, towards amplification and extenſion: Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence hath her rights beyond juſtice: And that the vices, whereof I ſhew him the rootes in mee, he ſhould amplifie them to trees. Let him not onely employ there unto thoſe that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe mee, but thoſe which but threaten mee. Injurious vices, both in qualitie and in number. Let him beate mee that way. I ſhould willingly embrace the example of <hi>Dion</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. <hi>Antigonus</hi> going about to ſcoffe and quip at him touching his birth and off-ſpring, he interrupted him and tooke the word out of his mouth: I am (ſaid hee) the ſonne of a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave, a butcher, branded for a rogue, and of a whoore, whom my father by reaſon of his baſe fortune, tooke to wife: Both were puniſhed for ſome miſdeede. Being a childe, an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator bought me as a ſlave, liking me for my beautie and comelineſſe; and dying, left mee all his goods; which having tranſported into this citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> I have applied my ſelfe vnto Philoſophie. Let not Hiſtorians buſie themſelves in ſeeking newes of mee. I will at large blaz on my ſelfe, and plainely tell them the whole diſcourſe. <hi>A generous and free-minded confeſſion doth diſable a reproch and diſarme an iniurie.</hi> So it is, that when all Cards be told, me ſeemes, that I am as oft commended as diſpraiſed beyond reaſon. As alſo me thinks, that even from my infancie, both in ranke and degree of honour, I have had place given mee, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above and more, than leſſe and beneath that which appertained to mee. I ſhould better like to be in a countrie, where theſe orders might either be reformed or contemned. Amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt men, after that ſtriving or altercation for the prerogative or vpper hand in going or ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, exceedeth three replies, it becommeth incivill. I neither feare to yeeld and give place, nor to follow and proceed vnjuſtly, ſo I may avoid ſuch irkeſome and importunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations. And never did man deſire precedencie or place before me, but I quitted the ſame without grudging. Beſides the profit I reape by writing of my ſelfe, I have hoped for this other, that if ever it might happen my humours ſhould pleaſe or ſympathize with ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, he would before my death ſeeke to be acquainted with me, or to overtake mee. I have given him much ground: For, whatſoever a long acquaintance or continuall familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might have gained him in many weariſome yeares, the ſame hath hee in three dayes fully ſeene in this Regiſter; and that more ſafely and more exactly. A pleaſant fantazie is this of mine; many things I would bee loath to tell a particular man, I vtter to the whole world. And concerning my moſt ſecret thoughts and inward knowledge, I ſend my deareſt friends to a Stationers ſhop.</p>

                        <p>If by ſo good markes and tokens, I had ever knowen or heard of any one man, that in this humour had beene anſwerable to mee, I would aſſuredly have wandred very farre to finde him out: For, the exceeding joy of a ſortable and in one conſent agreeing company, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (in mine opinion) be ſufficiently endeared or purchaſed at too high a rate. <hi>Oh God! who can expreſſe the value or conceive the true worth of a friend?</hi> How true is that ancient golden ſaying, that <hi>the vſe of a friend is more neceſſary and pleaſing, then of the elements, water and fire.</hi> But to returne to my former diſcourſe: There is then no great inconvenience in dying farre from home and abroad. Wee eſteeme it a part of duty and decencie to withdraw our ſelves for naturall actions, leſſe hideous and leſſe diſgracefull then this. But alſo thoſe that come vnto that, in languiſhing manner to draw a long ſpace of life, ſhould not happily wiſh with their miſerie to trouble a whole family. Therefore did the Indians of a certaine countrie deeme it juſt and lawfull, to kill him that ſhould fall into ſuch neceſſitie. And in another of their Provinces, they though it meete to forſake him, and as well as hee could leave him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to ſeeke to ſave himſelfe. To whom at laſt, proove they not themſelves tedious and intolerable? Common offices proceed not ſo farre. Perforce you teach crueltie vnto your beſt friends; obdurating by long vſe, both wife and children, not to feele, nor to conceive, nor to moane your evils any longer. The groanes and out-cries of my chollike, cauſe no

more ruth and wailing in any body. And ſhould we conceive pleaſure by their converſation (which ſeldome hapneth, by reaſon of the diſparitie of conditions, which eaſily produceth either contempt or envy towards what man ſoever) is it not too-too much, therwith to abuſe a whole age? The more I ſhould ſee them with a good heart to ſtraine themſelves for me, the more ſhould I bewaile their paine. <hi>The law of curteſie alloweth vs to leane vpon others, but not ſo vnmanerly to lie vpon them and vnderpropt our ſelves in their ruine.</hi> As hee who cauſed little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be ſlaine, that with their innocent blood he might be cured of a malady he had. Or another who was continually ſtored with yoong teudrels or laſſes, to keepe his old-frozen limbs warme a nights, and entermix the ſweeteneſſe of their breath with his old-ſtinking and offenſive vapours. Decrepitude is a ſolitary qualitie. I am ſociable even vnto exceſſe, yet doe I thinke it reaſonable, at laſt to ſubſtract my opportunity from the ſight of the world, and hatch it in my ſelfe. Let me ſhrowd and ſhrugge my ſelfe into my ſhell, as a tortoiſe: and learne to ſee men, without taking hold of them. I ſhould outrage them in ſo ſteepe a paſſage. It is now high time to turne from the company. But heere will ſomeſay, that in theſefarre journies you may peradventure fall into ſome miſerable dog-hole or poore cottage, where you ſhall want all needfull things. To whom I anſwer, that for things moſt neceſſary inſuch caſes, I ever carry moſt of them with me: And that, <hi>where-ever wee are, wee cannot poſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void fortune, if ſhe once take vpon her to perſecute vs.</hi> When I am ſicke, I want nothing that is extraordinarie: what nature cannot worke in me, I will not have a Bolus, or a gliſter to effect. At the very beginning of my agues or ſickeneſſes that caſt me downe, whilſt I am yet whole in my ſenſes and neere vnto health, I reconcile my ſelfe to God by the laſt duties of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; whereby I finde my ſelfe free and diſcharged; and thinke I have ſo much more reaſon and authoritie over my ſickeneſſe, I finde leſſe want of Notaries and counſell, then of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What I have not diſpoſed of my affaires or ſettled of my ſtate when I was in perfect health, let none expect I ſhould doe it beeing ſicke. Whatever I will doe for the ſervice of death, is alwayes ready done. I dare not delay it one onely day. And if nothing be done, it is as much to ſay, that either ſome doubt hath delaide the choiſe: For, <hi>ſometimes it is a good choiſe, not to chuſe at all:</hi> Or that abſolutely I never intended to doe any thing. I write my booke to few men, and to few yeares. Had it beene a matter of laſting continuance, it ſhould have beene compiled in a better and more poliſhed language: According to the continuall variation, that hitherto hath followed our French tongue. Who may hope, that it's preſent forme ſhall be in vſe fifty yeares hence? It dayly changeth and ſlips our hands: and ſince I could ſpeake the ſame, it is much altred and well nigh halfe varied. We ſay it is now come to a full perfection. There is no age but ſaith as much of hirs. It lies not in my power, ſo long as it glideth and differeth and altereth as it doth, to keepe it at a ſtay. It is for excellent and profitable compoſitions to faſten it vnto them, whoſe credit ſhall either diminiſh or encreaſe, according to the fortune of our ſtate. For all that, I feare not to inſert therein divers private articles, whoſe vſe is conſumed amongſt men living now adayes: and which concerne the particular knowledge of ſome, that ſhall further ſee into it, then with a common vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. When all is done, I would not (as I often ſee the memory of the deceaſed toſſed too and fro) that men ſhould deſcant and argue: <hi>Thus and thus be iudged; thus he lived; thus he ment: had he ſpoken when his life left him, he would have given I wot what: There is no man knew him better then my ſelfe.</hi> Now, as much as modeſtie and decorum doth permit me; I heere give a taſte of my inclinations and an eſſay of my affection: which I doe more freely and more willingly by word of mouth, to any that ſhall deſire to be throughly informed of them. But ſo it is, that if any man ſhall looke into theſe memorialls, he ſhall finde, that either I have ſaid all, or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigned all. What I cannot expreſſe, the ſame I point at with my finger.</p>

                           <hi>he, what they are not.</hi> And if with might and maine, I had not vpheld a friend of mine whom I have lately loſt, he had ſurely been mangled and torne in a thouſand contrrary ſhapes. But to make an end of my weake humours: I confeſſe, that in travelling I ſeldome alight in any place or come to any Inne, but firſt of all I caſt in my minde whether I may conveniently lie there, if I ſhould chance to fall ſicke; or dying, die at my eaſe and take my death quietly. I will, as neere as I can be lodged in ſome convenient part of the houſe, and in particular from all noiſe or ſtinking favours; in no cloſe, filthy or ſmoaky chamber. I ſeeke to flatter death by theſe frivolous circumſtances: Or as I may rather ſay, to diſcharge my ſelfe from all other trouble or encombrance; that ſo I may wholly apply and attend her, who without that ſhall happily lie very heavy vpon me. I will have her take a full ſhare of my lives eaſes and commodities; it is a great part of it and of much conſequence, and I hope it ſhall not belie what is paſt. Death hath ſome formes more eaſie then others, and aſſumeth divers qualities; according to all mens fantazies. Among the naturall ones, that proceeding of weakeneſſe and heavy dulneſſe, to me ſeemeth gentle and pleaſant. Among the violent I imagine a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice more hardly, then a ruine that overwhelmes me: and a cutting blow with a ſword, then a ſhot of an harquebuſe: and I would rather have choſen to drinke the potion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> then wound my ſelfe as <hi>Cato</hi> did. And though it bee all one yet doth my imagination per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a difference, as much as is betweene death and life, to caſt my ſelfe into a burning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, or in the channell of a ſhallow river. <hi>So fooliſhly doth our feare reſpect more the meane, then the effect.</hi> It is but one inſtant; but of ſuch moment, that to paſſe the ſame according to my deſire, I would willingly renounce many of my lives-dayes. Since all mens fantazies, finde either exceſſe or diminution in her ſharpenſſe; ſince every man hath ſome choiſe betweene the formes of dying, let vs trie a little further, whether we can finde out ſome one, free from all ſorrow and griefe. Might not one alſo make it ſeeme voluptuous, as did thoſe who died with <hi>Anthonic</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra?</hi> I omit to ſpeake of the ſharpe and exemplar efforts, that philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and religion produce. But amongſt men of no great fame, ſome have beene found (as one <hi>Petronius,</hi> and one <hi>Tigillinus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>) engaged to make themſelves away, who by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of their preparations have in a manner lulled the ſame aſleepe. They have made it paſſe and glide away, even in the midſt of the ſecurity of their accuſtomed paſtimes and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton recreations: Amongſt harlots and good felowes; no ſpeech of comfort, no mention of will or teſtament, no ambitious affectation of conſtancie, no diſcourſe of their future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no compunction of ſinnes committed, no apprehenſion of their ſoules-health, ever troubling them; amid ſports, playes, banketting, ſurfetting, chambring, jeſting, muſicke and ſinging of amorous verſes: and all ſuch popular and common entertainments. Might not wee imitate this manner of reſolution in more honeſt affaires and more commendable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts? <hi>And ſince there are deaths good vnto wiſe men and good vnto fooles, let vs find ſome one that may be good vnto ſuch as are betweene both.</hi> My imagination preſents me ſome eaſie and milde countenance thereof, and (ſince we muſt all die) to bee deſired. The tyrants of <hi>Rome</hi> have thought, they gave that criminall offender his life, to whom they gave the free choiſe of death. But <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> a Philoſopher ſo delicate, ſo modeſt and ſo wiſe, was he not forced by reaſon, to dare to vtter this verſe, latinized by <hi>Cicero:</hi>

                        <p>Fortune giveth the facilitie of my lives-condition ſome aide; having placed it in ſuch a time, wherein it is neither needefull nor comberſome vnto my people. It is a condition I would have accepted in all the ſeaſons of my age: but in this occaſion to truſſe vp bag and baggage, and take vp my bed and walke: I am particularly pleaſed, that when I ſhall die, I ſhall neither breede pleaſure nor cauſe ſorrow in them. Shee hath cauſed (which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of an artiſt) that ſuch as by my death may pretend any materiall benefit, receive thereby elſewhere, jointly a materiall loſſe and hinderance. Death lies ſometimes heavie vpon vs, in that it is burthenſome to others: and intereſſeth vs with their intereſt, almoſt as much as with ours: and ſomtimes more; yea altogether. In this inconveniency of lodging that I ſeeke, I neither entermix pompe nor amplitude; For, I rather hate it. But a certaine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and homely proprietie, which is commonly found in places where leſſe Arte is, and that
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:12117:284"/>
nature honoureth with ſome grace peculiar vnto her ſelfe. <hi>Non ampliter ſed munditer convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium. Plus ſalis quàm ſumptus. Not a great, but a neate feaſt. More conceite then cost.</hi>

                        <p>And then, it is for thoſe, who by their vrgent affaires are compelled to travell in the midſt of deepe Winter, and amongeſt the Griſons, to be ſurprized by ſuch extreamities in their journies. But I, who for the moſt part never travell, but for pleaſure, will neither bee ſo ill adviſed, nor ſo ſimply guided. If the way be fowle on my right hand, I take the left: If I find my ſelfe ill at eaſe or vnfit to ride, I ſtay at home. Which doing, and obſerving this courſe, in very truth I ſee no place, and come no where, that is not as pleaſant, as convenient and as commodious as mine owne houſe. True it is, that I ever finde ſuperfluitie ſuperfluous: and obſerve a kinde of troubleſomeneſſe in delicateneſſe and plenty. Have I omitted or left any thing behind me that was worth the ſeeing? I returne backe; It is ever my way, I am never out of it. I trace no certaine line, neither right nor crooked. Comming to any ſtrange place, finde I not what was tould mee? As it often fortuneth, that others judgements agree not with mine, and have moſt times found them falſe, I grieve not at my labour: I have learned that what was reported to bee there, is not. I have my bodies complexion as free, and my taſte as common, as any man in the world. The diverſity of faſhions betweene one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, concerneth mee nothing, but by the varieties-pleaſure. <hi>Each cuſtome hath his reaſon.</hi> Bee the trenchers or diſhes of wood, of pewter or of earth: bee my meate boyled, roſted or baked; butter or oyle, and that of Olives or of Wall-nuts; hot or colde; I make no difference; all is one to me: And as one, that is growing old, I accuſe the generous facultie; and had neede that delicatneſſe and choiſe, ſhould ſtay the indiſcretion of my appetite, and ſometime eaſe and ſolace my ſtomacke. When I have beene out of <hi>France,</hi> and that to do me curteſie, ſome have asked me, whether I would be ſerved after the French maner, I have je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted at them, and have ever thruſt-in amongeſt the thickeſt tables and fulleſt of ſtrangers. I am aſhamed to ſee our men beſotted with this fooliſh humor, to fret and chafe, when they ſee any faſhions contrary to theirs. They thinke themſelves out of their element, when they are out of their Village. Where ever they come they keepe their owne country faſhions, and hate, yea and abhorre all ſtrange maners: Meete they a countriman of theirs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> they feaſt that good fortune: And what doe they? Marry cloſe and joyne together, to blame, to condemne and to ſcorne ſo many barbarous faſhions as they ſee. And why not Barbarous, ſince not French? Nay happily they are the better ſort of men, that have noted and ſo much exclaimed againſt them. Moſt take going out but for comming home. They travell cloſe and covered, with a ſilent and incommunicable wit, defending themſelves from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ſome vnknowne ayre. What I ſpeake of ſuch, puts mee in minde in the like matter, of that I have heretofore perceived in ſome of your yoong Courtiers. They onely converſe with men of their coate; and with diſdaine or pitty looke vpon vs, as if we were men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. Take away their new fangled, myſterious and affected courtly complements, and they are out of their byaſe. As farre to ſeeke and ſhort of vs, as we of them. That ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is true; That <hi>An honest man is a man compounded.</hi> Cleane contrary, I travell fully glutted with out faſhions: Not to ſeeke Gaskoines in <hi>Sicilie;</hi> I have left over many at home. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke for Graecians and Perſians: Thoſe I accoſt, them I conſider, and with ſuch I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor to be acquainted: to that I prepare and therein I employ my ſelfe. And which is more, me ſeemeth, I have not met with many maners, that are not worth ours. Indeede I have not wandred farre, ſcarſly have I loſt the ſight of our Chimnies. Moreover, moſt of the caſuall companies you meete withall by the way, have more incommodity than pleaſure: a matter I doe not greatly take hold of, and leſſe now that age dooth particularize and in ſome ſort ſequeſter me from common formes. You ſuffer for other, or others endure for you. The one inconvenience is yrkeſome, the other troubleſome: but yet the laſt is (in my conceipt) more rude. <hi>It is a rare, chaunce and ſeld-ſeene fortune, but of exceeding ſolace and inestimable woorth, to have an honest man, of ſingular experience, of a ſound iudgement, of a reſolute vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and constant reſolution, and of manners comformable to yours, to accompany or follow you with a goodwill.</hi> I have found great want of ſuch a one in all my voyages. Which company a man muſt ſeeke with diſcretion and with great heed obtaine, before he wander from home. With me no pleaſure is fully delightſome without communication; and no delight abſolute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept imparted. I do not ſo much as apprehend one rare conceipt, or conceive one excellent good thought in my minde, but me thinks I am much grieved and grievouſty perplexed, to

If I vexed as other men, my ſoule ſhould never have ſtrength to beare th'alaroms and emotions, that follow ſuch as embrace much. She would preſently be diſplaced by this inteſtine agitation. If at any time I have beene vrged to the managing of ſtrange affaires, I have promiſed to vndertake them with my hand, but not with my lunges, and liver; to charge, and not to incorporate them into mee; to have a care, but nothing at all to bee over paſſionate of them: I looke to them, but I hatch them not. I worke enough to diſpoſe and direct the domeſticall troubles within mine owne entrailes and veines, without harbouring, or importune my ſelfe with any forraine employments: And am ſufficiently intereſſed with my proper, naturall and eſſentiall affaires, without ſeeking others buſineſſes.

What I wiſh for, I commonly deſire the ſame but mildely; and deſire but little: ſo likewiſe I ſeldome employ and quietly embuſie my ſelfe, What ever they intend and act, they doe it with all their will and vehemency. There are ſo many dangerous ſteps, that for the more ſecurity, wee muſt ſomewhat ſlightly and ſuperficially ſlide through the world, and not force it. <hi>Pleaſure it ſelfe is painefull in it's beight.</hi>

                        <p>Fortune would have a ſhare in my promotion by this particular circumſtance, which ſhee of her owne added thereunto; not altogether vaine. For <hi>Alexander</hi> diſdained the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Ambaſſadors, who offred him the freedome and Burgeoiſe of their Cittie, but when they told him that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> were likewiſe in their regiſters, hee kindely thanked them and accepted their offer. At my firſt arrivall, I faithfully diſciphered and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſplaied my ſelfe, ſuch as I am indeede: without memorie, without diligence, without experience and without ſufficiencie; ſo likewiſe without hatred, without ambition, without covetouſneſſe and without violence: that ſo they might bee duely inſtructed what ſervice they might, or hope, or expect at my hands. And forſomuch as the knowledge they had of my deceaſed father, and the honour they bare vnto his memory, had mooved them to chuſe me to that dignitie, I told them plainely, I ſhould be very ſorie, that any man ſhould worke ſuch an opinion in my will, as their affaires and Cittie had done in my fathers, while he held the ſaid government, wherevnto they had called mee. I remembred to have ſeene him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infant, and he an old man, his minde cruelly turmoiled with this publike toile; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the ſweete aire of his owne houſe, wherevnto the weakeneſſe of his age had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tied him; neglecting the care of his health and family, in a maner deſpiſing his life, which as one engaged for them, he much endangered, riding long and painefull journeies for them. Such a one was he: which humor proceeded from the bountie and goodneſſe of his nature. Never was minde more charitable or more popular. This courſe, which I commend in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I love not to follow: Neither am I without excuſe. He had heard, that <hi>a man muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelfe for his neighbour: that in reſpect of the generall, the particular was not to bee regarded.</hi> Moſt of the worldes-rules and precepts hold this traine, to drive vs out of our ſelves into the wide world, to the vſe of publike ſociety.

It is likely, that the true point of friendſhip, which everie man oweth to himſelfe, is to be found in theſe. Not a falſe amitie, which makes vs embrace glorie, knowledge, riches and ſuch like, with a principall and immoderate affection, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our being; nor an effeminate and indiſcrecte friendſhip; Wherein hapneth as to the Ivie, which corrupts and ruines the Wals it claſpeth: But a ſound and regular amity, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable and pleaſant. Who ſo vnderſtandeth all her duties and exerciſeth them, hee is rightly endenized in the Muſes cabinet: Hee hath attained the tipe of humane Wiſedome and the perfection of our happineſſe. This man knowing exactly what hee oweth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, findeth, that he ought to employ the vſe of other men and of the world vnto himſelfe; which to performe, he muſt contribute the duties and offices that concerne him vnto pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſociety. <hi>He that lives not ſomewhat to others, liveth little to himſelfe.

And for this onely wee live heere. As he that ſhould forget to live well and religiouſly, and by inſtructing and directing others, ſhould thinke himſelfe acquitted of his duty; would be deemed a foole: Even ſo, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh to live healthy and merrily himſelfe, therwith to ſerve another, in mine opinion taketh a bad and vnnaturall courſe.

Simply to moove or be dooing, coſt's it ſo little, that even ſleeping it is mooving and dooing. But it muſt have it's motion with diſcretion. For the body receiveth the charges impoſed him, juſtly as they are: But the ſpirit extendeth them, and often to his hinderance makes them heavy; giving them what meaſure it pleaſeth. Like things are effected by divers effortes and different contentions of will. The one may goe without the other. For, how many men doe dayly hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in warre which they regard not, and preſſe into the danger of battells, the loſſe wherof ſhall no whit breake their next ſleep?

he faines, he yeelds, hee deferres at his pleaſure according to the occaſions of neceſſity: hee failes of his attempt, without torment or affliction: ready and prepared for a new enterpriſe. He marcheth alwayes with the reines in his hand. Hee that is beſotted with this violent and tyrannicall intention, doth neceſſarily declare much indiſcretion and injuſtice. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his deſire tranſports him. They are raſh motions, and if fortune helpe not much, of little fruit. Philoſophie wills vs to baniſh choller in the puniſhment of offences; not to the end revenge ſhould be more moderate, but contrary, more weighty and ſurely ſet on: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this violence ſeemeth to bee a let. Choller doth not onely trouble, but wearieth the executioners armes. This paſſionate heat dulleth and conſumes their force. As in too much ſpeede, <hi>feſtinatio tarda eſt; Hastineſſe is ſlow.</hi> Haſte makes waſte, and hinders and ſtayes it ſelfe: <hi>Ipſa ſe velocitas implicat; Swiftneſſe entangles it ſelfe.</hi> As for example, according as by ordinarie cuſtome I perceive, covetouſneſſe hath no greater let, then it ſelfe. The more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and extended it is, the leſſe effectuall and fruitfull. Commonly it gathers wealth more ſpeedily being masked with a ſhew of liberality. A very honeſt Gentleman and my good friend, was likely to have endangered the health of his body, by an over paſſionate attention and earneſt affection to the affaires of a Prince, who was his Maiſter. Which Maiſter hath thus deſcribed himſelfe vnto me: That as another, hee diſcerneth and hath a feeling of the burthen of accidents: but ſuch as have no remedie, hee preſently reſolveth to ſuffer with patience: For the reſt, after hee hath appointed neceſſary proviſions, which by the vivacitie and nimbleneſſe of his wit hee ſpeedily effects, hee then attends the event with quietneſſe. Verily, I have ſeene in him at one inſtant a great careleſneſſe and liberty, both in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and countenance: Even in important and difficult affaires. I finde him more magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and capable, in bad then in good fortune. His loſſes are to him more glorious, than his victories; and his mourning than his triumphs. Conſider how in meere vaine and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous actions, as at cheſſe, tennis and ſuch like ſports, this earneſt and violent engaging with an ambicious deſire to winne, doth preſently caſt both minde and limmes into diſorder and indiſcretion. Wherein a man doth both dazle his ſight and diſtemper his whole body. Hee who demeaneth himſelfe with moſt moderation both in winning and looſing, is ever nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt vnto himſelfe, and hath his wits beſt about him. The leſſe hee is mooved or paſſionate in play, the more ſafely doth he governe the ſame, and to his greater advantage. We hindet the mindes ſeazure and holdfaſt, by giving her ſo many things to ſeize vpon. Some wee ſhould onely preſent vnto her, others faſten vpon hir, and others incorporate into hir. Shee may ſee and feele all things, but muſt onely feede on hir ſelfe: And bee inſtructed in that which properly concerneth hir, and which meerely belongeth to her eſſence and ſubſtance. <hi>The lawes of nature teach vs what is iuſt and fit for vs.</hi> After the wiſe-men have told vs, that according to nature no man is indigent or wanteth, and that each-one is poore but in his owne opinion, they alſo diſtinguiſh ſubtilly, the deſires proceeding from Nature, from ſuch as grow from the diſorders of our fantaſie. Thoſe whoſe end may be diſcerned are meerely hers; and ſuch as flie before vs and whoſe end we cannot attaine, are properly ours. <hi>Want of goods may eaſily be cured, but the poverty of the minde, is incurable.</hi>

tranſubſtantiate themſelves, into as many new formes and ſtrange beings, as they vndertake charges: and who emprelate themſelves even to the heart and entrailes; and entraine their offices even ſitting on their cloſe ſtoole. I cannot teach them to diſtinguiſh the ſalutations and cappings of ſuch as regard them, from thoſe that reſpect either their office, their traine or their mule. <hi>Tantum ſe fortunae permitunt, etiam vt naturam dediſcant. They give themſelves ſo much over to Fortune, as they forget Nature.</hi> They ſwell in mind and puffe vp their naturall diſcourſe, according to the dignity of their office. The Maior of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Michaell</hi> Lord of <hi>Montaigne,</hi> have ever beene two, by an evident ſeparation. To bee an advocate or a Treaſurer, one ſhould not be ignorant of the craft incident to ſuch callings. An honeſt man is not comptable for the vice and folly of his trade, and therfore ought not to refuſe the exerciſe of it. It is the cuſtome of his country; and there is profite in it. <hi>Wee muſt live by the worlde, and ſuch as we finde it, ſo make vſe of it.</hi> But the judgement of an Emperour ſhould be above his Empire; and to ſee and conſider the ſame as a ſtrange accident. Hee ſhould know how to enjoy himſelfe apart; and communicate himſelfe as <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> at leaſt to himſelfe. I cannot ſo abſolutely or ſo deeply engage my ſelfe. When my will gives me to any party, it is not with ſo violent a bond, that my vnderſtanding is thereby infected. In the preſent inteſtine trouble of our State, my intereſt hath not made mee forget neither the commendable qualities of our adverſaries, nor the reproachfull of thoſe I have followed. They partially extoll what ever is on their ſide: I doe not ſo much as excuſe the greater number of my friends-actions. A good Oratour looſeth not his grace by pleading againſt me. The inticrateneſſe of our debate remooved, I have maintained my ſelfe in equanimity and pure indifferency. <hi>Neque extra neceſſitates belli, praecipuum odium gero, Nor beare I capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hatred, when I am out of the neceſſitie of warre.</hi> Wherein I glory, for that commonly I ſee men erre in the contrary. Such as extend the choller and hatred, beyond their affaires (as moſt men doe) ſhew that it proceedes elſewhence, and from ſome private cauſe: Even as one being cured of an vlcer, and his fever remaineth ſtill, declareth it had another more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den begining. It is the reaſon they beare none vnto the cauſe, in generall: and forſomuch as it concerneth the intereſt of all, and of the ſtate: But they are vexed at it, onely for this; that it toucheth them in private. And therefore are they diſtempered with a particular paſſion, both beyond juſtice and publicke reaſon. <hi>Non tam omnia vniverſi, quàm ea, qua ad quemque pertinent, ſinguli carpebant. All did not ſo much finde fault withall, as every one with thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to every one.</hi> I will have the advantage to be for vs, which though it be not, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage not.

But I affect not to be noted a private enemy to others, and beyond generall reaſon, I greatly accuſe this vicious forme of obſtinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting: He is of the League, becauſe he admireth the grace of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> or he is a <hi>Hugonote,</hi> forſomuch as the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> activity amazeth him: He findes fault in the Kings behaviours, therefore he is ſedicious in his heart. I would not give the magiſtrate my voice, that he had reaſon to condemne a booke, becauſe an hereticke was therein named and extolled to be one of the beſt Poets of this age. Dare wee not ſay that a theefe hath a good leg? if he have ſo indeede; If ſhe be a ſtrumpet, muſt ſhe needes have a ſtinking breath? In wiſer ages, revoked they the prowd title of <hi>Capitolinus,</hi> they had formely given to <hi>Marcus Manlius,</hi> as the preſerver of religion and publicke liberty? Suppreſſed they the memory of his liberality, his deeds of armes and military rewards granted to his vertues, becauſe to the prejudice of his countries lawes, he afterward affected a Royalty? If they once conceive a hatred againſt an Orator or an advocate, the next day he becommeth barbarous and vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent. I have elſewhere diſcourſed of zeale, which hath driven good men into like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. For my ſelfe, I can ſay: that he doth wickedly, and this vertuouſly. Likewiſe, in prognoſtickes or ſiniſter events of affaires, they will have every man blinde or dull in his owne cauſe: and that our perſwaſion and judgement, ſerve not the truth but the project of our deſires. I ſhould rather erre in the other extreamity; So much I feare my deſire might corrupt me. Conſidering, I ſomewhat tenderly diſtruſt my ſelfe in things I moſt deſire. I have in my dayes ſeene wonders, in the indiſcreete and prodigious facility of people, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their hopes and beliefes, to bee led and governed, as it hath pleaſed and beſt fitted their leaders: above a hundred diſcontents, one in the neck of another: and beyond their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and dreames. I wonder no more at thoſe, whom the apiſh toyes of <hi>Apollonius</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> have ſeduced and blinded. Their ſence and vnderſtanding is wholly ſmothered
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:12117:293"/>
in their paſſion. Their diſcretion hath no other choiſe but what pleaſeth them and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their cauſe. Which I had eſpecially obſerved in the beginning of our diſtempered fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and factious troubles. This other which is growne ſince, by imitation ſurmounteth the ſame. Whereby I obſerve, that it is an inſeparable quality of popular errours. The firſt beeing gone, opinions enterſhocke one another, following the winde, as waves doe. They are no members of the body, if they may renounce it; if they folow not the common courſe. But truely they wrong the juſt partes, when they ſeeke to helpe them with fraude or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts. I have alwayes contradicted the ſame. This meane is but for ſicke braines: The healthy have ſurer and honeſter wayes to maintaine their reſolutions and excuſe all contrary accidents. The Heavens never ſaw ſo weighty a diſcord and ſo harmefull a hatred, as that betweene <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> nor ever ſhall heereafter: Mee ſeemeth notwithſtanding, I ſee in thoſe noble and Heroicall mindes, an exemplar and great moderation of the one toward the other. It was a jelouſie of honour and emulation of command, which tranſported them, not to a furious and indiſcreete hatred; without malice or detraction. In their ſharpeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites, I diſcover ſome reliques of reſpect and cinders of well-meaning affection. And I imagine, that had it beene poſſible, either of them deſired rather to effect his purpoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out overthrowing his competitour, than by working his vtter ruine. Note how contrarie the proceeding was betweene <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius.</hi> We muſt not runne headlong after our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and private intereſts. As in my youth, I ever oppoſed my ſelfe to the motions of love, which I felt to vſurpe vpon me; and laboured to diminiſh it's delights, leſt in the end it might vanquiſh and captivate me to his mercy: So do I now in all other occaſions, which my will apprehendeth with an over great appetite. I bend to the contrary of my diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I ſee the ſame plunged and drunke with it's owne Wine. I ſhunne ſo farre foorth to nouriſh hir pleaſure, as I may not revoke it without a bloody loſſe. Thoſe mindes which through ſtupidity ſee things but by halves, enjoy this happineſſe, that ſuch as be hurtfull, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them leaſt: It is a ſpirituall leproſie, that hath ſome ſhew of health; and ſuch a health, as Philoſophy doth not altogether contemne. But yet it may not lawfully bee termed wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; as we often doe. And after this manner did in former times ſome body mocke <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> who in the dead of Winter, went all naked, embracing an image of ſnow, to try his patience; Who meeting him in this order, ſaid thus vnto him; <hi>Art thou now very colde; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all,</hi> anſwered <hi>Diogenes. What thinkeſt thou to doe then, that is either hardor exemplar by ſtanding in the colde?</hi> replied the other: <hi>To meaſure conſtancy, we muſt neceſſarily know ſufferance,</hi> But ſuch minds as muſt behold croſſe events, and fortunes injuries in their height and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which muſt weigh and taſte them according to their naturall bitterneſſe and charge; let them employ their skill and keep themſelves from embracing the cauſes, and divert their approaches. What did King <hi>Cotys?</hi> He payed liberally for that goodly and rich Veſſell, which one had preſented vnto him, but forſomuch as it was exceeding brittle, hee preſently brake it himſelfe, that ſo betimes he might remoove ſo eaſie an occaſion of choller againſt his ſervants. I have in like ſort ſhunned confuſion in my affaires, and ſought not to have my goods contiguous to my neighbours, and to ſuch as I am to be linked in ſtrict friendſhippe: Whence commonly enſue cauſes of alienation and vnkindneſſe. I have heeretofore loved the hazardous play of Cardes and Dice; I have long ſince left it, onely for this that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any faire ſemblance I made in my loſſes, I was inwardly diſquieted. Let a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who is to take a lie or endure an outragious wrong, and cannot admit a bad excuſe for paiment or ſatisfaction, avoid the progreſſe of contentious altercations. I ſhunne melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike complexions and froward men, as infected. And in matters, I cannot talke-of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intereſt and emotion, I meddle not with them, except duty conſtraine mee therevnto. <hi>Melius non incipient, quam deſinent. They ſhall better not beginne, than leave off.</hi> The ſureſt way, is then to prepare our ſelves before occaſion. I know that ſome wiſemen have taken another courſe; and have not feared to engage and vehemently to inſinuate themſelves into diverſe objects. Thoſe aſſure themſelves of their owne ſtrength, vnder which they ſhrowd themſelves againſt all manner of contrary events, making miſchiefs to wreſtle one againſt another, by vigor and vertue of patience:</p>

The fauours, which fortune might have given mee, as aliances and acquaintances with ſuch as have Soveraigne authority in thoſe things; I have, in my conſcience done much inſtantly to evoide imploying them to others prejudice, and not over-value my rights above their worth. To conclude, I have ſo much prevailed by my endevours (in a good houre I may ſpeake it) that I am yet a virgin for any ſutes in law, which have notwithſtanding not omitted gently to offer mee their ſervice, and vnder pretence of lawfull titles inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into my allowance, would I but have given eare vnto them.

What ruine did our laſt Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> runne into, for the quarrell of a cart-load of ſheepes-skinnes?

For, <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caſar</hi> are but the new buddings and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of two others.

To embarke him, there needes but little adviſement, but being once-in, all parts doe worke; Then are greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions required, more difficult and important. How farre more eaſie is it not to enter, than to get forth? We muſt proceed contrary to the brier, which produceth a long and ſtraight ſtalke at the firſt ſpringing; but after, as tired and out of breath, it makes many and thicke knots, as if they were pawſes, ſhewing to have no more that vigor and conſtancie.

Moſt agreements of our moderne quarrels, are ſhamefull and falſe: Wee onely ſeeke to ſave apparances, and therewhilſt betray and diſa-vow our true intentions. We ſalve the deede: We know how wee ſpake it, and in what ſence the by-ſtanders know it: yea and our friends to whom wee would have our advantages knowne. It is to the prejudice of our libertie and intereſt of our reſolutions-honour, that we diſ-avow our thoughts and ſeeke for ſtarting holes in falſhood, to make our agreements. Wee belie ourſelves, to ſalve a lie we have given to another. We muſt not looke whether your action or word may admitte another interpretation, but it is your owne true and ſincere conſtruction, that you muſt now maintaine; whatſoever it coſt you. It is to your vertue and to your conſcience that men ſpeake; parts that ought not to be diſguiſed. Leave we theſe baſe courſes, wrangling ſhifts and verball meanes, to petty-fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Lawyers. The excuſes and reparations, or ſatisfactions, which dayly I ſee made; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and given to purge indiſcretion, ſeeme to mee more foule than indiſcretion it ſelfe. Better were it for one to offend his adverſarie againe, than in giving him ſuch ſatisfaction, to wrong himſelfe ſo much. You have braved him mooved by choller, and now you ſeeke to pacifie and flatter him in your cold and better ſence: Thus you abaſe your ſelfe more, than you were before exalted. I find no ſpeech ſo vicious in a Gentleman, as I deeme any recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he ſhall make, diſhonorable; eſpecially if it be wreſted from him by authoritie: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as obſtinacie is in him more excuſable, than cowardize.

                           <hi>ſemper Natura, tum etiam aetate iam quietus. Both ever quiet by Nature, and now becauſe of yeeres.</hi> And if at any time they are debauched to ſome rude and piercing impreſſion, it is in truth without my conſent. From which naturall ſlackneſſe, one muſt not therefore inferre any proofe of diſabilitie: For, <hi>Want of care and lacke of iudgement are two thinges:</hi> And leſſe vnkindneſſe and ingratitude toward thoſe Citizens, who to gratifie me, employed the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all the meanes they could poſſibly; both before they knew me and ſince. And who did much more for me, in appoynting me my charge the ſecond time, then in chooſing me the firſt. I love them with all my heart, and wiſh them all the good that may be. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if occaſion had beene offered, I would haveſpared nothing to have done them ſervice. I have ſtirred and laboured for them, as I doe for my ſelfe. They are a good people, warlike and generous; yet capable of obedience and diſcipline, and fit for good employment, if they be well guided. They ſay likewiſe, that I paſſed over this charge of mine without any deede of note or great ſhew. It is true. Moreover, they accuſe my ceſſation, when as all the world was convicted of too much dooing: I have a moſt nimble motion, where my will doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie me. But this point is an enemie vnto perſeverance. Whoſoever will make vſe of mee, according to my ſelfe, let him employ me in affaires, that require vigor and liberty: that have a ſhort, a ſtraight, and therewithall a hazardous courſe: I may peradventure ſomewhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile therein. Whereas if it be tedious, craftie, laborious, artificiall and intricate, they ſhall doe better to addreſſe themſelves to ſome other man. All charges of importance are not difficult. I was prepared to labour ſomewhat more earneſtly, if there had beene great neede. For it lyes in my power, to doe ſomething more than I make ſhew-of, and than I love to doe. To my knowledge, I have not omitted any motion that duty required earneſtly at my hands. I have eaſily forgotten thoſe, which ambition blendeth with dutie and cloketh with her title. It is they, which moſt commonly fill the eyes and eares, and ſatisfie men. Not the thing it ſelfe, but the apparance payeth them. If they heare no noiſe, they imagine we ſleepe. My humours are contrary to turbulent humours. I could pacifie an inconvenience or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without troubling my ſelfe, and chaſtiſe a diſorder without alteration.</p>
                        <p>Have I neede of choller and inflammation; I borrow it, and therewith maske my ſelfe: My maners are muſtie, rather wallowiſh then ſharpe. I accuſe not a Magiſtrate that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, ſo they that are vnder it ſleepe alſo. So ſleepe the lawes. For my part, I commend a gliding, an obſcure and repoſed life: <hi>Neque ſubmiſſam &amp; abiectam, neque ſe efferentem. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too abiect and ſubmiſſe, nor vaunting it ſelfe too much.</hi> But my fortune will have it ſo; I am<note place="margin">Cic. off. lib. 1.</note> deſcended of a family that hath lived without noiſe and tumult: and of long continuance particularly ambicious of integritie. Our men are ſo framed to agitation and oſtentations that goodneſſe, moderation, equitie, conſtancie, and ſuch quiet and meane qualities, are no more hard-of. Rough bodies are felt, ſmooth ones are handled imperceptibly. Sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is felt, health little or not at all: nor things that annoint vs, in regard of ſuch as ſting vs, It is an action for ones reputation and private commoditie, and not for the common good, to refer that to be done in the market place, which a man may do in the counſel-chamber: &amp; at noone day, what might have beene effected the night before: and to be jealous to doe that himſelfe, which his fellow can performe as well. So did ſome Surgeons of <hi>Greece</hi> ſhew the operations of their skill, vpon ſcaffolds, in view of all paſſengers, thereby to get more practiſe and cuſtome. They ſuppoſe, that good orders cannot be vnderſtood, but by the ſound of a trumpet. Ambition is no vice for pettie companions, and for ſuch endevours as ours. One ſaide to <hi>Alexander:</hi> your father will leave you a great commaund, eaſie and peacefull: the boy was envious of his fathers victories, and of the juſtice of his goverment.

Neither was the errour heeretofore perceived, nor is the reformation now diſcerned in our vſe. So much vncertainty is there in all things: So groſſe, ſo obſcure and ſo dull is our vnderſtanding. Some are of opinion, this reformation might have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed after a leſſe incommodious maner; ſubſtracting according to the example of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> for ſome yeares, the biſſextile or leape day: Which in ſome ſort, is but a day of hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and trouble: Vntill they might more exactly have ſatisfied the debt: Which by this late reformation is not done: For wee are yet ſome dayes in arrerages: And if by ſuch a meane, we might provide for times to come, appoynting that after the revolution of ſuch or ſuch a number of yeares, that extraordinary day might for ever be eclipſed: ſo that our miſreckoning ſhould not henceforward exceede foure and twenty houres. Wee have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther computation of time, but yeares: The World hath vſed them ſo many ages: And yet is it a meaſure, we have not vntill this day perfectly eſtabliſhed.

Had fortune heaped five or ſix like accidents one in the necke of another, they had doubtleſſe beene able to bring this miracle into nature. Whereas afterward there was ſo much ſimplicity and ſo little skill found in the architect of theſe workes, that he was deemed vnworthy of any puniſhment: As likewiſe ſhould bee done with moſt ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like things, were they throughly knowen in their nature. <hi>Miramur ex intervallo fallentia: Wee wonder at thoſe things that deceive vs by distance.</hi> Our ſight doth in ſuch ſort, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vs a farre-off with ſtrange images, which vaniſh in approaching neerer. <hi>Nnnquam ad liquidum fama perducitur.

Even that hindereth the information of them: For, whilſt a man endevoureth to finde out cauſes, forcible and weighty ends, and worthy ſo great a name, hee looſeth the true and eſſentiall. They are ſo little, that they eſcape our ſight. And verily a right wiſe, heedy and ſubtile inquiſitor is required in ſuch queſtings; imparciall and not preoccupated. All theſe miracles and ſtrange events, are vntill this day hidden from me: I have ſeene no ſuch monſter, or more expreſſe wonder in this world, then my ſelfe. <hi>With time and cuſtome a man doth acquaint and enure him ſelfe to all ſtrangeneſſe:</hi> But the more I frequent and know my ſelfe, the more my deformity aſtonieth me: and the leſſe I vnderſtand my ſelfe. The chiefeſt priviledge to produce and advance ſuch accidents, is reſerved vnto fortune. Travelling ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday thorough a village, within two leagues of my houſe, I found the place yet warme of a miracle that was but newly failed and diſcovered, wherewith all the country thereabout had for many months beene ammuſed and abuſed; and diverſe bordering Provinces began to liſten vnto it, and ſeverall troupes of all qualities ceaſed not thicke and threefold to flocke thither. A yong man of that towne, vndertooke one night in his owne houſe (never drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of any knavery) to counterfeit the voice of a ſpirit or ghoſt, but onely for ſport, to make himſelfe merry for that preſent, which ſucceeding better then he had imagined; to make the jeſt extend further, and himſelfe the merrier, he made a country-maiden acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his deviſe; who becauſe ſhe was both ſeely and harmeleſſe, conſented to beeſecret and to ſecond him: In the end they got another, and were now three, all of one age and like ſufficiency: and from private ſpirit-talking, they beganne with hideous voices to cry and roare aloud, and in, and about churches hiding themſelves vnder the chiefe Altar, ſpeaking but by night, forbidding any light to bee ſet vp: From ſpeeches tending the worldes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and threatning of the day of judgement (which are the ſubjects, by whoſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and abuſive reverence, impoſture and illuſion, is more eaſily lurked) they proceeded to certaine viſions and ſtrange geſtures, ſo fooliſh and ridiculous, that ther is ſcarſe any thing more groſſe and abſurd vſed among Children, in their childiſh ſports. Suppoſe I pray you, that fortune would have ſeconded this harmeleſſe deviſe or jugling tricke; Who knoweth how farre it would have extended, and to what it would have growen? The poore ſeely three Divels are now in priſon, and may happily e're long pay deere for their common ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe; and I wot not whether ſome cheverell judge or other, will bee avenged of them for his. It is manifeſtly ſeene in this, which now is diſcovered; as alſo in divers other things of like quality, exceeding our knowledge; I am of opinion that we vphold our judgement, as well to reject, as to receive. Many abuſes are engendered in the World; or to ſpeake more boldly, all the abuſes of the World are engendered vpon this, that we are taught to feare to make profeſſion, of our ignorance; and are bound to accept and allow, all that wee cannot refute. Wee ſpeake of all things by precepts and reſolution. The Stile of <hi>Rome</hi> did beare, that even the ſame, that a witnes depoſed, becauſe he had ſeene it with his owne eyes; and that which a Iudge ordained of his moſt aſſured knowledge, was conceived in this form of ſpeech, <hi>It ſeemeth ſo vnto me.</hi> I am drawen to hate likely things, when men goe about to ſet them downe as infallible. I love theſe wordes or phraſes, which mollifie and moderate the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our propoſitions: <hi>It may be: Peradventure: In ſome ſort: Some: It is ſaide: I thinke,</hi> and ſuch like: And had I beene to inſtruct children, I would ſo often have put this manner of anſwering in their mouth; enquiring, and not reſolving: <hi>What meanes it?

I remember (and I remember nothing elſe ſo well) that me thought, he proved his impoſture, whom he condemned as guilty, ſo wondrous ſtrange and ſo far-exceeding both our knowledge and his owne, who was judge, that I found much boldnes in the ſentence which had condemned him to be hanged.

To apply ſuch examples as the holy word of God offreth vs of ſuch things (aſſured and irrefragable examples) and joine them to our moderne events; ſince wee neither ſee the cauſes nor meanes of them, ſome other better wit then ours is thereunto required. Peradventure it appertaineth to that onely moſt-mightie teſtimony, to tell vs: This here, and that there; and not this other are of them. God muſt be beleeved; and good reaſon he ſhould be ſo. Yet is there not one amongſt vs, that will be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at his owne narration (and he ought neceſſarily to be aſtoniſhed at it, if he be not out of his wits) whether he employ it about others matters; or againſt himſelfe.

I ſawe both proofes, witneſſes, voluntary confeſſions, and ſome other inſenſible markes about this miſerable olde woman; I enquired and talked with her a long time, with the greateſt heed and attention I could; yet am I not caſily carried away by preoccupation.

True it is, that proofes and reaſons grounded vpon the fact and experience. I vntie not: for indeede they have no end; but often cut them, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did his knotte. When all is done, it is an over-valuing of ones conjectures, by them to cauſe a man to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alive. It is reported by diverſe examples (and <hi>Praestantius</hi> ſaith of his father) that being in a ſlumber much more deeply, then in a full-ſound ſleepe, he dreamed and verily thought himſelfe to be a Mare, and ſerued certaine ſouldiers for a ſumpter-horſe, and was indeede what he imagined to bee. If ſorcerers dreame thus materially: If dreames may ſometimes be thus incorporated into effects: I cannot poſſibly believe, that our will ſhould therefore be bound to the lawes and juſtice: which I ſay, as one who am neither a Iudge, nor a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor vnto Kings, and furtheſt from any ſuch worthineſſe: but rather a man of the common ſtamp, and both by my deedes and ſayings, borne and vowed to the obedience of publique reaſon.

What cannot we diſpute of according to that rate? I might likewiſe ſay of theſe, that the ſame ſtirring, which their labour, ſo ſitting doth give them, doth rouze and ſollicite them, as the jogging and ſhaking of their Coache, doth our Ladies. Doe not theſe examples fit that whereof I ſpake in the beginning? That our reaſons doe often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the effect, and have the extenſion of their juriſdiction ſo infinite, that they judge and exerciſe themſelves in manity, and to a not being?

This fantaſie of <hi>Carneades,</hi> ſo vigorous (as I imagine) proceeded antiently, from the impudency of thoſe, who make profeſſion to know; and from their exceſſive ſelfe-overweening. <hi>Aeſope</hi> was ſet to ſale, together with two other ſlaves; a Chapman enquired of the firſt, what he could doe: he to endeare himſelfe, anſwered, mountaines and wonders, and what not? For he knew and could doe all things. The ſecond anſwered even ſo for himſelfe, and more too: But when he came to <hi>Aeſope,</hi> and demaunded of him what he could doe: Nothing (ſaid he) for theſe two have foreſtaled all, and know and can doe all things, and have left nothing for mee. So hath it happened in the ſchoole of philoſophy. The raſhnes of thoſe who aſcribed the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of all things to mans wit, through ſpight and emulation produced this opinion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that humane wit was not capable of any thing. Some holde the ſame extremity in ignorance, that others hold in knowledge. To the end none may deny, that man is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate in all and every where: and hath no other ſentence or arreſt, than that of neceſſity, and impuiſſance to proceede further.</p>

This image of <hi>Socrates</hi> his diſcourſe, which his friends have left vs, we only approve it, by the reverence of publicke approbation. It is not of our owne knowledge: they are not according to our vſe. Might ſuch a man be borne now adayes, there are but few would now eſteeme him. Wee diſcerne not graces inlie or aright; We onely perceive them by a falſe light ſet out and pufft vp with arte: Such as paſſe vnder their naturall purity and ſimplicity, doe eaſily eſcape ſo weake and dimme a ſight as ours is. They have a ſecret, vnperceived and delicate beauty: he had neede of a cleere, farre-ſeeing and true-diſcerning ſight, that ſhould rightly diſcover this ſecret light. Is not in genuity (according to vs) coſin-germaine vnto ſottiſhneſſe, and a quality of reproach? <hi>Socrates</hi> maketh his ſoule to moove, with a naturall and common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus ſaith a plaine Country-man, and thus a ſeely Woman: Hee never hath other people in his mouth, than Coach-makers, Ioyners, Coblers and Maſons. They are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and ſimilitudes, drawen from the moſt vulgar and knowen actions of men: every one vnderſtands him. Vnder ſo baſe a forme, wee ſhould never have choſen the noble worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and brightneſſe of his admirable conceptions: Wee that eſteeme all thoſe but meane and vile, that learning doth not raiſe: and who have no perceiving of riches, except ſet out in ſhew and pompe. Our World is framed but vnto oſtentation. Men are puffed vp with winde, and moved or handled by bounds, as Baloones. This man propoſeth no vaine fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies vnto himſelfe.

Or to ſay better; he raiſed nothing, but rather brought downe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all difficulties, or ſharpeneſſe to their originall and naturall ſtate, and therevnto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vigor. For, in <hi>Cato,</hi> it is manifeſtly ſeene, to be an out-right proceeding, far-above &amp; beyond the common: By the brave exploites of his life, and in his death, hee is ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be mounted vpon his great horſes. Whereas this man keepes on the ground, and with a gentle and ordinary pace, treateth of the moſt profitable diſcourſes, and addreſſeth himſelfe both vnto death and to the moſt thorny and crabbed croſſes, that may happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the courſe of humane life. It hath indeede fortuned, that the worthieſt man to be known, and for a patterne to be preſented to the world, he is the man of whom we have moſt certaine knowledge. He hath beene declared and enlightned by the moſt cleare-ſeeing men, that ever were; the teſtimonies wee have of him, are in faithfulneſſe and ſufficiency moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable. It is a great matter, that ever he was able to give ſuch order vnto the pure imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a childe, that without altring or wreſting them, he hath thence produced the faireſt effects of our minde. He neither repreſents it rich nor high-raiſed; but found and pure: and ever with a blithe and vndefiled health. By theſe vulgar ſprings and naturall wards: by theſe ordinary and common fantaſies, ſans mooving or without vrging himſelfe, hee erected not onely the moſt regular, but the higheſt and moſt vigorous opinions, actions and cuſtomes, that ever were. Hee it is, that brought humane wiſedome from heaven againe, where for a long time it had beene loſt, to reſtore it vnto man: where her moſt juſt and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious worke is. See or heare him pleade before his judges; marke with what reaſons hee rouzeth his courage to the hazards of warre, what arguments fortifie his patience againſt detraction, calumniation, tyranny, death, and againſt his wives peeviſh head: therein is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

borrowed from arte, or from learning. The ſimpleſt may there know their meanes and might: it is impoſſible to goe further backe or lower. He hath done humane nature a great kindeneſſe, to ſhew what and how much ſhe can doe of her ſelfe. Wee are every one richer then we imagine, but we are taught to borrow, and inſtructed to ſhift; and rather to make vſe of others goods and meanes, then of our owne. There is nothing whereon man can ſtay or fix himſelfe in time of his neede. Of voluptuouſneſſe, of riches, of pleaſure, of power, hee ever embraceth more, then hee can graſpe or hold. His greedineſſe is incapable of moderation. The very ſame I finde to bee in the curioſity of learning and knowledge: he cuts out more worke then hee can well make an end of: and much more then he neede.

T'is they which induce a peaſant ſwaine, yea and whole nations to die as conſtantly as any Philoſopher. Should I have died leſſe merrily before I read the <hi>Thuſculanes?</hi> I thinke not. And when I finde my ſelfe in my beſt wits, I perceive, that I have ſomewhat enriched my tongue; my courage but little. It is even as nature framed the ſame at firſt. And againſt any conflict, it ſhields itſelfe, but with a natural and common march. Bookes have not ſo much ſerved me for inſtruction, as exercitation. What if learning, aſſaying to arme vs with new wardes and fences, againſt naturall inconveniences, hath more imprinted their greatneſſe and weight in our fantaſie, then her reaſons, quidities and ſubtilities, therewith to cover vs?

No formall accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made of it; for there was nothing to take hold of. I never oppoſed my ſelfe againſt the lawes; and who had called me in queſtion, ſhould have loſt by the bargaine. They were mute ſuſpicions, that ranne vnder hand, which never want apparance in ſo confuſed a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-burly, no more than lacke of envious or fooliſh wittes. I commonly affoord ayde vnto injurious preſumption, that fortune ſcattereth againſt me; by a faſhion I never had, to avoid juſtifying, excuſing or interpreting my ſelfe; deeming it to be a putting of my conſcience to compromiſe, to pleade for hir, <hi>Perſpicuitas enim, argumentatione elevatur: For the cleering of a cauſe, is leſſened by the arguing.</hi> And as if every man ſaw into mee as cleare as I doe my ſelfe, in lieu of withdrawing, I advance my ſelfe to the accuſation and rather endeare it; by an erronious and ſcoffing confeſſion: except I flatly hold my peace, as of a thing vnworthy any anſwer. But ſuch as take it for an over-proud confidence, doe not much leſſe diſeſteeme and hate me for it, than ſuch as take it for weakeneſſe of an indefenſible cauſe.

I bethought my ſelfe, amongſt my friendes, to whom I might commit a needy, a defective and vnfortunate olde age: But after I had ſurveyed them all, and caſt mine eyes every where, I found my ſelfe bare and far to ſeeke. For one to ſowſe himſelfe downe headlong, and from ſo great a height, hee ſhould heedily forecaſt that it may be in the armes of a ſolide, ſtedfaſt, vigorous and fortunate affection. They are rare, if there be any. In the end I perceived the beſt and ſafeſt way, was to truſt both my ſelfe and my neceſſity, vnto my ſelfe.

And I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they were profitable inconveniences: forſomuch as when reaſon will not ſerve, we muſt firſt warne vntoward Scholars with the rod; as with fire and violence of wedges, we bring a crooked peece of wood to be ſtraight. It is long ſince I call, to keepe my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſelfe, and live ſequeſtred from alience and ſtrange things notwithſtanding I daily ſtart out and caſt mine eyes aſide. Inclination, a great mans favourable word, a kind looke doth tempt me. God he knowes whether there bee penury of them now-adayes, and what ſenſe they beare. I likewiſe, without frowning, liſten to the ſubornings, framed to drawe mee to ſome towne of merchandiſe or city of trafficke; and ſo coldly defend my ſelfe, that it ſeemes I ſhould rather endure to be overcome, than not. Now to a ſpirit ſo indocile, blowes are required: and this veſſell, that of it ſelfe is ſo ready to warpe, to vnhoope, to eſcape and fall in peeces, muſt be cloſed, hooped and ſtrongly knockt with an adze.

A diſmaied and ſcattered family, making both her ſelfe and her friends afraide, and breeding horrour where it ſought to retire for ſhelter; being now to ſhift and change her dwelling, ſo ſoone as any of the company beganne to feele his finger ake, all the reſt were diſmaied. Every ſickeneſſe is then taken for the plague: none hath leaſure to conſider them. And the miſchiefe is, that according to rules of arte, what danger ſoeuer approcheth, a man muſt continue forty dayes in anxiety or feare of that euill; in which time your owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination doth perplex you as ſhee liſt and infect your health.

And if being alone, I ſhould have taken it, it had beene a ſtronger and further flight: It is a death in mine opinion, not of the worſt: It is commonly ſhort and ſpeeding voide of lingring giddineſſe, without paine, comforted by the publike condition; without

And would his rich and powerfull nature, have committed her defence vnto arte, and in her higheſt Eſſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vnto trueth and ſinceritie, the ornaments of his ſpeech, to adorne and decke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the embelliſhment of the figures and fictions of a fore-lern'nt Oration; Hee did moſt wiſely, and according to himſelfe, not to corrupt the tenure of an incorruptible life, &amp; ſo ſacred an image of humane forme, to prolong his decrepitude for one yeere; and wrong the immortall memory of ſo glorious an end. He ought his life, not to himſelfe, but to the worlds example. Had it not beene a publike loſſe, if he had finiſhed the ſame in ſome idle, baſe and obſcure manner? Truely, ſo careleſſe and effeminate a conſideration of his death, deſerved, poſteritie ſhould ſo much more conſider the ſame for him: which it did.

If any man thinkes, that amongſt ſo many examples, I might have choſen for the ſervice of my purpoſe, in <hi>Socrates</hi> his ſayings, I have choſen or handled this but ill: and deemeth this diſccurſe, to be raiſed above common opinions: I have done it wittingly: for I judge otherwiſe.

It repreſenteth in an vn-artificiall boldneſſe, and infantine ſecuritie, the pure impreſſion and firſt ignorance of nature. Becauſe it is credible, that wee naturally feare paine, but not death, by reaſon of her. It is a part of our being, no leſſe eſſentiall than life. To what end would Nature have elſe engendred the hate and horror of it, ſeeing it holdes thererein and with it a ranke of moſt great profit, to foſter the ſucceſſion, and nouriſh the viciſſitude of her works? And that in this vniverſall Common-weale, it ſteadeth and ſerveth more for birth and augmentation, then for loſſe, decay or ruine.</p>

This may bee ſaide to bee a buying or borrowing, and not a making or compiling of a booke. It is to teach men, not that one can make a booke, but to put them out of doubt, that hee cannot make it. A preſident of the law, in a place where I was, vanted himſelfe, to have hudled vp together two hundred and od ſtrange places in a preſidentiall law-caſe of his: In publiſhing of which, hee defaced the glory, which others gave him for it.

On hazard, to let men ſay, that it is for lacke of vnderſtanding it's naturally vſe, I give it ſome particular addreſſing of mine owne hand, to the end it may be ſo much leſſe meerely ſtrange.

And what if this gratious favour, which fortune hath not long ſince offered mee by the intermiſſion of this worke, could have befalne me in ſuch a ſeaſon, in liew of this, where it is equally deſireable to poſſeſſe, and ready to looſe?</p>

There is nothing more truly ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable, as the conformity or relation betweene the body and the minde. <hi>Ipſi animi, magni refert, quali in copore locati ſint: multa enim è corpore exiſtunt, quae acuant mentem: multa, quae obtundant. It is of great import in what body the minde is beſtowed: for many things ariſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſharpen the minde, and many things to dull and rebate it.</hi> This man ſpeakes of an vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ill-favourdneſſe, and membrall deformity: but we call ill-favourdneſſe a kinde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemelineſſe at the firſt ſight, which chiefely lodgeth in the face; and by the colour worketh a diſlike in vs; A freckle, a blemmiſh, a rude countenaunce, a ſower looke, proceeding of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of ſome inexplicable cauſe, may be in well ordered, comely and compleate limmes. The fouleneſſe of face, which inveſted a beauteous minde in my deare friend <hi>La Boitie,</hi> was of this predicament. This ſuperficiall ill-favourdneſſe, which is notwithſtanding to the moſt imperious, is of leſſe prejudice vnto the ſtate of the minde: and hath ſmall certainty in mens opinion. The other, by a more proper name called a more ſubſtantiall deformity, beareth commonly a deeper inward ſtroke. <hi>Not every ſhooe of ſmooth-ſhining leather, but every well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen and hanſome-made ſhoe, ſheweth the inward and right ſhape of the foot.</hi> As <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid of his, that it juſtly accuſed ſo much in his mind had he not corrected the ſame by inſtitution. But in ſo ſaying, I ſuppoſe, that according to his wonted vſe, he did but jeſt: and ſo excellent a mind, did never frame it ſelfe. I cannot often enough repeate, how much I eſteeme beauty, ſo powerfull and advantagious a quality is ſhe. He named it, <hi>a ſhort tyranny:</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>priviledge of Nature.</hi> We have none that exceeds it in credit. She poſſeſſeth the chiefe ranke in the commerce of ſociety of men: She preſents itſelfe forward: ſhe ſeduceth and preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupates our judgement, with great authority and wonderfull impreſſion. <hi>Phryne</hi> had loſt her plea, though in the hands of an excellent lawyer, if with opening her garments, by the ſodaine flaſhing of hir beauty, ſhe had not corrupted her judges. And I finde, that <hi>Cyrus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alexannder</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe three Maſters of the World, have not forgotten or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame in atchieving their great affaires. So hath not the firſt <hi>Scipio.</hi> One ſame word in Greeke importeth faire and good. And even the Holy-Ghoſt calleth often thoſe good, which he meaneth faire. I ſhould willingly maintaine the ranke of the goods, as imployed the ſong, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith to have beene triviall, taken from ſome auncient Poet; <hi>Health beeuty</hi> and <hi>riches. Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that the right of commaunding, doth of duty belong to ſuch as are faire; and if haply any be found, whoſe beauty approached to that of the Gods images, that veneration is equally due vnto them. To one that asked him, why the faireſt were both longer time and oftner frequented? <hi>This queſtion</hi> (quoth he) <hi>ought not to bee moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but by a blinde man.</hi> Moſt, and the greateſt Philoſophers, paide for their ſchooling and attained vnto Wiſedome, by the intermiſſion of their beauty, and favour their comlines. Not onely in men that ſerue me, but in beaſtes alſo, I conſider the ſame within two inches of goodneſſe. Yet me thinkes, that the ſame feature and manner of the face and thoſe linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which ſome argue certaine inward complexions, and our future fortunes, is a thing that doth not directly nor ſimply lodge vnder the Chapter of beauty and ill favourdneſſe; no more than all good favours, or cleereneſſe of aire, doe not alwayes promiſe health; nor all fogges and ſtinkes, infection, in times of the plague. Such as accuſe Ladies to contradict the beauty, by their manners, gueſſe not alwayes at the truth. For, <hi>In an ill favourd and ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed face, may ſometimes harbour ſome aire of probitie, and truſt.</hi> As on the contrary, I have ſometimes read betweene two faire eyes, the threats of a maligne and dangerous ill-boding nature. There are ſome fauourable Phyſiognomies; For in a throng of victorious enemies, you ſhall preſently ammiddeſt a multitude of vnknowen faces, make choiſe of one man more than of others, to yeeld yourſelfe vnto and truſt yòur life; and not properly by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beauty. A mans loòke or aire of his face, is but a weake warrant; notwithſtanding it is of ſome conſideration. And were I to whippe them, I would more rudely ſcourge ſuch as maliciouſly bely &amp; betray the promiſes, which Nature had charactred in their front. And more ſeverely would I puniſh malicious craft in a debonaire apparance and in a mild promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing countenance. It ſeemeth there bee ſome lucky and well boding faces, and other ſome vnlucky and ill preſaging: And I thinke, there is ſome Arte to diſtinguiſh gently-milde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from nyaes and ſimple; the ſevere from the rude; the malicious from the froward; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull from the melancholike and other neighbouring qualities. There are ſome

beauties, not onely fierce-looking, but alſo ſharpe-working, ſome others pleaſing-ſweete, and yet wallowiſhly taſtleſſe. To prognoſticate future ſucceſſes of them, be matters I leave vndecided. I have (as elſewhere I noted) taken for my regard this ancient precept, very rawly and ſimply: That <hi>We cannot erre in following Nature:</hi> and that the ſoveraigne document is, for a man to conforme himſelfe to her. I have not (as <hi>Socrates</hi>) by the power and vertue of reaſon, corrected my naturall complexions, nor by Arte hindered mine inclination. Look how I came into the World, ſo I goe-on: I ſtrive with nothing.

                        <p>And which makes a contrary ſhew to that of <hi>Socrates.</hi> It hath often betided me, that by the ſimple credite of my preſence and aſpect, ſome that had no knowledge of me, have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſted vnto it, were it about their owne affaires or mine. And even in forraine countries, I have thereby reaped ſingular and rare favours. Theſe two experiments, are hapily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be particularly related. A <hi>quidam</hi> gallant, determined vpon a time to ſurpriſe both my houſe and my ſelfe. His plot was, to come riding alone to my gate, and inſtantly to vrge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. I knew him by name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had ſome reaſon to truſt him, being my neighbour and ſomewhat alide vnto me. I preſently cauſed my gates to be opened, as I do to all men. He comes-in all afrighted, his horſe out of breath; both much haraſſed. He entertaines me with this fable; that within halfe a league of my houſe he was ſodainely ſet-vpon by an enemie of his, whome I knew well and had heard of their quarrell: that his foe had wondrouſly put him to his ſpurres; that being ſurpriſed vnarmed, and having fewer in his company then the other, he was glad to runne away, and for ſafety had made haſte to come to my houſe, as to his ſanctuary: That he was much perplexed for his men, all which he ſuppoſed to be either taken or ſlaine. I endevoured friendly to comfort and ſincerely to warrant and refreſh him. Within a while came gallopping foure or five of his Souldiers, amazed, as if they had beene out of their wits, haſting, to be let-in: Shortly after came others, and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all proper men, well mounted, better armed, to the number of thirty or there abouts, all ſeeming diſtracted for feare, as if the enemie that purſued them had beene at their heeles. This myſterie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſummon my ſuſpicion. I was not ignorant of the age wherin I lived, nor how much my houſe might bee envied: and had ſundry examples of others of my acquaintance, that had beene ſpoiled, beſet and ſurpriſed thus and thus. So it is, that perceiving with my ſelfe, there was nothing to be gotten, though I had begunne to vſe them kindly, if I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and being vnable to rid my ſelfe of them and cleare my houſe without danger and ſpoiling all; as I ever doe, I tooke the plaineſt and naturall well meaning way, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded they ſhould be let in and bid welcome. And to ſay truth, I am by nature little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious or miſtruſtfull, I am eaſily drawen to admit excuſes and encline to mild interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I take men according to common order, and ſuppoſe every one to meane as I doe, and
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:12117:306"/>
believe theſe perverſe and tretcherous inclinations, except I be compelled by ſome autenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call teſtimonie, no more then monſters or miracles. Beſides, I am a man that willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe vnto fortune, and careleſly caſt my ſelfe into her armes: Whereof hitherto I have more juſt cauſe to commend myſelfe, then to complaine. And have found her more circumſpect and friendly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carefull of my affaires, then I am my ſelfe. There are certaine actions in my life, the conduct of which may juſtly be termed difficult, or if any be ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, prudent. And of thoſe, ſuppoſe the third part of them to be mine owne; truely the other two are richly hirs. We are to blame, and in my conceit we erre, that we doe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and ſo much as we ought, truſt the heavens with ourſelves. And pretend more in our owne conduct, then of right appertaines vnto vs. Therefore doe our deſſeignes ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten miſcarry, and our intents ſo ſeldome ſort to wiſhed effect. The heauens are angry, and I may ſay envious of the extenſion and large priviledge we aſcribe vnto the right of humane wiſedome, to the prejudice of theirs: and abridge them ſo much the more vnto vs, by how much more we endeuour to amplifie them. But to come to my former diſcourſe. Theſe gallants kept ſtill on horſebacke in my court, and would not alight: their Captaine with me in my hall, who would never have his horſe ſet-vp, ſtill ſaying that he would not ſtay, but muſt neceſſarily withdraw himſelfe, ſo ſoone as he had newes of his followers. He ſaw himſelfe maſter of his enterpriſe, and nothing was wanting but the execution. Hee hath ſince reported very often, (for he was no whit ſcrupulous or afraid to tell this ſtory) that my vndaunted lookes, my vndiſmaide countenance, and my liberty of ſpeech, made him reject all manner of treaſonable intents or trecherous deſſeignes. What ſhall I ſay more? He bids me farewell, calleth for his horſe, gets vp, and offreth to be gone, his people having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their eies fixed vpon him, to obſerve his lookes and ſee what ſigne he ſhould make vnto them: much amazed to ſee him be gone, and wondring to ſee him omit and forſake ſuch an advantage. An other time, truſting to a certaine truce or ceſſation of armes, that lately had beene publiſhed through our campes in <hi>France,</hi> as one ſuſpecting no harme, I vndertooke a journey from home, through a dangerous and very tickliſh country; I had not rid far, but I was diſcovered, and behold three or foure troupes of horſemen, all ſeverall wayes, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, with purpoſe to entrap me: One of which overtooke mee the third day; where I was round beſet and charged by fifteene or twenty Gentlemen, who had all vizardes and caſes, followed aloofe-off by a band of Argoletiers. I was charged, I yeelded, I was taken and immediately drawne into the boſome of a thicke Wood, that was not far-off; there puld from my Horſe, ſtripped with all ſpeed, my truncks and cloke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bags rifled, my box taken; my Horſes, my equipage and ſuch things as I had, diſperſed and ſhared amongſt them. We continued a good while amongſt thoſe thorny buſhes, conteſting and ſtriving about my ranſome, which they racked ſo high, that it appeared well I was not much knowen of them. They had long conteſtation among themſelves for my life. and to ſay truth: there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances, threatned me of the danger I was in.</p>

To conclude, the moſt precious jewell they preſented me, was my liberty; as for my other things, I cared not greatly at that time. What the true cauſe of ſo vnlockt for a change and ſo ſodaine an alteration was, without any apparent impulſion, and of ſo wonderfull repentance, at ſuch a time, in ſuch an opportunity and ſuch an enterpriſe, fore-meditated, conſulted and effected without controlement, and which through cuſtome and the impiety of times was now become lawfull, (for at the firſt brunt I plainely confeſſed, and genuinly told them what ſide I was of, where my way lay, and whither I was riding) I verily know not yet, nor can I give any reaſon for it. The chiefeſt amongſt them vnmasked himſelfe, told mee his name and repeated diverſe times vnto me, that I ſhould acknowledge my deliverance to my countenance, to my boldneſſe and conſtancy of ſpeech, and be beholding to them for it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as they made me vnworthy of ſuch a misfortune; and demanded aſſurance of me for the like curteſie. It may be, that the inſcrutable goodneſſe of God would vſe this vaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for my preſervation: For, the next morrow it alſo ſhielded mee from worſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe or amboſcadoes, whereof themſelves gently forewarned me, The laſt is yet living, able to report the whole ſucceſe himſelfe; the other was ſlaine not long ſince. If my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance had not anſwered for me, if the ingenuity of mine inward intent might not plainely have beene diſciphered in mine eyes and voice, ſurely I could never have continued ſo long, without quarrells or offences: with this indiſcreete liberty, to ſpeake freely (be it right or wrong) what ever commeth to my minde, and raſhly to judge of things. This faſhion may in ſome ſort, (and that with reaſon) ſeeme vncivill and ill accomodated in our cuſtomary manners: but outragious or malicious, I could never meete with any, would ſo judge it, or that was ever diſtaſted at my liberty if he received the ſame from my mouth. <hi>Words repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe have, as another ſound, ſo another ſenſe.</hi> And to ſay true, I hate no body; And am ſo remiſſe to offend, or ſlow to wrong any, that for the ſervice of reaſon itſelfe, I cannot doe it. And if occaſions have at any time vrged me in criminall condemnations to doe as others, I have rather beene content to be amearced then to appeare. <hi>

No quality is ſo vniverſall in this ſurface of things, as variety and diverſity. The Greekes, the Latines, and wee vſe for the moſt expreſſe examples of ſimilitude, that of egs. Some have nevertheleſſe beene found, eſpecially one in <hi>Delphos,</hi> that knew markes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene egges, and neuer tooke one for another. And having diverſe Hennes, could rightly judge which had laid the egge. diſſimilitude doth of it ſelfe inſinuate into our workes, no arte can come neere vnto ſimilitude. Neither <hi>Perozet</hi> nor any other carde-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker can ſo induſtriouſly ſmoothe or whiten the backeſide of his cardes, but ſome cunning gamſter will diſtinguiſh them, onely by ſeeing ſome other player handle or ſhuffle them. Reſemblance doth not ſo much make one, as difference maketh another. Nature hath bound herſelfe to make nothing that may not be diſſemblable- Yet doth not the opinion of that man greatly pleaſe mee, that ſuppoſed by the multitude of lawes, to curbe the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judges, in entting out their morſells. He perceived not, that there is as much liberty and extenſion in the interpretation of lawes, as in their faſhion. And thoſe but mocke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who thinke to diminiſh our debates and ſtay them, by calling vs to the expreſſe word of ſacred Bible. Becauſe our ſpirit findes not the field leſſe ſpacious, to controule and checke the ſenſe of others, then to repreſent his own: and as if there were as litle courage and ſharpeneſſe to gloſeas to invent. Wee ſee how farre hee was deceived. For wee have in <hi>France</hi> more lawes then all the world beſides; yea more then were needefull to governe all the worlds imagined by <hi>Epicurus: Vt olim flagitijs, ſic nunc legibus labor amus. As in times paſt we were ſicke of offences, ſo now are we of lawes.</hi> As wee have given our judges ſo large a ſcope to moote, to opinionate, to ſuppoſe and decide, that there was never ſo powerfull and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious a liberty. What have our lawmakers gained with chuſing a hundred thouſand kindes of particular caſes, and adde as many lawes vnto them? That number hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, with the infinite diverſity of humane accidents. The multiplying of our inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall never come to the variation of examples. Adde a hundred times as many vnto them, yet ſhall it not followe, that of events to come, there be any one found, that in all this infinite number of ſelected and enregiſtred events, ſhall meete with one, to which hee may ſo exactly joyne and match it, but ſome circumſtance and diverſity will remaine, that may require a diverſe conſideration of judgement. There is but little relation betweene our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are in perpetuall mutation, and the fixed and vnmooveable lawes. The moſt to be deſired, are the rareſt, the ſimpleſt and moſt generall. And yet I believe, it were better to have none at all, then ſo infinite a number as wee have. Nature gives them ever more happy, then thoſe wee give our ſelves. Witneſſe the image of the golden age that Poets faine; and the ſtate wherein wee ſee diverſe nations to live, which have no other. Some there are, who to decide any controverſie, that may riſe amongeſt them, will chuſe for judge the firſt man that by chance ſhall travell alongeſt their mountaines: Others, that vpon a market day will name ſome one amongſt themſelves, who in the place without more wrangling ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all their queſtions. What danger would enſue, if the wiſeſt ſhould ſo decide ours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to occurrences and at firſt ſight; without being tied to examples and conſequences? <hi>Let every foote have his owne ſhooe. Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſending certaine Collonies into the <hi>Indies,</hi> provided wiſely, that no lawyers or ſtudents of the lawes ſhould bee carried thither, for feare leſt controverſies, ſutes or proceſſes ſhould people that new-found world. As a Science that of her owne nature engendreth altercation and diviſion, judging with <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> that <hi>Lawyers and Phiſitions are an ill proviſion for any countrie.</hi> Wherefore is it, that our common language ſo eaſie to bee vnderſtood in all other matters, becommeth ſo obſcure ſo harſh and ſo hard to bee vnderſtood in law-caſes, bills, contracts, indentures citations, wills and teſtaments? And that hee who ſo plainely expreſſeth himſelfe, what ever hee ſpake or write of any other ſubject, inlaw matters findes no manner or way to declare himſelfe or his meaning, that admits not ſome doubt or contradiction: Vnleſſe it be, that the Princes of this arte applying themſelves with a particular attention, to invent and chuſe ſtrange, choiſe and ſolemne words, and frame artificiall cunning clauſes, have ſo plodded and poized every ſillable; canvaſed and ſifted ſo exquiſitely every ſeame and quidity, that they are now ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and ſo confounded in the infinity of figures and ſo ſeverall-ſmall partitions, that they can no more come within the compaſſe of any order, or preſcription or certaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.

It was never ſeene, that two men judged alike of one ſamething. And it is impoſſible to ſee two opinions exactly ſemblable: not onely in divers men, but in any one ſame man, at ſeverall houres. I commonly find ſomething to doubt-of, where the commentary happily never deigned to touch, as deeming it ſo plaine. I ſtumble ſomtimes as much in an even ſmooth path; as ſome horſes that I know, who oftner trip in a faire plaine way, than in a rough and ſtony. Who would not ſay, that gloſſes increaſe doubts and ignorance, ſince no booke is to bee ſeene, whether divine or profane, commonly read of all men, whoſe interpretation dimmes or tarniſheth not the difficulty?

That thoſe ſo frequent glances on their workes, witneſſe their hart ſhivereth with their love they beare them; and that the diſdainfull churliſhneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they beate them, are but mignardizes and affectations of a motherly favour. Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in whom, both eſteeming and diſ-eſteeming himſelfe, ariſe often of an equall aire of arrogancy. For mine excuſe; That in this I ought to have more liberty than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, forſomuch as of purpoſe, I write both of my ſelfe and of my writings, as of my other actions: that my theame doth turne into it ſelfe: I wot not whether every man will take it. I have ſeene in <hi>Germanie,</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> hath left as many diviſions and altercations, concerning the doubt of his opinions, yea and more, than himſelfe mooveth about the Holy Scriptures. Our conteſtation is verball. I demaund what Nature voluptuouſneſſe, circle and ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is? The queſtion is of words, and with words it is anſwered. A ſtone is a body: but he that ſhould inſiſt and vrge; And what is a body? A ſubſtance: And what a ſubſtance? And ſo goe-on: Should at laſt bring the reſpondent to his Calepine or wittes end. One worde is changed for another word, and often more vnknowen. I know better what <hi>Homo</hi> is, then I know what <hi>Animall</hi> is, either mortall or reaſonable. To anſwere one doubt, they give mee three: It is <hi>Hidraes</hi> head. <hi>Socrates</hi> demaunded of <hi>Memnon</hi> what vertue was; There is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Memnon,</hi> the vertue of a Man, of a Woman, of a Magiſtrate, of a private Man, of a Childe, of an olde Man: What vertue meane you? Yea marry, this is very well, quoth <hi>Socrates;</hi> we were in ſearch of one vertue, and thou bringeſt me a whole ſwarme. Wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one queſtion, and wee have a whole huddle of them made vnto vs againe. As no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or forme doth wholly reſemble another, ſo doth it not altogether differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Oh ingenious mixture of Nature. <hi>If our faces were not like, wee could not diſcerne a man from a beaſt: If they were not vnlike, we could not diſtinguiſh one man from another man.</hi> Al things hold by ſome ſimilitude: Every example limpeth. And the relation, which is drawen from experience, is ever defective and imperfect. Compariſons are nevertheleſſe joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome end. So ſerve the Lawes, and ſo are they ſorted and fitted to all our ſutes or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; by ſome wire-drawen, forced and collaterall interpretation. Since the morall Lawes
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:12117:308"/>
which reſpect the particular duty of every man in himſelfe, are ſo hard to be taught and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as we ſee they are: It is no wonder, if thoſe which governe ſo many particulars, are more hard. Conſider the forme of this Law, by which we are ruled: It is a lively teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of humane imbecility; ſo much contradiction and ſo many errours are therin contained. That which we thinke favour or rigour in Law (wherein is ſo much of either, that I wot not wel whether we ſhal ſo often find indifferency in them, are crazed-infected parts and vnjuſt members of the very body and eſſence of Law. Certaine poore Country-men came even now to tell me in a great haſte, that but now in a forreſt of mine, they have left a man woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death, with a hundred hurts about him, yet breathing, and who for Gods ſake hath begged a little water and ſome helpe to raiſe himſelfe at their handes. But that they durſt not come neere him and ran all away, for feare ſome officers belonging to the Law ſhould meete and catch them; and as they doe with ſuch as they find neere vnto a murthered body, ſo they ſhould bee compelled to give an account of this miſchance, to their vtter vndooing; having neither friends nor mony to defend their innocency. What ſhould I have ſaid vnto them? It is moſt certaine, that this Office of humanity had brought them to much trouble. How many innocent and guilt-leſſe men have wee ſeene puniſhed? I ſay without the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fault; and how many more that were never diſcovered? This hath hapned in my time. Certaine men are condemned to death for a murther committed; the ſentence, if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, at leaſt concluded and determined. This done, The Iudges are advertiſed by the Officers of a ſub-alternall Court, not far-off, that they have certaine priſoners in hold, that have directly confeſſed the foreſaid murther, and thereof bring moſt evident markes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens. The queſtion and conſultation is now in the former Court, whether for all this, they might interrupt, or ſhould deferre the execution of the ſentence pronounced againſt the firſt. They conſider the novelty of the example and conſequence thereof, and how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the judgement. They conclude, that the condemnation hath paſſed according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Law, and therefore the Iudges are not ſubject to repentance. To be ſhort, theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretches are conſecrated to the preſcriptions of the Law. <hi>Philip,</hi> or ſome other, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſuch an inconvenience, in this manner. He had by an irrevocable ſentence condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one to pay another a round ſumme of money for a fine. A while after, the truth being diſcovered, it was found, he had wrongfully condemned him. On one ſide was the right of the cauſe, on the other the right of judiciary formes. He is in ſome ſort to ſatisfie both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuffering the ſentence to ſtand in full power: and with his owne purſe recompenced the intereſt of the condemned. But hee was to deale with a reparable accident, my poore ſlaves were hanged irreparably. How many condemnations have I ſeene more criminall, than the crime it ſelfe? All this put me in minde of thoſe auncient opinions; That <hi>Hee who will doe right in groſſe, muſt needes doe wrong by retaile; and iniuſtly in ſmall things, that will come to doe iuſtice in great matters;</hi> That humane iuſtice is framed according to the modell of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, according to which, whatſoever is profitable is alſo juſt and honeſt: And of that the Stoickes hold, that Nature her ſelfe in moſt of her workes, proceedeth againſt iuſtice: And of that which the Cyreniaques hold, that there is nothing juſt of it ſelfe: That cuſtomes and lawes frame juſtice. And the Theodorians, who in a wiſe man allow as juſt, all manner of theft, ſacriledge and paillardiſe, ſo he thinke it profitable for him. There is no remedy: I am in that caſe, as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was, and if I can otherwiſe chuſe, will never put my ſelfe vnto a man that ſhall determine of my head; or conſent that my honour or life, ſhall depend on the induſtry or care of mine atturney, more then mine innocency. I could willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture my ſelfe, and ſtand to that Law, that ſhould as well recompence me for a good deed, as puniſh me for a miſ-deede: and where I might have a juſt cauſe to hope, as reaſon to feare. <hi>Indemnitie is no ſufficient coyne for him, who doeth better than not to treſpaſſe.</hi> Our Law preſents vs but one of hir hands, and that is her left hand. <hi>Whoſoever goes to Law, doth in the end but looſe by it.</hi> In <hi>China,</hi> the policy, arts and government of which kingdome, having neither knowledge or commerce with ours; exceed our examples in divers partes of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and whoſe Hiſtories teach me, how much more ample and diverſe the World is, than either we or our forefathers could ever enter into.

themſelves, not onely to warrant themſelves, but alſo to get ſomething: Not ſimply to be paid, but liberally to be rewarded. No judge hath yet, God be thanked, ſpoken to me as a judge, in any cauſe whatſoever either mine or another mans; criminall or civill. No priſon did ever receive me, no not ſo much as for recreation to walke in. The very imagination of one, maketh the ſight of their outſide ſeeme irkeſome and loathſome to mee. I am ſo beſotted vnto liberty, that ſhould any man forbidde me the acceſſe vnto any one corner of the Indiaes I ſhould in ſome ſort live much diſcontented. And ſo long as I ſhall finde land or open ayre elſewhere, I ſhall never lurke in any place, where I muſt hide my ſelfe. Oh God, how hardly could I endure the miſerable condition of ſo many men, confined and immured in ſome corners of this kingdome, barred from entring the chiefeſt Citties, from acceſſe into Courts, from conuerſing with men, and interdicted the vſe of common wayes, onely becauſe they have offended our lawes. If thoſe vnder which I live, ſhould but threaten my fingers end, I would preſently goe finde out ſome others, whereſoever it were. All my ſmall wiſedome, in theſe civill and tumultuous warres, wherein we now live, doth wholly employ it ſelfe, that they may not interrupt my liberty, to goe and come where ever I liſt. Lawes are now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in credit, not becauſe they are eſſentially juſt, but becauſe they are lawes. It is the myſticall foundation of their authority; they have none other; which availes them much: They are often made by fooles. More often by men, who in hatred of equality, have want of equity; But ever by men, who are vaine and irreſolute Authours. There is nothing ſo groſſely and largely offending, nor ſo ordinarily wronging as the Lawes. Whoſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth them becauſe they are juſt, obeyes them not juſtly the way as he ought. Our French Lawes doe in ſome ſort, by their irregularity and deformity, lend an helping hand vnto the diſorder and corruption, that is ſeene in their diſpenſation and execution. Their beheſt is ſo confuſed, and their commaund ſo inconſtant, that it in ſome ſort excuſeth, both the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and the vice of the interpretation, of the adminiſtration and of the obſervation. Whatſoever then the fruit is wee may have of Experience, the ſame which we draw from forraine examples, will hardly ſtead our inſtitution much; if we reape ſo ſmall profit from that wee have of our ſelves, which is moſt familiar vnto vs: and truely ſufficient to inſtruct vs of what wee want. I ſtudy my ſelfe more than any other ſubject. It is my ſupernaturall Metaphiſike, it is my naturall Philoſophy.</p>

When by others reaſon, I finde my ſelfe convicted of a falſe opinion, I learne not ſo much, what new thing he hath told me; and this particular ignorance; which were but a ſmall purchaſe; as in generall I learne mine owne imbecilitie and weakeneſſe, and the treaſon of my vnderſtanding: whence I draw the reformation of all the maſſe. The like I doe in all my other errours: by which rule I apprehend and feele great profite for, and vnto my life.

The falſe ſteps my memory hath ſo often put vpon mee, at what time ſhe ſtood moſt vpon her ſelfe, have not idly beene loſt: ſhe may ſweare and warrant mee long enough; I ſhake mine eares at her: the firſt oppoſition made in witneſſe of her, makes me ſuſpect. And I durſt not truſt her in a matter of conſequence; nor warrant her touching others affaires. And were it not, that what I doe for want of memorie, others more often doe the ſame for lacke of faith, I would ever in a matter of fact rather take the truth from anothers mouth, then from mine owne.

It is not long ſince, that I found one of the wiſeſt men of <hi>France,</hi> (among thoſe of ſo meane fortune) ſtudying hard in the corner of a great Hall, which for that purpoſe was hung about with tapiſtrie, and round about him a diſordered rable of his ſervaunts, groomes and lackeys; pratling, playing and hoyting: who tolde me (as <hi>Seneca</hi> in a manner ſaith of himſelfe) that he learn'd and profited much by that hurly-burly or tintimare: as if beaten with that confuſed noyſe, he did ſo much the better recall and cloſe himſelfe into himſelfe, for ſerious contemplation; and that the ſaid tempeſtuous rumours did ſtrike and repercuſſe his thoughts inward. Whilſt he was a ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in <hi>Padua,</hi> his ſtudy was ever placed ſo neere the jangling of bells, the ratling of coaches and rumbling tumults of the market place, that for the ſervice of his ſtudy, he was fame, not onely to frame and enure himſelf to contemne, but to make good vſe of that turbulentnoiſe. <hi>Socrates</hi> anſwered <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who wondered how hee could endure the continuall tittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tattle and vnceſſant ſcoulding of his Wife: even as thoſe who are accuſtomed to heare the ordinary creaking of the ſqueaking wheeles of welles.

                        <p>Phyſitians commonly enfold and joine their rules vnto profit, according to the violence of ſharpe deſires or earneſt longings, that incidently follow the ſicke, No longing deſire can be imagined ſo ſtrange and vicious, but nature will apply herſelfe vnto it. And then how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is it to content ones fantaſie? In mine opinion, this part importeth all in all; at leaſt more and beyond all other. The moſt grievous and ordinary evills are thoſe, which fancy char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs withall. That Spaniſh ſaying doth every way pleaſe me: <hi>Deffienda me Dios de my. God defend me from my ſelfe.</hi> Being ſicke, I am ſory I have not ſome deſire may give mee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to ſatiate and cloy the ſame: Scarſly would a medicine divert me from it, So doe I when I am in health: I hardly ſee any thing left to be hoped or wiſhed-for. It is pittie a man ſhould be ſo weakned and enlanguiſhed, that hee hath nothing left him but wiſhing. The arte of Phyſicke is not ſo reſolute, that whatſoever wee doe, wee ſhall bee void of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to doe it. Shee changeth and ſhee varieth according to climates; according to the Moones; according to <hi>Fernelius;</hi> and according to <hi>Scala.</hi> If your Phyſitian thinke it not good that you ſleepe, that you drinke wine, or eate ſuch and ſuch meates: Care not you for that; I will finde you another that ſhall not be of his opinion. The diverſity of phyſicall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and medicinall opinions, embraceth all manner of formes. I ſaw a miſerable ſicke man, for the infinite deſire he had to recover, ready to burſt, yea and to die with thirſt; whom not long ſince another Phyſitian mocked, vtterly condemning the others counſell, as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him. Had not hee beſtowed his labour well? A man of that coate is lately dead of the ſtone, who during the time of his ſickeneſſe vſed extreame abſtinence to withſtand his evill; his fellowes affirme that contrary, his long faſting had withered and dried him vp, and ſo concocted the gravell in his kidnies. I have found, that in my hurts and other ſickeneſſes, earneſt talking diſtempers and hurts me as much as any diſorder I commit. My voice coſts me deare, and wearieth me; for I have it lowd, ſhrill and forced: So that, when I have had occaſion to entertaine the eares of great men, about weighty affaires, I have often troubled them with care how to moderate my voice, This ſtory deſerveth to bee remembred and to divert me. A certaine man, in one of the Greeke ſchooles ſpake very lowde, as I doe; the maiſter of the ceremonies ſent him word, hee ſhould ſpeake lower: let him (quoth he) ſend mee the tune or key in which he would have me ſpeake. The other replied, that hee ſhould take his tune from his eares to whom he ſpake. It was well ſayd, ſo hee vnderſtood himſelfe: Speake according as you have to doe with your auditory. For if one ſay, let it ſuffice that he heareth you; or, governe your ſelfe by him: I do not thinke he had reaſon to ſay ſo. The tune or motion of the voyce, hath ſome expreſſion or ſignification of my meaning: It is in me to direct the ſame, that ſo I may the better repreſent my ſelfe. There is a voyce to inſtruct one to flatter, and another to chide. I will not onely have my voyce come to him, but peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to wound and pierce him. When I brawle and rate my lackey, with a ſharpe and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing tune; were it fit he ſhould come to me and ſay, Maſter ſpeake ſoftly, I vnderſtand and heare you very well? <hi>Eſt quaedam vox ad auditum accomod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Suppoſe Nature driveth and brings thee vnto that glorious Schoole, into which thou hadſt never come of thine owne accord and freewill. If thou tel me, it is a dangerous and mortall evill,: what others are not ſo? For, it is a kinde of phyſicall couſenage, to except any, and ſo they goe directly vnto death: what matter is it, whether they goe by accident vnto it; and eaſily ſlide on either hand, toward the way that leadeth vs therevnto? But thou dieſt not becauſe thou art ſicke; thou dieſt becauſe thou art living. Death is able to kill thee without the helpe of any ſickeneſſe. Sickeneſſes have to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed their death; who have lived the longer, inaſmuch as they imagined they were ſtill dying. Seeing it is of woundes, as of diſeaſes, that ſome are medicinall and wholeſome. The chollike is often no leſſe long-lived than you. Many are ſeene, in whom it hath continued even from their infancy vnto their extreameſt age, who had they not forſaken hir company; ſhe was like to have aſſiſted them further. You oftner kill her, than ſhe doth you. And if ſhe did preſent thee with the image of neer-imminent death, were it not a kinde office for a man of that age, to reduce it vnto the cogitations of his end? And which is woorſe, thou haſt no longer cauſe to be cured: Thus and howſoever, common neceſſity calles for thee againſt the firſt day. Conſider but how artificially and how mildely ſhe brings thee in diſtaſte with life, and out of liking with the world; not forcing thee with a tyrannicall ſubjection, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other diſeaſes doe, wherwith thou ſeeſt olde men poſſeſſed. which continually holde them fettered and enſnared, and without releaſe of weakeneſſe nor intemiſſion of paines but by advertiſements and inſtructions, repriſed by intervalles: entermixing certaine paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of reſt, as if it were: to give thee meane, at thy eaſe, to meditate and repeate her leſſon. To give thee leaſure and ability to judge ſoundly, and like a man of a corage to take a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhee preſents thee with the ſtate of thy condition perfect, both in good and evill, and in one ſame day, ſometimes a moſt pleaſing, ſometimes a moſt intolerable life. <hi>If thou em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not death, at least thou ſhakest her by the hand once a moneth.</hi> Whereby thou haſt more cauſe to hope, that ſhe will one day ſurpriſe thee without threatning. And that being ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought into the haven; ſuppoſing to be ſtill in thy accuſtomed ſtate, one morning at vnawares, both thy ſelfe and thy confidence ſhall be tranſported over. A man hath no reaſon to complaine againſt thoſe diſeaſes, which ſo equally divide time with health. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Fortune, that ſhee ſo often aſſailes mee with one ſame kinde of weapon: ſhee by long vſe doth faſhion and enure mee vnto it, harden and habituate mee therevnto: I now know within a little which way and how I ſhall bee quit. For want of naturall memory I frame ſome of paper. And when ſome new ſymptome or accident commeth to my evill, I ſet it downe in writing: whence it proceedeth, that having now (in a manner) paſſed over and through all ſortes of examples, if any aſtoniſhment threaten mee; running and turning over theſe my looſe memorialles (as <hi>Sybillaes</hi> leaves) Imiſſe no more to finde to comfort me with ſome favourable prognoſtication in my former paſt experience. Cuſtome doth alſo ſerve mee, to hope the better heereafter. For, the conduct of this diſtribution, having ſo long beene conſtituted, it is to be ſuppoſed that Nature will not change this courſe, and no other worſe accident ſhall follow, then that I feele. Moreover, the condition of this diſeaſe is not ill ſeeming to my ready and ſodaine complexion. When it but faintly aſſailes mee, it makes mee afraid, becauſe it is like to continue long: But naturally it hath certaine vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and violent exceſſes. It doth violently ſhake me for one or two dayes. My reines have continued a whole age without alteration, an other is now well-nigh come, that they have changed ſtate. <hi>Evilles as well as goods have their periodes:</hi> this accident is happily come to his laſt. Age weakeneth the heate of my ſtomacke: his digeſtion being thereby leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, heeſendeth this crude matter to my reines. Why may not, at a certaine revolution, the heat of my reines be likewiſe infeobled: ſo that they may no longer petrifie my fleagme; and Nature addreſſe her ſelfe to finde ſome other courſe of purgation?

Is there any thing in this paine ſuffered, that may be counterpoiſed to the ſweete pleaſure of ſo ready an amendment? By how much more health ſeemeth fairer vnto me after ſickenes, ſo neere and ſo contiguous, that I may know them in preſence one of another, in their richeſt ornaments; wherein they attyre themſelves avy, as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and counterchecke one another: Even as the Stoickesſay, that <hi>

When <hi>Socrates</hi> (after he had his yrons or fetters taken from him) felt the pleaſure or tickling of that itching, which their weight and rubbing had cauſed in his legges; he rejoyced, to conſider the neere affinity that was betweene paine and pleaſure: how they combined together by a neceſſary bond; ſo that at turnes they enter-engender and ſucceede one an other: And cry out to good <hi>Aeſope,</hi> that hee ſhould from that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration have taken a proper body vnto a quaint fable. The worſt I ſee in other deſeaſes, is, that they are not ſo grievous in their effect, as in their iſſue. A man is whole yeare to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelfe; ever full of weakeneſſe, alwayes full of feare.</p>
                        <p>There is ſo much hazard and ſo many degrees before one can be brought to ſafety, that heee is never at an end. Before you can leave off your cover-chiefe and then your night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cappe; before you can the ayre againe, or have leave to drinke Wine, or lye with your Wife, or eate melons, it is much, if you fall not into ſome relapſe or new miſery. The gravell hath this priviledge, that it is cleane carried away. Whereas other maladies, leave ever ſome impreſſion and alteration, which leaveth the body ſuſceptible or vndertaking of ſome new infirmity; and they lend one an other their hands. Such are to be excuſed, as are contented with the poſſeſſion they have over vs, without extending the ſame, and without introducing their ſequell: But courteous, kind and gracious are thoſe, whoſe paſſage brings vs ſome profitable conſequence. Since I have had the ſtone-chollike, I finde my ſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of other accidents: more (as me thinks) then I was before, and neuer had ague ſince. I argue, that the extreame and frequent vomites I endure, purge me; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the diſtaſtes and ſtrange abſtinences I tolerate, disgeſt my offending humours: and Nature voydeth in theſe ſtones and gravell, whatſoeuer is ſuperfluous and hurtefull in her. Let no man tell me, that it is a medicine too deere ſold. For, what availe ſo many loathſome pills, ſtincking potions, cauterizings, inciſions, ſweatings, ſetons, dyets and ſo divers faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of curing, which, becauſe we are not able to vndergoe their violence and brooke their importunity, doe often bring vs vnto our graves? And therefore, when I am ſurpriſed, I take it as phyſicke: and when I am free, I take it as a conſtant and full deliverance. Lo here an other particular favour of my diſeaſe, which is, that he in a manner, keepes his play a-part, and let's mee keepe mine owne; or elſe I want but courage to doe it: In his greateſt emotion, I have held out tenne houres on Horſe-backe with him. Doe but endure, you neede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule or regiment: Play, dally, dyne, runne, be gameſome, doe this, and if you can, doe the other thing, your diſorder and debauching will rather availe than hurt it. Say thus much to one that hath the pox, or to one that hath the gowt, or to one that is belly-broken or cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſt. Other infirmites have more vniverſall bonds, torment farre-otherwiſe our actions, pervert al our order, and engage all the ſtate of mans life vnto their conſideration: Whereas this doth only twitch and pinch the skinne, it neither medleth with your vnderſtanding, nor with your will, tongue, feete nor hands, but leaves them all in your diſpoſition; it rather rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth and awaketh you, then deterre and drouzie you. The mind is wounded by the burning of a feaver ſuppreſſed by an Epilepſie, confounded by a migrane, and in concluſion, aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſmayed by all the diſeaſes that touch or wound the whole maſſe of his body, and it's nobleſt partes: This never medleth with it. If therefore it go ill with it, his be the blame: ſhe bewrayeth, ſhe forſaketh and ſhe diſplaceth herſelfe. None but fools will be perſwaded, that this hard, gretty and maſſie body, which is concocted and petrified in our kidneis, may be diſſolved by drinks. And therefore after it is ſtirred, there is no way, but to give it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if you doe not, he will take it himſelfe. This other peculiar commodity I obſerue, that it is an infirmity, wherein we haue but little to divine. We are diſpenſed from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereinto other maladies caſt vs, by the vncertainty of their cauſes, conditions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes.
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:12117:316"/>
A trouble infinitly painfull. We have no neede of doctorall conſultations, or colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giall interpretations. Our ſenſes tell vs where it is, and what it is. By, and with ſuch arguments, forcible or weake (as <hi>Cicero</hi> doth the infirmity of his old-age) I endevour to lull aſleepe, and ſtudy to ammuſe my imagination, and ſupple or annoynt her ſores. If they growe worſe to morrow; to morrow we ſhall provide for new remedies or eſcapes. That this is true: loe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward againe, happly the lightèſt motion wrings pure blood out of my reines. And what of that? I omitte not to ſtirre as before, and with a youthfull and inſolent heate ride after my hound. And find that I haue great reaſon of ſo important an accident, which coſts me but a deafe heavineſſe and dombe alteration in that parte. It is ſome great ſtone that waſteth and conſumeth the ſubſtance of my kidneis and my life, which I avoyde by little and little: not without ſome natural pleaſure, as an excrement now ſuperfluous and troubleſome. And feele I ſomething to ſhake? Except not that I ammuſe my ſelfe to feele my pulſe or looke into my vrine, thereby to finde or take ſome tedious prevention. I ſhall come time enough to feele the ſmart, without lengthening the ſame with the paine of feare. <hi>Who feareth to ſuffer, ſuffereth already, becauſe he feareth.</hi>

                        <p>Seeing the doubt and ignorance of thoſe, who will and do meddle with expounding the drifts and ſhifts of nature, with her internall progreſſe; and ſo many falſe prognoſtications of their arte ſhould make vs vnderſtand her meanes infinitly vnknowen. There is great vncertainty, variety and obſcurity, in that ſhee promiſeth and menaceth vs. Except old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which is an vndoubted ſigne, of deaths approching: of all other accidents, I ſee few ſignes of future things, whereon we may ground our divination. I onely judge my ſelfe by true-feeling ſenſe and not by diſcourſe: To what end? ſince I will adde nothing therunto except attention and patience. Will you know what I gaine by it? Behold thoſe who doe otherwiſe, and who depend on ſo many diverſe perſwaſions and counſelles; how oft ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination preſſeth them without the body. I have diverſe times being in ſafety and free from all dangerous accidents, taken pleaſure to communicate them vnto Phiſitions, as but then comming vpon me. I endured the arreſt or doome of their horrible concluſions, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much the more bounden vnto God for his grace, and better inſtructed of the vanity of this arte. <hi>Nothing ought ſo much be recommended vnto youth, as activitie and vigilancie.</hi> Our life is nothing but motion, I am hardly ſhaken, and am ſlow in all things, bee it to riſe, to goe to bed, or to my meales. Seaven of the clocke in the morning is to me an early houre: And where I may commaund, I neither dine before eleven, norſup till after ſix. I have heretofore imputed the cauſe of agues or maladies, whereinto I have falne, to the lumpiſh heavineſſe or drowzy dulneſſe, which my long ſleeping had cauſed me. And ever repented mee to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe againe in the morning. <hi>Plato</hi> condemnes more the exceſſe of ſleeping, then the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet of drinking. I love to lie hard and alone, yea and without a woman by me: after the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner: ſome what well and warme covered. I never have my bed warmed; but ſince I came to be an old man, if neede require, I have clothes given me to warme my feete my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. Great <hi>Scipio</hi> was taxed to bee a ſluggard or heavy ſleeper (in my conceit) for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cauſe, but that men were offended, hee onely ſhould bee the man, in whom no faulte might juſtly bee found. If there be any curioſity in my behaviour or manner of life, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about my going to bed, then any thing elſe; but if neede bee, I generally yeeld and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my ſelfe vnto neceſſity, as well and as quietly, and any other whoſoever. Slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hath poſſeſſed a great parte of my life: and as old as I am, I can ſleepe eight or nine houres together. I doe with profit withdraw my ſelfe from this ſluggiſh propenſion, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently finde my ſelfe better by it. Indeede I ſomewhat feele the ſtroke of alteration, but in three dayes it is paſt. And I ſee few that live with leſſe (when neede is) and that more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly exerciſe themſelves, nor whom toyling and labour offend leſſe. My body is capable of a firme agitation, ſo it be not vehement and ſodaine. I avoide violent exerciſes, and which induce mee to ſweate: my limbs will ſooner be wearied, then heated. I can ſtand a whole day long, and am ſeldome weary with walking. Since my firſt age, I ever loved rather to ride then walke vpon paved ſtreetes. Going a foote, I ſhall durty my ſelfe vp to the waſte: and little men, going alongſt our ſtreetes, are ſubject (for want of preſentiall apparence) to be juſtled or elbowed. I love to take my reſt, bee it ſitting or lying-along, with my legs as high or higher then my ſeate. No profeſſion or occupation is more pleaſing then the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; A profeſſion or exerciſe, both noble in execution (for, <hi>the ſtrongest, most generous and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest</hi>

No vtilitie, is either more juſt or vniverſall then the protection of the repoſe, or defence of the greatneſſe of ones country, The company and dayly converſation of ſo many noble, young and active men, cannot but be well-pleaſing to you: the dayly and ordinary ſight of ſo diverſe tragicall ſpectacles: the libertie and vncontroled freedome of that arteleſſe and vnaffected converſation, maſculine and ceremonileſſe maner of life: the hourely variety of a thouſand ever changing and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring actions: the couragious and minde ſtirring harmonie of warlike muſike, which at once entertaineth with delight and enflameth with longing, both your eares and your minde: the iminent and matchleſſe honour of that exerciſe: yea the very ſharpeneſſe and difficulty of it, which <hi>Plato</hi> eſteemeth ſo little, that in his imaginary commonwealth, he imparteth the ſame both to women and to children.

Multitude of diſhes, and varietie of ſervices diſpleaſe mee as much as any other throng. I am eaſily pleaſed with few meſſes and hate the opinion of <hi>Favorinus,</hi> that at a banquet you muſt have that diſh whereon you feede hungerly taken from you, and ever have a new one ſet in the place: And that it is a niggardly ſupper, if all the gueſts be not glutted with pinions and rumps of divers kindes of fowle: and that onely the daintie bird <hi>heccafico</hi> or ſnapfig deſerveth to bee eaten whole at one morſell. I feede much vpon ſalte cates and love to have my bread ſomewhat freſh: And mine own Baker makes none other for my bord; againſt the faſhion of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. In my youth, my overſeers had much adoe to reforme the refuſall I made of ſuch meats as youth doth commonly love beſt, as ſweete-meates, confets and marchpanes. My Tutor was wont to finde great fault with my lothing of ſuch dainties, as a kinde of ſqueamiſh delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. And to ſay truth, it is nothing but a difficultie of taſte, where it once is applied. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remooveth from a childe a certaine particular or obſtinate affection to browne bread, to bakon, or to garlike, taketh friandize from him.

Are not they wiſe men in the meane time? It is the chiefe daintie of all dainties: It is the taſte of nice effeminate fortune, that will bee diſtaſted with ordinarie and vſuall things. <hi>Per quae luxuria divitiarum taedio ludit.

I ſhall in ſome ſort be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, when I ſee it miſerably-depreſſed and over whelmed.

So chaunged ſhe hir minde, couragionſly taking hir husbands part: Whom ſhe never forſooke, whether-ſoever his ruine or diſtreſſe carryed him. Having (in my ſeeming) no other choiſe, than to follow that ſide, where ſhee might doe moſt good, where ſhee was moſt wanted, and where ſhe might ſhew her ſelfe moſt truely pittifull. I doe more naturally encline toward the example of <hi>Flamineus,</hi> who more and rather yeelded to ſuch as had neede of him, than to thoſe who might doe him good: than I bend vnto that of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who was ever wont, demiſſely to ſtoope and yeeld to the mighty, and inſolently to grow proud over the weake. Long ſitting at meales doth much weary and diſtemper mee: for, be it for want of better countenance and entertainment, or that I vſed my ſelfe vnto it when I was a child, I ſeede as long as I ſitte at the table. And therefore, being in mine owne houſe, though my board be but ſhort, and that wee vſe not to ſit long, I doe not commonly ſit downe with the firſt, but a pretty while after others: According to the forme of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> yet I imitate him not in his riſing before others. Contrary, I love to ſit a great while after, and to heare ſome diſcourſe or table-talke. Alwayes provided I beare not a part my ſelfe, for, if my belly bee full, I ſhall ſoone bee weary, and hurt my ſelfe with talking: and I finde the exerciſe of lowde-ſpeaking and conteſting before meate very pleaſant and wholeſome.

I love all manner of fleſh or ſowle but greene roſted and rawe ſodden, namely, ſuch as may beare it without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and love to have them throughly mortified; and in divers of them the very alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſmell. Onely hardneſſe or toughneſſe of meate doth generally moleſt me (of all other qualities. I am as careleſſe, and can as well brooke them, as any man that ever I knew) ſo that (contrary to received opinion) even amongſt fiſhes, I ſhall finde ſome, both too new and over-hard and firme, It is not the fault or want of teeth, which I ever had as perfectly-ſound and compleate as any other man: and which but now, being ſo olde, beginne to threaten mee. I have from my infancie learnd to rubbe them with my napkin, both in the morning when I riſe, and ſitting downe and riſing from the table. God doth them a grace, from whom by little and little he doth ſubſtract their life. It is the onely benefite of old age. Their laſt death ſhall be ſo much the leſſe full, languiſhing and painefull: it ſhall then kill but one halfe or quarter of a man. Even now I loſt one of my teeth, which of it ſelfe fell out, without ſtrugling or paine: it was the naturall terme of it's continuance. That part of my being, with diuerſe others, are already dead and mortified in mee, others of the moſt active, halfe dead, and which, during the vigor of my age held the firſt ranke. Thus I ſinke and ſcape from my ſelfe. What fooliſhnes will it be in my vnderſtanding, to feele the ſtart of that fall, already ſo advaunced, as if it were perfectly whole? I hope it not; verely I receive a ſpeciall comfort in thinking on my death, and that it ſhall be of the moſt juſt and natural: and cannot now require or hope other favor of deſtinie, concerning that, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Men perſwade themſelves, that as heretofore they have had a higher ſtature, ſo their lives were longer; But they are deceived: for <hi>Solon,</hi> of thoſe ancient times, though he were of an exceeding high ſtature, his life continued but 70. yeeres.

How many times doe I ſay, I am no more my ſelfe; how much is my preſent image further from thoſe, then from that of my deceaſe? It is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-great abuſe vnto nature to dragge and hurry her ſo farre, that ſhee muſt bee forced to give vs over; and abandon our conduct, our eyes, our teeth, our legges and the reſt, to the mercy of a forraine help and begged aſſiſtance: and to put our ſelves into the hands of arte, wearie to followe vs. I am not overmuch or greedily deſirous of ſallets or of fruites, except melons. My father hated all manner of ſawces; I love them all. Overmuch eating doeth hurt and diſtemper me: but for the qualitie I have yet no certaine knowledge that any meate offends me: I never obſerve either a full or wained Moone, nor make a difference betweene the Spring time or Autumne. There are certaine inconſtant and vnknowne motions in vs. For (by way of example) I have heeretofore found rediſh-rootes to be very good for mee, then very hurtfull, and now againe very well agreeing with my ſtomacke. In diverſe other things, I feele my appetite to change, and my ſtomacke to diverſifie from time to time.

Who can aſſure me, if I have a good taſte or ſtomake in the morning, that I ſhall have it againe at ſupper? Let vs old men; let vs, I ſay, take the firſt convenient time that commeth: Let vs leave hopes and prognoſtikes vnto Almanacke-makers. The extreame fruite of my health, is pleaſure: Let vs hold faſt on the preſent, and to vs knowne. I eſchew conſtancie in theſe Lawes of faſting. Who ſo will have a forme to ſerue him, let him avoyd continuance of it: but wee harden our ſelves vnto it, and therevnto wholy apply our forces: ſixe moneths after, you ſhall finde your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make ſo enured vnto it, that you ſhall have gotten nothing but this, to have loſt the liberty to vſe it otherwiſe without domage. I vſe to goe with my legges and thighs no more cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Sommer than in Winter; for I never weare but one paire of ſingle like-ſtockins. For the eaſing of my rheume and helpe of my chollike, I have of late vſed to keepe my head and belly warme. My infirmities did in few dayes habituate themſelves thereunto, and diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ordinary proviſions. From a ſingle night-cappe, I came to a double coverchef, and from a bonnet, to a lined and quilted hat. The bum baſting of my doublet, ſerves me now for no more vſe then a ſtomacher: it is a thing of nothing, vnleſſe I adde a hare or a vultures skin to it; and ſome warme wrapping about my head. Follow this gradation and you ſhall goe a faire pace, I will do no ſuch thing. If I durſt I could find in my hare to revoke the beginning I have given vnto it. Fall you into any new inconvenience? This reformation will no longer availe you. You are ſo accuſtomed vnto it, that you are driven to ſeeke ſome new one. So are they overthrowne, that ſuffer themſelves with forced formalities or ſtrict rules, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, and do ſuperſticiouſly conſtraine themſelves vnto them: they have neede of more, and of more after that: they never come to an end. It is much more commodious both for our buſineſſe and for our pleaſure (as did our forefathers) to looſe our dinner, and deferre making of good cheere, vnto the houre of withdrawing and of reſt, without interrupting the day: So was I wont to doe heretofore. I have for my health found out ſince by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that on the contrary, it is better to dine, and that one ſhall digeſt better being awake. Whether I be in health or in ſickeneſſe, I am not much ſubject to be thirſty: indeede my mouth is ſomewhat dry, but without thirſt. And commonly I vſe not to drinke, but when with eating I am forced to deſire it, and that is when I have eaten well. For a man of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtature I drinke indifferent much. In Sommer, and at an hungry meale, I not onely exceede the limites of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who drunke but preciſely three times: but, not to offend the rule of <hi>Democritus,</hi> who forbade vs to ſtay at foure, as an vnlucky number; if need be, I come to five: Three demiſextiers, or there abouts. I like little glaſſes beſt; and I love to empty my glaſſe: which ſome others diſlike, as a thing vnſeemely. Sometimes, and that very often, I temper my wine one halfe, and many times three partes with water. And when I am in mine owne houſe, from an antient cuſtome, which my fathers phiſitian ordained both for him, and himſelfe, looke what quantity of Wine is thought will ſerve mee a meale, the ſame is commonly tempered two or three houres before it be ſerved in, and ſo kept in the ſeller. It is reported, that <hi>Cranaus</hi> King of the Athenians, was the firſt, that invented the mingling of Wine with Water. Whether it were profitable or no, I will not now diſpute or ſtand vpon. I thinke it more decent and more wholeſome, that children ſhould drinke no Wine, vntill they be paſt the age of ſixteene or eighteene yeares. <hi>The moſt vſuall and common forme of life, is the beſt:</hi> Each particularity, doth in mine opinion impugne it. And I ſhould as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt a Germane, that ſhould put Water in his Wine, as a French-man, that ſhould drinke it

I have a free and eaſie reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and doe moſt commonly paſſeover my murres and colds without offence to my lungs, or without coughing. The ſoultry heate of ſommer is more offenſive to me, than the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Winter: for, Beſides the incommodity of heate, which is leſſe to bee remedied, than the inconvenience of cold; and beſides the force of the Sunnes beames, which ſtrike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, mine eyes are much offended with any kinde of glittring or ſparkling light; ſo that I cannot well ſit at dinner over againſt a cleare-burning fire. To allay or dim the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of paper, when I was moſt given to reading, I was wont to lay a piece of greene glaſſe vpon my booke, and was thereby much eaſed. Hitherto I never vſed ſpectakles, nor know not what they meane; and can yet ſee as farre as ever I could, and as any other man; true it is, that when night comes, I begin to perceive a dimnes and weakeneſſe in reading; the continual exerciſe whereof, and ſpecially by night, was ever ſomewhat troubleſome vnto mine eyes. Loe-heere a ſteppe-backe, and that very ſenſible. I ſhall recoyle no more, from a ſecond to a third, and from a third to a fourth, ſo gently, that before I feele the declination and age of my ſight, I muſt bee ſtarke blinde. So artificiall doe the Fates vntwiſt our lives-threede. Yet am I in doubt, that my hearing is about to become thicke: and you ſhall ſee, that I ſhal have loſt it halfe, when yet I ſhall finde fault with their voyces that ſpeake vnto mee. The minde muſt be ſtrained to a high pitch, to make it perceiue howe it declineth. My going is yet very nimble, quicke and ſtout; and I wot not which of the twoo I can more hardly ſtaie at one inſtant, eyther my minde or my body. I muſt like that preacher wel, that can tie mine attention to a whole ſermon. In places of ceremonies, where every man doth ſo nicely ſtand vpon countenance, where I have ſeene Ladies hold their eyes ſo ſteady, I could never ſo hold out, but ſome part of mine would ever be gadding: although I be ſitting there, I am not well ſetled. As <hi>Chryſippus</hi> the Phyloſophers chamber-maide, ſaide of hir Maſter, that he was never drunke but in his legges; for wherſoever he ſate, he was ever accuſtomed to bee wagging with them: and this ſhe ſaide at what time ſtore of Wine had made his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cuppe-ſhotten, and yet he felt no alteration but continued ſober in minde. It might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have beene ſaide of mee, that even from mine infancie, I had either folly or quicke-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in my feete, ſo much ſtirring and naturall inconſtancy have I in them, where ever I place them. It is vnmannerlineſſe, and prejudiciall vnto health, yea and to pleaſure alſo, to feede groſely and greedily, as I doe. I ſhall ſometimes through haſte bite my tongue and fingers ends. <hi>Diogenes</hi> meeting with a childe, that did eate ſo, gave his tutor a whirret on the eare. There were men in <hi>Rome,</hi> that as others teach youth to go with a good grace, ſo they taught men to chew, with decency, I doe ſometimes looſe the leiſure to ſpeake, which is ſo pleaſing an entertainment at the table, provided they be diſcourſes ſhort, witty and pleaſant. There is a kinde of jeloſie and envy betweene our pleaſures, and they often ſhocke and hinder one an other. <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> a man very exquiſitely-skilfull in making good cheere, inhibited all manner of muſicke at tables, becauſe it ſhould not hinder the delight of diſcourſes, for the reaſon which <hi>Plato</hi> affords him: that it is a cuſtome of populare or baſe men to call for minſtrels or ſingers at feaſts, and an argument, they want witty or good diſcourſes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing entertainement, wherewith men of conceipt and vnderſtanding knowe how to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſt and entertaine themſelves. <hi>

A good minde-pleaſing table-entertainement, is not a little voluptuous feaſt, nor a meanly artificiall banquet. Neither great or ſterne commaunders in Warres, nor famous or ſtrict Philoſophers have diſdained the vſe or knowledge of it.

My preſent ſtate doth now exclude me from them. For, every one, according to the good temper of body or mind, wherein he findes himſelfe, addeth either principall grace or taſte vnto them. My ſelfe, who but grovell on the ground, hate that kinde of inhumane wiſedome, which would make vs diſdainefull and enemies of

I deeme it an equall injuſtice, either to take naturall ſenſualities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hart, or to take them too neere the hart. <hi>Xerxes</hi> was a ninny-hammer, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped and given to all humane voluptuouſneſſe, propoſed rewards for thoſe, that ſhould deviſe ſuch as he had never heard-of.

But what? we are nothing but winde. And the very winde alſo, more wiſely then we, loveth to bluſter and to bee in agitation: And is pleaſed with his owne offices: without deſiring ſtability or ſolidity; qualities that be not his owne. The meere pleaſures of imagination, as well as diſ pleaſure (ſay ſome) are the greateſt: as the ballance of <hi>Critolaüs</hi> did expreſſe. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhee compoſeth them at hir pleaſure, and cuts them out of the whole cloth. I ſee dayly ſome notable preſidents of it, and peradventure to be deſired. But I, that am of a commixt condition, homely and plaine, cannot ſo throughly bite on that onely and ſo ſimple object: but ſhall groſely and careleſly give my ſelfe over to the preſent delights, of the generall and humane law. Intellectualy ſenſible, and ſenſiby-intellectuall. The <hi>Cyrenaique</hi> Philoſophers are of opihion, that as griefes, ſo corporal pleaſures are more powerfull; and as double, ſo, more juſt. There are ſome (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) who with a ſavage kinde of ſtupidity, will ſeeme diſtaſtefull or ſquemiſh of them. Some others I knowe, that doe it out of ambition. Why renounce they not alſo breathing? why live they not of their owne, and refuſe light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it commeth of gratuitie; and coſts them neither invention nor vigor?

I hate that we ſhould be commanded to have our minds in the clowds, whilſt our bodies are ſitting at the table: yet would I not have the minde to be faſtned thereunto, nor wallow vpon it, nor lie along theron, but to applie it ſelfe and ſit at it. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> defended but the body, as if wee had no ſoule: <hi>Zeno</hi> embraced but the ſoule, as if wee had no body.

                           <hi>It is an abſolute perfection, and as it were divine for a man to know how to enioy his being loyally.</hi> We ſeeke for other conditions becauſe we vnderſtand and not the vſe of ours: and goe out of our ſelves, forſomuch as we know not what abiding thereis. <hi>Wee may long enough get vpon ſtilis, for be wee vpon them, yet muſt wee goe with our owne legges. And ſit we vpon the higheſt throne of the World, yet fit we vpon our owne taile.</hi> The beſt and moſt commendable lives, and beſt pleaſing me are (in my conceit) thoſe which with order are fitted, and with <hi>decorum</hi> are ranged to the common mould and humane model: but without woonder or extravagancy. Now hath old age neede to be handled more tenderly. Let vs recommend it vnto that God, who is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of health, and fountaine all wiſedome: but blithe and ſociall:</p>
