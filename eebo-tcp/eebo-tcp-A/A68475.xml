            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ther of the≈øe waies might ea≈øily per≈øwade me: for I am much inclined to mercie, and affected to mildne≈ø≈øe. So it is, that in mine opinion, I ≈øhould more naturally ≈øtoop vnto compa≈ø≈øion, than bend to e≈øtimation. Yet is pitie held a vicious pa≈ø≈øion among the Stoickes. They would have vs aide the afflicted, but not to faint, and co≈øuffer with them. The≈øe examples ≈øeeme fitte≈øt for mee, for≈øomuch as the≈øe mindes are ≈øeene to be a≈ø≈øaulted and environed by the≈øe two meanes, in vndauntedly ≈øuffering the one, and ≈øtooping vnder the other. It may peraduentvre be ≈øaid, that to yeelde ones heart vnto commi≈øeration, is an effect of facilitie, tenderne≈ø≈øe, and meekene≈ø≈øe: whence it proceedeth, that the weake≈øt natures, as of women, children, and the vulgar ≈øort are more ≈øubject vnto it. But (having contemned teares and wailings) to yeeld vnto the onely reverence of the ≈øacred Image of vertue, is the effect of a couragious and imployable minde, holding a ma≈øculine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant vigor, in honour and affection. Notwith≈øtanding amazement and admiration may in le≈ø≈øe generous mindes worke the like effect. Witne≈ø≈øe the Thebanes, who having accu≈øed and indited their captaines, as of a capitall crime, for≈øomuch as they had continued their charge, beyond the time pre≈øcribed them, ab≈øolved and quit <hi>Pelopidas</hi> of all puni≈øhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he ≈øubmi≈ø≈øiuely yeelded vnder the burden of ≈øuch objections, and to ≈øave him≈øelfe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed no other meanes, but ≈øuing-reque≈øts, and demi≈ø≈øe entreaties; where on the contrary, <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> boldely relating the exploits atchieved by him, and with a fierce and arrogant manner, vpbraiding the people with them, had not the heart ≈øo much as to take their lots into his hands, but went his way, and was freely ab≈øolved: the a≈ø≈øembly much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ≈øtoutne≈ø≈øe of his courage. <hi>Diony≈øius</hi> the elder, after long-lingering and extreame difficulties, having taken the Citie of <hi>Reggio,</hi> and in it the Captaine <hi>Phyton</hi> (a worthy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt man) who had ≈øo ob≈øtinately defended the ≈øame, would needes ≈øhew a tragicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of revenge.

If they be unworthie, wee are to endure them pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, to conceale their vices, and to aid their indifferent actions with our commendations, as long as their authoritie hath need of our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and that ought to be a≈øcribed unto poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike order. But our commerce with them being ended, there is no rea≈øon we ≈øhould refu≈øe the unfolding of our felt wrongs vnto ju≈øtice and our libertie. And ≈øpecially to refu≈øe good ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the glory to have reverently and faithfully ≈øerved a ma≈øter, who≈øe imperfections were ≈øo well knowne unto them: exempting po≈øteritie from ≈øo profitable an example. And ≈øuch as for the re≈øpect of ≈øome private benefite or intere≈øt do wickedly imbrace the memorie of an vnwoorthie Prince, doe particular ju≈øtice at the charge of publike ju≈øtice. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ≈øpeaketh truely, where he ≈øaith, that the ≈øpeech of men brought up under a royaltie is ever full of vaine o≈øtentations, and fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øes: every man indifferently extolling the king, to the furthe≈øt ≈øtraine of valour and Soveraigne greatne≈ø≈øe. The magnanimitie of tho≈øe two Souldiers, may bee reproved, one of which being demaunded of <hi>Nero,</hi> why he hated him, an≈øwered him to his teeth; I loved thee while≈øt thou wa≈øt worthie of love, but ≈øince thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came≈øt a parricide, a fir-brand, a juglar, a player, and a Coach-man, I hate thee, as thou de≈øerve≈øt. The other being asked, wherefore he ≈øought to kill him; an≈øwered, Becau≈øe I find no other cour≈øe to hinder thy unce≈ø≈øant outrages and impious deedes. But can any man, that hath his ≈øen≈øes about him, ju≈øtly reproove the publike and generall te≈øtimonies, that ≈øince his death, have bin given, and ≈øo ≈ønall be for ever, both again≈øt him and all ≈øuch like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, of his tyrannicall and wicked demeanors? I am ≈øorie that in ≈øo ≈øacred a pollicie as the Lacedemonian was, ≈øo fained and fond a ceremonie at the death of their kings was ever devi≈øed and brought in u≈øe. All their confederates and neighbours, all the ≈ølave-Heotes, men and women pell-mell, for a te≈øtimonie of their griefe and ≈øorrow did mangle and ga≈øh their foreheads; and in their out-cries, and lamentations, exclaimed, that their decea≈øed king, how≈øoever he had lived, was and had bin the be≈øt Prince that ever they had, a≈øcribing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commendations due unto de≈øert, and to the la≈øt and latter ranke, what belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fir≈øt merite. <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> that hath an oare in every water, and medleth with all things, makes a que≈øtion, about <hi>Solons</hi> ≈øpeech, who ≈øaith, that no man can truely be counted happy before his death, Whether he that lived and died according to his wi≈øh may be named hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Whether his renowne be good or ill, and whether his po≈øteritie be mi≈øerable or no. While≈øt we ≈øtirre and remove, we tran≈øport our ≈øelves by preoccupation where≈øoever we li≈øt: But no ≈øooner are we out of being, but we have no communication at all with that which is.

                           <hi>Edward</hi> the fir≈øt king of <hi>England,</hi> in the long warres he had with <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having by triall found how greatly his pre≈øence advantaged the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of his affaires, and how he was ever victorious in any enterpri≈øe he vndertooke in his owne per≈øon; when he died, bound his ≈øonne by ≈øolemne oth, that being dead he ≈øhould cau≈øe his body to be boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vntill the fle≈øh fell from the bones, which he ≈øhould cau≈øe to be enterred, and carefully keeping the bones, ever carrie them about him, when≈øoever he ≈øhould happen to have wars with the Scots: As if de≈øtenie had fatally annexed the victorie vnto his limmes. <hi>Iohn Zi≈øca;</hi> who for the defen≈øe of <hi>Wickliffs</hi> opinions ≈øo much troubled the ≈øtate of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that after his death his body ≈øhould be flead, and a drum made of his skin, to be carried and ≈øounded in all the wars again≈øt his enemies: deeming the ≈øound of it would be a meanes to continue the advantages, which in his former warres he had obtained of them. Certaine Indians did likewi≈øe carry the bones of one of their Captaines in the skirmi≈øhes they had with the Spaniards, in regard of the good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe he had, while≈øt he lived, had again≈øt them: And other nations of that new-found world, do likewi≈øe carrie the bodies of ≈øuch worthie and fortunate men with them, as have died in their battels, to ≈øerve them in ≈øtead of good fortune and encouragement. The fir≈øt examples re≈øerve nothing el≈øe in their tombes, but the reputation acquired by their former atchievements: but the≈øe will al≈øo adjoine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the power of working. The act of Captaine <hi>Bayart</hi> is of better compo≈øition, who perceiving him≈øelfe deadly wounded by a ≈øhot received in his body, being by his men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded to come off and retire him≈øelfe from out the throng, an≈øwered, he would not now ≈øo neere his end, begin to turne his face from his enemie: and having ≈øtowtly foughten ≈øo long as he could ≈øtand, feeling him≈øelfe to faint and ≈øtagger from his hor≈øe, commanded his ≈øteward to lay him again≈øt a tree, but in ≈øuch ≈øort, that he might die with his face toward the enemie; as indeed he did. I may not omit this other example, as remarkeable for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration, as any of the precedent. The Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> great grand-father to <hi>Phillip,</hi> now King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was a Prince highly endowed with many notable qualities, and among≈øt others with a well-nigh matchle≈ø≈øe beautie and comeline≈ø≈øe of body; but with other cu≈øtomes of his, he had this one much contrarie to other Princes, who to di≈øpatch their waightie≈øt affaires make often their clo≈øe ≈øtoole, their regale Throne or Councel-chamber, which was, that he would not permit any groome of his chamber (were he never ≈øo neere about him) to ≈øee him in his inner-chamber, who if he had occa≈øion but to make water, wold as nicely and as religiou≈øly withdraw him≈øelfe as any maiden, and never ≈øuffer ≈øo much as a Phy≈øitian, much le≈ø≈øe any other what≈øoever, to ≈øee tho≈øe privie parts that all in mode≈øtie ≈øeeke to keepe ≈øecret and vn≈øeene. My ≈øelfe, that am ≈øo broad-mouthed and lavi≈øh in ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, am notwith≈øtanding naturally touched with that ba≈øhfulne≈ø≈øe. And vnle≈ø≈øe it be by the motion of nece≈ø≈øitie or of voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe, I never willingly imparted tho≈øe actions and parts (which cu≈øtome willeth to be concealed) to the view of any creature. I endure more compul≈øion, then I deeme befitting a man, e≈øpecially of my profe≈ø≈øion. But he grew to ≈øuch ≈øuper≈øtition, that by expre≈ø≈øe words in his la≈øt will and te≈øtament, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that being dead, he ≈øhould have linnen-≈ølops put about them.

The in≈øtruction which <hi>Cyrus</hi> giveth his children, that neither they nor any other ≈øhould either ≈øee or touch his body, after the breath were once out of it; I a≈øcribe it unto ≈øome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of devotion in him. For both his hi≈øtorian and him≈øelfe, among≈øt many other notable qualities they are endued with, have throughout all the cour≈øe of their life ≈øeemed to have a ≈øingular re≈øpect and awfull reverence vnto religion. That ≈øtorie di≈øplea≈øed me very much, which a noble man told me of a kin≈øman of mine (a man very famous &amp; well knowne both in peace and warre) which is, that dying verie aged in his court, being much tormented with extreame pangs of the ≈øtone, he with an earne≈øt and vnwearied care, emploied all his la≈øt houres, to di≈øpo≈øe the honor and ceremonie of his funerals, and ≈øummoned all the nobilitie

that came to vi≈øit him to give him a≈ø≈øured promi≈øe to be as a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, and to convay him to his la≈øt re≈øting place. To the very ≈øame Prince, who was with him at his la≈øt ga≈øp, he made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie earne≈øt ≈øute, he would command all his hou≈øhold to wait vpon him at his interrement, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing many rea≈øons, and all eaging divers examples, to prove that it was a thing very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and fitting a man of his qualitie: which a≈ø≈øured promi≈øe when he had obtained, &amp; had at his plea≈øure mar≈øhalled the order how they ≈øhould march, he ≈øeemed quietly and contentedly to yeeld vp the gho≈øt. I have ≈øeldome ≈øeene a vanitie continue ≈øo long. This other curio≈øitie meere oppo≈øite vnto it (which to prove I need not labor for home-examples) ≈øeemeth in my opinion co≈øin-german to this that is, when one is ever readie to breathe his la≈øt, carefully and pa≈ø≈øionately to endevor, how to reduce the convoy of his ob≈øequies vnto ≈øome particular &amp; vnwonted parcimonie, to one ≈øervant and to one lanterne: I heare the humor and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</hi> commended, who expre≈øly forbade his heires to v≈øe tho≈øe ceremonies about his interrement, which in ≈øuch ca≈øes were formerly accu≈øtomed: Is it tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and frugalitie, to avoid charge and voluptuou≈ønes, the v≈øe and knowledge of which is inperceptable vnto vs?

Were it requi≈øite to appoint any, I would be of opinion, that as well in that, as in all other actions of mans life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ≈øhould referre the rule of it to the qualitie of his fortune.

                        <p>THere is no man living, whom it may le≈ø≈øe be≈øeeme to ≈øpeake of memorie, than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, for to ≈øay truth, I have none at all: and am fully per≈øwaded that no-mans can-be ≈øo weake and forgetfull as mine. All other parts are in me common and vile, but touching me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, I thinke to carrie the pri≈øe from all-other, that have it weake≈øt, nay and to gaine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of it, be≈øides the naturall want I endure (for truely con≈øidering the nece≈ø≈øitie of it, <hi>Plato</hi> hath rea≈øon to name it <hi>A great and mighty Godde≈ø≈øe</hi>) In my countrie, if a man will imply that one hath no ≈øen≈øe, he will ≈øay, ≈øuch a one hath no memorie: and when I complaine of mine, they reprove me &amp; will not beleeve me, as if I accu≈øed my-≈øelfe to be mad &amp; ≈øencele≈ø≈øe. They make no difference betweene memorie &amp; wit; which is an empairing of my market: But they doe me wrong, for contrariwi≈øe, it is commonly ≈øeene by experience, that excellent memories do rather accompany weake judgements. Moreover they wrong me in this (who can do nothing ≈øo well as to be a perfect friend) that the ≈øame words which accu≈øe my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, repre≈øent ingratitude. From my affection they take hold of my memorie, &amp; of a naturall defect, they infer a want of judgement or con≈øcience. Some wil ≈øay, he hath forgotten this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, or reque≈øt, or that promi≈øe, he is not mindfull of his old friends, he never remembred to ≈øay, or doe, or conceale this or that, for my ≈øake. Verily I may ea≈øily forget, but to neglect the charge my friend hath committed to my tru≈øt, I never do it. Let them beare with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and not conclude it to be a kind of malice; which is ≈øo contrarie an enemie to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. Yet am I ≈øomewhat comforted. Fir≈øt, becau≈øe it is an evill, from which I have chieflie drawne the rea≈øon to correct a wor≈øe mi≈øchiefe, that would ea≈øily have growen vpon me: that is to ≈øay, ambition; which defect is intolerable in them that meddlewith wordly negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For as divers like examples of natures progre≈ø≈øe, ≈øay, ≈øhe hath happily ≈øtrengthned other faculties in me, according as it hath growne weaker and weaker in me, and I ≈øhould ea≈øily lay downe and wire-draw my minde and judgement, upon other mens traces, without exerci≈øing their proper forces, if by the benefit of memorie, forren inventions &amp; ≈øtrange opinions were pre≈øent with me. That my ≈øpeech is thereby ≈øhorter: For the Magazin of Memorie, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure more ≈øtored with matter, than is the ≈øtore-hou≈øe of Invention. Had it held out with me, I had ere this wearied all my friends with pratling: the ≈øubjects rouzing the meane facultie I have to manage and imploy them, ≈øtrengthning and wre≈øting my di≈øcour≈øes. It is pitie; I have a≈ø≈øaied by the trial of ≈øom of my private friends: according as their memory hath mini≈øtred them a whole and perfect matter, who recoile their narration ≈øo farre-backe, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12117:14"/>
≈øtuff-it with ≈øo many vaine circum≈øtances, that if the ≈øtory be good, they ≈ømoother the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of it: if bad, you mu≈øt needs either cur≈øe the good fortune of their memorie, or blame the misfortune of their judgement. And it is no ea≈øie matter, being in the mid≈øt of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere of a di≈øcour≈øe, to ≈øtop cunningly, to make a ≈øudden period, and to cut-it-off. And there is nothing whereby the cleane ≈øtrength of a hor≈øe is more knowne, than to make a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and cleane ≈øtop. Among the skilfull I ≈øee ≈øome, that ≈øtrive, but can not ≈øtay their race. While≈øt they labour to finde the point to ≈øtop their cour≈øe, they ≈øtagger and falter, as men that faint through weakene≈ø≈øe. Above all, old men are dangerous, who have onely the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of things pa≈øt left them, and have lo≈øt the remembrance of their repetitions. I have heard ≈øome very plea≈øant reports become mo≈øt irke≈øome and tedious in the mouth of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lord, for≈øomuch as all the by-≈øtanders had many times beene cloyed with them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, (as ≈øaid an ancient Writer) that, <hi>I doe not ≈øo much remember iniuries receiued.</hi> I had need have a prompter as <hi>Darius</hi> had, who not to forget the wrong he had received of the Athenians, when≈øoever he ≈øate downe at his table, cau≈øed a page to ≈øing unto him, <hi>Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the</hi> Athenians, and that the places or bookes which I read-over, <q>do ever ≈ømile upon me, with ≈øome new noveltie. It is not without rea≈øon, men≈øay, that <hi>he who hath not a good and readie memorie, ≈øhould never meddle with telling of lies, and feare to become a liar.</hi>
                           </q> I am not ignorant how the Grammarians make a difference betweene ≈øpeaking vntrue and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ≈øay that to ≈øpeake vntruly, is to ≈øpeake that which is fal≈øe, but was reputed true; and that the definition of the Latin word, <hi>mentiri,</hi> whence the French word, <hi>mentir,</hi> is derived, which in Engli≈øh is to lie, implieth and meaneth to go again≈øt ones con≈øcience: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence it concerneth onely tho≈øe, who ≈øpeake contrary to that which they know, of whom I ≈øpeake. Now the≈øe, either invent, ≈øeale, ≈øtampe and all, or el≈øe they di≈øgui≈øe and change a true ground. When they di≈øgui≈øe or change, if they be often put to the repetition of one thing, it is hard for them to keepe ≈øtill in one path, and very ≈øtrange if they lo≈øe not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves: becau≈øe the thing, as it is, having fir≈øt taken vp her ≈øtand in the memory, and there by the way of knowledge and witting, imprinted it-≈øelfe, it were hard it ≈øhould not repre≈øent it≈øelfe to the imagination, di≈øplacing and ≈øupplanting fal≈øhood, which therein can have no ≈øuch footing, or ≈øetled fa≈øtne≈ø≈øe: and that the circum≈øtances of the fir≈øt learning, ≈øtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into the minde, ≈øhould not cau≈øe it to di≈øper≈øe the remembrance of all fal≈øe or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtardizing parts gotten together. Where they altogether invent, for≈øomuch as there is no certaine impre≈ø≈øion, to front their fal≈øhood, they ≈øeeme to have ≈øo much the le≈ø≈øer feare to mi≈øtake or forget them≈øelves, which al≈øo notwith≈øtanding being an airie bodie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hold-fa≈øt may ea≈øily e≈øcape the memorie, except it be well a≈ø≈øured: whereof I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (to my no ≈ømall plea≈øure) ≈øeene the experience, at the co≈øt of tho≈øe, who profe≈ø≈øe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to frame their ≈øpeech, but as be≈øt ≈øhall fit the affaires they negotiate, and as be≈øt ≈øhall plea≈øe the great men they ≈øpeake vnto.

                        <p>So doe we ≈øee that in the gift of eloquence, ≈øome have ≈øuch a facility and promptitude, and that which we call vtterance, ≈øo ea≈øie and at command, that at all a≈ø≈øaies, and vpon everie occa≈øion, they are ready and provided; and others more ≈ølow, never ≈øpeake any thing except much laboured and premeditated. As Ladies and daintie Dames are taught rules to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and bodily exerci≈øes, according to the advantage of what they have faire≈øt about them. If I were to give the like coun≈øel, in tho≈øe two different advantages of eloquence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Preachers and pleading lawiers of our age ≈øeeme to make profe≈ø≈øion; the ≈ølowe ≈øpeaker in mine opinion ≈øhould be the better preacher, and the other the better lawier. For ≈øomuch as charge of the fir≈øt allowes-him as much lei≈øure as he plea≈øeth to prepare him-≈øelfe; moreover his cariere continueth ≈øtill in one kinde without interruption: whereas the Lawyers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions vrging him ≈øtill vpon any accident to be ready to enter the li≈øts: and the vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted replies &amp; an≈øwers of his advers partie, do often divert him from his purpo≈øe, where he is enforced to take a new cour≈øe. Yet is-it, that at the la≈øt enter-view which was at <hi>Mar≈øeilles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the ≈øeventh, and <hi>Francis</hi> the fir≈øt, our King, it hapned cleane-contrarie, where Mon≈øieur <hi>Poyet,</hi> a man of chiefe reputation &amp; all daies of his life brought vp to plead at the bar, who≈øe charge being to make an Oration before the Pope, and having long time before premeditated and con'd the ≈øame by roat, yea, &amp; as ≈øome report, brought it with him ready-penned from <hi>Paris;</hi> the very ≈øame day it ≈øhould have beene pronounced; the Pope ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecting he might happily ≈øpeake ≈øomething, might offend the other Princes Amba≈ø≈øadors, that were about him, ≈øent the argument, which he at that time and place thought fitte≈øt to be treated of, to the king, but by fortune cleane contrarie to that which <hi>Poyet,</hi> had ≈øo much ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died for: So that his Oration was altogether fru≈øtrate, and he mu≈øt pre≈øently frame another. But he perceiving him≈øelfe vnable for-it, the Cardinall <hi>Bellay</hi> was faineto ≈øupply his place and take that charge vpon him. The Lawyers charge is much harder than the Preachers: (yet in mine opinion) ≈øhall we find more pa≈ø≈øable Lawyers then commendable Preachers at lea≈øt in <hi>France.</hi> It ≈øeemeth to be more proper to the mind, to have her operation ready &amp; ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and more incident to the judgement, to have it ≈ølow and con≈øiderate. But who remaineth mute, if he have no lei≈øure to prepare him≈øelfe, and he likewi≈øe to whom lei≈øure giveth no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ≈øay better, are both in one ≈øelfe degree of ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe. It is reported that <hi>Seuerus Ca≈ø≈øius</hi> ≈øpake better extempore, and without premeditation. That he was more beholding to fortune, then to his diligence; that to be interrupted in his ≈øpeech redounded to his profit: &amp; that his adver≈øaries feared to vrge-him, le≈øt his ≈øudden anger ≈øhould redouble his eloquence. I know this condition of nature by experience, which can-not abide a vehement and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous premeditation: except it hold a free, a voluntarie, and ≈øelfe-plea≈øing cour≈øe, it can never come to a good end. We commonly ≈øay of ≈øome compo≈øitions, that they ≈ømell of the oile, &amp; of the lampe, by rea≈øon of a certaine har≈øhne≈ø≈øe, and rudene≈ø≈øe, which long plodding labour imprints in them that be much elaborated. But be≈øides the care of well-doing, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the minde, over-≈øtretched to her enterpri≈øe, doth breake and impeach the-≈øame; even as it hapneth vnto water, which being clo≈øely pent-in, through it's owne violence and abundance, can not finde i≈ø≈øue at an open gullet. In this condition of nature, whereof I now ≈øpeake, this al≈øo is ioyned vnto it, that it de≈øireth not to be pricked forward by the≈øe ≈øtrong pa≈ø≈øions, as the anger of <hi>Ca≈ø≈øius</hi> (for that motion would be over-rude) it ought not to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ≈øhaken, but yeeldingly ≈øolicited: it de≈øireth to be rouzed and prickt forward by ≈øtrange occa≈øions, both pre≈øent and ca≈øuall. If it goe all-alone, it doth but langui≈øh and loyter behinde: agitation is her life and grace. I cannot well containe my ≈øelfe in mine owne po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and di≈øpo≈øition, chaunce hath more intere≈øt in it than my ≈øelfe; occa≈øion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, yea the change of my voice, drawes more from my minde than I can finde therein, when by my ≈øelfe I ≈øecond and endevor to employ the ≈øame. My words likewi≈øe are better

than my writings, if choi≈øe may be had in ≈øo woorthle≈ø≈øe things. This al≈øo hapneth vnto me, that where I ≈øeeke my ≈øelfe, I finde not my ≈øelfe: and I finde my ≈øelfe more by chaunce, than by the ≈øearch of mine owne judgement. I ≈øhall perhaps have ca≈øt-foorth ≈øome ≈øuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in writing, happily dull and har≈øh for another, but ≈øinooth and curious for my ≈øelfe.

It were a notable di≈øcourte≈øie vnto our common rules, both towards an equall, but more toward a great per≈øon, not to meete with you in your hou≈øe, if he have once warned you that he will come: And <hi>Margaret</hi> Queene of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was woont to ≈øay to this purpo≈øe, <hi>That it was a kinde of incivilitie in a gentleman, to depart from his hou≈øe, as the fa≈øhion is, to meete with him that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him, how worthy ≈øoever he be: and that it more agreeth with civilitie and re≈øpect, to ≈øtay for him at home, and there to entertaine him: except it were for feare the ≈øtranger ≈øhould mi≈ø≈øe his way: and that it ≈øuffioeth to companie and waite vpon him, when he is going away againe.</hi> As for me, I oftentimes forget both the≈øe vaine offices; as one that endevoureth to aboli≈øh all maner of ceremonies in my hou≈øe. Some will bee offended at it, what can I doe withall? I had rather offend a ≈øtranger once, then my ≈øelfe everie day; for it were a continuall ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. To what end doe men avoid the ≈øervitude of Courts, and entertaine the ≈øame in their owne hou≈øes? Moreover it is a common rule in all a≈ø≈øemblies, that hee who is the meaner man, commeth fir≈øt to the place appointed, for≈øomuch as it belongs to the better man to be ≈øtaid-for, and waited vpon by the other. Neverthele≈ø≈øe we ≈øaw that at the enterview, prepared at <hi>Merceilles</hi> betweene Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ≈øeventh, and <hi>Francis</hi> the fir≈øt, King of <hi>France,</hi> the King having appointed all nece≈ø≈øatie preparations, went him-≈øelfe out of the Towne, and gave the Pope two or three dayes-lea≈øure, to make his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into it, and to refre≈øh him≈øelfe, before he would come to meete him there. Likewi≈øe at the meeting of the ≈øaid Pope with the Emperour at <hi>Bologna,</hi> the Emperour gave the Pope advantage and lea≈øure to be fir≈øt there, and afterward came him≈øelfe. It is (≈øay they) an ordinarie ceremonie at enterparlies betweene ≈øuch Princes, that the better man ≈øhould ever come fir≈øt to the place appointed; yea before him in who≈øe countrey the a≈ø≈øembly is: and they take it in this ≈øence, that it is, becau≈øe this complement ≈øhould te≈øtifie, he is the better man, whom the meaner goeth to ≈øeeke, and that hee ≈øueth vnto him. Not only ech countrey, but every Citie, yea and every vocation hath his owne particular decorum.

I have often ≈øeene men proove vnmanerly by too much maners, and importunate by over-much curte≈øie. The knowledge of entertainment is otherwi≈øe a profitable knowledge. It is, as grace and beautie are, the reconciler of the fir≈øt accoa≈øtings of ≈øociety and familiarity: and by con≈øequence, it openeth the entrance to in≈øtruct vs by the example of others, and to exploit and produce our example, if it have any in≈øtructing or communicable thing in it.</p>

                        <p>I Have heretofore heard a Prince, who was a very great Captaine, hold opinion, that a ≈øouldier might not for cowardi≈øe of heart be condemned to death: who ≈øitting at his table heard report of the Lord of <hi>Veruins</hi> ≈øentence, who for yeelding vp of <hi>Bollein,</hi> was doomed to loo≈øe his head. Verily there is rea≈øon a man ≈øhould make a difference betweene faultes proceeding from our weakene≈ø≈øe, and tho≈øe that grow from our malice. For in the latter we are directly bandied again≈øt the rules of rea≈øon, which nature hath imprinted in vs; and in the former it ≈øeemeth, we may call the ≈øame nature, as a warrant, becau≈øe it hath left-vs in ≈øuch imperfection and defect. So as divers nations have judged, that no man ≈øhould blame vs for any thing we doe again≈øt our con≈øcience. And the opinion of tho≈øe which condemne heretikes and mi≈øcreants vnto capitall puni≈øhments, is partly grounded vpon this rule: and the ≈øame which e≈øtabli≈øheth, that a Iudge or an advocate may not be called to account for any matter committed in their charge through over≈øight or ignorance. But touching cowardi≈øe, it is certain, the common fa≈øhion is, to puni≈øh the ≈øame with ignominie and ≈øhame. And ≈øome hold that this rule was fir≈øt put in practi≈øe by the Law-giver <hi>Charondas,</hi> and that before him the lawes of <hi>Greece</hi> were woont to puni≈øh tho≈øe with death, who for feare did runne away from a Battell: where he onely ordained, that for three daies together, clad in womens attire, they ≈øhould be made to ≈øit in the market-place: hoping yet to have ≈øome ≈øervice at their hands, and by meanes of this reproch, they might recover their courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

                        <p>It appeareth al≈øo that the Romane lawes did in former times puni≈øh ≈øuch as had runaway, by death.

In the time of our forefathers, the Lord of <hi>Franget,</hi> Whilom Lieutenant of the Mar≈øhall of <hi>Chastillions</hi> companie, having by the Mar≈øhall of <hi>Chabanes</hi> been placed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> in≈øtead of the Earle of <hi>Lude,</hi> and having yeelded the ≈øame vnto the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, was condemned to be degraded of all Nobilitie, and not only him≈øelfe, but all his ≈øucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding po≈øteritie declared villains and clownes, taxable and incapable to beare armes; which ≈øeuere ≈øentence was put in execution at <hi>Lyons.</hi> The like puni≈øhment did afterward al the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ≈øuffer, that were within <hi>Gui≈øe,</hi> when the Earle of <hi>Nan≈øaw</hi> entred the town: and others ≈øince.

Thus mu≈øt a man indevor to induce the Architect, the Painter, the Shoomaker to ≈øpeake of their owne trade, and ≈øo of the re≈øt, everie man in his vocation. And to this purpo≈øe am I wont, in reading of hi≈øtories (which is the ≈øubject of mo≈øt men) to con≈øider who are the writers: If they be ≈øuch as profe≈ø≈øe nothing but bare learning, the chiefe thing I learne in them, is their ≈øtile, and language: if Phi≈øitians: I believe them in what≈øoever they ≈øhall report concerning the temperatene≈ø≈øe of the aire, the health and complexion of Princes, or of hurts and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: If Lawiers, we ≈øhould ob≈øerve the controver≈øies of rights, titles, and preten≈øes of lawes and cu≈øtomes, the e≈øtabli≈øhments of policies, and ≈øuch like things: If Divines, we may note the affaires of the Church, the Eccle≈øia≈øticall cen≈øures, di≈øpen≈øations, ca≈øes of con≈øcience, and marriages: If Courtiers, maners, complements, ceremonies, and entertainements: if Warriors, what belongs vnto their charge, but chiefly the managing and conduct of the atchievements or exploits wherein they have bin them≈øelves in per≈øon: If Amba≈ø≈øadors, the negotiations, intelligences, practi≈øes, pollicies, and maner how to direct, complot, and conduct them.

For; who would giue eare vnto him, that for it's end would e≈øtabli≈øh our paine and di≈øturbance? The di≈ø≈øentions of philo≈øophicall ≈øects in this ca≈øe, are verball: <hi>Tran≈øcurramus ≈øolerti≈ø≈øimas nugas: Let vs runne over ≈øuch over-fine fooleries, and ≈øubtill trifles.</hi> There is more wilfulne≈ø≈øe and wrangling among them, than pertaines to a ≈øacred profe≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But what per≈øon a man vndertakes to act, he doth ever therewithall per≈øonate his owne. Although they ≈øay, that in vertue it ≈øelfe, the la≈øt ≈øcope of our aime is voluptuou≈ønes. It plea≈øeth me to importune their eares ≈øtill with this word, which ≈øo much offends their hearing: And if it imply any chiefe plea≈øure or exceeding contentments, it is rather due to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of vertue, than to any other ≈øupply, voluptuou≈ønes being more ≈øtrong, ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowie; ≈øturdie, and manly, is but more ≈øeriou≈øly voluptuous.

Should this ba≈øer ≈øen≈øuality de≈øerue this faire name, it ≈øhould be by competencie, and not by privilege. I finde it le≈ø≈øe voide of incommodities and cro≈ø≈øes, than vertue.

For ≈øo much as this ≈øillable ≈øounded ≈øo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øantly in their eares, and this voice ≈øeemed ≈øo ill-boding and vnluckie, the Romans had learned to allay and dilate the ≈øame by a Periphra≈øis. In liew of ≈øaying, he is dead, or he hath ended his daies, they would ≈øay, he hath lived. So it be life, be it pa≈øt or no, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: from whom we have borowed our phra≈øes <hi>quondam, alias, or late ≈øuch a one.</hi> It may happily be, as the common ≈øaying is, the time we live, is worth the mony we pay for it. I was borne betweene eleven of the clocke and noone, the la≈øt of Februarie 1533. according to our computation, the yeare beginning the fir≈øt of Ianuarie. It is but a fortnight ≈øince I was 39. yeares old. I want at lea≈øt as much more. If in the mean time I ≈øhould trouble my thoughts with a matter ≈øo farre from me, it were but folly. But what? we ≈øee both young and olde to leave their life after one ≈øelfe-≈øame condition. No man departs otherwi≈øe from it, than if he but now came to it, ≈øeeing there is no man ≈øo crazed, bedrell, or decrepite, ≈øo long as he remembers <hi>Met hu≈øalem,</hi> but thinkes he may yet live twentie yeares.

It is con≈øonant with rea≈øon and pietie, to take example by the humanity of <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> who ended his humane life at three and thirtie yeares.

                        <p>Our religion hath had no ≈øurer humane foundation, then the contempt of life. Di≈øcour≈øe of rea≈øon doth not onely call and ≈øummon vs vnto it. For why ≈øhould we feare to loo≈øe a thing, which being lo≈øt, cannot be moaned? but al≈øo, ≈øince we are threatned by ≈øo many kinds of death, there is no more inconvenience to feare them all, than to endure one: what matter is it when it commeth, ≈øince it is vnavoidable? <hi>Socrates</hi> an≈øwered one that told him, The thirty Tyrants have condemned thee to death; <hi>And Nature them,</hi> ≈øaid he. What fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe is it to carke and care ≈øo much, at that in≈øtant and pa≈ø≈øage from all exemption of paine and care? As our birth brought vs the birth of all things, ≈øo ≈øhall our death the end of all things. Therefore is it as great follie to weepe, we ≈øhall not live a hundred yeeres hence, as to waile we lived not a hundred yeeres agoe. <hi>Death is the beginning of another life.</hi> So wept we, and ≈øo much did it co≈øt vs to enter into this life; and ≈øo did we ≈øpoile vs of our ancient vaile in entring into it. Nothing can be grievous that is but once. Is it rea≈øon ≈øo long to feare, a thing of ≈øo ≈øhort time? Long life or ≈øhort life is made all one by death. For long or ≈øhort is not in things that are no more. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ≈øaith, there are certaine litle bea≈øts along≈øt the river <hi>Hy≈øpanis,</hi> that live but one day; ≈øhe which dies at 8. a clocke in the morning, dies in her youth, &amp; ≈øhe that dies at 5. in the afternoon, dies in her decrepitude, who of vs doth not laugh, when we ≈øhall ≈øee this ≈øhort moment of continuance to be had in con≈øideration of good or ill fortune? The mo≈øt &amp; the lea≈øt in ours, if we compare it with eternitie, or equall it to the la≈øting of mountaines, rivers, ≈øtars, and trees, or any other living creature, is no le≈ø≈øe ridiculous. But nature compels vs to it. <hi>Depart</hi> ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>out of this world, even as you came into it. The ≈øame way you came from death, to life returne without pa≈ø≈øion or amazement, from life to death: your death is but a peece of the worlds order, and but a parcell of the worlds life.</hi>

Neither men nor their lives are mea≈øured by the Ell. <hi>Chiron</hi> refu≈øed immortalitie, being informed of the conditions thereof, even by the God of time and of continuance, <hi>Saturne</hi> his father.

                           <hi>FOrtis imaginatio generat ca≈øum: A ≈øtrong imagination begetteth chance,</hi> ≈øay learned clearkes. I am one of tho≈øe that feele a very great conflict and power of imagination. All men are ≈øhockt therewith, and ≈øome overthrowne by it. The impre≈ø≈øion of it pierceth me, and for want of ≈øtrength to re≈øi≈øt her, my endevour is to avoid it. I could live with the only a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of holy and mery hearted men. The ≈øight of others angui≈øhes doth ≈øen≈øibly drive me into angui≈øh; and my ≈øen≈øe hath often v≈øurped the ≈øen≈øe of a third man. If one cough continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, he provokes my lungs and throate. I am more vnwilling to vi≈øite the ≈øicke dutie doth engage me vnto, than tho≈øe to whom I am little beholding, and regard lea≈øt. I apprehend the evill which I ≈øtudie, and place it in me. I deeme it not ≈øtrange that ≈øhe brings both agues and death to ≈øuch as give her ≈øcope to worke her will, and applaude her. <hi>Simon Thomas</hi> was a great Phi≈øitian in his daies. I remember vpon a time comming by chance to vi≈øit a rich old man that dwelt in <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> and who was troubled with the cough of the lungs, who di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øing with the ≈øaid <hi>Simon Thomas</hi> of the meanes of his recoverie, he told him, that one of the be≈øt was, to give me occa≈øion to be delighted in his companie, and that fixing his eyes vpon the livelines and fre≈øhnes of my face, and ≈øetting his thoughts vpon the jolitie and vigor, wherewith my youthfull age did then flouri≈øh, and filling all his ≈øen≈øes with my flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhing e≈øtate, his habitude might thereby be amended, and his health recovered. But he forgot to ≈øay, that mine might al≈øo be empaired and infected. <hi>Gallus Vibius</hi> did ≈øo well enure his minde to comprehend the e≈ø≈øence and motions of folly, that he ≈øo tran≈øported his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from out his ≈øeate, as he could never afterward bring it to his right place againe: and might rightly boa≈øt, to have become a ≈øoole through wi≈ødome. Some there are, that through feare anticipate the hang-mans hand; as he did, who≈øe friends having obtained his pardon, and putting away the cloth wherewith he was hood-winkt, that he might heare it read, was found ≈øtarke dead vpon the ≈øcaffold, wounded onely by the ≈øtroke of imagination. Wee ≈øweate, we ≈øhake, we grow pale, and we blu≈øh at the motions of our imaginations; and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in our beds we feele our bodies agitated and turmoiled at their apprehen≈øions, yea in ≈øuch manner, as ≈øometimes we are ready to yeeld vp the ≈øpirit. And burning youth (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a≈øleepe) is often therewith ≈øo po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and enfoulded, that dreaming it doth ≈øatisfie and enjoy her amorous de≈øires.</p>

The Hi≈øtories I borrow, I referre to the con≈øciences of tho≈øe I take them from.

I ≈øee it and reape profit by it, as well in ≈øhadow as in bodie. And in divers le≈ø≈øons that often hi≈øtories affoord, I commonly make v≈øe of that, which is mo≈øt rare and memorable. Some writers there are, who≈øe end is but to relate the events. Mine, if I could attaine to it, ≈øhould be to declare, what may come to pa≈ø≈øe, touching the ≈øame. It is ju≈øtly allowed in ≈øchooles, to ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øimilitudes, when they have none. Yet do not I ≈øo, and concerning that point, in ≈øuper≈øtitious religion, I exceed all hi≈øtoricall credit.

The≈øe con≈øiderations do neverthele≈ø≈øe never di≈øtract a man of vnder≈øtanding from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the common gui≈øe? Rather on the contrary, me ≈øeemeth, that all ≈øeverall, ≈øtrange, and particular fa≈øhions proceede rather of follie, or ambitious effectation, than of true rea≈øon: and that a wi≈øe man ought inwardly to retire his minde from the common pre≈ø≈øe, and hold the ≈øame liberty and power to judge freely of all things, but for outward matters, he ought ab≈øolutely to follow the fa≈øhions and forme cu≈øtomarily received. Publicke ≈øocietie hath nought to do with our thoughts; but for other things, as our actions, our travel, our fortune, and our life, that mu≈øt be accommodated and left to it's ≈øervice and common opinions: as that good and great <hi>Socrates,</hi> who refu≈øed to ≈øave his life by di≈øobeying the magi≈øtrate, yea a magi≈øtrate mo≈øt wicked and vnju≈øt.

The contexture and combining of this monarchie, and great building, having bin di≈ømi≈øt and di≈øolved by it, namely in her old yeares, giveth as much overture and entrance as a man will to like injuries.

for his ≈øo great clemency. But the like ≈øucceeded not to our Prince, for his mildne≈ø≈øe and lenitie, could not ≈øo warrant him, but that afterward he fell into the ≈ønares of the like trea≈øon: ≈øo vaine and frivolous a thing is humane wi≈øedome: and contrary to al projects, devi≈øes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, &amp; precautions, fortune doth ever keepe a full ≈øway and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all events. We count tho≈øe Phi≈øitians happy and ≈øucce≈ø≈øefull, that ≈øucce≈ø≈øefully end a de≈øperate cure, or come to a good i≈ø≈øue: as if there were no other arte but theirs, that could not ≈øub≈øi≈øt of it ≈øelfe, and who≈øe foundations were too feeble, to ≈øtand and relie vpon her owne ≈øtrength: and as if there were none but it, that ≈øtandes in neede of fortunes helpe-affoording hand, for the effecting of her operations. My conceit of it, is both the wor≈øt and the be≈øt a man may imagine: for thankes be to God, there is no commerce betweene vs: I am contrary to others; for I ever de≈øpi≈øe it, and when I am ≈øick, in ≈øtead of entring into league or compo≈øition with it, I then beginne to hate and feare it mo≈øt: and an≈øwere ≈øuch as vrge mee to take Phy≈øicke, that at lea≈øt they will tarie till ≈øuch time as I have recovered my health and ≈øtrength againe; that then I may the better be enabled to endure the violence and hazard of their potions. I let nature worke, and pre≈øuppo≈øe vnto my ≈øelfe, that ≈øhe hath provided her ≈øelfe, both of teeth and clawes, to defend her ≈øelf from ≈øuch a≈ø≈øaults as ≈øhal be≈øet her, and to maintaine this contexture or frame, who≈øe di≈ø≈øolution it ≈øo much hateth. In liew of bringing helpe vnto her, when ≈øhee mo≈øt ≈øtriveth, and is combated by ≈øickene≈ø≈øe, I greatly feare le≈øt I bring ≈øuccor vnto her adver≈øarie, and ≈øurcharge her with new enemies. Now I conclude, that not onely in Phi≈øicke, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe in ≈øundry more certaine artes, fortune hath great ≈øhare in them. The Poeticall furies, which ravi≈øh and tran≈øport their Author beyond him≈øelfe, why ≈øhall we not a≈øcribe them to his good fortune, ≈øince him≈øelfe confe≈ø≈øeth, that they exceede his ≈øtrength and ≈øufficiencie, and acknowledgeth to proceede from el≈øewhere, than from him≈øelfe, and that they are not in his power, no more than Orators ≈øay to have tho≈øe ≈øtrange motions and extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, that in their arte tran≈øport them beyond their purpo≈øe?

But fortune yet doth much more evidently ≈øhewe, the ≈øhare ≈øhee hath in all their workes, by the graces and beauties that often are found in them, not only beyond the intent, but be≈øides the very knowledge of the workman. A heedy Reader ≈øhall often di≈øcover in other mens compo≈øitions, perfections farre-differing from the Authors meaning, and ≈øuch as haply he never dreamed of, and illu≈øtrateth them with richer ≈øen≈øes, and more excellent con≈øtructions. As for military enterpri≈øes, no man is ≈øo blinde but ≈øeeth what ≈øhare fortune hath in them: even in our coun≈øels and deliberations, ≈øome chance or good lucke mu≈øt needs be joyned to them, for what≈øoever our wi≈øedome can effect, is no great matter. The ≈øharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and quicker it is, more weakene≈ø≈øe findes it in it≈øelfe, and ≈øo much the more doth it di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øt it≈øelfe. I am of <hi>Sillaes</hi> opinion: and when I neare≈øt con≈øider the mo≈øt glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites of warre, me thinkes I ≈øee, that tho≈øe who have the conduct of them, employ ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coun≈øell nor deliberation about them, but for fa≈øhion-≈øake, and leave the be≈øt part of the enterpri≈øe to fortune, and on the confidence they have in her ayde, they ≈øtill go beyond the limits of all di≈øcour≈øe. Ca≈øuall rejoycings, and ≈øtrange furies en≈øue among their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which for the mo≈øt induce them to take the coun≈øell lea≈øt grounded vpon apparance or rea≈øon, and which quaile their courage beyond rea≈øon; whence it hath ≈øucceeded vnto diver≈øe great Captaines, by giving credite to ≈øuch ra≈øh coun≈øels, and aleaging to their ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that by ≈øome divine in≈øpiration, and other ≈øignes and progno≈øtications, they were encouraged to ≈øuch and ≈øuch enterpri≈øes.

As in the≈øe two examples I have lately mentioned, there is no doubt, but that it was more commendable and generous in him, who had received the offence, to remit and pardon the ≈øame, than to have done otherwi≈øe.

Being yet a child, I ≈øaw a gentleman, who had the command of a great Citie, and by a commotion of a ≈øeditiou≈øly-furious people greatly put to his plunges, who to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the ri≈øing-fire of this tumult, re≈øolved to ≈øally out from a ≈øtrongly-a≈ø≈øured place, where he was ≈øafe, and yeeld him≈øelfe to that many-headed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter mutinous rowt; thrived ≈øo ill by it, that he was mi≈øerably ≈ølaine among≈øt them: yet deeme I not his over≈øight to have beene ≈øo great an i≈ø≈øuing out, his memorie being of mo≈øt men condemned, as becau≈øe he tooke a way of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and remi≈ø≈øene≈ø≈øe, and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to extingui≈øh that rage and hurly-burly, rather by way of following, than of guiding, and by requiring ≈øute, than by demon≈øtrative re≈øolution: and I deeme a gratiou≈øly-milde ≈øeveritie, with a militarie commandement, full of confidence and ≈øecuritie, be≈øeeming his ranke, and the dignitie of his charge, had better availed him, had beene more ≈øucce≈ø≈øefull, at lea≈øt with more honour, and well ≈øeeming comline≈ø≈øe. There is nothing le≈ø≈øe to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or hoped for at the hands of this mon≈øtrous-faced-multitude, thus agitated by furie, then humanitie and gentlene≈ø≈øe; it will much ≈øooner receive reverence, and admit feare. I might al≈øo blame him, that having vndertaken a re≈øolution (in my judgement, rather brave then ra≈øh) to ca≈øt him≈øelfe incon≈øiderately, weake and vnarmed, amid≈øt a tempe≈øtuous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of ≈øencele≈ø≈øe and mad men, he ≈øhould have gone through-≈øtitch with it, and not leave the per≈øon he repre≈øented in the briers, whereas, after he had perceived the danger at hand, he chanced to bleede at the no≈øe; and then to change that demi≈ø≈øe and flattering counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he had vndertaken, into a di≈ømaide and drooping looke, filling both voice and eyes with a≈øtoni≈øhment and repentance: and ≈øeeking to ≈øquat him≈øelfe, hee the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and called them vpon him.

Divers coun≈øels were propo≈øed, ≈øundry opinions heard, as in a ≈øubject of great difficultie, and on which depended ≈øo many weightie con≈øequences.

                           <hi>that a mans owne wit, force, droope, and as it were dimini≈øh it ≈øelfe, to make roome for others.</hi> I might ≈øay, that as plants are choked by over-much moi≈øture, and lamps dammed with too much oyle, ≈øo are the actions of the mind over-whelmed by over-aboundance of matter and ≈øtudie: which occupied and intangled with ≈øo great a diver≈øitie of things, loo≈øeth the mean to ≈øpread and cleare it ≈øelfe; and that ≈øurcharge keepeth it low-drooping and faint. But it is otherwi≈øe, for our mind ≈øtretcheth the more by how much more it is repleni≈øhed. And in examples of former times, the contrary is ≈øeene, of ≈øufficient men in the managing of publike affaires, of great Captaines, and notable Coun≈øellers in matters of e≈øtate, to have been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall excellently wi≈øe. And concerning Philo≈øophers, retired from all publike negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have indeed ≈øometimes been vilified, by the comike libertie of their times, then opinions and demeanors yeelding them ridiculous. Will you make them judges of the right of a proce≈ø≈øe, or of the actions of a man? They are readie for it. They enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any life yet remaining, whether any motion. Whether man be any thing but an Oxe, what working or ≈øuffering is; what ≈øtrange bea≈øts law and ju≈øtice are. Speake they of the Magi≈øtrate, or ≈øpeake they vnto him?

E≈øteeme you any man the greater for po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing two hundred acres of land? They ≈øcoffe at him, as men accu≈øtomed to embrace all the world, as their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. Do you boa≈øt of your Nobilitie, becau≈øe you can blazon your de≈øcent of ≈øeaven or eight rich Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?

And were you lineally de≈øcended in the fiftieth degree from <hi>Hercules,</hi> they deeme it a vanitie to vaunt or alleadge this gift of fortune. So did the vulgare ≈øort di≈ødaine them as ignorant of the fir≈øt and common things, and as pre≈øumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and in≈øolent.

I quit this fir≈øt rea≈øon, and thinke it better to ≈øay, that this evill proceedeth from the bad cour≈øe they take to follow ≈øciences; and that re≈øpecting the manner we are in≈øtructed in them, it is no wonder if neither Schollers nor Ma≈øters, howbeit they proove more learned, become no whit more ≈øufficient. Verily the daily care, and continuall charges of our fathers, aymeth at nothing ≈øo much, as to ≈øtore our heads with knowledge and learning; as for judgement and vertue, that is never ≈øpoken of. If a man pa≈ø≈øe by, crie out to our people; <hi>Oh what a wi≈øe man goeth yonder?

We labour, and toyle, and plod to fill the memorie, and leave both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding and con≈øcience emptie.

Where as <hi>Epicurus</hi> cleane contrarie to him in three hundred volumes, he left behind him, had not made v≈øe of one allegation. It was my fortune not long ≈øince to light vpon ≈øuch a place: I had langui≈øhingly traced after ≈øome French words, ≈øo naked and ≈øhallow, and ≈øo void either of ≈øence or matter, that at la≈øt I found them to be nought but meere French words; and after a tedious and weari≈øome travell, I chanced to ≈øtumble vpon an high, rich, and even to the clouds-rai≈øed piece, the de≈øcent whereof had it been ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more plea≈øant or ea≈øie, or the a≈øcent reaching a little further, it had been excu≈øable, and to be borne-withall; but it was ≈øuch a ≈øteepie downe-fall, and by meere ≈øtrength he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen out of the maine rocke, that by reading of the fir≈øt ≈øixe words, me thought I was carried into another world: whereby I perceive the bottome whence I came to be ≈øo low and deep, as I dur≈øt never more adventure to go through it; for, if I did ≈øtuffe any one of my di≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes with tho≈øe rich ≈øpoiles, it would manife≈øtly cau≈øe the ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe of others to appeare. To reprove mine owne faults in others, ≈øeemes to me no more vn≈øufferable, then to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend (as I doe often) tho≈øe of others in my ≈øelfe. They ought to be accu≈øed everywhere, and have all places of Sanctuarie taken from them: yet do I know how over-boldly, at all times I adventure to equall my ≈øelfe vnto my filchings, and to march hand in hand with them; not without a fond-hardie hope, that I may perhaps be able to bleare the eyes of the judges from di≈øcerning them. But it is as much for the benefit of my application, as for the good of mine invention and force. And I doe not furiou≈øly front, and bodie to bodie wre≈øtle with tho≈øe old champions: it is but by ≈øleights, advantages, and fal≈øe-offers I ≈øeek to come within them, and if I can, to give them a fall. I do not ra≈øhly take them about the necke, I do but touch them, nor do I go ≈øo far as by my bargaine I would ≈øeeme to doe; could I but keepe even with them, I ≈øhould then be an hone≈øt man; for I ≈øeeke not to venture on them, but where they are ≈øtronge≈øt. To doe as I have ≈øeen ≈øome, that is, to ≈øhroud them≈øelves vnder others armes, not daring ≈øo much as to ≈øhow their fingers ends vnarmed, and to botch vp all their works (as it is an ea≈øie matter in a common ≈øubiect, namely for the wi≈øer ≈øort) with anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inventions, heere and there hudled-vp together. And in tho≈øe who endevored to hide what they have filched from others, and make it their owne, it is fir≈øt a manife≈øt note of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, then a plaine argument of cowardline≈ø≈øe; who having nothing of any worth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to make ≈øhow of, will yet vnder the countenance of others ≈øufficiencie goe about to make a faire offer: Moreover (oh great fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe) to ≈øeek by ≈øuch co≈øening tricks to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtall the ignorant approbation of the common ≈øort, nothing fearing to di≈øcover their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to men of vnder≈øtanding (who≈øe prai≈øe onely is of value) who will ≈øoone trace out ≈øuch borrowed ware.

And truely, my meaning is, but to ≈øhew, that the greate≈øt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, and importing all humane knowledge, ≈øeemeth to be in this point, where the nurture and in≈øtitution of young children is in que≈øtion. For, as in matters of husbandrie the labor that mu≈øt be v≈øed before ≈øowing, ≈øetting, and planting, yea in planting it ≈øelfe, is mo≈øt certaine and ea≈øie. But when that which was ≈øowen, ≈øet, and planted, commeth to take life; before it come to ripene≈ø≈øe, much adoe, and great varietie of proceeding belongeth to it. So in men, it is no great matter to get them, but being borne, what continuall cares, what diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, what doubts and feares, doe daily waite on their parents and tutors, before they can be nurtured and brought to any good? The fore-≈øhew of their inclination while≈øt they are young is ≈øo vncertaine, their humours ≈øo variable, their promi≈øes ≈øo changing, their hopes ≈øo fal≈øe, and their proceedings ≈øo doubtfull, that it is very hard, (yea for the wi≈øe≈øt) to ground any certaine judgement, or a≈ø≈øured ≈øucce≈ø≈øe vpon them.

                        <p>Madame, Learning joyned with true knowledge is an e≈øpeciall and gracefull ornament, and an implement of wonderfull v≈øe and con≈øequence, namely in per≈øons rai≈øed to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fortune, wherein you are. And in good trueth, learning hath not her owne true forme, nor can ≈øhe make ≈øhew of her beauteous lineaments, if ≈øhe fall into the hands of ba≈øe and vile per≈øons. [For, as famous <hi>Torquato Ta≈ø≈øo</hi> ≈øaith; Philo≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>phie being a rich and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queene, and knowing her owne worth, graciou≈øly ≈ømileth vpon, and lovingly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Princes and noble men, if they become ≈øuters to her, admitting them as her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gently affoording them all the favours ≈øhe can; whereas vpon the contrarie, if ≈øhe be wooed, and ≈øued vnto by clownes, mechanicall fellowes, and ≈øuch ba≈øe kind of people, ≈øhe holds hir ≈øelfe di≈øparaged and di≈øgraced, as holding no proportion with them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øee we by experience, that if a true Gentleman, or nobleman follow hir with any atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wooed her with importunitie, he ≈øhall learne and know more of hir, and proove a better ≈øcholler in one yeare, then an vngentle, or ba≈øe fellow ≈øhal in ≈øeaven, though he pur≈øue hir never ≈øo attentively.] She is much more readie and fierce to lend hir furtherance and direction in the conduct of a warre, to attempt honorable actions, to command a people, to treat a peace with a prince of forraine nation, then ≈øhe is to forme an argument in Logick, to devi≈øe a Syllogi≈øine, to canva≈øe a ca≈øe at the barre, or to pre≈øcribe a receit of pills. So (noble Ladie) for≈øomuch as I cannot per≈øwade my ≈øelfe, that you will either forget or neglect this point, concerning the in≈øtitution of yours, e≈øpecially having ta≈øted the ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe thereof, and being de≈øcended of ≈øo noble and learned a race.

of his bodie: and to thinke that the mind is together with the ≈øame exerci≈øed, and not the contrarie? As for other matters, this in≈øtitution ought to be directed by a ≈øweet-≈øevere mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; Not as ≈øome doe, who in liew of gently-bidding children to the banquet of letters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent them with nothing but horror and crueltie. Let me have this violence and compul≈øion removed, there is nothing that, in my ≈øeeming, doth more ba≈øtardi≈øe and dizzie a wel-borne, and gentle nature: If you would have him ≈øtand in awe of ≈øhame and puni≈øhment, doe not ≈øo much enure him to-it: accu≈øtome him patiently to endure ≈øweat and cold, the ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe of the wind, the heat of the ≈øunne, and how to de≈øpi≈øe all hazards. Remove from him all nicene≈ø≈øe and quaintne≈ø≈øe in clothing, in lying, in eating, and in drinking: fa≈øhion him to all things; that he prove not a faire and wanton-puling boy, but a lu≈øtie and vigorous boy: When I was a child, being a man, and now am old, I have ever judged &amp; believed the ≈øame. But among≈øt other things, I could never away with this kind of di≈øcipline v≈øed in mo≈øt of our Colledges. It had peradventure been le≈ø≈øe-hurtfull, if they had ≈øomewhat inclined to mildne≈ø≈øe, or gentle intreatie. It is a verie pri≈øon of captivated youth, and proves di≈ø≈øolute, in puni≈øhing it before it be ≈øo. Come vpon them when they are going to their le≈ø≈øon, and you heare nothing but whipping and brawling, both of children tormented, and ma≈øters be≈øotted with anger and chafing. How wide are they, which go about to allure a childs mind to go to his booke, being yet but tender and fearefull, with a ≈øtearne-frowning countenance, and with hands-full of rods? Oh wicked and pernicious manner of teaching! which <hi>Quintillian</hi> hath verie well noted, that this imperious kind of authoritie, namely, this way of puni≈øhing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, drawes many dangerous inconveniences with-in. How much more decent were it, to ≈øee their ≈øchool-hou≈øes and formes ≈øtrewed with greene boughes and flowers, then with bloodie burchen-twigs? If it lay in me, I would do as the Philo≈øopher <hi>Speu≈øippus</hi> did, who cau≈øed the pictures of Gladne≈ø≈øe and Ioy, of <hi>Flora,</hi> and of the Graces, to be ≈øet-vp round about his ≈øchool-hou≈øe. Where their profit lieth, there ≈øhould al≈øo be their recreation. Tho≈øe meats ought to be ≈øugred-over, that are healthfull for childrens ≈øtomakes, and tho≈øe made bitter that are hurtfull for them. It is ≈øtrange to ≈øee how carefull <hi>Plato</hi> ≈øheweth him≈øelfe in framing of his lawes about the recreation &amp; pa≈øtime of the youth of his Citie, and how far he extends him≈øelfe about their exerci≈øes, ≈øports, ≈øongs, leaping, and dancing, wherof he faith, that ≈øevere antiquitie gave the conduct and patronage vnto the Gods them≈øelves, namely, to <hi>Apollo,</hi> to the Mu≈øes, and to <hi>Munerva.</hi> Marke but how far-forth he endevoreth to give a thou≈øand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to be kept in his places of exerci≈øes both of bodie and mind. As for learned Sciences, he ≈øtands not much vpon them, and ≈øeemeth in particular to commend Poe≈øie, but for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øickes-≈øake. All ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe and ≈øelfe particularitie in our manners, and conditions, is to be ≈øhunned, as an enemie to ≈øocietie and civill conver≈øation. Who would not be a≈øtoni≈øhed at <hi>Demophons</hi> complexion, chiefe ≈øteward of <hi>Alexanders</hi> hou≈øhold, who was wont to ≈øweat in the ≈øhadow, and quiver for cold in the ≈øunne? I have ≈øeene ≈øome to ≈øtartle at the ≈ømell of an apple, more then at the ≈øhot of a peece; ≈øome to be frighted with a mou≈øe, ≈øome readie to ca≈øt their gorge at the ≈øight of a me≈ø≈øe of creame, and others to be ≈øcared with ≈øeeing a fether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ≈øhaken: as <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who could not abide to ≈øee a cock, or heare his crowing. There may happily be ≈øome hidden propertie of nature, which in my judgement might ea≈øilie be removed, if it were taken in time. In≈øtitution hath gotten this vpon me (I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe with much a doe) for, except beere, all things el≈øe that are mans foode agree indifferently with my ta≈øte. The bodie being yet ≈øouple, ought to be accommodated to all fa≈øhions and cu≈øtomes; and (alwaies provided, his appetites &amp; de≈øires be kept vnder) let a yong man boldly be made fit for all Nations and companies-yea, if need be, for all di≈øorders and ≈øorfetings; let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him≈øelfe with all fa≈øhions; That he may be able to doe all things, and love to do none but tho≈øe that are commendable. Some ≈øtrict Philo≈øophers commend not, but rather blame <hi>Cali≈øthenes,</hi> for loo≈øing the good favour of his Ma≈øter <hi>Alexander,</hi> only becau≈øe he would not pledge him as much as he had drunke to him.

Yet can no man ≈øay, but that to ≈øpeake well, is mo≈øt gracious and commendable, but not ≈øo excellent as ≈øome make it: and I am grieved to ≈øee how we imploy mo≈øt part of our time about that onely. I would fir≈øt know mine owne tongue perfectly, then my neighbours with whom I have mo≈øt commerce. I mu≈øt needs acknowledge, that the Greeke and Latine tongues, are great ornaments in a gentleman, but they are purcha≈øed at over-high a rate. V≈øe-it who li≈øt, I will tell you how they may be gotten better cheape, and much ≈øooner then is ordinarily v≈øed, which was tried in my ≈øelfe. My late father, having by all the meanes and indu≈øtrie, that is po≈ø≈øible for man, ≈øought among≈øt the wi≈øe≈øt, and men of be≈øt vnder≈øtanding, to find a mo≈øt exqui≈øite and readie way of teaching, being advi≈øed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences then in v≈øe; was given to vnder≈øtand, that the lingring while, and be≈øt part of our youth, that we imploy in learning the tongues, which co≈øt them nothing, is the only cau≈øe we can never attaine to that ab≈øolute perfection of skill and knowledge, of the Greekes, and Romanes. I doe not believe that to be the onely cau≈øe. But ≈øo it-is, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient my father found-out, was this; that being yet at nur≈øe, and before the fir≈øt loo≈øing of my tongue, I was delivered to a Germaine (who died ≈øince, a mo≈øt excellent Phi≈øitian in <hi>France</hi>) he being then altogether ignorant of the French tongue, but exqui≈øitely readie and skilfull in the Latine. This man, whom my Father had ≈øent-for of purpo≈øe, and to whom he gave verie great intertainment, had me continually in his armes, and was mine onely over≈øeer. There were al≈øo iojned vnto him two of his countrimen, but not ≈øo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; who≈øe charge was to attend, and now and then, to play with me; and all the≈øe together did never intertaine me with other then the Latine tongue. As for others of his hou≈øhold, it was an inviolable rule, that neither him≈øelfe, nor my mother, nor man, nor maide-≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, were ≈øuffered to ≈øpeake one word in my companie, except ≈øuch Latine words, as every one had learned to chat and prattle with me, It were ≈øtrange to tell how euery one in the hou≈øe profited therein. My Father and my Mother learned ≈øo much Latine, that for a neede they could vnder≈øtand-it, when they heard-it ≈øpoken, even ≈øo did all the hou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ≈øervants, namely ≈øuch as were neere≈øt and mo≈øt about-me. To be ≈øhort, we were all ≈øo Latinized, that the townes round about vs had their ≈øhare of-it; in≈øomuch as even at this day, many Latine names both of workmen and of their tooles, are yet in v≈øe among them. And as for my ≈øelfe, I was about ≈øix yeares old, and could vnder≈øtand no more French or Perigordine, then Arabike, and that without arte, without bookes, rules, or gramer, without whipping or whining. I had gotten as pure a Latine tongue as my Ma≈øter could ≈øpeake; the rather becau≈øe I could neither mingle or confound the ≈øame with other tongues. If for an E≈ø≈øay they would give me a Theame, whereas the fa≈øhion in Colledges is, to give it in French, I had it in bad Latine, to reduce the ≈øame into good. And <hi>Nicholas Grucchi,</hi>

As for the Greeke, wherein I have but ≈ømall vnder≈øtanding, my father purpo≈øed to make me learne-it by arte; But by new and vncu≈øtomed meanes, that is, by way of recreation and exerci≈øe. We did to≈ø≈øe our declinations, and conjugations to and fro, as they do, who by way of a certaine game at tables learne both Arithmetike and Geometrie. For, among≈øt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he had e≈øpecially beene per≈øwaded to make me ta≈øte and apprehend the fruits of dutie and ≈øcience by an vnforced kinde of will, and of mine owne choice; and without any compul≈øion or rigor to bring me vp in all mildene≈ø≈øe and libertie: yea with ≈øuch kinde of ≈øuper≈øtition, that, whereas ≈øome are of opinion, that ≈øuddenly to awaken yoong children, and as it were by violence to ≈øtartle and fright them out of their dead ≈øleepe in a morning (wherein they are more heavie and deeper plunged then we) doth greatly trouble and di≈øtemper their braines, he would every morning cau≈øe me to be awakened by the ≈øound of ≈øome in≈øtrument; and I was never without a ≈øervant; Who to that purpo≈øe attended vpon me.

For at thirteene yeares of age, that I left the Colledge, I had read over the whole cour≈øe of Philo≈øophie (as they call it) but with ≈øo ≈ømall profit, that I can now make no account of it. The fir≈øt ta≈øte or feeling I had of bookes, was of the plea≈øure I tooke in reading the fables of <hi>Ovids</hi> Metamorpho≈øies; for, being but ≈øeaven or eight yeares old, I would ≈øteale and ≈øeque≈øter my ≈øelfe from all other delights, onely to reade them: For≈øomuch as the tongue wherein they were written was to me natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and it was the ea≈øie≈øt booke I knew, and by rea≈øon of the matter therein contained, mo≈øt agreeing with my yoong age.

names, and to this day know not their bodies, nor what they containe: So exact was my di≈øcipline. Wherby I became more carele≈ø≈øe to ≈øtudie my other pre≈øcript le≈ø≈øons. And well did it fall out for my purpo≈øe, that I had to deale with a very di≈øcreet Ma≈øter, who out of his judgement could with ≈øuch dexteritie winke<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> at, and ≈øecond my vntowardline≈ø≈øe, and ≈øuch other faults that were in me. For by that meanes, I read-over <hi>Virgils Aeneades, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Plautus,</hi> and other Italian Comedies, allured thereunto by the plea≈øantne≈ø≈øe of their ≈øeverall ≈øubjects: Had he beene ≈øo fooli≈øhly-≈øevere, or ≈øo ≈øverely froward as to cro≈ø≈øe this cour≈øe of mine, I think verily I had never brought any thing from the Colledge, but the hate and contempt of Bookes, as doth the greate≈øt part of our Nobilitie. Such was his di≈øcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ≈øo warily did he behave him≈øelfe, that he ≈øaw and would not ≈øee: hee would fo≈øter and encrea≈øe my longing: ≈øuffering me but by ≈øtealth, and by ≈ønatches to glut my ≈øelfe with tho≈øe Bookes; holding ever a gentle hand over me, concerning other regular ≈øtudies. For, the chiefe≈øt thing my father required at their hands (vnto who≈øe charge he had committed me) was a kinde of well-conditioned mildene≈ø≈øe, and facilitie of complexion. And, to ≈øay truth, mine had no other fault, but a certaine dull-langui≈øhing, and heavie ≈ølothfulne≈ø≈øe. The danger was not, I ≈øhould do-ill, but that I ≈øhould doe nothing.</p>
                        <p>No man did ever ≈øu≈øpect, I would prove a bad, but an vnprofitable man: fore≈øeeing in me rather a kind of idlene≈ø≈øe, than a voluntary craftine≈ø≈øe. I am not ≈øo ≈øelfe-conceited but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what hath followed. The complaints that are daily buzzed in mine eares are the≈øe; that I am idle, colde, and negligent in offices of friend≈øhip, and dutie to my parents, and kinsfolkes; and touching publike offices, that I am over-≈øingular and di≈ødainefull. And tho≈øe that are mo≈øt iniurious cannot aske, wherefore I have taken, and why I have not paied? but may rather demand, why I doe not quit, and wherefore I doe not give? I would take it as a favour, they ≈øhould wi≈øh ≈øuch effects of ≈øupererogation in me. But they are vnju≈øt and over-partiall, that will goe about to exact that from me, which I owe not, with more rigor than they will exact from them≈øelves that which they owe; wherein if they condemne me, they vtterly cancell, both the gratifying of the action, and the gratitude, which thereby would be due to me. Whereas the active well-doing ≈øhould be of more con≈øequence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from my hand, in regard I have no pa≈ø≈øive at all.

They ≈øuppo≈øe to ≈øhew them≈øelves very moderate and skilfull, when they yeeld their adver≈øaries any of tho≈øe articles now in que≈øtion. But be≈øides that, they perceive not what an advantage it is for him that chargeth you, if you but once begin to yeeld &amp; give them ground; and how much that encorageth him to pur≈øue his point: tho≈øe articles which they chu≈øe for the lighte≈øt, are oftentimes mo≈øt important. Either a man mu≈øt wholy ≈øubmit him≈øelfe to the authoritie of our Eccle≈øia≈øticall pollicie, or altogether di≈øpence him≈øelfe from it: It is not for vs to determine what part of obedience we owe vnto it. And moreover, I may ≈øay it, becau≈øe I have made triall of it, having ≈øometimes v≈øed this libertie of my choice, and particular election, not regarding certaine points of the ob≈øeruance of our Church, which ≈øeeme to beare a face, either more vaine, or more ≈øtrange; comming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them with wi≈øemen, I have found that tho≈øe things have a mo≈øt ≈øolide and ≈øteadie foundation, and that it is but fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe and ignorance, makes vs receiue them with le≈ø≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect and reverence then the re≈øt. Why remember we not, what, and how many contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we finde and feele even in our owne judgement? How many things ≈øerved vs but ye≈øterday as articles of faith, which to day we deeme but fables? Glory and curio≈øitie are the ≈øcourges of our ≈øoules.

                        <p>Touching this ≈øecond point I goe as farre as my Painter, but for the other and better part I am farre behinde: for my ≈øufficiency reacheth not ≈øo farre, as that I dare vndertake, a rich, a polli≈øhed, and according to true skill, and arte-like table. I have advi≈øed my ≈øelfe to borrow one of <hi>Steven de la Boitie,</hi> who with this kinde of worke ≈øhall honour all the world. It is a di≈øcour≈øe he entitled, <hi>Voluntary Servitude,</hi> but tho≈øe who have not knowen him, have ≈øince very properly rebaptized the ≈øame. <hi>The again≈øt one.</hi> In his fir≈øt youth he writ, by way of E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaie, in honour of libertie again≈øt Tyrants. It hath long ≈øince beene di≈øper≈øed among≈øt men of vnder≈øtanding, not without great and well de≈øerved commendations: for it is full of wit, and containeth as much learning as may be: yet doth it differ much from the be≈øt he can do. And if in the age I knew-him in, he would have vndergone my de≈ø≈øigne, to ≈øet his fanta≈øies downe in writing, we ≈øhould doubtle≈ø≈øe ≈øee many rare things, and which would very neerely approch the honour of antiquity: for e≈øpecially touching that part of natures gifts, I know none may be compared to him. But it was not long of him, that ever this Treatize, came to mans view, and I believe he never ≈øawe it ≈øince it fir≈øt e≈øcaped his hands: with certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notes concerning the edict of Ianuarie, famous by rea≈øon of our inte≈øtine warre, which haply may in other places finde their de≈øerved prai≈øe. It is all I could ever recover of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques (whom when death ≈øeized, he by his la≈øt will and te≈øtament, left with ≈øo kinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, heire and executor of his librarie and writings) be≈øides the little booke, I ≈øince cau≈øed to be publi≈øhed: To which his pamphlet I am particularly mo≈øt bounden, for ≈øo much as it was the in≈øtrumentall meane of our fir≈øt acquaintance. For it was ≈øhowed me long time before I ≈øawe him; and gave me the fir≈øt knowledge of his name, addre≈ø≈øing, and thus nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing that vn≈øpotted friend≈øhip, which we (≈øo long as it plea≈øed God) have ≈øo ≈øincerely, ≈øo entire and inviolably maintained betweene vs, that truely a man ≈øhall not commonly heare of the like; and among≈øt our moderne men no ≈øigne of any ≈øuch is ≈øeene. So many partes are required to the erecting of ≈øuch a one, that it may be counted a wonder, if fortunce once in three ages contract the like. There is nothing to which Nature hath more addre≈ø≈øed vs than to ≈øocietie. And <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>that perfect Law-givers have had more regardfull care of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip then of iu≈øtice.</hi> And the vtmo≈øt drift of it's perfection is this. For generally, all tho≈øe amities which are forged and nouri≈øhed by voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe or profit, publike or private neede, are thereby ≈øo much the le≈ø≈øe faire and generous, and ≈øo much the le≈ø≈øe true amities, in that they intermeddle other cau≈øes, ≈øcope, and fruit with friend≈øhip, then it ≈øelfe alone: Nor doe tho≈øe foure auncient kindes of friend≈øhips; <hi>Naturall, ≈øociall, ho≈øpitable,</hi> and <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerian,</hi> either particularly or conjointly be≈øeeme the ≈øame. That from children to parents may rather be termed re≈øpect: Friend≈øhip is nouri≈øhed by communication, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the over-great di≈øparitie cannot bee found in them, and would happly offend the duties of nature: for neither all the ≈øecret thoughts of parents can be communicated vnto children, le≈øt it might engender an vnbe≈øeeming familiaritie betweene them, nor the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and corrections (which are the chiefe≈øt offices of friend≈øhip) could be exerci≈øed from children to parents. There have nations beene found, where, by cu≈øtome, children killed their parents, and others, where parents ≈ølew their children, thereby to avoide the hindrance of enter-bearing one another in after times: for naturally one dependeth from the ruine of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There have Philo≈øophers beene found di≈ødaining this naturall conjunction, witne≈ø≈øe <hi>Ari≈øtippus,</hi> who being vrged with the affection he ought his children, as proceeding from his loynes, began to ≈øpit, ≈øaying, <hi>That al≈øo that excrement proceeded from him, and that al≈øo we engendred wormes and lice.</hi> And that other man, whom <hi>Plutarke</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded to agree with his brother, an≈øwered, <hi>I care not a ≈øtraw the more for him, though he came out of the ≈øame wombe I did.</hi> Verily the name of Brother is a glorious name, and ful of loving kindne≈ø≈øe, and therefore did he and I terme one another ≈øworne brother: but this commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, dividence, and ≈øharing of goods, this joyning wealth to wealth, and that the riches of one ≈øhall be the povertie of another, doth exceedingly di≈øtemper and di≈øtract all brotherly

The father and the ≈øonne may very well be of a farre differing complexion, and ≈øo many brothers: He is my ≈øonne, he is my kin≈øman; but he may be a foole, a bad, or a peevi≈øh-minded man.

On the other ≈øide, friend≈øhip is enjoyed according as it is de≈øired, it is neither bred, nor nouri≈øhed, nor encrea≈øeth but in jovi≈ø≈øance, as being ≈øpirituall, and the minde being refined by v≈øe and cu≈øtome. Vnder this chiefe amitie, the≈øe fading affections have ≈øometimes found place in me, le≈øt I ≈øhould ≈øpeake of him, who in his ver≈øes ≈øpeakes but too much of it. So are the≈øe two pa≈ø≈øions entred into me in knowledge one of another, but in compari≈øon never: the fir≈øt flying a high, and keeping a proud pitch, di≈ødainfully behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other to pa≈ø≈øe her points farre vnder it.

And truely, if without that, ≈øuch a genuine and voluntarie acquaintance might be contracted, where not onely mindes had this entire jovi≈ø≈øance, but al≈øo bodies, a ≈øhare of the aliance, and where a man might wholy be engaged: It is certaine, that friend≈øhip would

thereby be more compleate and full: But this ≈øex could never yet by any example attaine vnto it, and is by ancient ≈øchooles rejected thence. And this other Greeke licence is ju≈øtly abhorred by our cu≈øtomes, which notwith≈øtanding, becau≈øe according to v≈øe it had ≈øo nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarie a di≈øparitie of ages, and difference of offices betweene lovers, did no more ≈øufficiently an≈øwer the perfect vnion and agreement, which heere we require: <hi>Quis e≈øt enim iste amor</hi>

For, what love is this of friend≈øhip? why doth no man loue either a deformed yong man, or abeantifull old man?</hi> For even the picture the <hi>Academic</hi> makes of it, will not (as I ≈øuppo≈øe) di≈øavowe mee, to ≈øay thus in her behalfe: That the fir≈øt furie, en≈øpired by the ≈øon of <hi>Venus</hi> in the lovers hart, vpon the object of tender youths-flower, to which they allow all in≈øolent and pa≈ø≈øionate violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an immoderate heate may produce, was ≈øimply grounded vpon an externall beauty; a fal≈øe image of corpor all generation: for in the ≈øpirit it had no power, the ≈øight whereof was yet concealed, which was but in his infancie, and before the age of budding. For, if this furie did ≈øeize vpon a ba≈øe minded courage, the meanes of it's pur≈øute, where riches, gifts, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the advancement of dignities, and ≈øuch like vile marchandize, which they reproove. If it fell into a mo≈øt generous minde, the interpo≈øitions were likewi≈øe generous: Philo≈øophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in≈øtructions, documents to reverence religion, to obey the lawes, to die for the good of his countrie: examples of valor, wi≈øedome and ju≈øtice. The lover endevoring and ≈øtudying to make him≈øelfe acceptable by the good grace and beauty of his minde (that of his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long ≈øince decayed) hoping by this mentall ≈øocietie to e≈øtabli≈øh a more firme and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bargaine. When this pur≈øute attained the effect in due≈øea≈øon, (for by not requiring in a lover, he ≈øhould bring lea≈øure and di≈øcretion in his enterpri≈øe, they require it exactly in the beloved; for a≈ø much as he was to judge of an internall beauty, of a difficile knowledge, &amp; ab≈øtru≈øe di≈øcovery) then by the interpo≈øition of a ≈øpirituall beauty was the de≈øire of a ≈øpiritual conception engendred in the beloved. The latter was heere chiefe≈øt; the corporall, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and ≈øecond, altogether contrarie to the lover. And therefore do they preferre the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and verifie that the gods likewi≈øe preferre the ≈øame: and greatly blame the Poet <hi>Ae≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus,</hi> who in the love between <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus</hi> a≈øcribeth the lovers part vnto <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was in the fir≈øt and beardle≈ø≈øe youth of his adole≈øcency, and the faire≈øt of the Graecians.

When <hi>Lelius</hi> in the pre≈øence of the Romane Con≈øuls, who after the condemnation of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Gracchus,</hi> pur≈øued all tho≈øe that had beene of his acquaintance, came to enquire of <hi>Caius Blo≈øius</hi> (who was one of his chiefe≈øt friends) what he would have done for him, and that he an≈øwered: <hi>All things, What? All things?</hi> replied he: <hi>And what if he had willed thee to burne our Temples? Blo≈øius</hi> an≈øwered, <hi>He would never have commanded ≈øuch a thing. But what if he had done it?</hi> replied <hi>Lelius:</hi> The other an≈øwered, <hi>I would have obeyed him:</hi> If hee were ≈øo perfect a friend to <hi>Gracchus,</hi> as Hi≈øtories report, he needed not offend the Con≈øuls with this la≈øt and bolde confe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øhould not have departed from the a≈ø≈øurance hee had of <hi>Gracchus</hi> his minde. But yet tho≈øe, who accu≈øe this an≈øwer as ≈øeditious, vnder≈øtand not well this my≈øterie: and doe not pre≈øuppo≈øe in what termes he ≈øtood, and that he held <hi>Gracchus</hi> his will in his ≈øleeve, both by power and knowledge. They were rather friends than Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, rather friends than enemies of their countrey, or friends of ambition and trouble. Having ab≈øolutely committed them≈øelves one to another, they perfecty held the reines of one anothers inclination: and let this yoke be guided by vertue and conduct of rea≈øon (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe without them it is altogether impo≈ø≈øible to combine and proportion the ≈øame.) The an≈øwer of <hi>Blo≈øius</hi> was ≈øuch as it ≈øhould be. If their affections mi≈øcarried, according to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were neither friendes one to other, nor friends to them≈øelves. As for the re≈øt, this an≈øwer ≈øoundes no more than mine would doe, to him that would in ≈øuch ≈øort enquire of me; if your will ≈øhould commaund you to kill your daughter, would you doe it? and that I ≈øhould con≈øent vnto it: for, that beareth no witne≈ø≈øe of con≈øent to do it: becau≈øe I am not in doubt of my will, and as little of ≈øuch a friends will. It is not in the power of the worlds di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe to remove me from the certaintie I have of his intentions and judgements of mine: no one of it's actions might be pre≈øented vnto me, vnder what ≈øhape ≈øoever, but I would pre≈øently finde the ≈øpring and motion of it. Our mindes have jumped ≈øo vnitedly together, they have with ≈øo fervent an aflection con≈øidered of each other, and with like affection ≈øo di≈øcovered and ≈øounded, even to the very bottome of ech others heart and entrails, that I did not onely know his, as well as mine owne, but I would (verily) rather have tru≈øted him concerning any matter of mine, than my ≈øelfe. Let no man compare any of the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend≈øhips to this. I have as much knowledge of them as another, yea of the perfecte≈øt of their kinde: yet will I not per≈øwade any man to confound their rules, for ≈øo a man might be deceived. In the≈øe other ≈øtrict friend≈øhips a man mu≈øt march with the bridle of wi≈ødome and precaution in his hand: the bond is not ≈øo ≈øtrictly tied, but a man may in ≈øome ≈øort di≈øtru≈øt the ≈øame. <hi>Love him</hi> (≈øaide <hi>Chilon</hi>) <hi>as if you ≈øhould one day hate him againe. Hate him as if you ≈øhould love him againe.</hi> This precept, ≈øo abhominable in this ≈øoveraigne and mi≈øtris Amitie, is nece≈ø≈øarie and whole≈øome in the v≈øe of vulgar and cu≈øtomarie frend≈øhips: toward which a man mu≈øt employ the ≈øaying <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> was woont ≈øo often to repeat, <hi>Oh you my friends, there is no perfect friend.</hi>

                        <p>In this noble commerce, offices and benefits (nur≈øes of other amities) de≈øerve not ≈øo much as to bee accounted of: this confu≈øion ≈øo full of our willes is cau≈øe of it: for euen as the friend≈øhip I beare vnto my ≈øelfe, admits no accrea≈øe, by any ≈øuccour I give my ≈øelfe in any time of neede, what≈øoever the Stoickes alleadge; and as I acknowledge no thanks vnto my ≈øelfe for any ≈øervice I doe vnto my ≈øelfe, ≈øo the vnion of ≈øuch friends, being truely perfect, makes them loo≈øe the feeling of ≈øuch duties, and hate, and expell from one another the≈øe words of divi≈øion, and difference; benefit, good deed, dutie, obligation, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prayer, thanks, and ≈øuch their like.

them; wils, thoughts, judgements, goods, wives, children, honour, and life; and their mutuall agreement, being no other than one ≈øoule in two bodies, according to the fit defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> they can neither lend or give ought to each other. See here the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon why Law-makers, to honour marriage with ≈øome imaginary re≈øemblance of this divine bond, inhibite donations betweene husband and wife; meaning thereby to inferre, that all things ≈øhould peculiarly bee proper to each of them, and that they have nothing to divide and ≈øhare together. If in the friend≈øhip wherof I ≈øpeake, one might give vnto another, the receiver of the benefit ≈øhould binde his fellow. For, each ≈øeeking more than any other thing, to doe each other good, he who yeelds both matter and occa≈øion, is the man ≈øheweth him≈øelfe liberall, giving his friend that contentment, to effect towards him what he de≈øireth mo≈øt.

And <hi>Charixenus</hi> one of them, dying five daies after <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> the ≈øub≈øtitution being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of <hi>Aretheus,</hi> he carefully and very kindly kept and maintained his mother, and of five talents that he was worth, he gave two &amp; a halfe in mariage to one only daughter he had, and the other two &amp; a halfe to the daughter of <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> whom he maried both in one day. This example is very ample, if one thing were not, which is the multitude of friends: For, this perfect amity I ≈øpeake-of, is indivi≈øible; each man doth ≈øo wholy give him≈øelfe vnto his friend, that he hath nothing left him to divide el≈øe-where: moreover he is grieved that he is double, triple, or quadruple, and hath not many ≈øoules, or ≈øundry wils, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them all vpon this ≈øubject. Common friend≈øhips may bee divided; a man may love beautie in one, facilitie of behaviour in another, liberalitie in one, and wi≈øedome in another, paternity in this, fraternity in that man, &amp; ≈øo forth: but this amitie which po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth the ≈øoul, and ≈øwaies it in all ≈øoveraigntie, it is impo≈ø≈øible it ≈øhould be double.

The remainder of this hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeth very wel with what I ≈øaid; for, <hi>Eudamidas</hi> giveth as a grace &amp; fauor to his friends to employ them in his need: he leaveth them as his heires of his liberality, which con≈øi≈øteth in putting the meanes into their hands, to doe him good.

I remember to have read in Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> in a place where he condemneth marriages of kinsfolkes in forbidden degrees, this one rea≈øon among≈øt others: that the love a man beareth to ≈øuch a woman may be immoderate; for, if the wedlocke, or husband-like affection be ≈øound and perfect, as it ought to be, and al≈øo ≈øurcharged with that a man oweth to alliance and kindred, there is no doubt, but that ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe may ea≈øily tran≈øport a husband beyond the bounds of rea≈øon. Tho≈øe Sciences that direct the maners of men, as Divinitie and Philo≈øophie, medleth with all things. There is no action ≈øo private and ≈øecret may be concealed from their knowledge and juri≈ødiction. Well doe they learne that ≈øearch and cen≈øure their libertie. It is women communicate their partes as much as a man li≈øt to wantonize with them: but to phi≈øicke them ba≈øhfulne≈ø≈øe forbids them. I will then in their behalfe teach husbands this, if there be any too much fle≈øht vpon them: which is, that the verie plea≈øures they have by the familiaritie of their wives, except moderately v≈øed; they are reprooved: and not onely in that, but in any other vnlawfull ≈øubjects, a man may tre≈øpa≈ø≈øe in licentiou≈øne≈ø≈øe and offend in exce≈ø≈øe. Tho≈øe ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe endearings, which the fir≈øt heate ≈øugge≈øts vnto vs in that ≈øportfull delight, are not onely vndecently, but hurtfully employed towards our wives. Let them at lea≈øt learne impudencie from another hand. They are ever broad-waking when wee neede them. I have v≈øed no meanes but naturall and ≈øimple in≈øtruction. Marriage is a religious and devout bond: and that is the rea≈øon the plea≈øure a man hath of it, ≈øhould be a moderate, ≈øtaied, and ≈øerious plea≈øure, and mixed with ≈øeveritie, it ought to bee a voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe ≈øomewhat circum≈øpect and con≈øcientious. And becau≈øe it is the chiefe≈øt of generation, there are that make a que≈øtion, whether it be lawfull to require them of copulation, as well when we have no hope of children, as when they are over-aged, or bigge with childe. <hi>It is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,</hi> according to <hi>Plato.</hi> Certaine nations (and among≈øt others, the Mahometane) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre Conjunction with women great with childe. Many al≈øo with tho≈øe that have their monethly di≈øea≈øe. <hi>Zenobia</hi> received her husband but for one charge; which done, al the time of her conception, ≈øhe let him goe at randon, and that pa≈øt, ≈øhe gave him leave to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: a notable and generous example of marriage.</p>

                           <hi>Plato</hi> borroweth the narration (of ≈øome needy and hunger-≈øtarven Poet) of this ≈øport. That <hi>Iupiter</hi> one day gave his wife ≈øo hot a charge, impatient to ≈øtay till ≈øhe came to bed, hee laide her along vpon the floore, and by the vehemence of his plea≈øure forgot the vrgent and weighty re≈øolutions lately concluded vpon with the other gods of his caele≈øtiall court; boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting he found it as ≈øweet at that time, as he had done, when fir≈øt he ≈øpoiled her of her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by ≈øtealth and vnknowne to their parents. The Kings of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> called for their wives, when they went to any ≈øolemne fea≈øt, but when much drinking and wine began to heate them in good earne≈øt they ≈øent them to their chambers, ≈øeeing they could no longer refrain, but mu≈øt needs yeeld to ≈øen≈øual tie, le≈øt they ≈øhould be partakers of their immoderate lu≈øt; and in their ≈øteade ≈øent for other women, whom this duty of re≈øpect might not concerne. <hi>All plea≈øures and gratifications are not well placed in all ≈øortes of people.

This narration of <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> hath no reference vnto our new found countries. This ≈øervant I had, was a ≈øimple and rough-hewen fellow: a condition fit to yeeld a true te≈øtimonie. For, ≈øubtile people may indeed marke more curiou≈øly, and ob≈øerve things more exactly, but they amplifie and glo≈øe them: and the better to per≈øwade, and make their interpretations of more validity, they cannot chu≈øe but ≈øomewhat alter the ≈øtorie.

Wherein is required either a mo≈øt ≈øincere Reporter, or a man ≈øo ≈øimple, that he may have no invention to build vpon, and to give a true likelihood vnto fal≈øe devi≈øes, and be not wedded to his owne will. Such a one was my man; who be≈øides his owne report, hath many times ≈øhewed me divers Mariners, and Marchants, whom hee had knowne in that vovage. So am I plea≈øed with his information, that I never enquire what Co≈ømographers ≈øay of it. We had need of Topographers to make vs particular narrations of the places they have beene in. For ≈øome of them, if they have the advantage of vs, that they have ≈øeene <hi>Pale≈øtine,</hi> will challenge a priviledge, to tell vs newes of all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides. I would have every man write what he knowes, and no more: not onely in that, but in all other ≈øubjects.

From which vice proceed divers great inconveniences. Now (to returne to my purpo≈øe) I finde (as farre as I have beene informed) there is nothing in that nation, that is either barbarous or ≈øavage, vnle≈ø≈øe men call that barbari≈øme which is not common to them.

And a man mu≈øt thinke, that the diligent labours of our invention, are farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their merit. It is the part of hone≈øt minded men to pourtray vertue, as faire as po≈ø≈øible faire may be. A thing which would no whit be mi≈ø-≈øeeming or vndecent, if pa≈ø≈øion ≈øhould tran≈øport vs to the favour and pur≈øuite of ≈øo ≈øacred formes, what the≈øe doe contrarie, they either doe it through malice or knaverie, with purpo≈øe to reduce and ≈øute their beliefe to

their capacitie, where of I lately ≈øpake: or rather as I thinke, becau≈øe their ≈øight is not of ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power or clearnes, nor addre≈ø≈øed to conceive or apprehend the farre-≈øhining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vertue in naturall and genuine purity: As <hi>Plutarke</hi> ≈øaith, that in his time, ≈øome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the cau≈øe of <hi>Cato</hi> the yongers death to the feare he had conceived of <hi>Ce≈øar:</hi> whereat he hath ≈øome rea≈øon to be moved: by which a man may iudge, how much more he would have beene offended with tho≈øe that have a≈øcribed the ≈øame vnto ambition. Oh fooli≈øh people! Hee would no doubt have performed a faire action, ≈øo generous and ≈øo iu≈øt, rather with ignominie, then for glorie. This man was truely a patterne, whom nature cho≈øe to ≈øhew how farre humane vertue may reach, and mans con≈øtancie attaine-vnto. But my purpo≈øe is not here to treate this rich argument: I will onely confront together the ≈øayings of five Latin Poets vpon <hi>Catoes</hi> commendacions, and for the intere≈øt of <hi>Cato,</hi> and by inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie for theirs al≈øo. Now ought a gentleman well-bred, in re≈øpect of others, finde the two former ≈øomewhat langui≈øhing. The third more vigorous, but ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of force. He will iudge there were yet place for one or two degrees of invention, to reach vnto the fourth, in con≈øideration of which he will through admiration ioyne handes for the la≈øt (yet fir≈øt in ≈øome degree and ≈øpace, but which ≈øpace he will ≈øweare can by no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ≈øpirit be filled-vp) he wil be much amazed, he will be much amated. Loe here are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we haue more Poets than iudges and interpreters of poe≈øie. It is an ea≈øier matter to frame it; then to knowe-it: Being ba≈øe and humble, it may be iudged by the precepts and art of it: But the good &amp; loftie, the ≈øupreme &amp; divine, is beyond rules, and aboue rea≈øon. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer di≈øcerneth hir beauty, with a con≈øtant, quicke-≈øeeing, and ≈øetled looke, he can no more ≈øee and comprehend the ≈øame then the ≈øplendor of a lightning fla≈øh. It hath no community with our iudgement; but ran≈øacketh and ravi≈øheth the ≈øame. The furie which prickes and moves him that can penetrate hir, doth al≈øo ≈øtricke and wound a third man, if he heare-it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handled or recited, as the Adamant ≈øtone drawes, not only a needle, but infu≈øeth ≈øome of hir faculty in the ≈øame to drawe others: And it is more apparently ≈øeene in theaters, that the ≈øacred in≈øpiration of the Mu≈øes, having fir≈øt ≈øtirred vp the Poet with a kinde of agitation vnto choler, vnto griefe, vnto hatred, yea and beyond him ≈øelf, whether and how ≈øoever they plea≈øe, doth al≈øo by the Poet ≈øtrike &amp; enter into the Actor, and con≈øequently by the Actor, a whole auditorie or multitude. It is the ligament of our ≈øences depending one of another. Even from my infancie, Poe≈øie hath had the vertue to tran≈øpierce and tran≈øport me. But that lively and feeling-mouing that is naturally in me, hath diver≈øly beene handled, by the diver≈øitie of formes, not ≈øo much higher or lower (for they were ever the highe≈øt in every kind) as different in colour. Fir≈øt a blithe and ingenious fluidity, then a quaint-witie, and lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conceit. To conclude, a ripe and con≈øtant force. <hi>Ovid, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Virgill,</hi> will better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. But here our Gallants are in their full cariere.</p>

If things yeeld them≈øelves vnto our mercie, why ≈øhould we not have the fruition of them, or applie them to our advantage?

Therefore doth ea≈øe and indigencie depend from every mans owne opinion; and wealth and riches no more then glorie or health, have either more preheminence or plea≈øure, then he who po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth them, lendeth them. Every man is either well or ill, according as he findes him≈øelfe.

The knowledge we have of this mans vnmated-haughtie heart, by there≈øt of his life; may make vs judge with all ≈øecuritie, that it onely proceeded from a ≈øpirit, ≈øo far elevated above ≈øuch accidents, that he dained not ≈øo much as to trouble his mind with them, no more then with ordinarie chances. In the ≈øea-fight, which <hi>Augu≈øtus</hi> gained again≈øt <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> even at the in≈øtant he ≈øhould go to fight, was ≈øurpri≈øed with ≈øo heavie a ≈øleep, that his friends were compelled to awaken-him, to give the ≈øignall of the battell; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gave occa≈øion vnto <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> to charge him with this imputation, that he had not dared with open eyes to ≈øurvay the mar≈øhalling of his armie, and that his heart would not ≈øuffice him, to pre≈øent him≈øelfe vnto his ≈øouldiers, vntill ≈øuch time that <hi>Agrippa</hi> brought him newes of the victorie he had obtained of his enemies.

There was a great companie bandied together about a quarell which a Gentleman had with another, who in verie truth had ≈øome prerogative of titles, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and alliances aboue the common ≈øort of Nobilitie; vpon which word of his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, every one ≈øeeking to equall him≈øelfe vnto him, alledged, ≈øome one of ≈øpring, ≈øome another, ≈øome the re≈øemblance of his name, ≈øome of his armes, other≈øome an old far-fetcht pedigree, and the meane≈øt of them to be the great grand-child of ≈øome King beyond the Seas. When they came all to dinner, this man whom hitherto they had all followed, in liew of taking his wonted place, making low-lowting reverences, went to the lowe≈øt end of the board, entreating the companie to hold him excu≈øed, that through ra≈øh-vnadvi≈øedne≈ø≈øe he had hitherto lived with them companion-like, but now being lately enformed of their right qualities, he began to know them according to their ancient degrees, and that it did not duly belong vnto him to ≈øit above ≈øo many Princes.

                        <p>I Would willingly excu≈øe our people for having no other patterne or rule of perfection, but his owne cu≈øtomes, his owne fa≈øhions: For, it is a common vice, not onely in the vulgar ≈øorte, but as it were in all men, to bend their ayme, and frame their thoughts vnto the fa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein they were borne.

every moneth, nay every day, and judgeth ≈øo diver≈øly of him≈øelfe. When he wore ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa≈øted doublets, and but little lower then his brea≈øt, he would maintaine by militant rea≈øons, that the wa≈øte was in his right place: but when not long after he came to weare them ≈øo long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa≈øted, yea almo≈øt ≈øo low as his privities, then began he to condemne the former fa≈øhion, as fond, intollerable and deformed; and to commend the latter, as comely, hand≈øome, and commendable.

If it be a ≈øubiect I vnder≈øtand not my ≈øelfe, therein I make triall of it, ≈øounding afarre off the depth of the ford, and finding the ≈øame over deepe for my reach, I keepe my ≈øelfe on the ≈øhoare. And to acknowledge not to be able to wade through, is a part of it's effect, yea of ≈øuch whereof he vanteth mo≈øt. If I light vpon a vaine and idle ≈øubiect, I a≈ø≈øay to trie, and endevor to ≈øee, whether I may find a good ground to worke vpon, and matter to frame a body, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to builde and vnder-lay-it. Sometimes I addre≈ø≈øe my judgement and contrive-it to a noble and out-worne ≈øubject, wherein is nothing found ≈øub≈øi≈øting of it ≈øelfe, the high way to

There he plea≈øeth him≈øelf in chu≈øing the cour≈øe he thinkes be≈øt, and a thou≈øand paths ≈øometimes he ≈øaith, this or that was be≈øt cho≈øen. I take my fir≈øt Argument of fortune: All are alike vnto me: And I never purpo≈øe to handle them throughly: For, there is nothing wherein I can perceive the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Which they doe not that promi≈øe to ≈øhew it-vs. Of a hundred partes and vi≈øages that everie thing hath, I take one, which ≈øometimes I ≈ølightly runne-over, and other times but cur≈øorily glance-at. And yet other whil≈øt I pinch it to the quicke. And give it a <hi>Stockado,</hi> not the wide≈øt, but the deepe≈øt I can. And for the mo≈øt part I love to ≈øeize vpon them by ≈øome vnwonted lu≈øtre. I would adventure to treate and di≈øcour≈øe of ≈øome matter to the depth; knew I my ≈øelfe le≈ø≈øe, or where I deceived in mine owne impui≈ø≈øance; Scattering here one and there another worde: Scantlings taken from their maine ground-work, di≈øorderly di≈øper≈øed, without any well-grounded de≈øigne and promi≈øe. I am not bound to make it good, nor without varying to keepe my ≈øelfe clo≈øe tied vnto-it; when≈øoever it ≈øhall plea≈øe me to yeeld my ≈øelfe to doubt, to vncertaintie, and to my Mi≈øtris forme, which is ignorance. Ech motion ≈øheweth and di≈øcouereth what we are. The very ≈øame minde of <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> we ≈øee in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, mar≈øhalling, and ≈øetting the battel of <hi>Phar≈øalia,</hi> is likewi≈øe ≈øeene to order, di≈øpo≈øe, and contrive, idle, trifling and amorous devi≈øes.

Things ≈øeverall in them≈øelves have peradventure, weight, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and condition: But inwardly, in vs, ≈øhe cuttes-it out for them, as ≈øhe vnder≈øtandeth the ≈øame hir≈øelfe. Death is fearefull and vgly vnto <hi>Cicero;</hi> wi≈øhed-for and de≈øired of <hi>Cato:</hi> and indifferent vnto <hi>Socrates.</hi> Health, well-fare, con≈øcience, authoritie, riches, glory, beauty, and their contraries are di≈øpoyled at the entrance, and receive a new ve≈øture at the ≈øoules hand. Yea, and what coulour ≈øhe plea≈øeth; browne, bright greene, ≈øadde, or any hew el≈øe: ≈øharpe or ≈øweete, deepe or ≈øuperficiall, and what each of them plea≈øeth. For, none of them did ever veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their ≈øtiles, their rules, or formes in common; each on ≈øeverally is a Queene in hir owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate. Therefore let vs take no more excu≈øes from externall qualites of things. To vs it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to give our ≈øelves accoumpt of it. Our good, and our evill hath no dependancy, but from our ≈øelves. Let vs offer our vowes and offerings vnto it; and not to fortune. She hath no power over our maners. Why ≈øhall I not iudge of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as I am ≈øitting and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Table, and talking in good company? Or if hee were playing at Che≈ø≈øe, what ≈øtring of his witte doth not touch or harpe on this fond-childi≈øh, and time-con≈øuming play? I lothe and ≈øhunne-it, only becau≈øe there is not ≈øport inough in it, and that in his recreation, he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øerious with vs, being a≈øhamed I mu≈øt apply that attention thervnto, as might be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ≈øome good ≈øubiect. He was no more bu≈øied in levying his forces and preparing for his glorious pa≈ø≈øage into <hi>India;</hi> nor this other in di≈øintangling and di≈øcovering of a pa≈ø≈øage, whence dependeth the wel-fare and ≈øafety of mankind. See how much our mind troubleth this ridiculous ammuzing, if all hir ≈øinnewes bandy not. How amply ≈øhe giveth every one Law in that, to know and directly to iudge of him≈øelfe. I doe not more vniver≈øally view and feele my ≈øelfe in any other po≈øture. What pa≈ø≈øion doth not exerci≈øe vs thervnto? Choller, ≈øpight, hatred, impatience, and vehement ambition to overcome, in a matter wherein it were haply more excu≈øable to be ambitious for to be vanqui≈øhed. For, a rare pre-excellency, and beyond the common reach, in ≈øo frivolous a thing, is much mi≈ø-≈øeeming a man of honor. What I ≈øay of this example, may be ≈øpoken of all others. Every parcell, every occupation of a man, accu≈ø th, and ≈øheweth him equal vnto another. <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> were two Philo≈øophers, the fir≈øt of which, finding and deeming humane condition to be vaine and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, did never walke abroad, but with a laughing, ≈øcornefull and mocking countenance: Whereas <hi>Heraclitus</hi> taking pitie and compa≈ø≈øion of the very ≈øame condition of ours, was continuallie ≈øeene with a ≈øadde, mournefull, and heavy cheere, and with teares trickling downe his blubbered eyes.<note place="margin">Iuuen.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THere are certaine frivolus and vaine inventions, or as ≈øome call them, ≈øubtilties of wit, by meanes of which, ≈øome men doe often endevor to get credit and reputation: as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Poets, that frame whole volumes with ver≈øes beginning with one letter: we ≈øee Egges, Wings, Hatchets, Cro≈ø≈øes, Globes, Columnes, &amp; divers other ≈øuch-like figures anciently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhioned by the Graecians, with the mea≈øure and proportion of their ver≈øes, ≈øpreading, length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ≈øhortning them, in ≈øuch ≈øort as they ju≈øtly repre≈øent ≈øuch and ≈øuch a figure. Such was the ≈øcience and profe≈ø≈øion of him, who long time bu≈øied him≈øelfe, to number how many ≈øeverall waies the letters of the Alphabet might be ranged, and found-out that incredible number mentioned by <hi>Plutarke.</hi> I allow of his opinion, who having one brought before him, that was taught with ≈øuch indu≈øtrie, and ≈øo curiou≈øly to ca≈øt a graine of Millet with his hand, that without ever mi≈ø≈øing, he would every time make-it goe through a needles-eye; and being entreated to be≈øtow ≈øome thing vpon him, (as a reward for ≈øo rare a skill,) verie plea≈øantly and worthily, commaunded, that this cunning workman ≈øhould have two or thee peckes of Millet delivered him, to the end his rare arte and wittie labour might not remaine without da lie exerci≈øe. It is a wonderfull te≈øtimonie of our judgements imbecilitie, that it ≈øhould commend and allow of things, either for their rarene≈ø≈øe, or noveltie, or for their difficultie, though neither goodne≈ø≈øe or profit be joyned vnto them.

Of ≈øimple, le≈ø≈øe-curious, and lea≈øt-in≈øtructed ≈øpirits are made good chri≈øtians, who ≈øimplie beleeve through reverence and obedience, and are kept in awe of the lawes. In the meane vigor of ≈øpirits, and ≈ølender capacitie is engendred the error of opinions: They follow the apparance of the fir≈øt ≈øen≈øe; and have ≈øome title to interpret-it fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe and ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe, that we are confirmed in ancient waies, re≈øpecting vs, that are nothing therein in≈øtructed by ≈øtudie. The be≈øt, mo≈øt-≈øetled, and cleare≈øt-≈øeeing ≈øpirits, make another ≈øort of well-beleevers, who by long and religious inve≈øtigation, penetrate a more profound, and find-out a more ab≈øtru≈øe light in ≈øcriptures, and di≈øcover the mi≈øterious and divine ≈øecrets of our eccle≈øia≈øticall pollicie. And therefore ≈øee we ≈øome of them, that have reached vnto this la≈øt ranke, by the ≈øecond, with wonderfull fruit and confirmation; as vnto the furthe≈øt bounds of chri≈øtian intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: and injoy their victorie with comfort, than≈ø-giving, reformation of manners, and great mode≈øtie. In which ranke, my purpo≈øe is not to place the≈øe others, who to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from the ≈øu≈øpicion of their forepa≈ø≈øed errors, and the better to a≈ø≈øure vs of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extreame, indi≈øcreet, and vnju≈øt in the conduct of our cau≈øe, and taxe and taint the ≈øame with infinit reproches of violence. The ≈øimple pea≈øants are hone≈øt men; ≈øo are Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, (or as our time nameth them, ≈øtrong and cleare natures) enriched with a large in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of profitable ≈øciences.

Therefore do I (as much as lieth in me) with-draw my ≈øelfe into the fir≈øt and naturall ≈øeat, whence I never a≈ø≈øaied to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.

Meane and indifferent Poe≈øie, and that con≈øi≈øteth betweene both, is skorned, and contemned, and pa≈ø≈øeth without honour or e≈øteeme. But fora≈ømuch as ≈øince the pa≈ø≈øage hath been opened vnto the ≈øpirit, I have found (as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hapneth) that we had apprehended that which is neither ≈øo nor ≈øo for a difficult ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe, and of a rare ≈øubject; And that ≈øince our invention hath been ≈øet on fire, it di≈øcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an infinit number of like examples; I will onely adde this one: That if the≈øe E≈ø≈øayes were worthie to be judged-of, it might in mine opinion happen, that they would not greatly plea≈øe the common and vulgar ≈øpirits, and as little the ≈øingular and excellent. The fir≈øt will vnder≈øtand but little of them, the latter over-much; they might perhaps live and rub out in the middle region.</p>

In the verie heart of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> the Scithian women, after they had wa≈øhed them≈øelves, did ≈øprinkle, dawbe, and powder all their bodies and faces over, with a certaine odoriferous drug, that groweth in their Countrie: which du≈øt and dawbing being taken away, when they come neere men, or their husbands, they remaine verie cleane, and with a verie ≈øweet-≈øavouring perfume. What odor ≈øoever it be, it is ≈øtrange to ≈øee, what hold it will take on-me, and how apt my skin is to receive it. He that complaineth again≈øt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ≈øhe hath not created man with a fit in≈øtument, to carrie ≈øweet ≈ømels fa≈øt-tied to his no≈øe, is much to blame: for, they carrie them≈øelves. As for me in particular, my mo≈øtachoes, which are verie thicke, ≈øerve me for that purpo≈øe. Let me but approach my gloves or my hand-kercher to them, their ≈ømell will ≈øticke vpon them a whole day. They manife≈øt the place I come from. The clo≈øe-≈ømacking, ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe-moving, love-alluring, and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ømirking ki≈ø≈øes of youth, were heretofore wont to ≈øticke on them many houres after; yet am I little ≈øubject to tho≈øe popular di≈øea≈øes, that are taken by conver≈øation, and bred by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of the ayre: And I have e≈øcaped tho≈øe of my time, of which there hath been many and ≈øeverall kinds, both in the Townes about me, and in our Armie. We read of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that during the time of many plagues and relap≈øes of the pe≈øtilence, which ≈øo often infe≈øted the Citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> he never for≈øooke or went out of the Towne: yet was he the onely man, that was never infected, or that felt any ≈øickne≈ø≈øe. Phi≈øitians might (in mine opinion) draw more v≈øe and good from odours, then they doe. For, my ≈øelfe have often perceived, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto their ≈øtrength and qualitie, they change and alter, and move my ≈øpirits, and worke ≈øtrange effects in me: which makes me approve the common ≈øaying, that the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of incen≈øe and perfumes in Churches, ≈øo ancient and ≈øo far-di≈øper≈øed throughout all nations and religions, had an e≈øpeciall regard to rejoyce, to comfort, to quicken, to rowze, and to purifie our ≈øen≈øes, that ≈øo we might be the apter and readier vnto contemplation. And the better to judge of it, I would I had my part of the skill, which ≈øome Cookes have, who can ≈øo curiou≈øly ≈øea≈øon and temper ≈øtrange odors with the ≈øavour and relli≈øh of their meats. As it was e≈øpecially ob≈øerved in the ≈øervice of the King of <hi>Tunes,</hi> who in our dayes landed at <hi>Naples,</hi> to meete and enter-parly with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. His viands were ≈øo exqui≈øitely farced, and ≈øo ≈øumptuou≈øly ≈øea≈øoned with ≈øweet odoriferous drugs, and aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ≈øpices, that it was found vpon his booke of accompt, the dre≈ø≈øing of one peacocke, and two fe≈øants amounted to one hundred duckets; which was their ordinarie maner of cooking his meates.

I was even now con≈øidering, whence this generall errour commeth, that in all our de≈ø≈øeignes and enterpri≈øes, of what nature ≈øoever, we immediatly have recour≈øe vnto God, and in every nece≈ø≈øitie, we call vpon his holie name: And at what time ≈øoever we ≈øtand in need of any help, and that our weakne≈ø≈øe wanteth a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, we onely invoke him, without con≈øidering whether the occa≈øion be ju≈øt or vnju≈øt; and what e≈øtate or action we be in, or go about, be it never ≈øo vicious or vnlawfull, we call vpon his name and power. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he is our onely protector, and of power to affoord-vs all maner of help and comfort; but although he vouch≈øafe to honour vs with this joy-bringing fatherly adoption, yet is he as ju≈øt as he is good; and as good and ju≈øt, as he is mightie: But oftner v≈øeth his ju≈øtice than his might, and favoureth vs according to the rea≈øon of the ≈øame, and not according to our reque≈øts. <hi>Plato</hi> in his lawes maketh three ≈øorts of injurious beliefe in the Gods: Fir≈øt, that there is none at all; Secondly, that they meddle not with our affaires; Thirdly, that they never refu≈øe any thing vnto our vowes, offrings, and ≈øacrifices. The fir≈øt errour, according to his opinion, did never continue immutable in man, even from his fir≈øt infancie vnto his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age.

With what language entertaine they divine ju≈øtice concerning this ≈øubject?

The word or voice is too divine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other v≈øe but to exerci≈øe our lungs, and to plea≈øe our eares. It is from the con≈øcience and not from the tongue that it mu≈øt proceed.

Nor is it ≈øeemely, or toollerable, to ≈øee the ≈øacred booke of our beliefes-My≈øteries, to≈ø≈øed vp and downe and plaid withall, in a ≈øhop, or a hall, or a kitchin. They have heretofore been accompted my≈øteries, but through the abu≈øe of times, they are now held as ≈øports and recreations. So ≈øerious, and venerable a ≈øtudie ≈øhould not, by way of pa≈øtime, and tumultuarie be handled. It ought to be a fixed, a purpo≈øed, and ≈øetled action, to which this preface of our office <hi>≈øur≈øum corda</hi> ≈øhould ever be adioyned; and the verie exterior parts of the bodie, ≈øhould with ≈øuch a countenance, be referred vnto it, that to all mens eyes it may witne≈ø≈øe a particular attention and duteous re≈øpect. It is not a a ≈øtudie fitting all men, but onely ≈øuch as have vowed them≈øelves vnto-it, and whom God hath, of his infinit mercie, called thereto. The wicked, the vngodly, and the ignorant are thereby empaired. It is no hi≈øtorie to be fabulou≈øly reported, but a hi≈øtorie to be dutifully reverenced, awfully feared, and religiou≈øly adored. Are they not plea≈øantly conceited, who becau≈øe they have reduced the ≈øame into the vulgar tongues, and that all men may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand-it, per≈øwade them≈øelves, that the people ≈øhall the better conceive and dige≈øt the ≈øame? Con≈øi≈øteth-it but in the words, that they vnder≈øtand not all they find written? Shall I ≈øay more? By approaching thus little vnto it, they goe backe from it. Meere ignorance, and wholy relying on others, was verily more profitable and wi≈øer, then is this verball, and vaine knowledge, the nur≈øe of pre≈øumption, and ≈øour≈øe of temeritie. Moreover, I am of opinion, that the vncontrouled libertie, that all men have to wre≈øt, di≈ø≈øipate, and wyre-draw a word ≈øo religious, and important, to ≈øo many ≈øeverall idiomes, hath much more danger then profit following-it. The Iewes, the Mahometans, and well-nigh all other nations, are wedded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and reverence the language, wherein their my≈øteries and religion had originally been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and any change or tran≈ølation hath not without apparance of rea≈øon been directly forbidden. Know we whether there be Iudges enow in <hi>Ba≈øque</hi> and in <hi>Brittanie</hi> to e≈øtabli≈øh this tran≈ølation made in their tongue? The vniver≈øall Church hath no more difficult and ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne judgement to make.

                           <hi>Margaret</hi> Queene of <hi>Navarre,</hi> maketh mention of a yong Prince (whom although ≈øhe name not expre≈øly, yet his greatne≈ø≈øe hath made him ≈øufficiently knowne) who going about an amorous a≈ø≈øignation, and to lie with an Advocates wife of <hi>Paris,</hi> his way lying along≈øt a Church, he did never pa≈ø≈øe by ≈øo holie a place, whether it were in going or comming from his lecherie, and cukolding-labour, but would make his praiers vnto God, to be his help and furtherance. I would faine have any impartiall man tell me, to what purpo≈øe this Prince invoked and called on God for his divine favour, having his mind onely bent to ≈øinne, and his thoughts ≈øet on luxurie: Yet doth ≈øhe alleage him for a ≈øpeciall te≈øtimonie of ≈øingular devotion. But it is not onely by this example, a man might verifie, that women are not verie fit to manage or treat matters of Religion and Divinitie. A true and hartie praier, and an vnfained religious reconciliation from vs vnto God, cannot likely fall into a wicked and impure ≈øoule, e≈øpecially when Sathan ≈øwaieth the ≈øame. He that calleth vpon God for his a≈øsi≈øtance, whil≈øt he is engulphed and wallowing in filthie ≈øinne, doth as the cut-pur≈øe, that ≈øhould call for ju≈øtice vnto his ayde, or tho≈øe that produce God in witne≈ø≈øe of a lie.</p>

                        <p>The Gods did grievou≈øly puni≈øh the impious vowes of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> by granting them vnto him. His praier was, that his children might betweene them≈øelves decide in armes the ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of his e≈øtate; he was ≈øo mi≈øerable, as to be taken at his word.

For, our ≈øoule, being full-fraught with concupi≈øcence, and all manner of vngodly thoughts, nothing touched with repentance, nor moved with new reconciliation towards God, we headlong pre≈øent vnto him tho≈øe heedle≈ø≈øe words, which memorie affoordeth our tongue, by which we hope to obtaine an expiation and remi≈ø≈øion of our offences.

                           <p>Of Age.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Cannot receive that manner, whereby we e≈øtabli≈øh the continuance of our life. I ≈øee that ≈øome of the wi≈øer ≈øort doe greatly ≈øhorten the ≈øame, in re≈øpect of the common opinion. What ≈øaid <hi>Cato Iunior,</hi> to tho≈øe who ≈øought to hinder him from killing him-≈øelfe? <hi>Doe I now live the age, wherein I may iu≈øtly be reproved to leave my life too ≈øoone?</hi> Yet was he but eight and fortie yeares old. He thought that age verie ripe, yea, and well advanced, con≈øidering how few men come vnto-it. And ≈øuch as entertaine them≈øelves with, I wot not what kind of cour≈øe, which they call naturall, promi≈øeth ≈øome few yeares beyond, might do-it, had they a priviledge that could exempt them from ≈øo great a number of accidents, vnto which each one of vs ≈øtands ≈øubject by a naturall ≈øubjection, and which may interrupt the ≈øaid cour≈øe, they propo≈øe vnto them≈øelves. What fondne≈ø≈øe is-it, for a man to thinke he ≈øhall die, for, and through, a failing and defect of ≈øtrength, which extreame age draweth with-it, and to propo≈øe that terme vnto our life, ≈øeeing it is the rare≈øt kind of all deaths, and lea≈øt in v≈øe? We onely call it naturall, as if it were again≈øt nature to ≈øee a man breake his necke with a fall; to be drowned by ≈øhipwracke; to be ≈øurpri≈øed with a pe≈øtilence, or pleuri≈øie, and as if our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12117:95"/>
condition did not pre≈øent the≈øe inconveniences vnto vs all. Let vs not flatter our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øelves with the≈øe fond-goodly woords; a man may peradventure rather call that naturall, which is generall, common and vniver≈øall. To die of age, is a rare, ≈øingular, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie death, and ≈øo much le≈ø≈øe naturall then others: It is the la≈øt and extreame≈øt kind of dying: The further it is from vs, ≈øo much the le≈ø≈øe is it to be hoped for: Indeed it is the limit, beyond which we ≈øhall not pa≈ø≈øe, and which the law of nature hath pre≈øcribed vnto vs, as that which ≈øhould not be outgon by any; but it is a rare priviledge peculiar vnto hir ≈øelfe, to make vs continue vnto-it. It is an exemption, which through ≈øome particular favour ≈øhe be≈øtoweth on ≈øome one man, in the ≈øpace of two or three ages, di≈øcharging him from the cro≈ø≈øes, troubles, and difficulties, ≈øhe hath enterpo≈øed betweene both, in this long cariere and pilgrimage. Therefore my opinion is, to con≈øider, that the age vnto which we are come, is an age whereto few arive: ≈øince men come not vnto it by any ordinarie cour≈øe, it is a ≈øigne we are verie forward. And ≈øince we have pa≈øt the accu≈øtomed bounds, which is the true mea≈øure of our life, we mu≈øt not hope, that we ≈øhall goe much further. Having e≈øcaped ≈øo many occa≈øions of death, wherein we ≈øee the world to fall, we mu≈øt acknowledge that ≈øuch an extraordinarie fortune, as that is, which maintaineth vs, and is beyond the common v≈øe, is not likely to continue long. It is a fault of the verie lawes, to have this fal≈øe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They allow not a man to be capable and of di≈øcretion, to manage and di≈øpo≈øe of his owne goods, vntill he be five and twentie yeares old, yet ≈øhall he hardly pre≈øerve the ≈øtate of his life ≈øo long. <hi>Augustus</hi> abridged five yeares of the ancient Romane Lawes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that for any man that ≈øhould take vpon him the charge of judgement, it ≈øufficed to be thirtie yeares old. <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> di≈øpen≈øed with the Knights, who were ≈øeaven and fortie yeares of age, from all voluntarie ≈øervices of warre. <hi>Augustus</hi> brought them to fortie and five. To ≈øend men to their place of ≈øojourning before they be five and fiftie or three ≈øcore yeares of age, me ≈øeemeth, carrieth no great apparance with-it. My advice would be, that our vacation, and employment ≈øhould be extended as far as might be for the publike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie; but I blame ≈øome, and condemne mo≈øt, that we begin not ≈øoone enough to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ≈øelves. The ≈øame <hi>Augustus</hi> had been vniver≈øall and ≈øupreame judge of the world, when he was but nineteene yeares old, and would have another to be thirtie, before he ≈øhall bee made a competent judge of a cottage or farme. As for my part, I thinke our minds are as full growne and perfectly joynted at twentie yeares, as they ≈øhould be, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe as much as they can. A mind which at that age hath not given ≈øome evident token or earne≈øt of hir ≈øufficiencie, ≈øhall hardly give-it afterward; put hir to what triall you li≈øt. Naturall qualities and vertues, if they have any vigorous or beauteous thing in them, will produce and ≈øhow the ≈øame within that time, or never. They ≈øay in Daulphin√©,</p>

As for my particular, I am verily per≈øwaded, that ≈øince that age, both my ≈øpirit and my bodie, have more decrea≈øed then encrea≈øed, more recoyled then advanced. It may be, that knowledge and experience ≈øhall encrea≈øe in them, together with life, that be≈øtow their time well: but vivacitie, promptitude, con≈øtancie, and other parts much more our owne, more important and more e≈ø≈øentiall, they droope, they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh, and they faint.</p>

And it is written, that the <hi>Per≈øians,</hi> after they had well tippled, were wont to con≈øult of their chiefe≈øt affaires. My ta≈øte, my relli≈øh and my complexion, are ≈øharper enemies vnto this vice, then my di≈øcour≈øe: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides that I captivate more ea≈øily my conceits vnder the auctoritie of ancient opinions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I finde-it to be a fond, a ≈øtupide and a ba≈øe kinde of vice, but le≈ø≈øe malicious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then others; all which ≈øhocke, and with a ≈øharper edge wound publike ≈øocietie. And if we cannot give our ≈øelves any plea≈øure, except (as they ≈øay) it co≈øt-vs ≈øomething; I finde this vice to be le≈ø≈øe chargeable vnto our con≈øcience then others; be≈øides, it is not hard to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, difficult to be found; a con≈øideration not to be de≈øpi≈øed. A man well advanced in yeares and dignitie, among≈øt three principall commodities he told me to have remaining in life, counted this: and where ≈øhall a man more rightly finde-it, then among≈øt the naturall? But he tooke-it ill, delicatene≈ø≈øe, and the choi≈øe of wines is therein to be avoided. If you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your voluptuou≈ønes to drinke it with plea≈øure and daintily neate, you tie your ≈øelfe vnto an inconvenience to drinke-it other then is allwayes to be had. A man mu≈øt have a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a loo≈øe and a freer ta≈øte. To be a true drinker, a man ≈øhould not have ≈øo tender and ≈øqueami≈øh a palat. The Germans doe in a maner drinke aqually of all ≈øorts of wine with like plea≈øure. Their end is rather to gulpe it downe freely, then to ta≈øte it kindely. And to ≈øay truth they have it better cheape. Their voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe is more plenteous and fuller. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, to drinke after the French maner, as two draughts and moderatly, is over-much to re≈øtraine the favours of that God. There is more time and con≈øtancie required therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Our forefathers were wont to ≈øpend whole nights in that exerci≈øe, yea often times they joyned whole long dayes vnto them. And a man mu≈øt proportion his ordinarie more large and firme. I have in my dayes ≈øeene a principall Lord; a man of great employment and enterpri≈øes, and famous for good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, who without ≈øtraining him≈øelfe, and eating but an ordinary meales-meat, was wont to drinke litle le≈ø≈øe then five pottles of wine, yet at his ri≈øing ≈øeemed to be nothing di≈øtempered, but rather as we have found to our no ≈ømall co≈øt in managing of our affaires, over-wi≈øe and con≈øiderate. The plea≈øure of that, whereof we would make account in the cour≈øe of our life ought to be employed longer ≈øpace. It were nece≈ø≈øary, as ≈øhop-boyes or labouring people, that we ≈øhould refu≈øe no occa≈øion to drinke<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to have this de≈øire in our minde. It ≈øeemeth that wee dayly ≈øhorten the v≈øe of this: and that in our hou≈øes, (as I have ≈øeene in mine infancie) breakefa≈øts, nunchions, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ≈øhould be more frequent and often v≈øed, then now adayes they are. And ≈øhould wee thereby in any ≈øorte proceede towards amendment? Noverily. But it may be, that we have

much more given our ≈øelves over vnto paillardi≈øe and all maner of luxurie then our fathers were. They are two occupations, that enter-hinder one another, in their vigor. On the one ≈øide, it hath empaired and weakned our ≈øtomake, and on the other, ≈øobrietie ≈øerveth to make vs more jolly-quaint, lu≈øty, and wanton for the exerci≈øe of love matters. It is a wonder to thinke on the ≈øtrange tales I have heard my father report, of the cha≈øtitie of his times. He might well ≈øpeake of it, as he that was both by art and nature proper for the v≈øe and ≈øolace of Ladies. He ≈øpake little and well, few words, but to the purpo≈øe, and was ever wont to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe ≈øome ornament taken from vulgar bookes, and above all, Spani≈øh, among≈øt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ≈øpeeches: And of all Spani≈øh authors, none was more familiar vnto him then <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Aurelius.</hi> His demeanour and carriage was ever milde, meeke, gentle, and very mode≈øt, and above all, grave and ≈øtately. There is nothing he ≈øeemed to be more carefull<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of, then of his hone≈øty, and ob≈øerve a kinde of decencie of his per≈øon, and orderly decorum in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, were it on foote or on ho≈øebacke. He was exceeding nice in performing his word or promi≈øe; And ≈øo ≈øtrictly con≈øcientious and ob≈øequous in religion, that generally he ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather to encline toward ≈øuper≈øtition, then the contrary. Though he were but a little man, his courage and vigor was great: he was of an vpright, and well proportioned ≈øtature, of a plea≈øing, cheerefull-looking countenance, of a ≈øwarthy hue, nimbly addicted, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitely nimble vnto all noble and gentleman<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> like exerci≈øes. I have ≈øeene ≈øome hollow ≈øtaves of his filled with lead, which hee wont to v≈øe and exerci≈øe his armes withall, the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him-≈øelfe to pitch to barre, to throw the ≈øledge, the ca≈øt the pole and to play at fence: and ≈øhooes with leaden ≈øoles, which he wore to enure him≈øelfe, to leape, to vault and to run. I may without blu≈øhing ≈øay, that in memory of him≈øelfe, he hath left certain pety miracles among≈øt vs. I have ≈øeene him when hee was pa≈øt three-≈øcore yeeres of age mocke at all our ≈øports, and out-countenance our youthfull pa≈øtimes, with a heavy furr'd Gowne about him to leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ≈øaddle; to make the pommada round about a Table vpon his thumb; and ≈øeldom to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend any ≈øtaires without skipping three or foure ≈øteppes at once. And concerning my di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, hee was wont to ≈øay, that in a whole Province there was ≈øcar≈øe any woman of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that had an ill name. Hee would often report ≈øtrange familiarities, namely of his owne, with very hone≈øt women, without any ≈øu≈øpicion at all. And prote≈øted verie religiou≈ølie, that when he was married, he was yet a pure Virgine; yet had he long time followed the warres beyond the Mountaines, and therein ≈øerved long, whereof hee hath left a Iournall-Booke of his owne collecting, wherein hee hath particularly noted, what≈øoever happened day by day worthy the ob≈øervation, ≈øo long as he ≈øerved, both for the publike and his particular v≈øe. And he was well ≈øtrucken in yeeres, when he tooke a wife. For returning out of <hi>Italie,</hi> in the yeere of our Lord, one thou≈øand five hundred eight and twenty, and being ful three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres olde, by the way hee cho≈øe him≈øelfe a wife. But come we to our drinking againe. The incommodities of age, which neede ≈øome helpe and refre≈øhing, might with ≈øome rea≈øon beget in me a de≈øire or longing of this faculty: for, it is in a man the la≈øt plea≈øure, which the cour≈øe of our yeers ≈øtealeth vpon vs. Good fellowes ≈øay, that naturall heate is fir≈øt taken in our feete: That properly belongeth to infancie. From thence it a≈øcendeth vnto the middle region, where it is ≈øetled and continueth a long time: and in mine opinion, there produceth the onely true, and mooving plea≈øures of this corporall life. Other delight and ≈øen≈øualities in re≈øpect of that, doe but ≈øleepe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in the end, like vnto a vapour, which by little and little exhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and mounteth aloft, it comes vnto the throate, and there makes hir la≈øt bode. Yet could I never conceive, how any man may either encrea≈øe or prolong the plea≈øure of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond thir≈øt, and in his imagination frame an artificiall appetite, and again≈øt nature. My ≈øtomacke could not well reach ≈øo farre: it is very much troubled to come to an end of that which it takes for his neede. My con≈øtitution is, to make an accompt of drinking, but to ≈øucceed meate, and therefore doe I ever make my la≈øt draught the greate≈øt. And fora≈ømuch as in age, we have the roofe of our mouthes commonly furred with rhume, or di≈øtempered, di≈øta≈øted and altered through ≈øome other evill con≈øtitution, wine ≈øeemeth better vnto vs and of a quicker reli≈øh, according as our pores be either more or le≈ø≈øe open and wa≈øhed. At lea≈øt I ≈øeldome reli≈øh the ≈øame very well, except it be the fir≈øt draught I take. <hi>Anachar≈øis</hi> wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ≈øee the Graecians drinke in greater gla≈ø≈øes at the end of their meales, then in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It was (as I imagine) for the very ≈øame rea≈øon, that the Germans doe-it, who never begin to carou≈øe, but when they have well fed. <hi>Plato</hi> forbiddeth children to drinke any

wine, before they be eighteene yeeres of age, and to be druncke before they come to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But to ≈øuch as have once attained the age of fortie<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> he is content to pardon them, if they chaunce to delight them≈øelves with it, and alloweth them ≈øomwhat largely to blend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of <hi>Dioni≈øius</hi> in their banquets, that good God, who be≈øtoweth cheerefulne≈ø≈øe vpon men, and youth vnto aged men, who layeth and a≈øwageth the pa≈ø≈øions of the minde, even as yron is made flexible by the fire: and in his profitable lawes drinking-meetings or quaffing companies as nece≈ø≈øary and commendable (alwaies provided there be a chiefe leader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them to containe and order them) drunkene≈ø≈øe being a good and certaine tryall of everie mans nature; and therewithall proper to give aged men the courage to make merry in dancing and in mu≈øicke; things alowable and profitable, and ≈øuch as they dare not vndertake being ≈øober and ≈øetled. That wine is capable to ≈øupply the mind with temperance, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with health. Notwith≈øtanding, the≈øe re≈øtrictions, partely barrowed of the Carthaginians, plea≈øe him well. Let tho≈øe forebeare it that are going about any expedition of warre.

It is reported, that <hi>Stilpo</hi> the Philo≈øopher, finding him≈øelfe ≈øurcharged with age, did purpo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ha≈øten his end, by drinking of pure wine.

We have for our part, together with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our neighbour-Nation, the orders of Knight-hood, which only were e≈øtabli≈øhed to this purpo≈øe.

This is worthy to be con≈øidered, that our nation giveth the chiefe preheminence of all vertue vnto valiancy, as the Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the word ≈øheweth, which commeth of valour, or worth: and that according to our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued cu≈øtome, when after the phra≈øe of our court and nobility we ≈øpeake of a worthy man, or of an hone≈øt man, we thereby inferre no other thing than a valiant man; after the v≈øuall Roman fa≈øhion.

But becau≈øe, by rea≈øon of his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he could not take notice of the exceeding kindne≈ø≈øe and many-fold offices he hath received from you, my meaning is, that if ever the≈øe my compo≈øitions ≈øhall happly one day come into his hands (when peradventure I ≈øhall neither have mouth nor ≈øpeach to declare it vnto him) he receive this te≈øtimonie in all veritie from me; which ≈øhall al≈øo more lively be te≈øtified vnto him by the good effects, (whereof, if ≈øo it plea≈øe God, he ≈øhall have a ≈øen≈øible feeling) that there is no Gentleman in <hi>France,</hi> more endebted to his mother, then he; and that hereafter he cannot yeeld a more certaine proofe of his goodne≈ø≈øe, and te≈øtimonie of his vertue, then in acknowledging and confe≈ø≈øing you for ≈øuch. If there be any truely-naturall law, that is to ≈øay, any in≈øtinct, vniver≈øally and perpetually imprinted, both in bea≈øts and vs, (which is not without controver≈øie) I may, according to mine opinion, ≈øay, that next to the care, which each living creature hath to his pre≈øervation, and to flie what doth hurt him; the affection which the engenderer beareth his off-≈øpring, holds the ≈øecond place in this ranke. And fora≈ømuch as nature ≈øeemeth to have recommended the ≈øame vnto-vs, ayming to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, encrea≈øe, and advance, the ≈øucce≈ø≈øive parts or parcels of this hir frame. It is no woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if back<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>againe it is not ≈øo great from children vnto fathers. This other Ari≈øtotelian con≈øideration remembred: That <hi>hee who doth benefit another, loveth him better than hee is beloved of him againe:</hi> And hee to whom a debt is owing, loveth better, than hee that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And every workeman loveth his worke better, than hee ≈øhould bee beloved of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if it had ≈øen≈øe or feeling. Fora≈ømuch as we love to be; and being con≈øi≈øteth in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and action. Therefore is every man, in ≈øome ≈øort or other in his owne workman≈øhip. <hi>Who≈øoever doth a good deed, exerci≈øeth a faire and hone≈øt action: Who≈øoever receiveth, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth onely a profitable action.</hi> And profite is nothing ≈øo much to be e≈øteemed or loved as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtie. Hone≈øtie is firme and permanent, affording him that did it, a con≈øtant gratification. Profite is verie ≈ølipperie, and ea≈øilie lo≈øt, nor is the memorie of it ≈øo ≈øweet, or ≈øo fre≈øh. Such things are deare≈øt vnto vs, that have co≈øt vs mo≈øt: And to give, is of more co≈øt then to take. Since it hath plea≈øed God to endow-vs with ≈øome capacitie of di≈øcour≈øe, that as bea≈øts we ≈øhould not ≈øervily be ≈øubjected to common lawes, but rather with judgement and voluntarie libertie applie our ≈øelves vnto them; we ought ≈øomewhat to yeeld vnto the ≈øimple auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Nature: but not ≈øuffer hir tyrannically to carrie-vs away: only rea≈øon ought to have the conduct of our inclinations. As for me, my ta≈øte is ≈øtrangely di≈øta≈øted to it's propen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in vs are produced without the ordinance and direction of our judgement. As vpon this ≈øubject I ≈øpeak-of, I cannot receive this pa≈ø≈øion, wherewith ≈øome embrace chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ≈øcar≈øly borne, having neither motion in the ≈øoule, nor forme well to be di≈øtingui≈øhed in the bodie, whereby they might make them≈øelves lovely or amiable. And I could never well endure to have them brought vp or nur≈øed neere about me. A true and wel ordred affection,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12117:113"/>
ought to be borne and augmented, with the knowledge they give vs of them≈øelves; and then, if they de≈øerve-it (naturall inclination marching hand in hand with rea≈øon) to cheri≈øh and make much of them, with a perfect fatherly love and loving friend≈øhip, and conformably to judge of them if they be otherwi≈øe, alwaies yeelding our ≈øelves vnto rea≈øon, notwith≈øtanding naturll power. For the mo≈øt part; it goeth cleane contrary, and commonly feele our ≈øelves more mooved with the ≈øports, idlene≈ø≈øe, wantonne≈ø≈øe, and infant-trifles of our children, than afterward we doe with all their actions, when they bee men: As if we had loved them for our pa≈øtimes, as we doe apes, monkies, or perokitoes, and not as men. And ≈øome that liberally furni≈øh them with ≈øporting bables while they be children, will mi≈øerably pinch it in the lea≈øt expence for nece≈ø≈øaries when they grow men. Nay, it ≈øeemeth that the jelou≈øie we have to ≈øee them appeare into, and injoy the world, when we are ready to leave them, makes vs more ≈øparing and clo≈øe-handed toward them. It vexeth and grieveth vs when we ≈øee them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs at our heeles, ≈øuppo≈øing they ≈øolicite vs to be gone hence: And if we were to feare that ≈øince the order of things beareth, that they cannot indeede, neither be, nor live, but by our being and life, we ≈øhould not meddle to be fathers. As for mee, I deeme it a kind of cruelty and inju≈øtice, not to receive them into the ≈øhare and ≈øociety of our goods, and to admit them as Partners in the vnder≈øtanding of our dome≈øticall affaires (if they be once capable of it) and not to cut off and ≈øhut- vp our commodities to provide for theirs, ≈øince we have engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them to that purpo≈øe. It is meere inju≈øtice to ≈øee an old, crazed, ≈øinnow-≈øhronken, and nigh dead father ≈øitting alone in a Chimny-corner, to enjoy ≈øo many goods as would ≈øuffice for the preferment and entertainment of many children, and in the meane while, for want of meanes, to ≈øuffer them to loo≈øe their be≈øt daies and yeares, without thru≈øting them into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ≈øervice and knowledge of men; whereby they are often ca≈øt into di≈øpaire, to ≈øeeke, by ≈øome way how vnlawfull ≈øoever to provide for their nece≈ø≈øaries. And in my daies, I have ≈øeene divers yong-men, of good, hou≈øes ≈øo given to ≈øtealing and filching, that no correction could divert them from it. I know one very well alied, to whom, at the in≈øtance of a brother of his (a mo≈øt hone≈øt, gallant, and vertuous Gentleman) I ≈øpake to that purpo≈øe, who bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an≈øwered and confe≈ø≈øed vnto me, that onely by the rigor and coveti≈øe of his father he had beene forced and driuen to fall into ≈øuch lewdne≈ø≈øe and wickedne≈ø≈øe. And even at that time he came from ≈øtealing certaine jewels from a Lady, in who≈øe bed-chamber he fortuned to come with certaine other Gentlemen when ≈øhe was ri≈øing, and had almo≈øt beene taken. He made me remember a tale I had heard of an other Gentleman, from his youth ≈øo fa≈øhioned and inclined to this goodly trade of pilfering, that comming afterward to be heire and Lord of his owne goods, re≈øolved to giue over that manner of life, could notwith≈øtanding (if he chanced to come neere a ≈øhop, where he ≈øaw any thing he ≈øtood in neede of) not chu≈øe but ≈øteale the ≈øame, though afterward he would ever ≈øend mony and pay for it. And I have ≈øeene diver≈øe ≈øo inured to that vice, that among≈øt their companions, they would ordinarily ≈øteale ≈øuch things, as they would re≈øtore againe. I am a Ga≈øcoine, and there is no vice wherein I have le≈ø≈øe skill: I hate it ≈øomewhat more by complexion, then I accu≈øe it by di≈øcour≈øe. I doe not ≈øo much as de≈øire another mans goods.</p>
                        <p>And although my Country-men be indeed ≈øomewhat more taxed with this fault, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> yet have we ≈øeene of late daies, and that ≈øundry times men well borne and of good parentaeg in other parts of <hi>France</hi> in the hands of ju≈øtice, and lawfully convicted of many mo≈øt horrible robberies. I am of opinion that in regard of the≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches and lewd actions, fathers may, in ≈øome ≈øort, be blamed, and that it is onely long of them. And if any ≈øhall an≈øwer mee, as did once a Gentleman of good worth and vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he thriftily endevored to hoard vp riches, to no other purpo≈øe, nor to have any v≈øe and commodity of them, then to be honoured, re≈øpected and ≈øuingly ≈øought vnto by his friends and kinsfolkes, and that age having bereaved him of all other forces, it was the onely remedy he had left to maintaine him≈øelfe in authority with his hou≈øhold, and keepe him from falling into contempt and di≈ødaine of all the world. (And truely according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtotle,</hi> not onely old-age, but each imbecility, is the promoter, and motive of couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe. That is ≈øomething, but it is a remedie for an evill, whereof the birth ≈øhould have beene hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and breeding a voyded. That father may truely be ≈øaid mi≈øerable, that holdeth the affection of his children tied vnto him by no other meanes, then by the neede they have of his helpe, or want of his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, if that may be termed affection: <hi>A man ≈øhould yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe</hi>

hou≈øe, and enjoying of my goods, but with ≈øuch libertie and limited condition, as if they ≈øhould give me occa≈øion, I might repent my ≈øelfe of my gift, and revoke my deede. I would leave the v≈øe and fruition of all vnto them, the rather becau≈øe it were no longer fit for me to weald the ≈øame. And touching the di≈øpo≈øing of all matters in gro≈ø≈øe, I would re≈øerve what I plea≈øed vnto my ≈øelfe. Having ever judged, that it mu≈øt be a great contentment to an aged father, him≈øelfe to direct his children in the government of his hou≈øhold-affaires, and to be able whil≈øt him≈øelfe liveth, to checke and controule the demeanors: ≈øtoring them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction and advi≈øed coun≈øel according to the experience he hath had of them, and him≈øelf to addre≈ø≈øe the ancient honour and order of his hou≈øe in the handes of his ≈øucce≈ø≈øours, and that way warrant him≈øelfe of the hopes hee may conceive of their future conduct and after ≈øucce≈ø≈øe. And to this effect, I would not ≈øhunne their company. I would not be far from them, but as much as the condition of my age would permit, enjoy and be a partner of their ≈øports, mirths, and fea≈øts. If I did not continually live among≈øt them (as I could not wel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending their meetings and hindering their recreation, by rea≈øon of the peevi≈øh fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈ø≈øe of my age, and the trouble of my infirmities, and al≈øo without forcing their rules, and re≈øi≈øting the forme of life, I ≈øhould then follow) I would at lea≈øt live neere them, in ≈øome corner of my hou≈øe, not the be≈øt and faire≈øt in ≈øhew, but the mo≈øt ea≈øefull and commodious. And not as ≈øome yeeres ≈øince, I ≈øaw a Deane of S. <hi>Hillarie</hi> of Poictiers, reduced by rea≈øon and the incommoditie of his melancholy to ≈øuch a continuall ≈øolitarine≈ø≈øe, that when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his chamber he had never remooved one ≈øtep out of it in two and twenty yeares before: yet had all his faculties free and ea≈øie, onely a rheume excepted that fell into his ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make. Scar≈øe once a weeke would he ≈øuffer any body to come and ≈øee him. Hee would ever be ≈øhut vp in his chamber all alone, where no man ≈øhould come, except a boy, who once a day brought him meate, and who might not tarrie there, but as ≈øoone as he was in, mu≈øt goe out againe. All his exerci≈øe was ≈øometimes to walke vp and downe his chamber, and now and then reade on ≈øome booke (for he had ≈øome vnder≈øtanding of letters) but ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately re≈øolved to live and die in that cour≈øe, as he did ≈øhortly after. I would endevour by a kinde of civill demeanour and milde conver≈øation, to breede and ≈øettle in my children a true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harty-loving friend≈øhip, and vnfained good will towards me. A thing ea≈øily obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt well-borne mindes: For, if they proove, or be ≈øuch ≈øurly-furious bea≈øtes, or given to churli≈øh di≈øobedience, as our age bringeth forth thou≈øands, they mu≈øt as bea≈øtes be hated, as churls neglected, and as degenerate avoided. I hate this cu≈øtome, to forbid children to call their fathers father, and to teach them another ≈øtrange name, as of more reverence: As if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not ≈øufficiently provided for our authoritie. We call God-almightie by the name of father, and di≈ødaine our children ≈øhould call vs ≈øo. I have reformed this fault in mine owne hou≈øholde. It is al≈øo follie and inju≈øtice to deprive children, e≈øpecially being of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent age, of their fathers familiaritie, and ever to ≈ønew them a ≈øurly, au≈øtere, grim, and di≈ødainefull countenance, hoping thereby to keepe them in awefull feare and duteous obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For, it is a very vnprofitable proceeding, and which maketh fathers yrke≈øome vnto children; and which is wor≈øe, ridiculous. They have youth and ≈øtrength in their hands, and con≈øequently, the breath and favour of the worlde; and doe with mockerie and contempt receive the≈øe churli≈øh fierce, and tyrannicall countenaunces, from a man that hath no lu≈øty bloud left him, neither in his heart, nor in his veines; meere bugge-beares, and ≈øcar-crowes, to ≈øcare birdes with all. If it lay in my power to make my ≈øelfe feared, I had rather make my ≈øelfe beloved.

Alas (was he wont to ≈øay) the poore lad, ≈øaw never any thing in me, but a ≈øevere-≈øurly-countenance, full of di≈ødaine, and happily was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with this conceit, that I could neither love nor e≈øteeme him according to his merits. Ay-me, to whom did I re≈øerve, to di≈øcover that ≈øingular and loving affection, which in my ≈øoule I bare vnto him? Was it not he that ≈øhould have had all the plea≈øure and acknowledgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?

Tell me my good friend, am I the better or the wor≈øe by having a ta≈øte of it? Surely I am much the better. His griefe doth both comfort and honour mee. Is it not a religious and plea≈øing office of my life, for ever to make the ob≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies thereof? Can there be any plea≈øure worth this privation? I doe vnfold and open my ≈øelfe as much as I can to mine owne people, and willigly declare the ≈øtate of my will and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment toward them, as commonly I doe towards all men: I make ha≈øte to produce and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent my ≈øelfe, for I would have no man mi≈øtake me, in what part ≈øoever. Among≈øt other particular cu≈øtomes, which our ancient Gaules had, (as <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> affirmeth) this was one, that children never came before their fathers, nor were in any publicke a≈ø≈øembly ≈øeene in their company, but when they began to beare armes; as if they would infer, that then was the time, fathers ≈øhould admit them to their acquaintance and familiarity. I have al≈øo ob≈øerved another kinde of indi≈øcretion in ≈øome fathers of our times, who during their owne life, would never be induced to acquaint or impart vnto their children, that ≈øhare or portion, which by the Law of Nature, they were to have in their fortunes: Nay, ≈øome there are, who after their death bequeath and commit the ≈øame aucthority, over them and their goods, vnto their wives, with full power and law to di≈øpo≈øe of them at their plea≈øure. And my ≈øelfe have knowen a Gentleman, a chiefe officer of our crowne, that by right and hope of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion (had he lived vnto it) was to inherite above fifty thou≈øand crownes a yeere good land, who at the age of more then fifty yeeres fell into ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øity and want, and was run ≈øo farre in debt, that he had nothing left him, and as it is ≈øuppo≈øed died for very neede; while≈øt his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hir extreame decrepitude, enjoyed all his lands and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed all his goods, by vertue
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:12117:116"/>
of his fathers will and te≈øtament, who had lived very neere foure-≈øcore yeares. A thing (in my conceite) no way to be commended, but rather blamed. Therefore doe I thinke, that a man but little advantaged or bettered in e≈øtate, who is able to liue of him≈øelfe, and is out of debt, e≈øpecially if he have children, and goeth about to marry a wife, that mu≈øt have a great joynter out of his lands, a≈ø≈øuredly there is no other debt, that brings more ruine vnto hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes then that. My predece≈ø≈øours have commonly followed this coun≈øell, and ≈øo have I, and all have found good by it. But tho≈øe that di≈ø≈øwade vs from marrying of riche wives, le≈øt they might proove over di≈ødainefull and peevi≈øh, or le≈ø≈øe tractable and loving, are al≈øo deceived to make vs neglect and for-goe a reall commoditie, for ≈øo frivolous a conjecture. To an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonable women, it is all one co≈øt to hir, whether they pa≈ø≈øe vnder one rea≈øon, or vnder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>They love to be where they are most wronged.</hi> Inju≈øtice doeth allure them; as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their vertuous actions enticeth the good. And by how much richer they are, ≈øo much more milde and gentle are they: as more willingly and gloriou≈øly cha≈øt, by how much fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are. Some colour of rea≈øon there is, men ≈øhould leave the admini≈øtration of their goods and affaires vnto mothers, whil≈øt their children are not of competent age, or fit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes to manage the charge of them: And il hath their father brought them vp, if he cannot hope, the≈øe comming to yeares of di≈øcretion, they ≈øhal have no more wit, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and ≈øufficiencie, then his wife, con≈øidering the weakne≈ø≈øe of their ≈øexe. Yet truly were it as much again≈øt nature, ≈øo to order things, that mothers mu≈øt wholy depend of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens de≈øcretion. They ought largely and competently to be provided, wherewith to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their e≈øtate, according to the quality of their hou≈øe and age: becau≈øe <hi>neede and want is much more vn≈øeemely and hard to be indured in women, than in men:</hi> And children rather then mothers ought to be charged therewith. In generall, my opinion is, that the be≈øt di≈øtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods, is when we die, to di≈øtribute them according to the cu≈øtome of the Country. The Lawes have better thought vpon them then we: And better it is to let them erre in their election, then for vs ra≈øhly to hazard to faile in ours. They are not properly our owne, ≈øince without vs, and by a civill pre≈øcription, they are appointed to certaine ≈øucce≈ø≈øours. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we have ≈øome further liberty, I thinke it ≈øhould be a great and mo≈øt apparant cau≈øe to induce vs to take from one, and barre him from that, which Fortune hath allotted him, and the common Lawes and Iu≈øtice hath called him vnto: And that again≈øt rea≈øon wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øe this liberty, by ≈øuting the ≈øame vnto our priuate humours and frivolous fanta≈øies.

To whom the Law-giver an≈øwereth in this manner; my frends (≈øaith he) who doubtles ≈øhall ≈øhortly die it is a hard matter for you, both to know your ≈øelves, and what is yours, according to the <hi>Delphike</hi> in ≈øcription: As for me, who am the maker of your lawes, I am of opinion that neither your ≈øelves are your owne, nor that which you enjoy. And both you and your goods, pa≈øt and to come, belong to your familie; and moreover both your families and your goods are the common wealths: Wherfore, lea≈øt any flatterer, either in your age, or in time of ≈øickenes, or any other pa≈ø≈øion, ≈øhould vnadvi≈øedly induce you to make any vnlawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayance or vnju≈øt will and te≈øtament, I will looke to you and keepe you from-it.

To me it belongeth, who have no more regarde to one thing, then to another, and who as much as I can, take care for the general, to have a regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full re≈øpect of that which you leave behind you. But to returne to my former di≈øcour≈øe, me thinkes, we ≈øeldome ≈øee that woman borne, to whom the ≈øuperioritie or maje≈øtie over men is due, except the motherly and naturall; vnles it be for the cha≈øti≈øement of ≈øuch, as by ≈øome fond-febricitant humor have voluntarily ≈øubmitted them≈øelves vnto them: But that doth nothing concerne old women, of whom we ≈øpeake here.

For, wanting rea≈øonable di≈øcour≈øe to chu≈øe, and embrace what they ought, they rather ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be directed, where natures impre≈ø≈øions are mo≈øt ≈øingle, as other creatures, which take no longer knowledge of their yong-ones, then they are ≈øucking. Moreover, experience doth manife≈øtly ≈ønew vnto vs, that the ≈øame naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to which we a≈øcribe ≈øo much authoritie, hath but a weake foundation. For a very ≈ømall gaine, we daily take mothers owne children from them and induce them to take charge of ours; Doe we not often procure them to bequeath their children to ≈øome fond, filthie, ≈ølutti≈øh, and vnhealthie nurce, to whom we would be very loth to commit ours, or to ≈øome bruti≈øh Goate, not onely forbidding them to nurce and feede their owne children (what danger ≈øoever may betide them) but al≈øo to have any care of them, to the end they may the more diligently follow, and carefully attend the ≈øervice of ours? Whereby wee ≈øoone ≈øee through cu≈øtome a certaine kinde of ba≈øtard-affection to be engendred in them, more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement then the naturall, and to be much more tender and carefull for the well fare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of other mens children, then for their owne. And the rea≈øon why I have made mention of Goates, is, becau≈øe it is an ordinarie thing round about me where I dwell, to ≈øee the countrie women, when they have not milke enough to feed their infants with their owne brea≈øts, to call for Goates to helpe them. And my ≈øelfe have now two lacke is wayting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, who except it were eight daies never ≈øuck't other milke then Goates; They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently to come at call, and give yong infants ≈øucke, and become ≈øo well acquainted with their voice, that when they heare them crie; they runne forthwith vnto them. And if by chance they have any other child put to their teates, then their nur≈øeling, they refu≈øe and reject him, and ≈øo doth the childe a ≈øtrange Goate. My ≈øelfe ≈øaw that one not long ≈øince, from whom the father tooke a Goate, which he had ≈øucked two or three daies, becau≈øe he had but borrowed it of one his neighbours, who could never be induced to ≈øucke any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby he ≈øhortly died; and as I verely thinke, of meere hunger. <hi>Bea≈øts as well as we doe ≈øoone alter, and ea≈øily ba≈øtardize their naturall affection.</hi> I beleeve, that in that, which <hi>Hero dotus</hi> reporteth of a certaine province of <hi>Libia,</hi> there often followeth great error and mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. He ≈øaith, that men doe indifferently v≈øe, and as it were in common frequent women;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12117:117"/>
And that the childe as ≈øoone as he is able to goe, comming to any ≈øolemne meetings and great a≈ø≈øemblies, led by a naturall in≈øtinct findeth out his owne father: where being turned loo≈øe in the midde≈øt of the multitude, looke what man the childe doth fir≈øt addre≈ø≈øe his ≈øteps vnto, and then goe to him, the ≈øame is ever afterward reputed to be his right father. Now if we ≈øhal duely con≈øider this ≈øimple occa≈øion of loving our children, becau≈øe we have begotten them, for which we call them our other ≈øelves. It ≈øeemes there is another production com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from vs, and which is of no le≈ø≈øe recommendation and con≈øequence. For what we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender by the minde, the fruites of our courage, ≈øufficiencie, or ≈øpirite, are brought forth by a far more noble part, then the corporall, and are more, our owne. We are both father and mother together in this generation: ≈øuch fruites co≈øt vs much dearer, and bring vs more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and chiefly if they have any good or rare thing in them. For, the value of our other children, is much more theire, then ours. The ≈øhare we have in them is but little; but of the≈øe all the beautie, all the grace, and all the worth is ours. And therefore doe they repre≈øent, and re≈øemble vs much more lively then others. <hi>Plate</hi> addeth moreover, that the≈øe are immortall i≈ø≈øues, and immortalize their fathers, yea and deifie them, as <hi>Licurgus, Solen,</hi> and <hi>Minos.</hi> All hi≈øtories being full of examples of this mutuall friend≈øhip of fathers toward their children, I have not thought it ami≈ø≈øe to ≈øet downe ≈øome choi≈øe one of this kinde. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> that good Bi≈øhop of <hi>Tricea,</hi> loved rather to loo≈øe the dignity, profit and devotion of ≈øo venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Prelate≈øhip, then to for-goe his daughter, a yong woman to this day commended for hir beautie, but happily ≈øomewhat more curiou≈øly and wantonly pranked-vp then be≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the daughter of a churchman and a Bi≈øhop, and of over-amorous behavior. There was one <hi>Labienus</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> a man of great worth and authority, and an ong≈øt other commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities, mo≈øt excellent in all maner of learning, who (as I think) was the ≈øonne of that great <hi>Labienus,</hi> cheife of all the captaines that followed and were vnder <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> in the warres againe the Gaules, and who afterward taking great <hi>Pompeys</hi> part, behaved him≈øelfe ≈øo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly and ≈øo con≈øtantly, that he never for≈øooke him vntill <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> defeated him in <hi>Spaine.</hi> This <hi>Labienus</hi> of whom I ≈øpake, had many that envied his vertues; But aboue all (as it is likely) courtiers, and ≈øuch as in his time were favored of the Emperors, who hated his frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, his fatherly humors, and di≈øta≈øte he bare ≈øtill again≈øt tyrannie, wherewith it may be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed he had ≈øtuffed his bookes and compo≈øitions. His adver≈øaries vehemently pur≈øued him before the Magi≈øtrate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and prevailed ≈øo farre, that many of his works which he had publi≈øhed were condemned to be burned.

We have enough to doe, to endure the burthen of them, and are ≈øo engived and ≈øhackled in them, as if we were to fight but with the ≈øhocke or brunt of our armes: And as if we were as much bound to defend them, as they to ≈øhield vs. <hi>Cornelius Facitus</hi> doth plea≈øantly quip and je≈øt at the men of war of our ancient Gaules, ≈øo armed, only to maintaine them≈øelves, as they that have no meane, either to offend or to be offended, or to rai≈øe them≈øelves being overthrowne. <hi>Lucullus</hi> ≈øeeing certaine Median men at armes, which were in the front of <hi>Tigranes</hi> Army, heavily and vnweildely armed, as in an yron-pri≈øon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended thereby an opinion, that he might ea≈øily defeat them, and began to charge them fir≈øt, and got the victory. And now that our Muskettiers, are in ≈øuch credite, I thinke we ≈øhall haue ≈øome invention found to immure vs vp, that ≈øo we may be warranted from them, and to traine vs to the warres in Skonces and Ba≈øtions, as tho≈øe which our fathers cau≈øed to be carried by Elephants. A humour farre different from that of <hi>Scipio</hi> the yoonger, who ≈øharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooved his ≈øouldiers, becau≈øe they had ≈øcattered certaine Calthrops vnder the water along≈øt a dike, by which tho≈øe of the Towne that he be≈øieged might ≈øally out vpon him, ≈øaying; <hi>that tho≈øe which a≈ø≈øailed, ≈øhould re≈øolve to enterpri≈øe and not to feare:</hi> And had ≈øome rea≈øon to feare, that this provi≈øion might ≈øecure and lull their vigilancy a≈øleepe to guard them≈øelves. Moreover he ≈øaid to a yoong man, that ≈øhewed him a faire ≈øhield he had; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed good youth, it is a faire one, but <hi>a Roman ≈øouldier ought to have more confidence in his right hand, than in his left.</hi> It is onely cu≈øtome that makes the burthen of our armes intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto vs.</p>

The≈øe are but my fanta≈øies, by which I endevour not to make things knowen, but my≈øelfe. They may haply one day be knowen vnto me, or have bin at other times, according as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath brought me where they were declared or manife≈øted. But I remember them no more. And if I be a man of ≈øome reading, yet I am a man of no remembring, I conceive no certainty, except it bee to give notice, how farre the knowledge I have of it, dooth now reach. Let no man bu≈øie him≈øelfe about the matters, but on the fa≈øhion I give them. Let that which I borrow be ≈øurvaid, and then tell me whether I have made good choice of ornaments, to beautifie and ≈øet foorth the invention, which ever comes from mee. For, I make others to relate (not after mine owne fanta≈øie, but as it be≈øt falleth out) what I can not ≈øo well expre≈ø≈øe, either through vnskill of language, or want of judgement. I number not my borrowings, but I weigh them. And if I would have made their number to prevaile, I would have had twice as many.

I will love him that ≈øhall trace, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feather me; I meane through clearene≈ø≈øe of judgement, and by the onely di≈øtinction of the force and beautie of my Di≈øcour≈øes.

As for <hi>Amadis</hi> and ≈øuch like tra≈øh of writings, they had never the credit ≈øo much as to allure my youth to delight in them. This I will ≈øay more, either boldly or ra≈øhly, that this old and heavie-pa≈øed mind of mine, will no more be plea≈øed with <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> or tickled with good <hi>Ovid:</hi> his facilitie, and quaint inventions, which heretofore have ≈øo ravi≈øhed me, they can now adaies ≈øcarcely entertaine me.

And ≈øo are <hi>Plutarkes</hi> little workes, and <hi>Senecaes</hi> Epi≈øtles; which are the be≈øt and mo≈øt profitable partes of their writings. It is no great matter to draw mee to them, and I leave them where I li≈øt. For, they ≈øucceed not, and depend not one of another. Both jumpe and ≈øuite together, in mo≈øt true and profitable opinions: And fortune brought them both into the world in one age. Both were Tutors vnto two Roman Emperours: Both were ≈øtrangers, and came from farre Countries; both rich and mighty in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and in credite with their ma≈øters. Their in≈øtruction is the prime and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:12117:120"/>
creame of Philo≈øophie, and pre≈øented with a plaine, vnaffected, and pertinent fa≈øhion. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke</hi> is more vniforme and con≈øtant; <hi>Seneca</hi> more waving and diver≈øe. This doth labour, force, and extend him≈øelfe, to arme and ≈øtrengthen vertue again≈øt weakne≈ø≈øe, feare, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous de≈øires; the other ≈øeemeth nothing ≈øo much to feare their force or attempt, and in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ≈øcorneth to ha≈øten or change his pace about them, and to put him≈øelfe vpon his guarde. <hi>Plutarkes</hi> opinions are Platonicall, gentle and accommodable vnto civill ≈øocietie: <hi>Senacaes</hi> Stoicall and Epicurian, further from common v≈øe, but in my conceit, more proper parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and more ≈øolide. It appeareth in <hi>Seneca,</hi> that he ≈øomewhat inclineth and yeeldeth to the tyrannie of the Emperors which were in his daies; for, I verily beleeve, it is with a forced judgement, he condemneth the cau≈øe of tho≈øe noblie-minded murtherers of <hi>Cae≈øar: Plutarke</hi> is every where free and open-hearted; <hi>Seneca,</hi> full-fraught with points and ≈øallies, <hi>Plutarke</hi> ≈øtuft with matters. The former doth moove and enflame you more; the latter, content, plea≈øe, and pay you better: This doth guide you, the other drive you on. As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> of all his works, tho≈øe that treat of Philo≈øophie (namely morall) are they which be≈øt ≈øerve my turne, and ≈øquare with my intent. But boldly to confe≈ø≈øe the trueth, (For, <hi>Since the bars of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie were broken downe, all curbing is taken away</hi>) his maner of writing ≈øeemeth verie tedious vnto me, as doth all ≈øuch-like ≈øtuffe. For, his prefaces, definitions, divi≈øions, and Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, con≈øume the greate≈øt part of his Works; what≈øoever quicke, wittie, and pithie conceit is in him, is ≈øurcharged, and confounded by tho≈øe his long and far-fetcht preambles. If I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow but one houre in reading him, which is much for me; and let me call to minde what ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, or juice I have drawne from him, for the mo≈øt part, I find nothing but winde &amp; o≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in him: for he is not yet come to the arguments, which make for his purpo≈øe, and rea≈øons that properly concerne the knot or pith I ≈øeek-after. The≈øe Logicall and Ari≈øtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ordinances are not availfull for me, who onely endevour to become more wi≈øe and ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and not more wittie or eloquent. I would have one begin with the la≈øt point: I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand ≈øufficiently what death and voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe are: let not a man bu≈øie him≈øelfe to anatomize them. At the fir≈øt reading of a Booke, I ≈øeeke for good and ≈øolide rea≈øons, that may in≈øtruct me how to ≈øu≈øtaine their a≈ø≈øaults. It is nether gramaticall ≈øubtilties, nor logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call quiddities, nor the wittie contexture of choi≈øe words, or arguments, and ≈øyllogi≈ømes, that will ≈øerve my turne. I like tho≈øe di≈øcour≈øes that give the fir≈øt charge to the ≈øtronge≈øt, part of the doubt; his are but flouri≈øhes, and langui≈øh every where. They are good for Schooles, at the barre, or for Orators and Preachers, where we may ≈ølumber: and though we wake a quarter of an houre after, we may find and trace him ≈øoone enough.

forth on this worlds Theatre.

As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> I am of the common judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that be≈øides learning, there was no exqui≈øite excellencie in him: He was a good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, of an hone≈øt-gentle nature, as are commonly fat and burly men; for ≈øo was he: But to ≈øpeake truely of him, full of ambitious vanitie and remi≈ø≈øe nicene≈ø≈øe. And I know not well how to excu≈øe him, in that he deemed his Poe≈øie worthy to be publi≈øhed. It is no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, to make bad ver≈øes, but it is an imperfection in him, that he never perceived how vnworthy they were of the glorie of his name. Concerning his eloquence, it is beyond all compari≈øon, and I verily beleeve, that none ≈øhall ever equall it. <hi>Cicero</hi> the yoonger, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled his father in nothing, but in name, commaunding in <hi>A≈øia,</hi> chanced one day to have many ≈øtrangers at his board, and among≈øt others, one <hi>Castius</hi> ≈øitting at the lower end, as the maner is to thru≈øt-in at great mens tables: <hi>Cicero</hi> inquired of one of his men what he was, who told him his name, but he dreaming on other matters, and having forgotten what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere his man made him, asked him his name twice or thrice more: the ≈øervant, becau≈øe he would not be troubled to tell him one thing ≈øo often, and by ≈øome circum≈øtance make him to know him better. It is, ≈øaid he, the ≈øame <hi>Castius,</hi> to whom ≈øome have told you, that in re≈øpect of his owne, maketh no accompt of your fathers eloquence: <hi>Cicero</hi> being ≈øuddainly, mooved, commaunded the ≈øaid poore <hi>Castius,</hi> to be pre≈øently taken from the table, and well whipt in his pre≈øence: Lo-heere an vncivill and barbarous ho≈øt. Even among≈øt tho≈øe, which (all things con≈øidered) have deemed his eloquence matchle≈ø≈øe and incomparable others there have been, who have not ≈øpared to note ≈øome faults in it: As great <hi>Brutus</hi> ≈øaid, that it was an eloquence, broken, halting, and disjoynted, <hi>fractam &amp; elumbem: Incoherent and ≈øinnowle≈ø≈øe.</hi> Tho≈øe Orators that lived about his age, reprooved al≈øo in him the curious care he had of a certaine long cadence, at the end of his clau≈øes, and noted the≈øe words, <hi>E≈ø≈øe videatur,</hi> which he ≈øo often v≈øeth.

Such as are betweene both (which is the mo≈øt common fa≈øhion) it is they that ≈øpoile all; they will needs chew our meat for vs, and take vpon them a law to judge, and by con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ≈øquare and encline the ≈øtorie according to their fanta≈øie; for, where the judgement bendeth one way, a man cannot chu≈øe but wre≈øt and turne his narration that way. They vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to chu≈øe things worthy to be knowne, and now and then conceal either a word, or a ≈øecret action from vs, which would much better in≈øtruct vs: omitting ≈øuch things as they vnder≈øtand not, as incredible: and happily ≈øuch matters, as they know not how to declare, either in good Latin, or tollerable French. Let them boldly en≈øtall their eloquence, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe: Let them cen≈øure at their plea≈øure, but let them al≈øo give vs leave to judge after them: And let them neither alter nor di≈øpence by their abridgements and choi≈øe, any thing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the ≈øub≈øtance of the matter; but let them rather ≈øend it pure and entire with all hir dimen≈øions vnto vs. Mo≈øt commonly (as chiefly in our age) this charge of writing hi≈øtories is committed vnto ba≈øe, ignorant, and mechanicall kind of people, only for this con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they can ≈øpeak well; as if we ≈øought to learne the Grammer of them; and they have ≈øome rea≈øon, being only hyred to that end, and publi≈øhing nothing but their tittle-tattle to aime at nothing el≈øe ≈øo much. Thus with ≈øtore of choi≈øe and quaint words, and wyre-drawne phra≈øes they huddle vp, and make a hodge-pot of a laboured contexture of the reports, which they gather in the market-places, or ≈øuch other a≈ø≈øemblies. <hi>The only good hi≈øtories are tho≈øe that are written by ≈øuch as commanded, or were imploid them≈øelves in weighty affaires, or that were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the conduct of them, or that at lea≈øt have had the fortune to manage others of like qualitie.</hi> Such in a maner are all the Graecians and Romans. For, many eye-witne≈ø≈øes hauing written of one ≈øame ≈øubject (as it hapned in tho≈øe times, when Greatne≈ø≈øe and Knowledge did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly meet) if any fault or over-≈øight have pa≈øt them, it mu≈øt be deemed exceeding light, and vpon ≈øome doubtfull accident. <hi>What may a man expect at a Phi≈øitions hand, that di≈øcour≈øeth of warre, or of a bare Scholler, treating of Princes ≈øecret de≈øignes?</hi> If we ≈øhall but note the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Romans had in that, we need no other example: <hi>A≈øinius Polio</hi> found ≈øome mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking or over≈øight in <hi>Cae≈øars</hi> Commentaries, whereinto he was falne, only becau≈øe he could not po≈ø≈øiblie over≈øee all things with his owne eyes, that hapned in his Armie, but was faine to relie on the reports of particular men, who often related vntruths vnto him; or el≈øe becau≈øe he had not been curiou≈øly adverti≈øed, and di≈øtinctly enformed by his Lieutenants and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, of ≈øuch matters as they in his ab≈øence had managed or effected. Whereby may be ≈øeen, that <hi>nothing is ≈øo hard, or ≈øo vncertaine to be found-out, as the certaintie of a Truth,</hi> ≈øithence no man can put any a≈ø≈øured confidence concerning the truth of a battel, neither in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, that was Generall, or commanded over it, nor in the ≈øoldiers that fought, of any thing, that hath hapned among≈øt them; except after the maner of a ≈øtrict point of law, the ≈øeverall witne≈ø≈øes are brought and examined face to face, and that all matters be nicely and thorowly ≈øifted by the objects and trials of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of every accident.

been handled by <hi>Bodine,</hi> and agreeing with my conception. Somewhat to aide the weakne≈ø≈øe of my memorie, and to a≈ø≈øi≈øt her great defects; for it hath often been my chance to light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bookes, which I ≈øuppo≈øed to be new, and never to have read, which I had not vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diligently read and run-over many yeares before, and all be≈øcribled with my notes: I have a while ≈øince accu≈øtomed my ≈øelfe, to note at the end of my booke (I meane ≈øuch as I purpo≈øe to read but once) the time I made an end to read it, and to ≈øet downe what cen≈øure or judgement I gave of it; that ≈øo, it may at lea≈øt, at another time repre≈øent vnto my mind, the aire and generall Idea, I had conceived of the Author in reading him. I will here ≈øet downe the Coppie of ≈øome of mine annotations, and e≈øpecially what I noted vpon my <hi>Guicciardine</hi> about ten yeares ≈øince: (For what language ≈øoever my bookes ≈øpeake vnto me, I ≈øpeake vnto them in mine owne.) He is a diligent Hi≈øtoriographer, and from whom in my conceit, a man may as exactly learne the truth of ≈øuch affaires as pa≈ø≈øed in his time, as of any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what≈øoever: and the rather becau≈øe him≈øelfe hath been an Actor of mo≈øt part of them, and in verie honourable place. There is no ≈øigne or apparance, that ever he di≈øgui≈øed or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured any matter, either through hatred, malice, favour, or vanitie; whereof the free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parciall judgements he giveth of great men, and namely of tho≈øe by whom he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced or imployed in his important charges, as of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ≈øeaventh, beareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted te≈øtimonie. Concerning the parts wherewith he mo≈øt goeth about to prevaile, which are his digre≈ø≈øions and di≈øcour≈øes, many of them are verie excellent, and enriched with faire ornaments, but he hath too much plea≈øed him≈øelfe in them: for, endevouring to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might be ≈øpoken, having ≈øo full and large a ≈øubject, and almo≈øt infinite, he proveth ≈øomewhat langui≈øhing, and giveth a ta≈øte of a kind of ≈øchola≈øticall tedious babling. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I have noted this, that of ≈øo ≈øeverall and divers armes, ≈øucce≈ø≈øes, and effects he judgeth of; of ≈øo many and variable motives, alterations, and coun≈øels, that he relateth, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth any one vnto vertue, religion, or con≈øcience: as if they were all extingui≈øhed and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed the world: and of all actions, how glorious ≈øoever in apparance they be of them≈øelves, he doth ever impute the cau≈øe of them, to ≈øome vicious and blame-worthie occa≈øion, or to ≈øome commoditie and profit. It is impo≈ø≈øible to imagine, that among≈øt ≈øo infinite a number of actions, whereof he judgeth, ≈øome one have not been produced and compa≈ø≈øed by way of rea≈øon. No corruption could ever po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe men ≈øo vniver≈øally, but that ≈øome one mu≈øt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity e≈øcape the contagion; which makes me to feare, he hath had ≈øome di≈øta≈øte or blame in his pa≈ø≈øion, and it hath haply fortuned, that he hath judged or e≈øteemed of others according to him≈øelfe. In my <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> there is this: In him you ≈øhall find a plea≈øing-≈øweet, and gently-gliding ≈øpeach, fraught with a purely-≈øincere ≈øimplicitie, his narration pure and vnaffected, and wherein the Authours vn≈øpotted-good meaning doth evidently appeare, void of all maner of vanitie or o≈øtentation ≈øpeaking of him≈øelfe, and free from all affection or envie ≈øpeaking of others: his di≈øcour≈øes and per≈øwa≈øions, accompanied more with a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning zeale, and meere veritie, then with any laboured and exqui≈øit ≈øufficiencie, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through, with gravitie and authoritie, repre≈øenting a man well-borne, and brought vp in high negotiations. Vpon the memories and hi≈øtorie of Mon≈øieur du <hi>Bellay:</hi> It is ever a well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing thing, to ≈øee matters writen by tho≈øe, that have a≈ø≈øaide how, &amp; in what maner they ought to be directed and managed: yet can it not be denied, but that in both the≈øe Lords, there will manife≈øtly appeare a great declination from a free libertie of writing, which clearely ≈øhineth in ancient writers of their kind: as in the Lord of <hi>Ionuille,</hi> familiar vnto Saint <hi>Lewis, Eginard,</hi> Chancellor vnto <hi>Charlemaine;</hi> and of more fre≈øh memorie in <hi>Philip de Comines.</hi> This is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a declamation or pleading for king <hi>Francis</hi> again≈øt the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, then an Hi≈øtorie. I will not believe, they have altered or changed any thing concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of matters, but rather to wre≈øt and turne the judgement of the events, many times again≈øt rea≈øon, to our advantage, and to omit what≈øoever they ≈øuppo≈øed, to be doubtfull or tickli≈øh in their ma≈øters life: they have made profe≈ø≈øion of it witne≈ø≈øe the recoylings of the Lords of <hi>Momorancy</hi> and <hi>Byron,</hi> which therein are forgotten; and which is more, you ≈øhall not ≈øo much as find the name of the Ladie of E≈øtampes mentioned at all. A man may ≈øometimes colour, and happily hide ≈øecret actions, but ab≈øolutely to conceal that, which all the world knoweth, and e≈øpecially ≈øuch things as have drawne-on publike effects, and of ≈øuch con≈øequence, it is an inexcu≈øable defect, or as I may ≈øay vnpardonable over≈øight.

But vertue importeth, and ≈øoundeth ≈øomewhat I wot not what greater and more active, then by an happy complexion, gently and peaceably, to ≈øuffer it ≈øelfe to be led or drawne, to follow rea≈øon. He that through a naturall facilitie, and genuine mildne≈ø≈øe, ≈øhould neglect or contemne injuries received, ≈øhould no doubt performe a rare action, and worthy commendation: But he who being toucht and ≈øtung to the quicke, with any wrong or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence received, ≈øhould arme him≈øelfe with rea≈øon again≈øt this furiou≈øly-blind de≈øire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and in the end after a great conflict, yeeld him≈øelfe ma≈øter over-it, ≈øhould doubtle≈ø≈øe doe much more. The fir≈øt ≈øhould doe well, the other vertuou≈øly: the one action might be termed goodne≈ø≈øe, the other vertue. For, <hi>It ≈øeemeth, that the verie name of vertue pre≈øuppo≈øeth difficultie, and inferreth re≈øi≈øtance, and cannot well exerci≈øe it ≈øelfe without an enemie.</hi> It is perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the rea≈øon why we call God good, mightie, liberall, and ju≈øt, but we terme him not vertuous.

Hitherto I have come at good ea≈øe; but at the end of this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, one thing commeth into my minde, which is, that the ≈øoule of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute the perfecte≈øt that ever came to my knowledge, would, according to my accompt, prove a ≈øoule de≈øerving but little commendation: For, I can perceive no maner of violence or vicious concupi≈øence in him: I can imagine no maner of difficultie or compul≈øion in the whole cour≈øe of his vertue. I know his rea≈øon ≈øo powerfull, and ≈øo ab≈øolute mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe over him, that ≈øhe can never give him way to any vicious de≈øire, and will not ≈øuffer it ≈øo much as to breed in him. To a vertue ≈øo exqui≈øit, and ≈øo high-rai≈øed as his is, I can per≈øwade nothing. Me thinkes I ≈øee it march with a victorious and triumphant pace, in pompe, and at ea≈øe, without let or di≈øturbance. If vertue cannot ≈øhine but by re≈øi≈øting contrarie appetites, ≈øhall we then ≈øay, it cannot pa≈ø≈øe without the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of vice, and oweth him this, that by his meanes it attaineth to honour and credit? What ≈øhould al≈øo betide of that glorious and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Epicurian voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe, that makes accompt, effeminately to pamper vertue in hir lap, and there wantonly to entertaine it, allowing it for hir recreation, ≈øhame, reproch, agues, povertie, death, and tortures?

I doe not ≈øo ea≈øily beleeve them, or el≈øe I vnder≈øtand them not; for, in effect, I feel the contrarie. They are ≈øharpe-wittie ≈øubtilties, and without ≈øub≈øtance, about which Philo≈øophie doth often bu≈øie it ≈øelfe. Some vices I ≈øhun; but other≈øome I e≈øchew as much as any Saint can doe. The Peripatetikes doe al≈øo di≈øavow this connexitie, and indi≈ø≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knitting together. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> is of opinion, <hi>That a wi≈øe and iust man may be both intemperate and incontinent. Socrates</hi> avowed vnto them, who in his Phi≈øiognomie percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ≈øome inclination vnto vice, that indeed it was his naturall propen≈øion, but that by di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline he had corrected the ≈øame.

On the other≈øide, what good I have, I have it by the lot of my birth: I have it neither by law nor pre≈øcription, nor by any apprenti≈øhip. The innocencie that is in me, is a kinde of ≈øimple-plaine innocencie, without vigor or arte. Among≈øt all other vices, there is none I hate more, then crueltie, both by nature and judgement, as the extreame≈øt of all vices. But it is with ≈øuch an yearning and faint-hartedne≈ø≈øe, that if I ≈øee but a chickins necke puld off, or a pigge ≈øtickt, I cannot chu≈øe but grieve, and I cannot well endure a ≈øeelie dew-bedabled hare to groane, when ≈øhe is ≈øeized vpon by the boundes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hunting be a violent ≈øport.

                        <p>But to returne to my former di≈øcour≈øe, I have a verie feeling and tender compa≈ø≈øion of other mens afflictions, and ≈øhould more ea≈øily weep for companie ≈øake, if po≈ø≈øiblie for any occa≈øion what≈øoever, I could ≈øhed teares. There is nothing ≈øooner mooveth teares in me, then to ≈øee others weepe, not onely fainedly, but how≈øoever, whether truely or forcedly. I do not greatly waile for the dead, but rather envie them. Yet doe I much waile and moane the dying. The Canibales and ≈øavage people do not ≈øo much offend me with roa≈øting and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of dead bodies, as tho≈øe, which torment and per≈øecute the living. Let any man be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by law, how de≈øervedly ≈øoever, I cannot endure to behold the execution with an vnrelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eye. Some one going about to witne≈ø≈øe the clemencie of <hi>Iulius Cae≈øar;</hi> He was (≈øaith he) tractable &amp; milde in matters of revenge. Having compelled the Pirates to yeeld them≈øelves vnto him, who had before taken him pri≈øoner, and put him to ran≈øome, fora≈ømuch as he had threatned to have them all crucified, he condemned them to that kind of death, but it was after he had cau≈øed them to be ≈øtrangled. <hi>Philomon</hi> his ≈øecretarie, who would have poy≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, had no ≈øharper puni≈øhment of him, then an ordinarie death. Without mencioning the Latin Author, who for a te≈øtimonie of clemencie dareth to alleage, the onely killing of tho≈øe, by whom a man hath been offended, it may ea≈øily be ghe≈ø≈øed, that he is tainted with vile and horrible examples of crueltie, ≈øuch as Romane Tyrants brought into fa≈øhion. As for me, even in matters of ju≈øtice, <hi>What≈øoever is beyond a ≈øimple death, I deeme it to be meere crueltie:</hi> And e≈øpecially among≈øt vs, who ought to have a regardfull re≈øpect, that their ≈øoules ≈øhould be ≈øent to heaven, which cannot be, having fir≈øt by intollerable tortures agitated, and as it were brought them to di≈øpaire. A Souldier, not long ≈øince, being a pri≈øoner, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from a loft a Tower, where he was kept, that ≈øtore of people flocked together on a greene, and Carpenters were bu≈øie at worke to erect a skaffold, ≈øuppo≈øing the ≈øame to be for him, as one de≈øperat, re≈øolved to kill him≈øelfe, and ≈øearching vp and downe for ≈øome thing to make him≈øelfe away, found nothing but an old ru≈øtie cart-naile, which fortune pre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Shortly after, one of his keepers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-in vnto him, and yet living, finding him in that mi≈øerable plight, but weltring in his goare-blood, and readie to ga≈øpe his la≈øt, told the Magi≈øtrates of it, which, to prevent time before he ≈øhould die, ha≈øtned to pronounce ≈øentence again≈øt him: which when he heard, and that he was onely condemned to have his head cut-off, he ≈øeemed to take heart of grace againe, and to be ≈øorie for what he had done, and tooke ≈øome comfortable drinks, which before he had refu≈øed, greatly thanking the Iudges for his vnhoped gentle condemnation: And told them, that for feare of a more ≈øharply-cruell, and intollerable death by law, he had re≈øolved to prevent-it by ≈øome violent manner of death, having by the preparations he had ≈øeen the Carpenters make, and by gathering of people together, conceived an opinion, that they would torture him with ≈øome horrible torment, and ≈øeemed to be delivered from death, onely by the change of it.

                        <p>It was my fortune to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon a day that one <hi>Catena,</hi> a notorious high-way thee≈øe, was executed: at his ≈øtrangling no man of the companie ≈øeemed to be mooved to any ruth; but when he came to be quartered, the Executioner gave no blow that was not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a pitteous voyce, and hartie exclamation, as if every man had had a feeling ≈øym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie, or lent his ≈øen≈øes to the poore mangled wretch. Such inhumane outrages and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous exce≈ø≈øes ≈øhould be exerci≈øed again≈øt the rinde, and not practi≈øed again≈øt the quicke. In a ca≈øe ≈øomewhat like vnto this, did <hi>Artaxerces</hi> a≈ø≈øwage and mittigate the ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe of the ancient lawes of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> appointing that the Lords, which had tre≈øpa≈ø≈øed in their e≈øtate, whereas they were wont to be whipped, they ≈øhould be ≈øtripped naked, and their clothes whipped for them: and where they were accu≈øtomed to have their haire pulled-off, they ≈øhould onely have their hat taken off. The Aegyptians ≈øo devout and religious, thought they did ≈øufficiently ≈øati≈øfie divine Iu≈øtice, in ≈øacrificing painted and counterfait hogges vnto it: An over-hardy invention, to go about with pictures &amp; ≈øhadowes to appea≈øe God, a ≈øub≈øtance ≈øo e≈ø≈øentiall and divine.

                        <p>And the very ≈øame interpretation, that <hi>Plutarke</hi> giveth vnto this error, which is very well taken, is al≈øo honorable for them. For, he ≈øaith, that (for example-≈øake,) it was neither the Cat nor the oxe, that the Egyptians adored; but that in tho≈øe bea≈øts, they wor≈øhipped ≈øome image of divine faculties. In this patience and vtility, and in that, vivacity, or (as our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Borgonians with all <hi>Germany</hi>) the impatience to ≈øee them≈øelves ≈øhut-vp: Whereby they repre≈øented the liberty, which they loved and adored, beyond all other divine facultie, and ≈øo of others. But when among≈øt the mo≈øt moderate opinions, I meete with ≈øome di≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, that goe about and labour to ≈øhew, the neere re≈øemblance betweene vs and bea≈øtes, and what ≈øhare they have in our greate≈øt Priviledges, and with how much likely-hood they are compared vnto vs, truely I abate much of our pre≈øumption, and am ea≈øily removed from that imaginary Soveraigntie, that ≈øome give and a≈øcribe vnto vs aboue all other creatures. If all that were to be contradicted, yet is there a kind of re≈øpect, and a general duty of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which tieth vs, not only vnto brute bea≈øts that have life and ≈øen≈øe, but even vnto trees and plants. <hi>Vnto men we owe Iustice, and to all other creatures, that are capable of it, grace and benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> There is a kinde of enter-changeable commerce and mutuall bond between them and vs. I am not a≈øhamed nor affraide to declare the tenderne≈ø≈øe of my childi≈øh Nature, which is ≈øuch, that I cannot well reject my Dog, if he chance (although out of ≈øea≈øon) to fawne vpon me, or begge of mee to play with him. The Turkes have almes, and certaine Ho≈øpitalls appoynted for brute bea≈øts. The Romans had a publike care to breed and nouri≈øh Gee≈øe, by who≈øe vigilancy their Capitoll had beene ≈øaved. The Athenians did precizely ordaine, that all maner of Mules, which had ≈øerved or beene emploied about the building of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called <hi>Hecatompedon,</hi> ≈øhould be free, and ≈øuffered to feede where≈øoever they plea≈øed, without any let or empeachment. The Agrigentines had an ordinary cu≈øtome, ≈øeriou≈øly and ≈øolemnly to bury all ≈øuch bea≈øts, as they had held deare; as hor≈øes of rare worth and merit, ≈øpeciall dogs, choi≈øe or profitable birds, or ≈øuch as had but ≈øerved to make their children ≈øport. And the ≈øumptuous magnificence, which in all other things was ordinary and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto them, appeared al≈øo almo≈øt notably in the ≈øtately ≈øumptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and co≈øtly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of monuments erected to that end, which many ages after have endured and been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in pride and ≈øtate. The Aegyptians were wont to bury their Woolues, their Dogges, their Cats, their Beares, and Crocodiles in holy places, embalming their carca≈ø≈øes, and at their deaths to were mourning weedes for them. <hi>Cymon</hi> cau≈øed a ≈øtately-honourable toombe to be errected for the Mares, wherewith he had three times gained the prize at running in the Olimpike games. Ancient <hi>Xantippus</hi> cau≈øed his Dogge to be enterred vpon a hill by the ≈øea ≈øhoare, which ever ≈øince hath beene named by him. And <hi>Plutarke</hi> (as him≈øelfe ≈øaith) made it a matter of con≈øcience, in hope of a ≈ømall gaine, to ≈øell or ≈øend an Oxe to the ≈øhambles, that had ≈øerved him a long time.</p>

                        <p>KNowledge is withoutall contradiction, a mo≈øt profitable and chiefe ornament: Tho≈øe who de≈øpi≈øe it declare evidently their ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe: Yet doe not Ivalue it at ≈øo exce≈ø≈øive a rate, as ≈øome have done; namely <hi>Herillus</hi> the Philo≈øopher, who grounded his chiefe felicity vpon it, and held that it lay in hir power to make vs content and wi≈øe: which I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, nor that which others have ≈øaid, that <hi>Knowledge is the mother of all vertue,</hi> and that all <hi>vice proceedeth of ignorance.</hi> Which if it be, it is ≈øubject to a large interpretation. My hou≈øe hath long ≈øince ever ≈øtood open to men of vnder≈øtanding, and is very well knowne to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: for, my father, who commanded the ≈øame fifty yeeres and vpward, ≈øet on fire by that new kind of earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe, wherewith King <hi>Francis</hi> the fir≈øt embraced Letters, and rai≈øed them vnto credite, did with great diligence, and much co≈øt, endevour to purcha≈øe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of learned men: receiving and entertaining them as holy per≈øons, and who had ≈øome particular in≈øpiration of divine wi≈øedome; collecting their ≈øentences and di≈øcour≈øes, as if they had beene Oracles; and with ≈øo much more reverence and religious regard, by how much le≈ø≈øe authority he had to judge of them: for, he had no knowledge of Letters, no more than his predece≈ø≈øors before him. As for me, I love them indeed, but yet I wor≈øhip them not. Among≈øt others, <hi>Peter Bunel</hi> (a man in his time, by rea≈øon of his learning, of high e≈øteeme) having ≈øo journed a few daies at <hi>Montagne</hi> with my father, and others of his coate, being ready to depart thence, pre≈øented him with a booke entituled <hi>Theologia naturalis; five liber creatur arum magistri Raimondi de Scbonda.</hi> And for ≈øomuch as the Italian and Spani≈øh tongues were very familiar vnto him, and that the booke was written in a kind of latinized Spani≈øh, whereof diver≈øe words had Latine terminations; he hoped, that with little aide, he might reape no ≈ømall profite by it, and commended the ≈øame very much vnto him, as a booke mo≈øt profitable, and fitting the daies in which he gave it him. It was even at what time the new-fangles of <hi>Luther</hi> began to creepe in favour, and in many places to ≈øhake the foundation of our ancient beliefe. Wherein he ≈øeemed to be well advi≈øed, as he who by di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of rea≈øon fore-≈øaw, that this budding di≈øea≈øe would ea≈øily turne to an execrable Athei≈øme: For, the vulgar wanting the faculty to judge of things by them≈øelves, ≈øuffering it ≈øelfe to be carried away by fortune, and led-on by outward apparances, if once it be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with the boldne≈ø≈øe to de≈øpi≈øe, and malapertne≈ø≈øe to impugne the opinions, which to fore it held in awefull reverence (as are tho≈øe wherein con≈øi≈øteth their ≈øalvation) and that ≈øome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their religion be made doubtfull and que≈øtionable, they will ≈øoone and ea≈øily admit an equall vncertainty in all other parts of their beliefe, as they that had no other grounded authority or foundation, but ≈øuch as are now ≈øhaken and weakned, and immediately reject (as a tyrannicall yoke) all impre≈ø≈øions, they had in former times received by the authority of Lawes, or reverence of ancient cu≈øtome,</p>

My father, a few-daies before his death, lighting by chance vpon this booke, which before he had neglected, among≈øt other writings commanded mee to tran≈ølate the ≈øame into French. It is ea≈øie to tran≈ølate ≈øuch authors, where nothing but the matter is to be repre≈øented; but hard and dangerous, to vndertake ≈øuch as have added much to the grace and elegancy of the language, namely to reduce them into a weaker and poorer tongue. It was a ≈øtrange taske, and new occupation for mee: but by fortune beeing then at lei≈øure, and vnable to gaine≈øay the commandement of the be≈øt father that ever was; I came ere long (as well as I could) to an end of it: wherein he tooke ≈øingular delight, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ≈øame to be printed, which accordingly was after his decea≈øe performed. I found the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12117:127"/>
conceits of the author to be excellent, the contexture of his worke well followed, and his project full of pietie. Now fora≈ømuh as diver≈øe ammu≈øe them≈øelves to reade-it, and e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Ladies, to whom we owe mo≈øt ≈øervice, it hath often beene my hap to help them, when they were reading it, to di≈øcharge the booke of two principall objections, which are brought again≈øt the ≈øame. His drift is bold, and his ≈øcope adventurous; for he vndertaketh by humane and naturall rea≈øons, to e≈øtabli≈øh and verifie all the articles of Chri≈øtian religion again≈øt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thei≈øts. Wherein (to ≈øay truth) I find him ≈øo re≈øolute and ≈øo happy, as I deeme it a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible to doe better in that argument, and thinke that none equalleth him. Which booke ≈øeeming to me both over-rich and exqui≈øite, being written by an aucthor, who≈øe name is ≈øo little knowne, and of whom. all we know, is, that he was a Spaniard, who about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres ≈øince profe≈ø≈øed Phi≈øicke in <hi>Thoulou≈øe.</hi> I demanded once of <hi>Adrianus Turnebue</hi> (a man who knew all things) what ≈øuch a booke might be, who an≈øwered, that he deemed the ≈øame to be ≈øome Quinte≈ø≈øence extracted from out Saint <hi>Thomas Aquinas:</hi> For, in good truth, onely ≈øuch a ≈øpirit fraught with ≈øo infinite erudition, and ≈øo full of admirable ≈øubtilitie, was capable of ≈øuch and ≈øo rare imaginations. So it is, that who≈øoever be the authour or devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer of it (the title whereof ought not without further rea≈øon to be taken from <hi>Sebond</hi>) he was a very ≈øufficient-worthie man, and endowed with ≈øundry other excellent qualities. The fir≈øt thing he is reproved for in his Booke, is, that <hi>Chri≈øtians wrong them≈øelves much, in that</hi>

                           <hi>they ground their beliefe vpon humane rea≈øons, which is conceived but by faith, and by a particular in≈øpiration of God.</hi> Which objection ≈øeemeth to containe ≈øome zeale of pietie; by rea≈øon whereof we ought with ≈øo much more mildnes and regarde, endevour to ≈øatisfie them that propo≈øe it. It were a charge, more befitting a man conver≈øant, and ≈øutable to one acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the holy Scriptures, than me, who am altogether ignorant in them. Neverthele≈ø≈øe I thinke, that even as to a matter ≈øo divine and high and ≈øo much exceeding al humane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, as is this Verity, wherewith it hath plea≈øed the goodne≈ø≈øe of God to enlighten vs, it is mo≈øt requi≈øite, that he affoord and lend vs his helpe. And that, with an extraordinary and priviledged favour, that ≈øo we may the better conceive and entertaine the ≈øame: For, I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that meanes meerely humane can no way be capable of it; which if they were; ≈øo many rare and excellent mindes, and ≈øo plenteou≈øly ≈øtored with naturall faculties, as have beene in times pa≈øt, would never by their di≈øcour≈øe, have mi≈øt the attayning of this knowledge. <hi>It is faith onely, which lively and a≈ø≈øiuredly embraceth the high mysteries of our Religion.</hi> And no man can doubt, but that it is a mo≈øt excellent and commendable enterpri≈øe, properly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and fit to the ≈øervice of our faith, the natural helpes and humane implements which God hath be≈øtowed vpon vs. And no que≈øtion is to be made, but that it is the mo≈øt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable employment we can put them vnto; and that there is no occupation or intent more worthy a good Chri≈øtian, than by all meanes, ≈øtudies and imaginations, carefully to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, how to embelli≈øh, amplifie and extend the trueth of his beliefe and religion. <hi>It is not enough for vs to ≈øerve God in ≈øpirit and ≈øoule,</hi> we owe him be≈øides, and wee yeelde vnto him a corporall wor≈øhiping; we applie our limmes, our motions, and all externall things, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. The like ought to be done, and we ≈øhould accompany our faith with all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon we po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe: Yet alwayes with this provi≈øo, that we thinke it doth not depend of-vs, and that all our ≈øtrength and arguments can never attaine to ≈øo ≈øupernaturall and divine a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Except it ≈øeize vpon vs, and as it were enter into vs by an extraordinarie infu≈øion: And vnle≈ø≈øe it al≈øo enter into vs, not onely by di≈øcour≈øe, but al≈øo by humane meanes, ≈øhe is not in her dignitie, nor in her glorie. And verely I feare therfore, that except this waie, we ≈øhould not enjoy-it. Had we fa≈øt-holde on God, by the enterpo≈øition of a lively faith; had we hold-fa≈øt on God by him≈øelfe, and not by vs; had we a divine foundation, then ≈øhould not humane and worldly occa≈øions have the power ≈øo to ≈øhake and totter-vs, as they have. Our hold would not then yeeld to ≈øo weake a batterie: The love of noveltie; the con≈øtraint of Princes; the good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of one partie; the ra≈øh and ca≈øuall changing of our opinions, ≈øhould not then have the power to ≈øhake and alter our beliefe. We ≈øhould not ≈øuffer the ≈øame to be trouble at the will and plea≈øure of a new argument, and at the per≈øwa≈øion, no, not of all the rhetorike that ever was: we ≈øhould with≈øtand the≈øe boi≈øtrous billowes with an inflexible and vnmoveable con≈øtancie:</p>

It is through the vanity of the ≈øame imagination, that he dare equall him≈øelfe to God, that he a≈øcribeth divine conditions vnto him≈øelfe, that he ≈øelecteth and ≈øeparateth him≈øelfe from out the ranke of other creatures; to which his fellow-brethren and compeers, he cuts out and ≈øhareth their parts, and allotteth them what portions of meanes or forces he thinkes good. How knoweth he by the vertue of his vnder≈øtanding the inward and ≈øecret motions of bea≈øts? By what compari≈øon from them to vs doth he conclude the bruti≈øhne≈ø≈øe, he a≈øcribeth vnto them? When I am playing with my Cat, who knowes whether ≈øhe have more ≈øport in dallying with me, then I have in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with hir? We entertaine one another with mutuall api≈øh trickes, If I have my houre to begin or to refu≈øe, ≈øo hath ≈øhe hirs. <hi>Plato</hi> in ≈øetting forth the golden age vnder <hi>Saturne,</hi> among≈øt the chiefe advantages that man had then, reporteth the communication he had with bea≈øts, of whom enquiring and taking in≈øtruction, he knew the true qualities, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of every one of them: by, and from whom he got an ab≈øolute vnder≈øtanding and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wi≈øedome, whereby he led a happier life, then we can doe.

For, we vnder≈øtand them no more then they vs. By the ≈øame rea≈øon, may they as well e≈øteeme vs bea≈øts, as we them. It is no great marvell if we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand them not: no more doe we the corni≈øh, the Welch, or Iri≈øh. Yet have ≈øome boa≈øted that they vnder≈øtood them, as <hi>Apollonius Thyaneus, Melampus, Tire≈øias, Thales</hi> and others. And if it be (as Co≈ømographers report) that there are Nations, who receive and admit a Dogge to be their King, it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily follow, that they give a certaine interpretation to his voice and moving. We mu≈øt note the parity that is betweene vs. We have ≈øome meane vnder≈øtanding of their ≈øen≈øes, ≈øo have bea≈øts of ours, about the ≈øame mea≈øure. They flatter and faune vpon vs, they threat, and entreate vs, ≈øo doe we them. Touching other matters, we manife≈øtly perceive, that there is a full and perfect communication among≈øt them, and that not onely tho≈øe of one ≈øame kinde vnder≈øtand one another, but even ≈øuch as are of different kindes</p>

In the great ≈øhewes of <hi>Rome,</hi> Elephants were ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ≈øeene, taught to moove and dance at the ≈øound of a voice, certaine dances, wherein were many ≈øtrange ≈øhifts, enter-changes, caprings, and cadences, very hard to be learned.

But the tale of the Piot is very ≈øtrange, which <hi>Plutarke</hi> confidently witne≈ø≈øeth to have ≈øeene: This Iay was in a Barbers ≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was admirable in counterfaiting with hir voice what≈øoever ≈øhe heard: It fortuned one day, that certaine Trumpeters ≈øtaied before this ≈øhop, and there ≈øounded a good while; and being gone, all that day, and the next after, the Piot began to be very ≈øad, ≈øilent, and melancholy, whereat all men marvelled, and ≈øurmized that the noi≈øe or clang of the Trumpets had thus affrighted and dizzied hir, and that with hir hearing ≈øhe had al≈øo lo≈øt hir voice. But at la≈øt they found, ≈øhe was but in a deepe ≈øtudy, and dumpi≈øh retracting into hir ≈øelfe, exerci≈øing hir minde, and preparing hir voice, to repre≈øent the ≈øound, and expre≈ø≈øe the noi≈øe of the Trumpets ≈øhe had heard: And the fir≈øt voice ≈øhe vttered was that, wherein ≈øhe perfectly expre≈ø≈øed their ≈øtraines, their clo≈øes, and their changes: having by hir new Prenti≈øhip altogether quit, and as it were, ≈øcorned what ever ≈øhee could prattle before. I will not omit to alleadge another example of a Dogge, which <hi>Plutarke</hi> al≈øo ≈øaith to have ≈øeene (as for any order or methode, I know very well I doe but confound it, which I ob≈øerve no more in ranging the≈øe examples, than I doe in all the re≈øt of my bu≈øine≈ø≈øe) who being in a ≈øhip, noted that this Dogge was in great perplexity how to get ≈øome Oyle out of a deepe Pitcher, which by rea≈øon of it's narrow mouth, he could not reach with his tongue, got him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently ≈øome Pibble-≈øtones, and put ≈øo many into the Iarre, that he made the Oyle come vp ≈øo neare the brimme, as he could ea≈øily reach and licke ≈øome. And what is that but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a very ≈øubtill ≈øpirit? It is reported, that the Ravens of <hi>Barbary</hi> will doe the like, when the water they would drinke is too low. This action doth ≈øomewhat re≈øemble that, which <hi>Iuba</hi> a King of that Nation relateth of their Elephants; that when through the wiles of tho≈øe who cha≈øe them, any one chanceth to fall into certaine deepe pittes, which they prepare for them, and to deceive them, they cover over with reedes, ≈øhrubs, and boughes, his fellowes will ≈øpeedily with all diligence bring great ≈øtore of ≈øtones and peeces of timber, that ≈øo they may helpe to recover him out againe. But this bea≈øt hath in many other effects, ≈øuch affinity with mans ≈øufficiency, that would I particularly trace out what experience hath taught, I ≈øhould ea≈øily get an affirmation of what I ≈øo ordinarily maintaine, which is, that there is more difference found betweene ≈øuch and ≈øuch a man, than betweene ≈øuch a bea≈øt and ≈øuch a man. An Elephants keeper in a private hou≈øe of <hi>Syria,</hi> was wont every meale

to ≈øteale away halfe of the allowance which was alotted him; it fortuned on a day, his ma≈øter would needes feede him him≈øelfe, and having poured that ju≈øt mea≈øure of barly, which for his allowance hee had pre≈øcribed him, into his manger: the Elephant ≈øternely eying his ma≈øter, with his truncke divided the provender in two equall partes, and laide the one a ≈øide, by which he declared the wrong his keeper did him.

He ≈øaw (as him≈øelfe reporteth) a company of Emmets goe from their ne≈øt, bearing among≈øt them the body of a dead Ant, toward another Emmets ne≈øt, from which many other Ants came, as it were to meete them by the way to parly with them, who after they had continued together a while, they which came la≈øt, returned backe, to con≈øult (as you may imagine) with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, and becau≈øe they could hardly come to any capitulation; they made two or three voyages to and fro: In the end, the la≈øt come, brought vnto the other a worme from their habitation, as for a ran≈øome of the dead, which worme the fir≈øt company tooke vpon their backes, and carried it home, leaving the dead body vnto the other. Loe heere the interpretation that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> gave it: Witne≈ø≈øing thereby, that tho≈øe creatures which have no voice at all, have neverthele≈ø≈øe mutual commerce, and enterchangeable communication, whereof if we be not partakers, it is onely our fault; and therfore doe we fondly to cen≈øure it. And they yet produce divers other effects, farre ≈øurpa≈ø≈øing our capacity, and ≈øo farre out of the reach of our imitation, that even our thoughts are vnable to conceive them. Many hold opinion, that in the la≈øt and famous ≈øea-fight, which <hi>Antonie</hi> lo≈øt again≈øt <hi>Augu≈øtus,</hi> his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall-gally was in hir cour≈øe ≈øtaied by that little fi≈øh, the Latines call <hi>Remora,</hi> and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh a Sucke-≈øtone, who≈øe property is, to ≈øtay any ≈øhip he can fa≈øten him≈øelfe vnto.

A certaine Citizen of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> whilom purcha≈øed vnto him≈øelfe the reputation to be an excellent Mathematitian, becau≈øe he had learn't the quality of the Hedge-hogge, who≈øe property is to build his hole or denne, open diver≈øe waies, and toward ≈øeverall windes, and fore-≈øeeing ri≈øing ≈øtormes, he pre≈øently ≈øtoppeth the holes that way; which thing the fore≈øaid Citizen heedfully ob≈øerving, would in the City foretell any future ≈øtorme, and what winde ≈øhould blow.

In the Camelion it is a change proceeding of pa≈ø≈øion, but in the Pourcontrell a change in action; we our ≈øelves doe often change our colour, and altar our countenance, through ≈øudden feare, choler, ≈øhame, and ≈øuch like violent pa≈ø≈øions, which are wont to alter the hew of our faces: but it is by the effect of ≈øufferance, as in the Cameleon.

And the judges in acknowledgement of the Dogges good office, at the Cities charge appointed him for his ≈øu≈øtenance a certaine daily mea≈øure of Corne, and enjoyned the Prie≈øts of the Temple, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to looke vnto him. <hi>Plutarke</hi> affirmeth this ≈øtorie to be mo≈øt true, and to have hapned in his time. Touching gratitude and thankfulne≈ø≈øe, (for me thinks we have need to further this word greatly) this onely example ≈øhall ≈øuffice, of which <hi>Appion</hi> reporteth to have been a≈øpectator him≈øelfe. One day (≈øaith he) that the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> (to plea≈øe and recreate the common people) cau≈øed a great number of wilde bea≈øts to be baited, namely huge great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it ≈øo fortuned, that there was one among≈øt the re≈øt, who by rea≈øon of his furious and ≈øtately carriage, of his vnmatched ≈øtrength, of his great limmes, and of his loude, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror-cau≈øing roaring, drew all by-≈øtanders eyes to gaze vpon him. Among≈øt other ≈ølaves, that in ≈øight of all the people were pre≈øented to encounter with the≈øe bea≈øts, there chanced to be one <hi>Androdus of Dacia,</hi> who belonged vnto a Roman Lord, who had been Con≈øull. This huge Lion, having eyed him a far off, fir≈øt made a ≈øuddaine ≈øtop, as ≈øtrucken into a kind of admiration, then with a milde and gentle countenance, as if he would willingly have taken acquaintance of him, faire and ≈øoftly approached vnto him: Which done, and re≈øting, a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he was the man he tooke him for, begun fawningly to wagge his taile, as dogges doe that fawne vpon their new-≈øound ma≈øters, and licke the poore and mi≈øerable ≈ølaves hands and thighes, who through feare was almo≈øt out of his wits and halfe dead. <hi>Androdus</hi> at la≈øt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hart of grace; and by rea≈øon of the Lions mildene≈ø≈øe having rouzed vp his ≈øpirits, and wi≈øhly fixing his eies vpon him, to ≈øee whether he could call him to remembrance; it was to all beholders a ≈øingular plea≈øure to ob≈øerve the love, the joy, and blandi≈øhments, ech endevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter-≈øhew one another. Whereat the people rai≈øing a loud crie, and by their ≈øhouting and clapping of hands ≈øeeming to be much plea≈øed; the Emperour willed the ≈ølave to be brought before him, as de≈øirous to vnder≈øtand of him the cau≈øe of ≈øo ≈øtrange and ≈øeld-≈øeene an accident: Who related this new, and wonderfull ≈øtorie vnto him.</p>
                        <p>My ma≈øter (≈øaid he) being Procon≈øull in <hi>Affrica,</hi> for≈øomuch as he cau≈øed me every day to be mo≈øt cruelly beaten, and held me in ≈øo rigorous bondage, I was con≈øtrained, as being wearie of my life, to run away: And ≈øafely to ≈øcape from ≈øo eminent a per≈øon, and who had ≈øo great authoritie in the Countrie, I thought it be≈øt to get me into the de≈øert, and mo≈øt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented wilderne≈ø≈øes of that region, with a full re≈øolution, if I could not compa≈ø≈øe the meanes to ≈øu≈øtaine my ≈øelfe, to finde one way or other, with violence to make my ≈øelfe away. One day, the Sunne about noone-tide being extreamly hote, and the ≈øcorching heat thereof intollerable, I fortuned to come vnto a wilde vnhanted cave, hidden among≈øt crags, and almo≈øt inacce≈ø≈øible, and where I imagined no footing had ever been; therein I hid my ≈øelfe: I had not long been there, but in comes this Lion, with one of his pawes ≈øore hurt, and bloody-goared, wailing for the ≈ømart, and groaning for the paine he felt; at who≈øe arrivall, I was much di≈ømaide, but he ≈øeeing me lie clo≈øe-cowring in a corner of his den, gently made his approaches vnto me, holding forth his goared paw toward me, and ≈øeemed with ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame humbly to ≈øue, and ≈øuppliantly to beg for help at my hands. I, moved with ruth, taking it into my hand, pulled out a great ≈øplint, which was gotten into-it, and ≈øhaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off all feare, fir≈øt I wrung and cru≈øht his ≈øore, and cau≈øed the filth and matter, which therein was gathered, to come forth; then, as gently as for my hart I could, I clean≈øed, wiped, and dried the ≈øame. He feeling ≈øome ea≈øe in his griefe, and his paine to cea≈øe, ≈øtill holding his foote betweene my hands, began to ≈øleep and take ≈øome re≈øt. Thence forward he and I lived

together, the full ≈øpace of three years in his den, with ≈øuch meat as he ≈øhifted-for: For, what bea≈øts he killed, or what prey ≈øoever he tooke, he ever brought home the better part, and ≈øhared-it with me, which for want of fire, I ro≈øted in the Sunne, and therewith nouri≈øhed my ≈øelfe all that while. But at la≈øt wearied with this kinde of bruti≈øh life, the Lion being one day gone to purcha≈øe his wonted pray, I left the place, hoping to mend my fortunes, and having wandred vp and downe three dayes, I was at la≈øt taken by certaine Souldiers, which from <hi>Africa</hi> brought me into this Citie to my Ma≈øter againe, who immediately condemned me to death, and to be devoured by wilde bea≈øts. And as I now perceive, the ≈øame Lion was al≈øo ≈øhortly after taken, who as you ≈øee hath now required me of the good turne I did him, and the health which by my meanes he recoved. Behold heer the hi≈øtorie, <hi>Androdus</hi> reported vnto the Emperour, which after he cau≈øed to be declared vnto all the people, at who≈øe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reque≈øt, he was forthwith ≈øet at libertie, and quit of his puni≈øhment, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon con≈øent of all, had the Lion be≈øtowed vpon him. <hi>Appion</hi> ≈øaith further, that <hi>Androdus</hi> was daily ≈øeen to leade the Lion vp and downe the ≈øtreets of <hi>Rome,</hi> tied onely with a little twine, and walking from taverne to taverne, received ≈øuch money as was given him, who would gently ≈øuffer him≈øelfe to be handled, touched, decked, and ≈øtrowed with flowers, all over and over, many ≈øaying when they met him: yonder is the Lion that is the mans ho≈øte, and yonder is the man that is the Lions Phi≈øitian.

Concerning particular offices, which we for the benefit of our life, draw one from an other, many like examples are found among≈øt them. It is a≈ø≈øuredly beleeved, that the Whale never ≈øwimmeth, vnle≈ø≈øe ≈øhe have a little fi≈øh going before her, as her vantgard, it is in ≈øhape like a Gudgeon, and both the Latines and we, call it the Whales-guide; for, ≈øhe doth ever follow him, ≈øuffering her ≈øelfe, as ea≈øily to be led and turned by him, as a ≈øhip is directed and turned by a ≈øterne: for requitall of which good turne, whereas all things el≈øe, be it, bea≈øt, fi≈øh, or ve≈ø≈øell, that comes within the horrible <hi>Chaes</hi> of this mon≈øtrous mouth, is pre≈øently lo≈øt and devoured, this little fi≈øh, doth ≈øafely retire him≈øelfe therein, and there ≈øleepes verie quietly, and as long as he ≈øleepes, the Whale never ≈øtirs; but a≈ø≈øoone as he awaketh and goeth his way, whereever he takes his cour≈øe ≈øhe alwaies followeth him, and if ≈øhe fortune to loo≈øe him, ≈øhe wanders here and there, and often ≈øtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the rocks, as a ≈øhip that hath nor ma≈øt nor rudder.

In the maner of the Tunnies life, may be di≈øcovered a ≈øingular knowledge of the three parts of the Mathematikes. Fir≈øt for A≈øtrologie, it may well be ≈øaid that man doth learne it of them: For, where≈øoever the winter Sol≈øtitium doth take them, there do they ≈øtay them≈øelves, and never ≈øtir till the next Aequinoctium, and that is the rea≈øon why <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth ≈øo willingly a≈øcribe that arte vnto them: Then for Geometrie and Arithmetike, they alwaies frame their ≈øhole of a Cubike figure, every way ≈øquare: and ≈øo forme a ≈øolide, clo≈øe and wel-ranged bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailon, encompa≈ø≈øed round about of ≈øixe equall ≈øides. Thus orderly mar≈øhaled, they take their cour≈øe and ≈øwim whither their journey tends, as broad and wide behind as before: So that he that ≈øeeth and telleth but one ranke, may ea≈øily number all the troope, for≈øomuch as the number of the depth is equall vnto the bredth, and the bredth vnto the length. Touching magnanimitie and haughtie courage, it is hard to ≈øet it forth more lively, and to produce a rarer patterne, then that of the Dog, which from <hi>India</hi> was ≈øent vnto <hi>Alexander:</hi> to whom was fir≈øt pre≈øented a Stag, then a wilde Boare, and then a Beare, with each of which he ≈øhould have foughten, but he ≈øeemed to make no accompt of them, and would not ≈øo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove out of his place for them, but when he ≈øaw a Lion, he pre≈øently rouzed him≈øelfe, ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently he meant onely ≈øo noble a bea≈øt worthie to enter combate with him. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning repentance and acknowledging of faults committed, it is reported, that an Elephant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through rage of choller ≈ølaine his governour, conceived ≈øuch an extreame inward griefe, that he would never afterward touch any food, and ≈øuffered him≈øelf to pine to death. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clemencie, it is reported of a Tiger, (the fierce≈øt and mo≈øt inhumane bea≈øt of all) who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Kid given her to feed vpon, endured the force of gnawing hunger, two daies together, rather then ≈øhe would hurt him; the third day with maine ≈øtrength ≈øhe brake the cage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ≈øhe was kept-pent, and went el≈øewhere to ≈øhift for feeding; as one vnwilling to ≈øeize vpon the ≈øeelie Kid her familiar and gue≈øt.

Of the three actions or faculties of the ≈øoule, that is to ≈øay, he imaginative, the concupi≈øciple, and the con≈øenting, they allow and conceive the two former; the la≈øt, they hold and defend to be ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one or other ≈øide, be it never ≈øo light, <hi>Zeno</hi> in je≈øture painted forth his imagination vpon this divi≈øion of the ≈øoules faculties: the open and out-≈øtretched hand was apparance; the hand halfe-≈øhutte, and fingers ≈øomewhat bending, con≈øent: the fi≈øt clo≈øe, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion: if the fi≈øt of the left-hand were clo≈øely clinched together, it ≈øignified Science.

And therefore is he very carefull in his lawes that nothing bee ≈øung in publike but Poe≈øies; the fabulous fictions of which tend to ≈øome profitable end: being ≈øo apt to imprint all manner of illu≈øion in mans minde, that it is inju≈øtice not to feede them rather with commodious lies, then with lies either vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or damageable, He flatly ≈øaith in his Common-wealth, that for the benefit of men, it is often nece≈ø≈øarie to deceive them. It is ea≈øie to di≈øtingui≈øh, how ≈øome Sects have rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed truth, and ≈øome profit; by which the latter have gained credit. It is the mi≈øerie of our condition, that often, what offers it ≈øelfe vnto onr imagination for the likely e≈øt: pre≈øents not it ≈øelfe vnto it for the mo≈øt beneficiall vnto our life. The bolde≈øt ≈øects, both <hi>Epicurian, Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhonian</hi> and new <hi>Academike,</hi> when they have ca≈øt their acoumpt, are compelled to ≈øtoope to the civill law. There are other ≈øubjects, which they have to≈ø≈øed, ≈øome on the left and ≈øome on the right hand, each one labouring and ≈øtriving to give it ≈øome ≈øemblance, were it right or wrong: For, having found nothing ≈øo ≈øecret, whereof they have not attempted to ≈øpeake, they are many times forced to forge divers feeble and fond conjectures: Not that them≈øelves tooke them for a ground-worke, nor to e≈øtabli≈øh a truth, but for an exerci≈øe of their ≈øtudie. <hi>Non tam id ≈øen≈øi≈ø≈øe, quod dicerent, qu√†m exercere ingenia materiae difficultate videntur volui≈ø≈øe. They ≈øeeme not ≈øo much to have thought as they ≈øaid, as rather willing to exerci≈øe their wits in the difficulty of the matter.</hi> And if it were not ≈øo taken, how ≈øhould we cloke ≈øo great an incon≈øtancie, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and vanity of opinions, which we ≈øee to have beene produced by the≈øe excellent and admirable ≈øpirits? As for example, <hi>What greater vanitie can there be, then to goe about by our proportions and coniectures to gue≈ø≈øe at God? And to governe both him and the world according to our capacitie and lawes?</hi> And to v≈øe this ≈ømall ≈øcantlin of ≈øufficiencie, which he hath plea≈øed to impart vnto our naturall condition, at the co≈øt and charges of divinitie? And becau≈øe we cannot extend our ≈øight ≈øo farre as his glorious throne, to haue removed him downe to our corruption and mi≈øeries? Of all-humane and ancient opinions concerning religion, I thinke that to have had more likelyhood and excu≈øe, which knowledged and confe≈ø≈øed God to be an incomprehen≈øible power, chiefe beginning and pre≈øerver of all things; all goodnes, all perfection; accepting in good part the honour and reverence which mortall men did yeeld him, vnder what v≈øage, name and manner ≈øoever it was.</p>

If one were he ≈øhould either be in another, or in him≈øelfe: if he be in another, then are they two: If he be in him≈øelfe, they are al≈øo two, the comprizing and the comprized. According to the≈øe rules or doctrines, the Nature of things is but a fal≈øe or vaine ≈øhadow. I have ever thought, this manner of ≈øpeech in a Chri≈øtian, is full of indi≈øcretion and irreverence; God cannot die, God cannot gaine-≈øay him≈øelfe, God cannot doe this or that. I cannot allow, a man ≈øhould ≈øo bound Gods heavenly power vnder the Lawes of our word. And that apparance, which in the≈øe propo≈øitions offers it ≈øelfe vnto vs, ought to be repre≈øented more reverently and more religiou≈øly. Our ≈øpeech hath his infirmities and defects, as all things el≈øe have. Mo≈øt of the occa≈øions of this worlds troubles are Grammaticall. Our ≈øutes and proce≈ø≈øes proceed but from the canva≈øing and debating the interpretation of the Lawes, and mo≈øt of our warres from the want of knowledge in State-coun≈øellors, that could not cleerely di≈øtingui≈øh and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expre≈ø≈øe the Covenants, and Conditions of accords, betweene Prince and Prince. How many weighty ≈øtrifes, and important quarrels, bath the doubt of this one ≈øilable, <hi>Hoc,</hi> brought forth in the world? examine the plaine≈øt ≈øentence, that Logike it ≈øelfe can pre≈øent vnto vs. If you ≈øay, it is faire Weather, and in ≈øo ≈øaying, ≈øay true; it is faire Weather then. Is not thie a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme of ≈øpeech? Yet will it deceive vs: That it is ≈øo; Let vs follow the example: If you ≈øay, I lie, and that you ≈øhould ≈øay true, you lie then. The Arte, the rea≈øon, the force of the conclu≈øion of this la≈øt, are like vnto the other; notwith≈øtanding we are entangled. I ≈øee the Pyrhonian Phylo≈øophers, who can by no manner of ≈øpeech expre≈ø≈øe their General conceit: for, they had neede of a new language. Ours is altogether compo≈øed of affirmative propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are directly again≈øt them. So that, when they ≈øay, I doubt, you have them fa≈øt by the throte to make them a vow, that at lea≈øt you are a≈ø≈øured and know, that they doubt. So have they been compelled to ≈øave them≈øelves by this compari≈øon of Phy≈øicke, without which their conceite would be inexplicable and intricate. When they pronounce, I know not, or I doubt, they ≈øay, that this propo≈øition tran≈øportes it ≈øelfe together with the re≈øt, even as the Rewbarbe doeth, which ≈øcowred ill humours away, and therewith is carryed away him≈øelfe. This conceipt is more certainly conceived by an interrogation: What can I tell? As I beare it in an Impre≈øe of a paire of ballances. Note how ≈øome prevaile with this kinde of vnreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and vnhallowed ≈øpeach. In the di≈øputation, that are now-adayes in our religion, if you overmuch vrge the adver≈øaries, they will roundly tell you, that it lieth not in the power of God to make his body at once to be in Paradi≈øe and on earth, and in many other places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And how that ancient skoffer made profitable v≈øe of it. Atlea≈øt (≈øaith he) it is no ≈ømall comfort vnto man, to ≈øee that God cannot doe all things; for he cannot kill him≈øelfe if he would, which is the greate≈øt benefite we have in our condition; he cannot make mortall men immortall, nor rai≈øe the dead to life againe, nor make him that hath lived, never to have lived, and him, who hath had honours, not to have had them, having no other right over what is pa≈øt, but of ≈øorgetfulne≈ø≈øe. And that this ≈øociety betweene God and Man; may al≈øo be combined with ≈øome plea≈øant examples, he cannot make twi≈øe ten not to be twenty. See what he ≈øaith and which a Chri≈øtian ought to abhor, that ever ≈øuch and ≈øo profane words ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe his mouth: Whereas on the contrary part, it ≈øeemeth that fond men endevour to finde out this fooli≈øh-boldne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpeech, that ≈øo they may turne and winde God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to their mea≈øure.</p>

The preiudice fore≈øtaled in our mindes is ≈øo framed, as the forme of man comes to mans mind, when he is thinking of God.</hi> Therefore <hi>Xenophanes</hi> ≈øaid plea≈øantly, that if bea≈øts frame any Gods vnto them≈øelves, (as likely it is they doe) they ≈øurely frame them like vnto them≈øeves, and glorifie them≈øelves as we doe. For, why may not a Goo≈øe ≈øay thus? All parts of the world behold me, the earth ≈øerveth me to tread vpon, the Sunne to give me light, the ≈øtarres to in≈øpire we with influence: this commoditie I have of the windes, and this benefit of the waters; there is nothing that this worlds-vaulte doth ≈øo favorably looke vpon, as me ≈øelfe; I am the favorite of nature: Is it not man that careth for me, that keepeth me, lodgeth me, and ≈øerveth me? For me it is he ≈øoweth, reapeth and grindeth: If he eate me, ≈øo doth man feede on his fellow, and ≈øo doe I on the wormes, that con≈øume and eate him. As much might a Crane ≈øay, yea and more boldly, by rea≈øon of hir flights-libertie, and the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this goodly and high-bownding region. <hi>Tam blanda conciliatrix, &amp; tam ≈øui e≈øt</hi>

Tho≈øe that argue by pre≈øuppo≈øition, we mu≈øt pre≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe again≈øt them, the verie ≈øame axiome, which is di≈øputed of. For, each humane pre≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, and every invention, vnle≈ø≈øe rea≈øon make a difference of it, hath as much authoritie as another. So mu≈øt they all be equally balanced, and fir≈øt the generall &amp; tho≈øe that tyrannize vs. <hi>A per≈øwa≈øion of certaintie, is a manife≈øt te≈øtimonie of fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe, and of extreame vncertaintie.</hi> And no people are le≈ø≈øe Philo≈øophers and more fooli≈øh, then <hi>Platoes</hi> Phylodoxes, or lovers of their owne opinions. We mu≈øt know whether fire be hote, whether ≈ønow be white, whether in our knowledge there be any thing hard or ≈øoft. And touching the an≈øweres, whereof they tell old tales, as to him who made a doubt of heat, to whom one replied, that to trie he ≈øhould ca≈øt him≈øelfe into the fire; to him that denied the yce to be cold, that he ≈øhould put ≈øome in his bo≈øome; they are mo≈øt vnworthie the profe≈ø≈øion of a Philo≈øopher. If they had left vs in our owne naturall e≈øtate, admitting of ≈øtrange apparances, as they pre≈øent them≈øelves vnto vs by our ≈øen≈øes, and had ≈øuffred vs to follow our naturall appetites, directed by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our birth, they ≈øhould then have rea≈øon to ≈øpeake ≈øo. But from them it is that we have learn't to become judges of the world; it is from them we hold this conceit, that mans rea≈øon is the generall controuller of all that is, both without and within heavens-vault; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all, and can doe all, by meanes whereof, all things are knowne and di≈øcerned. This an≈øwere were good among the Canibals, who without any of <hi>Aristotles</hi> precepts, or ≈øo much as knowing the name of naturall Philo≈øophie, enjoy mo≈øt happily, a long, a quiet, &amp; a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life. This an≈øwere might happily availe more, and be of more force, then all tho≈øe they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:12117:158"/>
can borrow from their rea≈øon and invention. All living creatures, yea, bea≈øts and all, where the commaundement of the naturall law is yet pure and ≈øimple, might with vs be capable of this an≈øwere; but they have renounced it. They ≈øhall not need to tell me, it is true, for you both heare and ≈øee, that it is ≈øo: They mu≈øt tell me, if what I thinke I feel, I feel the ≈øame in effect; and if I feel it, then let them tell me, wherefore I feel it, and how and what: Let them tell me the name, the beginning, the tennons, and the abuttings of heat and of cold, with the qualities of him that is agent, or of the patient; or let them quit me their profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, which is neither to admit, nor approve any thing, but by the way of rea≈øon: It is their touch ≈øtone, to trie all kinds of E≈ø≈øayes. But ≈øurely it is a touch≈øtone full of fal≈øehood, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, imperfection and weakne≈ø≈øe: which way can we better make triall of it, then by it ≈øelfe? If ≈øhe may not be credited ≈øpeaking of hir ≈øelfe, hardly can ≈øhe be fit to judge of ≈øtrange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: If ≈øhe know any thing, it can be but hir being and domicile. She is in the ≈øoule, and either a part or effect of the ≈øame. For, the true and e≈ø≈øentiall rea≈øon (who≈øe name we ≈øteal by fal≈øe ≈øignes) lodgeth in Gods bo≈øome: There is hir home, and there is hir retreat, thence ≈øhe takes hir flght, when Gods plea≈øure is that we ≈øhall ≈øee ≈øome glimps of it: Even as <hi>Pallas</hi> i≈ø≈øued out of hir fathers head, to communicate and empart hir ≈øelfe vnto the world. Now let vs ≈øee what mans rea≈øon hath taught vs of hir ≈øelfe and of the ≈øoule: Not of the ≈øoule in generall, whereof well nigh all Philo≈øophie maketh both the cele≈øtiall and fir≈øt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies partakers; nor of that which <hi>Thales</hi> attributed even vnto things, that are reputed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øoule or life, drawne therevnto by the con≈øideration of the Adamant ≈øtone: But of that which appertaineth to vs, and which we ≈øhould know be≈øt.</p>

Behold &amp; read in him the gibbri≈øh of the Gods. But what dream'd or doted he on, when he defined man, to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with two feet, and without feathers; giving them that were di≈øpo≈øed to mocke at him, a plea≈øant and ≈øcopefull occa≈øion to doe-it? For, having plucked-off the feathers of a live ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, they named him the man of <hi>Plato.</hi> And by what ≈øimplicitie did the Epicureans fir≈øt imagine, that the Atomes or Motes, which they termed to be bodies, having ≈øome weight and a naturall mooving downward, had framed the world; vntill ≈øuch time as they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øed by their adver≈øaries, that by this de≈øcription, it was not po≈ø≈øible, they ≈øhould joyne and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:12117:159"/>
take hold one of another; their fall being ≈øo downe-right and perpendicular, and every way engendring Parallell lines? And therefore was it nece≈ø≈øarie, they ≈øhould afterward adde a ca≈øuall moving, ≈øideling vnto them: And moreover to give their Atomes crooked and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tailes, that ≈øo they might take hold of any thing and cla≈øpe them≈øelves. And even then, tho≈øe that pur≈øue them with this other con≈øideration, do they not much trouble them? If Atomes have by chance formed ≈øo many ≈øorts of figures, why did they never meet together to frame a hou≈øe, or make a ≈øhooe? Why ≈øhould we not likewi≈øe believe that an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of greek Letters confu≈øedly ≈øcattred in ≈øome open place, might one day meet and joine together to the contexture of th'Iliads? That which is capable of rea≈øon (≈øaith <hi>Zeno</hi>) is better than that which is not. <hi>There is nothing better then the world: then the world is capable of rea≈øon.</hi> By the ≈øame arguing <hi>Cotta</hi> maketh the world a Mathematician, and by this other arguing of <hi>Zeno,</hi> he makes him a Mu≈øition, and an Organi≈øt. The whole is more than the part: We are capable of Wi≈øedome, and we are part of the World: Then the World is wi≈øe. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit like examples ≈øeen, not only of fal≈øe, but fooli≈øh arguments, which cannot hold, &amp; which accu≈øe their authors not ≈øo much of ignorance, as of folly, in the reproches that Philo≈øophers charge one another with, about the di≈øagreeings in their opinions and Sects.

So are all things ≈øpent and vented alike. Phy≈øicke is received as Geometry: and jugling trickes, enchantments, bonds, the commerce of decea≈øed ≈øpirits, progno≈øtications, domifications, yea even this ridiculous, wit and wealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øuming pur≈øuite of the Philo≈øophers ≈øtone, all is emploid and vttered without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

This opinion is plau≈øible and brought in by way of compo≈øition: but it is hard to give our ≈øpirit any limites, being very curious and greedy, and not tied to ≈øtay rather at a thou≈øand, then fifty paces. Having found by experience, that if one had mi≈øt to attaine vnto ≈øome one thing, another hath come vnto it; and that which one age never knew, the age ≈øucceeding hath found out: and that Sciences and Artes are not ca≈øt in a mould, but rather by little and little formed and ≈øhaped by often handling and polli≈øhing them over: even as beares fa≈øhion their yong whelps by often licking them: what my ≈øtrength cannot di≈øcover, I cea≈øe not to ≈øound and trie: and in handling and kneading this new matter and with removing and chafing it, I open ≈øome facultie for him that ≈øhal follow me, that with more ea≈øe he may inioy the ≈øame, and ≈øo make it more facile, more ≈øupple and more pliable:</p>

And fora≈ømuch as by the ≈øame way, fa≈øhion and conduct, errours are received into our ≈øoule, ≈øhe hath not wherewithall to di≈øtingui≈øh them, nor whereby to chu≈øe the truth from fal≈øhood. The Academikes received ≈øome inclination of judgement, and found it over raw, to ≈øay, it was no more likely, ≈ønow ≈øhould be white then blacke, and that we ≈øhould be no more a≈ø≈øured of the moving of a ≈øtone, which goeth from our hand, then of that of the eight Spheare. And to avoide this difficulty and ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe, which in trueth can not but hardly lodge in our imagination, how beit they e≈øtabli≈øh, that we were no way capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in the deepe≈øt Aby≈ø≈øes, where mans ≈øight can no way enter; yet avowed they ≈øomethings to be more likely and po≈ø≈øible then others, and received this faculty in their judgement, that they might rather encline to one apparance then to an other. They allowed hir this propen≈øion, interdicting hir all re≈øolution. The Pyrrhoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans advi≈øe is more hardy, and therewithall more likely. For this Academicall inclination, and this propen≈øion rather to one then another propo≈øition, what el≈øe is it, then a reacknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of ≈øome apparant truth, in this than in that? If our vnder≈øtanding be capable of the forme, of the lineaments, of the behaviour and face of truth; it might as well ≈øee it all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, as but halfe, growing and imperfect. For this apparance of veri≈øimilitude, which makes them rather take the left then the right hand, doe you augment it; this one ounce of likelyhood, which turnes the ballance, doe you multiply it, by a hundred, nay by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand ounces; it will in the end come to pa≈ø≈øe, that the ballance will ab≈øolutely re≈øolve and conclude one choi≈øe and perfect truth.

If our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and ≈øen≈øible faculties are without ground or footing, if they but hull vp and downe and drive with the wind, for nothing ≈øuffer we our judgement to be caried away to any part of their operation, what apparance ≈øoever it ≈øeemeth to pre≈øent vs with.

Leave we aparte this infinite confu≈øion of opinions, which is ≈øeene among≈øt Phylo≈øophers them≈øelves, and this vniver≈øall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall di≈øputation, in and concerning the knowledge of things.</p>

How diver≈øly judge we of things? How often change we our fanta≈øies?

                        <p>A Philo≈øopher being taken with the deede, was demaunded, what he did: an≈øwered very mildely, <hi>I plant man,</hi> blu≈øhing no more being found ≈øo napping, then if he had bin taken ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Garlike. It is (as I ≈øuppo≈øe) of a tender and re≈øpectiue opinion, that a notable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Authour, holds this action ≈øo nece≈ø≈øarily-bound to ≈øecrecy and ≈øhame, that in Cynike embracements and dalliances, hee could not be per≈øwaded that the worke ≈øhould come to her end; but rather, that it lingred and ≈øtaid, only to repre≈øent wanton ge≈øtures, and la≈øcivious motions, to maintaine the impudencie of their ≈øchooles-profe≈ø≈øion: and that to powre forth what ≈øhame had forced and ba≈øhfulne≈ø≈øe re≈øtrained, they had al≈øo afterward neede to ≈øeeke ≈øome ≈øecret place. He had not ≈øeene farre-enough into their licenciou≈øne≈ø≈øe: For, <hi>Diogenes</hi> in ≈øight of all, exerci≈øing his Ma≈øturbation, bred a longing-de≈øire, in the by-≈øtanders, that in ≈øuch ≈øort they might fill their bellies by rubbing or clawing the ≈øame.

The≈øe Philo≈øophers ≈øet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame rate on vertue; and rejected all other di≈øciplines, except the morall; yet is it, that in al actions, they a≈øcribed the Soveraigne authority to the election of their wi≈øe, yea, and above all lawes: &amp; appointed no other re≈øtraint vnto voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but themoderation, &amp; pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others liberty<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

Our fanta≈øie doth not apply it ≈øelf to ≈øtrange things, but is rather conceived by the interpo≈øition of ≈øen≈øes; and ≈øen≈øes cannot comprehend a ≈øtrange ≈øubject; Nay not ≈øo much as their owne pa≈ø≈øions; and ≈øo, nor the fanta≈øie, nor the apparance is the ≈øubjects, but rather the pa≈ø≈øions only, and ≈øufferance of the ≈øen≈øe: which pa≈ø≈øion and ≈øubject are diver≈øe things: Therefore <hi>who iudgeth by apparances, iudgeth by a thing, different from the ≈øubiect.</hi> And to ≈øay, that the ≈øen≈øes pa≈ø≈øions referre the qualitie of ≈øtrange ≈øubjects by re≈øemblance vnto the ≈øoule: How can the ≈øoule and the vnder≈øtanding re≈øt a≈ø≈øured of that re≈øemblance, having of it≈øelfe no commerce with forraigne ≈øubjects? Even as he that knowes not <hi>Socrates,</hi> ≈øeeing his picture cannot ≈øay that it re≈øembleth him. And would a man judge by apparances, be it by all it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible; for by their contraries and differences they hinder one another, as we ≈øee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. May it be that ≈øome choice apparances rule and direct the others? This choy≈øe mu≈øt be verified by an other choy≈øe, the ≈øecond by a third: and ≈øo ≈øhall we never make an end. In few, <hi>there is no constant existence, neither of our being, nor of the obiects.</hi> And we, and our judgement, and al mortal things els do vnce≈ø≈øantly rowle turne and pa≈ø≈øe away. Thus can nothing be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely e≈øtabli≈øhed, nor of the one, nor of the other; both the judging and the judged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in continuall alteration and motion. Wee have no communication with being; for every humane nature is ever in the middle betweene being borne and dying; giving nothing of it ≈øelfe but an ob≈øcure apparance and ≈øhaddow, and an vncertaine and weake opinion. And if perhappes you fix your thought to take it's being; it would be even, as if one ≈øhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to gra≈øpe the water: for, how much the more he ≈øhall clo≈øe and pre≈ø≈øe that, which by its owne nature is ever gliding, ≈øo much the more he ≈øhall loo≈øe what he would hold and fa≈øten. Thus, ≈øeeing all things are ≈øubject to pa≈ø≈øe from one change to another; rea≈øon, which therein ≈øeeketh a reall ≈øub≈øi≈øtance, findes hir ≈øelfe deceived as vnable to apprehend any thing ≈øub≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant and permanent: for≈øomuch as each thing eyther commeth to a being, and is not yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together; or beginneth to dy before it be borne. <hi>Plato</hi> ≈øaid, that bodies had never an exi≈øtence but in deede a birth, ≈øuppo≈øing that <hi>Homer</hi> made the <hi>Ocean</hi> Father, and <hi>Thet is</hi> Mother of the Gods, thereby to ≈øhew-vs, that all things are in continuall motion, change and variation. As he ≈øaith, a common opinion among≈øt all the Philo≈øophers before his time; Only <hi>Parmenides,</hi> excepted, who denied any motion to be in things; of who≈øe power he maketh no ≈ømall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that each thing or matter was ever gliding, and labile. The Stoickes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, there is no pre≈øent time, and that which we call pre≈øent, is but conjoyning and a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of future time &amp; pa≈øt. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> averreth that no man ever entred twi≈øe one ≈øame river. <hi>Epicarmus</hi> avowcheth, that who erewhile borrowed any mony, doth not now owe it: and that he who ye≈øternight was bidden to dinner this day, commeth to day vnbidden; ≈øince they are no more them≈øelves, but are become others: and that one mortall ≈øub≈øtance could not twi≈øe be found in one ≈øelf ≈øtate: for by the ≈øodaine≈ø≈øe and lightne≈ø≈øe of change, ≈øomtimes it wa≈øteth, and othertimes it re-a≈ø≈øembleth; now it comes and now it goes; in ≈øuch ≈øort, that he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be borne, never comes to the perfection of being. For, this being borne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth never to an end, nor ever ≈øtayeth as being at an end; but after the ≈øeede proceedeth continually in change and alteration from one to another. As of mans ≈øeede, there is fir≈øt made a ≈øhapele≈ø≈øe fruit in the Mothers Wombe, than a ≈øhapen Childe, then being out of the Wombe, a ≈øucking babe, afterward he becommeth a ladde, then con≈øequently a ≈øtriplin, then a full-growne man, then an old man, and in the end an aged decrepite man. So that age and ≈øub≈øequent generation goeth ever vndoing and wa≈øting the precedent.</p>

For, not only (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ≈øaid) the death of fire is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ayre; and the death of ayre, a generation of Water. But al≈øo we may mo≈øt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øee it in our ≈øelves. The flower of age dieth, fadeth and fleeteth, when age comes vpon vs, and youth endeth in the flower of a full growne mans age: Child-hood in youth, and the fir≈øt age, dieth in infancie: and ye≈øter-day endeth in this day, and to day ≈øhall die in to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And <hi>nothing remaineth or ever continueth in one ≈øtate.</hi> For to proove it, if we ≈øhould ever continue one and the ≈øame, how is it then, that now we rejoyce at one thing, and now at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? How comes it to pa≈ø≈øe, we love things contrary, or we hate them, or we love them, or we blame them? How is it, that we have different affections, holding no more the ≈øame ≈øence in the ≈øame thought? For it is not likely, that without alteration we ≈øhould take other pa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>What admitteth alterations, continueth not the ≈øame:</hi> and if it be not one ≈øelfe ≈øame, than is it not: but rather with being all one, the ≈øimple being doth al≈øo change, ever becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming other from other. And by con≈øequence Natures ≈øen≈øes are deceived and lie fal≈øely; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what appeareth for what is; for want of truely knowing what it is that is. But then what is it, that is indeed? That which is eternall, that is to ≈øay, that which never had birth, nor ever ≈øhall have end; and to which no time can bring change or cau≈øe alteration. For time is a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thing, and which appeareth as in a ≈øhadow, with the matter ever gliding, alwaies fluent, without ever being ≈øtable or permanent; to whom rightly belong the≈øe termes, <hi>Before</hi> and <hi>After:</hi> and it <hi>Hath beene,</hi> or <hi>Shall be.</hi> Which at fir≈øt ≈øight doth manife≈øtly ≈øhew, that it is not a thing, which is; for, it were great ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe, and apparant fal≈øe-hood, to ≈øay, that that is which is not yet in being, or that already hath cea≈øed from being. And concerning the≈øe words, <hi>Pre≈øent, In≈øtant, Even-now,</hi> by which it ≈øeemes, that e≈øpecially we vphold and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ground the intelligence of time; rea≈øon di≈øcovering the ≈øame, doth forth with de≈øtroy it: for pre≈øently it ≈øevereth it a≈øunder and divideth it into future and pa≈øt-time, as willing to ≈øee it nece≈ø≈øarily parted in two. As much happeneth vnto nature, which is mea≈øured according vnto time, which mea≈øureth hir: for no more is there any thing in hir, that remaineth or is ≈øub≈øi≈øtent: rather all things in hir are either borne or ready to be borne, or dying. By meanes whereof, it were a ≈øinne to ≈øay of God, who is the only that is, that he was or ≈øhalbe: for the≈øe words are declinations, pa≈ø≈øages, or Vici≈ø≈øitudes of that, which cannot la≈øt, nor continue in being. Wherfore we mu≈øt conclude; <hi>that onely God is, not according to any mea≈øure of time, but according to an immoovable and immutable eternity, not mea≈øured by time, nor ≈øubiect to any decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, before whom nothing is, nor nothing ≈øhall be after, nor more now nor more recent, but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being: which by one onely</hi> Now <hi>or</hi> Pre≈øent, <hi>filleth the</hi> Ever, <hi>and there is nothing that truly is, but the alone:</hi> Without ≈øaying, he hath beene, or he ≈øhall be, without beginning, and ≈øans ending.

                        <p>It is a degree of con≈øtancie, vnto which I have experienced to arrive, as tho≈øe that ca≈øt them≈øelves into danger, or into the Sea, with clo≈øed eyes. In mine opinion, there is nothing more worthy the noting in <hi>Socrates</hi> life, then to have had thirtie whole dayes to ruminate his deaths-decree, to have dige≈øted it all that while, with an a≈ø≈øured hope, without di≈ømay or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and with a cour≈øe of actions and words, rather ≈øuppre≈øt; and loo≈øe-hanging, then out-≈øtretched and rai≈øed by the weight of ≈øuch a cogitation. That <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> to whome <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth, being ≈øicke, cau≈øed <hi>Agrippa</hi> his ≈øonne in lawe, and two or three of his other friends to be called<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for, to whom he ≈øaid; that having a≈ø≈øaied, how he got nothing in going about to be cured, and what he did to prolong his life did al≈øo lengthen and augment his griefe, he was now determined to make an end of one and other; intreating them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his determination, and that by no meanes, they would loo≈øe their labour to di≈ø≈øwade him from it. And having cho≈øen to end his life by ab≈øtinence, his ≈øickenes was cured by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; The remedy he had employed to make him≈øelfe away, brought him to health againe. The Phy≈øitions, and his friendes, glad of ≈øo happy a ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, and rejoycing thereof with him, were in the end greatly deceived; for, with all they could doe, they were never able to make him alter his former opinion, ≈øaying, that as he mu≈øt one day pa≈ø≈øe that cariere, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ≈øo forward, he would remoove the care, another time to beginne againe. This man having with great lea≈øure apprehended death, is not onely no whit di≈øcouraged, when hee comes to front it, but re≈øolutely falles vpon it: for, being ≈øatisfied of that, for which he was entred the combate, in a braverie he thru≈øt him≈øelfe into it, to ≈øee the end of it. It is farre from fearing death, to goe about to ta≈øte and ≈øavour the ≈øame. The hi≈øtorie of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øopher, is much like to this. His gummes being ≈øwolne, his Phy≈øitions per≈øwaded him to v≈øe great ab≈øtinence; having fa≈øted two dayes, he was ≈øo well amended, as they told him he was well, and might returne to his wonted cour≈øe of life.

So doth he coun≈øell <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> by no meanes to order his actions, by the vulgar opinion and publike reputation: vnle≈ø≈øe it be to avoide other accidentall incommodities, which the contempt of men might bring vnto him.

As an amorous pa≈ø≈øion addeth beauties, and lendeth graces to the ≈øubject it embraceth, and maketh ≈øuch as are therewith po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, with a troubled conceite, and di≈øtracted Iudgement, to deeme what they love, and finde what they affect, to bee other, and ≈øeeme more perfect, then in trueth it is.

We are nought but ceremonie; ceremonie doth tran≈øport<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> vs, and wee leave the ≈øub≈øtance of things; wee hold-fa≈øt by the boughs, and leave the trunke or body. We have taught Ladies to blu≈øh, onely by hearing that named, which they nothing feare to doe. Wee dare not call our members by their proper names, and feare not to employ them in all kinde of di≈ø≈øolutene≈ø≈øe. Ceremonie forbids vs by words to expre≈ø≈øe lawfull and naturall things; and we believe it. Rea≈øon willeth vs to doe no bad or vnlawfull things, and no man giveth credite vnto it.

po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe-vs. Others there be which are artificiall, whereof I will not ≈øpeake. As ≈øalutations, reverences, or conges, by which ≈øome doe often purcha≈øe the honor, (but wrongfully) to be humble, lowly, and courteous: A man may be humble through glory. I am very prodigall of cappings, namely in Summer, and I never receive any from what quality of men ≈øoever, but I giue them as good and as many as they bring, except he be ≈øome ≈øervant of mine. I wi≈øh that ≈øome Princes whom I know, would be more ≈øparing, and impartial di≈øpencers of them; for, being ≈øo indi≈øcreetly employed, they have no force at all: If they be without regard, then are they without effect. Amonge≈øt di≈øordered countenaunces, let vs not forget the ≈øterne looke of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour, who in publike held ever his head bolt-vpright, without turning or bending the ≈øame on any ≈øide, no not ≈øo much as to looke on them that ≈øaluted him ≈øideling, holding his body ≈øo fixt and vnmooveable, that let his Coche ≈øhake never ≈øo much, he kept ≈øtill vp-right: he dur≈øt never ≈øpit nor wipe his No≈øe, nor dry his face before the people. I wot not whether tho≈øe ge≈øtures, which were noted in me were of this fir≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and whether in truth I had any ≈øecret propen≈øion to this fault, as it may well be: and I cannot an≈øwer for the motions of my body. But concerning tho≈øe of the ≈øoule, I will heere ingeniou≈øly confe≈ø≈øe what I thinke of them. There are two parts in this glory: Which is to ≈øay, for a man to e≈øteeme him≈øelfe overmuch, the other, not ≈øufficiently to e≈øteeme of others. For the one, fir≈øt me thinkes, the≈øe con≈øiderations ought ≈øomewhat to be accompted of. I feele my ≈øelfe ≈øurcharged with one errour of the minde, which both as bad, and much more as importunate, I vtterly di≈ølike. I endevour to correct it; but I cannot di≈øplace it. It is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I abate the ju≈øt value of tho≈øe things, which I po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe; and enhance the worth of things, by how much they are more ≈øtrange, ab≈øent and not mine owne. This humour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ≈øelfe very farre, as doth the prerogative of the authority, wherewith husbands looke vpon their owne wives with a vicious di≈ødame, and many fathers vpon their children: So doe I, and betweene two like workes would I ever weigh again≈øt mine. Not ≈øo much that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie of my preferment, and amendment troubleth my judgement, and hindereth me from plea≈øing my ≈øelfe, as that ma≈øtery hir≈øelfe begets a contempt of that which a man po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth and oweth. Policies, far cu≈øtomes and tongues flatter me; and I perceive the Latine tongue by the favour of hir dignity to deceive me, beyond what belongs vnto hir, as children and the vulgar ≈øort. My neighbours oeconomie; his hou≈øe, and his hor≈øe, though but of equall value, is more worth then mine, by how much more it is not mine owne. Be≈øides, becau≈øe I am mo≈øt ignorant in mine owne matters: I admire the a≈ø≈øurance, and wonder at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, that every man hath of him≈øelfe: whereas there is almo≈øt nothing, that I wot I know, nor that I dare warrant my ≈øelfe to be able to doe. I have not my faculties in propo≈øition, or by e≈øtate, and am not in≈øtructed in them but after the effect: As doubtfull of mine owne ≈øtrength, as vncertaine of anothers force. Whence it followeth, if commendably I chance vpon any one piece of worke, I rather impute it to my fortune, then a≈øcribe it to mine indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry; fora≈ømuch as I de≈ø≈øeigne them all to hazard, and in feare. Likewi≈øe I have this in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that of all the opinions, which Antiquity hath had of man in gro≈øe, tho≈øe which I mo≈øt willingly embrace, and whereon I take mo≈øt hold, are ≈øuch as mo≈øt vilifie, contemne, and annihilate vs. Me thinkes Philo≈øophy hath never better cardes to Shew, then when ≈øhe checketh our pre≈øumption, and cro≈ø≈øeth our vanity; when in good ≈øooth ≈øhe acknowledgeth hir irre≈øolution, hir weakene≈ø≈øe and hir ignorance. Me ≈øeemeth the over good conceit, and ≈øelfe-weening opinion man hath of him≈øelfe, is the Nurce-mother of the fal≈øe≈øt opinions, both publike and particular. Tho≈øe which a cocke-hor≈øe will pearch them≈øelves vpon the <hi>Epicicle</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ≈øee ≈øo farre into heaven, they even pull out my teeth. For in the ≈øtudy which I profe≈ø≈øe, the ≈øubject whereof is Man, finding ≈øo extreame a variety of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ≈øo inextricable a laberinth of difficulties one vpon the necke of another, ≈øo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity, and ≈øo much vncertainty, yea even in the ≈øchoole of wi≈øedome it ≈øelfe: you may imagine ≈øince tho≈øe men could never be re≈øolved of the knowledge of them≈øelves and of their owne condition, which is continually before their eyes, which is ever within them; ≈øince they know not how that mooveth, which them≈øelves cau≈øe to moove, nor how to ≈øet forth the ≈øprings, and de≈øcipher the wards, which them≈øelves hold and handle, how ≈øhould I thinke of the true cau≈øe of the flux and reflux of the river <hi>Nilus?</hi> The curio≈øity to know things hath beene given to men (as ≈øaith the holy Scripture) for a ≈øcourge. But to come to my particular, it is very hard (mee ≈øeemeth) that ≈øome other regardeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:12117:185"/>
le≈ø≈øe, yea and ≈øome other e≈øteemeth me le≈ø≈øe then I e≈øteeme my ≈øelfe. I accompt my ≈øelfe of the comon ≈øort except in that I deeme my≈øelfe guiltie of the ba≈øe≈øt, and culpable of the mo≈øt popular defects: but not di≈øavowed nor excu≈øed. And I only pri≈øe my ≈øelfe, wherein I know my worth. If any glory be in me, it is but ≈øuperficially infu≈øed into me; by the trea≈øon of my complexion: and hath no ≈øolide body appearing to the ≈øight of my judgement. I am but ≈øprinckled over, but not throughly dyed. For in trueth, touching the effects of the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, in what manner ≈øoever, there never came any thing from me, that contented me. And others approbation is no currant payment for me. My judgement is tender and hard e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in mine owne behalfe. I feele my ≈øelfe to waver and bend through weakene≈ø≈øe: I have nothing of mine owne to ≈øatisfie my judgement. My ≈øight is indifferently cleare and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but if I take any ≈øerious worke in hand, it is trobled, and dimmed: as I perceive mo≈øt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnly in Poe≈øie: I love it exceedingly: I have ≈øome in≈øight or knowledge in other mens Labours, but in trueth I play the Novice when I ≈øet my hand vnto it: Then can I not abide my ≈øelfe. A man may play the foole every where el≈øe, but not in Poe≈øie.</p>

In the times of the Olimpike games, with chariots exceeding all other in magnificence, he al≈øo ≈øent Poets and Mu≈øitians to pre≈øent his ver≈øes, with tents and pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gilt and mo≈øt ≈øumtuou≈øly tapi≈øtred. When they fir≈øt beganne to reher≈øe them, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and excellencie of the pronuntiation did greatly allure the peoples attention: but when they beganne to con≈øider the fondne≈ø≈øe of the compo≈øition, they fell as ≈øoone to contemne them: and being more and more exa≈øperated fell furiou≈øly into an vprore, and headlong ranne in mo≈øt ≈øpitefull maner to teare and ca≈øt downe all his pavillions. And fora≈ømuch as his rich chariets did no good at all in their cour≈øe, and the ≈øhip which carried his men, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning homeward mi≈ø≈øed the ≈øhore of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and was by violent ≈øtormes driven and ≈øpilt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coa≈øt of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> they certainly believed, the wrath of the Gods to have beene the cau≈øe of it, as being greatly offended, both again≈øt him, and his vile and wicked Poeme: yea and the Mariners them≈øelves that e≈øcaped the ≈øhipwracke did much ≈øecond the peoples opinion: to which the Oracle that foretold his death ≈øeemed in ≈øome ≈øorte to ≈øub≈øcribe: which implied, that <hi>Dioni≈øius</hi> ≈øhould be neere his end, at what time he had vanqui≈øhed tho≈øe that ≈øhould be of more worth than him≈øelfe: Which he interpreted to be the Carthaginians, who exceeded him in might. And having at any time occa≈øion to fight or grapple with them, that he might not incurre the meaning of this prediction, he would often temper and avoyde the victory. But he mi≈ø-vnder≈øtoode the matter, for the God ob≈øerved the time of advantage, when as through partiall favour and inju≈øtice he obtained the victory over the tragicall Poets at <hi>Athens,</hi> who were much better than he was, where he cau≈øed in contention of them, his Tragedie, entitled the <hi>Lenetens,</hi> to be publikely acted. After which v≈øurped vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, he pre≈øently decea≈øed: And partly through the exce≈ø≈øive joy, hee thereby conceived. What I finde excu≈øable in mine, is not of it≈øelfe, and according to truth: but in compari≈øon of other compo≈øitions, wor≈øe than mine, to which I ≈øee ≈øome credite given.

My French tongue is corrupted both in the pronuntiation, and el≈øe-where by the barbari≈øme of my countrie. I never ≈øaw man of the≈øe hither-countries, that did not evidently ta≈øte of his home-≈øpeech, and who often did not wound tho≈øe eares, that are purely French. Yet is it not becau≈øe I am ≈øo cunning in my <hi>Perigordin:</hi> For I haue no more v≈øe of it, than of the Dutch, nor doe I greatly care. It is a language (as are many others round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me) like to that of <hi>Poitou, Xaintogne, Angoule≈øme, Limo≈øin,</hi> and <hi>Auergne,</hi> ≈øquattering, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and filthie. There is about vs, toward the mountaines a Ga≈øcoine tongue, which I much commend and like, ≈øinnowie, pithie, ≈øhort, ≈øignificant, and in truth man-like and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, more than any other I vnder≈øtand. As compendious powerfull, and pertinent as the French is gracious, delicate, and copious. As for the Latine, which was given me for my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue, by rea≈øon of di≈øcontinuance, I have ≈øo lo≈øt the promptitude of it, as I cannot well make v≈øe of it in ≈øpeech, and ≈øcar≈øely in writing, in which I have heerctofore beene ≈øo ready, that I was called a ma≈øter in it. Loe heere my little ≈øufficiencie in that behalfe. <hi>Beauty is a part of great commendation in the commerce and ≈øocietie of men.</hi> It is the chiefe meane of reconciliation betweene one and other. Nor is there any man ≈øo barbarous, and ≈øo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, that in ≈øome ≈øort feeleth not him≈øelfe ≈øtrucken with her ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe. The body hath a great part in our being, and therein keepes a ≈øpeciall ranke: For, his ≈øtructure and compo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are worthy due con≈øideration. Such as goe about to ≈øunder our two principall parts, and ≈øeparate them one from another, are much to blame: They ought rather to be coupled and joined fa≈øt together. The ≈øoule mu≈øt be enjoined not to retire her ≈øelfe to her quarter, nor to entertaine her ≈øelfe apart, nor to de≈øpi≈øe and leave the bodie (which ≈øhe cannot well doe, except it beby ≈øome counterfaited api≈øh tricke) but ought to combine and cling fa≈øt vnto him, to embrace, to cheri≈øh, a≈ø≈øi≈øt, correct, per≈øwade and advi≈øe him, and if he chance to ≈øwarve or ≈øtray, then to leade and direct him: In fine, ≈øhe ≈øhould wed and ≈øerve him in ≈øtead of a husband, that ≈øo their effects may not ≈øeeme contrary and divers, but agreeing and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Chri≈øtians have a particular in≈øtruction concerning this bond, for they know that Gods ju≈øtice alloweth this ≈øocietie, and embraceth this conjunction of the body and ≈øoule, yea ≈øo farre as to make the body capable of euerla≈øting rewards. And that God beholds the whole man to worke, and will have him entirely to receive either the puni≈øhment, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compen≈øe, according to his demerits. The Peripatetike Sect (of all Sects the mo≈øt ≈øociable) attributeth this onely care vnto wi≈øedome, in common to procure and provide, the good of the≈øe two a≈ø≈øociated parts: And declareth other Sects to have partialized overmuch, becau≈øe they had given them≈øelves to the full con≈øideration of this commixture; this one for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, this other for the ≈øoule, with one like error and over≈øight, and had mi≈øtaken their ≈øubject, which is Man; and their guide, which in generall they avouched to be Nature. The fir≈øt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction, that hath beene among≈øt men, and the fir≈øt con≈øideration, that gave preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ≈øome over others, it is very likely it was the advantage of beautie.</p>

que≈øtion, or to ≈øcape it by ≈øome winding, nor to di≈ø≈øemble a truth, nor have I memorie able to continue it ≈øo fained, nor a≈ø≈øurance ≈øufficient to maintaine it; and I play the Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard through feeblene≈ø≈øe. And therefore I apply my ≈øelfe to ingenuitie, and ever to ≈øpeake truth and what I thinke, both by complexion and by intention; leaving the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe thereof vnto fortune. <hi>Ari≈øtippus</hi> ≈øaid, that the chiefe≈øt commoditie her reaped by Philo≈øophie, was, that he ≈øpake freely and ≈øincerely to all men: Memory is an in≈øtrument of great ≈øervice, and without which, judgement will hardly di≈øcharge his duty, whereof I have great want. What a man will propo≈øe vnto me, he mu≈øt doe it by peece-meales: For, to an≈øwer to a di≈øcour≈øe that hath many heads, lieth not in my power. I cannot receive a charge, except I have my writing tables about me: and if I mu≈øt remember a di≈øcour≈øe of any con≈øequence, be it of any length, I am driven to this vile and mi≈øerable nece≈ø≈øitie, to learne every word I mu≈øt ≈øpeake, by rote; otherwi≈øe I ≈øhould never doe it well or a≈ø≈øuredly, for feare my memory ≈øhould in my greate≈øt need faile me; which is very hard vnto me, for I mu≈øt have three houres to learne three ver≈øes. Moreover in any long di≈øcour≈øe, the libertie or authoritie to remoove the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to change a word, vnce≈ø≈øantly altering the matter, makes it more difficult to bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the authors memory. And the more I di≈øtru≈øt it, the more it troubleth me. It ≈øerveth me better by chance, and I mu≈øt carele≈øly ≈øollicite her, for if I vrge her, ≈øhe is a≈øtoni≈øhed; and if it once beginne to waver, the more I ≈øound her, the more entangled and intricate ≈øhee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. She will wait vpon me when ≈øhe li≈øt, not when I plea≈øe. And what I feele in my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I feele in many other parts of mine. I e≈øchew commandement, duty, and compul≈øion. What I doe ea≈øily and naturally, if I re≈øolve to doe it by expre≈ø≈øe and pre≈øcribed appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I can then doe it no more. Even in my body, tho≈øe parts, that have ≈øome liberty, and more particular juri≈ødiction, doe ≈øometimes refu≈øe to obey me, if at any time I appoint and enjoine them to doe me ≈øome nece≈ø≈øary ≈øervices. This forced and tyrannicall preordinance doth reject them, and they either for ≈øpight or feare ≈øhrinke and are quailed. Being once in a place, where it is reputed a barbarous di≈øcourte≈øie not to pledge tho≈øe that drinke to you, where although I were v≈øed with all liberty, in favour of certaine Ladies that were in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, according to the fa≈øhion of the countrey, I would needs play the good fellow. But it made vs all mery; for the threats and preparation, that I ≈øhould force my ≈øelfe beyond my naturall cu≈øtome, did in ≈øuch ≈øort ≈øtop, and ≈øtuffe my throat, that I was not able to ≈øwallow one drop, and was barr'd of drinking all the repa≈øt. I found my ≈øelfe glutted and full of drinke by the overmuch ≈øwilling that my imagination had fore-conceived. This effect is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant in tho≈øe, who≈øe imagination is more vehement and ≈øtrong: yet it is naturall: and there is no man, but ≈øhall ≈øometimes have a feeling of it. An excellent Archer being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, was offered to have his life ≈øaved, if he would but ≈øhew any notable triall of his profe≈ø≈øion, refu≈øed to make proofe of it; fearing le≈øt the contention of his will ≈øhould make him to mi≈ø≈øe-direct his hand, and that in lieu of ≈øaving his life, hee might al≈øo lo≈øe the reputation he had gotten in ≈øhooting in a bow. A man who≈øe thoughts are bu≈øie about other matters, ≈øhall very neere within an inch keepe and alwaies hit one ≈øelfe ≈øame number and mea≈øure of paces, in a place where he walketh; but if heedily hee endevour to mea≈øure and count them, he ≈øhall finde that what he did by nature and chance, he cannot doe it ≈øo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by de≈ø≈øeigne. My Library (which for a countrey Library, may pa≈ø≈øe for a very faire one) is ≈øeated in a corner of my hou≈øe: if any thing come into my minde, that either I mu≈øt goe ≈øeeke or write in it, for feare I ≈øhould forget it in cro≈ø≈øing of my Court, I mu≈øt de≈øire ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body to remember the ≈øame for me.

Mine being ≈øo weake, I have no great cau≈øe to complaine if I know but little. I know the names of Artes in Generall and what they treate of, but nothing further. I turne and to≈ø≈øe over bookes, but do not ≈øtudie them; what of them remaines in me, is a thing which I no longer acknowledge to be any bodies el≈øe. Onely by that hath my judgement profited: and the di≈øcour≈øes and imaginations, wherewith it is in≈øtructed and trained vp. The Authours, the place, the words, and other circum≈øtances, I ≈øodainely forget: and am ≈øo excellent in forgetting, that as much as any thing el≈øe I forget mine owne writings and compo≈øitions. Yea, mine owne ≈øayings are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hand-while alleaged again≈øt my ≈øelfe, when God wot I perceive it not. He that would know of me, whence or from whom the ver≈øes or examples, which here I have hudled vp are taken, ≈øhould greatly put me to my ≈øhifts, &amp; I could hardly tell it him. Yet have I not beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, but at famous and very well knowen gates: which though they were rich in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, did never plea≈øe me, vnle≈ø≈øe they al≈øo came from rich and honourable hands, and that authority concurre with rea≈øon. It is no great marvell, if my booke follow the fortune of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes; and my memory forgoe or forget as well what I write, as what I reade: and what I give, as well as what I receive. Be≈øides the defect of memory, I have others, which much further my ignorance. My wit is dull and ≈ølow, the lea≈øt cloud dimmeth it, ≈øo that (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ≈øake) I never propo≈øed riddle vnto it (were it never ≈øo ea≈øie) that it was able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. There is no ≈øubtility ≈øo vaine, but confounds me. In games, wherein wit may beare a part, as of che≈ø≈øe, of cards, of tables and others, I could never conceive but the common and plaine≈øt draughts. My apprehen≈øion is very ≈øluggi≈øh and gloomy; but what it once hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the ≈øame it keepeth fa≈øt: and for the time it keepes it, the ≈øame it embraceth generally, ≈øtrictly and deepely. My ≈øight is quicke, ≈øound, perfect and farre-≈øeeing, but ea≈øily wearied, if much charged or emploied. By which occa≈øion I can haue no great commerce with books, but by others ≈øervice which reade vnto me. <hi>Plime</hi> the yoonger can in≈øtruct tho≈øe that have tri'd it, how much this fore ≈ølowing importeth tho≈øe that give them≈øelves to this occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And how it commeth to pa≈ø≈øe, that a minde blinde and ≈ølumbering in all other things, is in ≈øome particular effects, lively, cleare and excellent, a man mu≈øt inquire of cunning ma≈øters. But tho≈øe are the faire ≈øpirits, which are vniver≈øall, open, and ready to all, if not in≈øtructed, at lea≈øt to be in≈øtructed. Which I alleage to accu≈øe mine: For, be it either through weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, or retchle≈ø≈øene≈ø≈øe (and to be carele≈ø≈øe of that which lieth at our feet, which we have in our hands, which neere≈øt concerneth the v≈øe of life, is a thing farre from my Dogma or Doctrine) there is none ≈øo ≈øimple or ≈øo ignorant as mine, in divers ≈øuch common matters, and of which without imputation or ≈øhame a man ≈øhould neuer be ignorant; whereof I mu≈øt needs tell ≈øome examples.

I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand not the names of the mo≈øt v≈øuall tooles about husbandry, nor of the meane≈øt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of tillage, which mo≈øt children know. I was never skilfull in Mechanicall arts, nor in Traffike or knowledge of Merchandize, nor in the diver≈øity and nature of fruits, wines, or cates, nor can I make a Hawke, phy≈øick a Hor≈øe, or teach a Dogge. And ≈øince I mu≈øt make full ≈øhew of my ≈øhame or ignorance, it is not yet a moneth ≈øince, that I was found to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, whereto Leven ≈øerued to make bread withall; or what it was to cunne Wine.

Verily a man might draw a much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie conclu≈øion from me: For let me have all that may belong to a Kitchin, yet ≈øhall I be ready to ≈øtarve for hunger. By the≈øe partes of my confe≈ø≈øion, one may imagine divers others, to my co≈øt and detriment. But how≈øoever I make my ≈øelfe knowen, alwaies prouided it be as I am indeede, I have my purpo≈øe.

                        <p>In≈øtabilitie is the wor≈øt I find in our ≈øtate, and that our lawes, no more than our garments, can take no ≈øetled forme. <hi>It is an ea≈øie matter to accu≈øe a ≈øtate of imperfection, ≈øince all mortall things are full of it.</hi> As ea≈øie is it to beget in a people a contempt of his ancient ob≈øervances: No man ever vndertooke it, but came to an end: But to e≈øtabli≈øh a better ≈øtate in place of that which is condemned and raced out, divers who have attempted it, have ≈øhronke vnder the burthen. Touching my conduct, my wi≈øedome hath ≈ømall ≈øhare therein. I am very ea≈øily to be directed by the worlds publike order. Oh happie people, that doth what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, better then they which command, without vexing them≈øelves about cau≈øes; which ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them≈øelves gently to be rowled on, according to the heavens rowling. Obedience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pure and quiet in him, who talketh, pleadeth and contendeth. In ≈øome, (to returne to my ≈øelfe) the onely matter, for which I make ≈øome accompt of my ≈øelfe, is that, wherein never man did thinke him≈øelfe defective. My commendation is vulgar, common and popular; For, who ever thought he wanted wit? It were a propo≈øition, which in it≈øelfe would imply contradiction. It is an infirmity, that is never where it is ≈øeene, it is very ≈øtrong and fa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, but yet pierced and di≈ø≈øipated by the fir≈øt beame of the pacients ≈øight, as doth the Sunnes raies ≈øcatter and di≈øpearce a gloomie mi≈øt.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:12117:191"/>
him≈øelfe of that ≈øubject; and to condemne him≈øelfe, an ab≈øolving of him≈øelfe. There was never ≈øo ba≈øe a porter, nor ≈øo ≈øilly a woman, but thought he had ≈øufficient wit for his provi≈øion. We ea≈øely know in others, the advantage of courage, of bodily ≈øtrength, of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of di≈øpo≈øition and of beautie, but we never yeelde the advantage of judgement to any body: And the rea≈øons, which part from the ≈øimple naturall di≈øcour≈øe in others, we thinke, that had we but looked that way, wee had ≈øurely found them. The skill, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the ≈øtile and ≈øuch like partes, which we ≈øee in ≈øtrange workes, we ea≈øily perceive whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they exceede ours; but the meere productions of wit and vnder≈øtanding, every man dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it lyeth in him to meete with the very like, and doth hardly perceive the weight and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie of it, except (and that verie ≈øcar≈øely) in an extreame and incomparable di≈øtance. And he that ≈øhould clearely ≈øee the height of a ≈øtrangers judgement, would come and bring his vnto it. Thus, is it a kind of exerci≈øing, whereof a man may hope but for meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and ≈ømall prai≈øe, and a maner of compo≈øition, of little or no harme at all. And then, for whom doe you write? The wi≈øer ≈øort, vnto whom belongeth booki≈øh juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, know no other price but of doctrine, and avow no other proceeding in our wits, but that of erudition and arte. If you have mi≈øtaken one <hi>Scipio</hi> for an other, what of any worth have you left to ≈øpeake-of? He that is ignorant of <hi>Aristotle</hi> (according to them) he is there withall ignorant of him≈øelfe. Popular and ≈øhallow-headed minds, cannot perceive the grace or comeline≈ø≈øe, nor judge of a ≈ømooth and quaint di≈øcour≈øe. Now the≈øe two kindes po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the world. The third, vnto who≈øe ≈øhare you fall, of regular wits, and that are ≈øtrong of them≈øelves, is ≈øo rare, that ju≈øtly it hath neither name or ranke among≈øt vs; he loo≈øeth halfe his time, that doth a≈øpire or endevour to plea≈øe it. It is commonly ≈øaid, that the ju≈øte≈øt portion, nature hath given vs of the graces, is that of ≈øen≈øe and vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: for there is no man, but is contented with the ≈øhare ≈øhe hath allotted him: I i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It may be, the continuall commerce I have with ancient humours, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of tho≈øe rich mindes of former ages doth bring me out of liking and di≈øta≈øte both of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and of my ≈øelfe, or that in truth we live in an age, which produceth things but meane and indifferent. So it is, that I know nothing worthy any great admiration. Al≈øo I know not many men ≈øo familiarly as I ≈øhould, to be able to judge of them: and tho≈øe with whom the quality of my condition doth ordinarily make me conver≈øant, are for the mo≈øt part, ≈øuch as have little care for the manuring of the ≈øoule, and to whom nothing is propo≈øed for chiefe felicitie, but honour; and for ab≈øolute perfection, but valour. What≈øoever I ≈øee or beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or worthy in any other man, I willingly commend and regard; yea and I often endeare my ≈øelfe with what I thinke of it, and allow my ≈øelfe to lie ≈øo farre forth: For, I cannot invent a fal≈øe ≈øubject. I willingly witne≈ø≈øe with my friends what I finde prai≈øe-worthy in them. And of an inch of valour, I willingly make an inch and a halfe; but to lend them qualities they have not, I cannot; and openly to defend their imperfections, I may not: yea bee they mine enemies, I ≈øhall ≈øincerely give them their due, in witne≈ø≈øing their worth or honour. My affection may change; my judgement never. And I confound not my quarrell with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circum≈øtances, that are impertinent and belong not vnto it. And I am ≈øo jealous of the liberty of my judgement, that for what pa≈ø≈øion ≈øo ever I can hardly quit it. I wrong my ≈øelfe more in lying, than him of whom I lie. This commendable and generous cu≈øtome of the Per≈øian nation, is much noted; <hi>They ≈øpake very honourably and iustly of their mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and with tho≈øe with whom they were at deadly fude and warre, ≈øo farre foorth as the merit of their vertue de≈øerved.</hi> I know divers men who have ≈øundry noble and worthy parts; ≈øome wit, ≈øome courage, ≈øome dexteritie, ≈øome con≈øcience, ≈øome a readine≈ø≈øe in ≈øpeech, ≈øome one Science, and ≈øome another; but of a great man in generall, and that hath ≈øo many excellent parts together, or but one, in ≈øuch a degree of excellencie, as hee may thereby bee admired, or but compared to tho≈øe of former ages whom we honour, my fortune hath not permitted me to ≈øee one. And the greate≈øt I ever knew living (I meane of naturall parts of the minde, and the be≈øt borne) was <hi>Stephanus de la Boitie:</hi> Verily it was a compleat minde, and who ≈øet a good face, and ≈øhewed a faire countenance vpon all matters: A minde after the old ≈øtampe, and which, had fortune therewith beene plea≈øed, would no doubt have brought forth wondrous effects; having by skill and ≈øtudy added very much to his rich naturall gifts. But I know not how it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, and ≈øurely it doth ≈øo, there is as much vanitie and weakene≈ø≈øe of vnder≈øtanding found in tho≈øe, that profe≈ø≈øe to have mo≈øt ≈øufficiencie, that will entermeddle with learned vacations, and with the charges that depend of bookes, than in any ≈øort of people; whether it be becau≈øe there is more required, and expected at their hands, and common faults cannot be excu≈øed in them, or that the ≈øelfe-opinion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge emboldeneth them the more to produce and di≈øcover them≈øelves over-forward, whereby they loo≈øe and betray them≈øelves.

Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ju≈øtice, him≈øelfe would take the paines to heare all parties: And although for curio≈øity ≈øake, he would enquire of ≈øuch as came before him, what religion they were of, neverthele≈ø≈øe the enmitie he bare to ours, did no whit weigh downe the ballance. Him≈øelfe made ≈øundrie good Lawes, and revoked diver≈øe ≈øub≈øidies and impo≈øitions, his Predece≈ø≈øours before him had receaved. We have two good Hi≈øtorians, as eye-witne≈ø≈øes of his actions. One of which, (who is <hi>Marcellinus</hi>) in ≈øundry places of his Hi≈øtorie bitterly reprooveth this ordinance of his, by which he forbade ≈øchooles, and interdicted all Chri≈øtian Rhethoricians, and Grama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to teach: Saying, he wi≈øhed this his action might be buried vnder ≈øilence. It is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had done any thing el≈øe more ≈øharpe or ≈øevere again≈øt vs, he would not have forgot it, as he that was well affected to our ≈øide. Hee was indeede very ≈øevere again≈øt vs, yet not a cruell enemie. For, our people them≈øelves report this Hi≈øtorie of him, that walking one day about the Citty of <hi>Calcedon, Maris</hi> Bi≈øhop thereof, dur≈øt call him wicked and traitor to Chri≈øt, to whom he did no other thing, but an≈øwered thus: Goe wretched man, weepe and deplore the lo≈ø≈øe of thine eyes; to whom the Bi≈øhop replyed, I thanke Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, that he hath deprived me of my ≈øight, that ≈øo I might not view thy impudent face, affecting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as they ≈øay) a kind of Philo≈øophicall patience. So it is, this part cannot be referred to the cruelties, which he is ≈øaid to have exerci≈øed again≈øt vs. He was (≈øaith <hi>Eutropius</hi> my other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony) an enemy vnto Chri≈øtianity, but without ≈øhedding of bloud. But to returne to his ju≈øtice, he can be accu≈øed of nothing but of the rigors he v≈øed in the beginning of his Empire, again≈øt ≈øuch as had followed the faction of <hi>Constantius</hi> his Predece≈ø≈øour. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ≈øobrietie, he ever lived a Souldiers kinde of life, and in time of peace, would feede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe, than one who prepared and enured him≈øelfe to the au≈øteritie of warre. Such was his vigilancie, that he divided the night into three or foure parts, the lea≈øt of which hee allotted vnto ≈øleepe; the re≈øt he employed in vi≈øiting the ≈øtate of his army, and his guardes, or in ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for, amonge≈øt other his rare qualities, he was mo≈øt excellent in all ≈øorts of learning. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that being laide down to re≈øt, fearing le≈øt ≈øleep ≈øhould divert him from his thoughts and ≈øtudies, he cau≈øed a ba≈øen to be ≈øet neere his bed ≈øide, and holding one of his handes out, with a brazen ball in it, that if ≈øleepe ≈øhould ≈øurprize him, loo≈øing his fingers endes, the ball falling into the ba≈øen, might with the noy≈øe rouze him from out his ≈øleepe. This man had a mind ≈øo bent to what he vndertook, and by rea≈øon of his ≈øingular ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinence ≈øo little troubled with vapours, that he might well have pa≈øt this devi≈øe. Touching military ≈øufficiencie, he was admirable in all partes belonging to a great Captaine.

Wee have no great memorie of any man, that either hath ≈øeene more dangers, nor that more often hath made triall of his per≈øon. His death hath ≈øome affinitie with that of <hi>Epaminoudas,</hi> for being ≈øtrucken with an arrow, and attempting to pull it out, he had ≈øurely done it, but that being ≈øharpe-cutting, it hurt and weakened his hand.

that ≈øo he might encourage his ≈øouldiers, who without him couragiou≈øly maintained the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, vntill ≈øuch time as darke night ≈øevered the Armies. Hee was beholding to Philo≈øophie for a ≈øingular centempt, both of him≈øelfe and of all humane things. Hee a≈ø≈øuredly believed the eternitie of ≈øoules. In matters of religion, he was vicious every-where. He was ≈øurnamed <hi>Apostata,</hi> becau≈øe he had for≈øaken ours; notwith≈øtanding this opinion ≈øeemes to mee more likely, that never tooke it to hart, but that for the obedience which he bare to the lawes, he di≈ø≈øembled til he had gotten the Empire into his hands. He was ≈øo ≈øuper≈øtitious in his, that even ≈øuch as lived in his time, and were of his owne religion, mocked him for it; and it was ≈øaide, that if he had gained the Victory of the Parthians, hee would have con≈øumed the race or breede of Oxen, to ≈øatisfie his ≈øacrifices. He was al≈øo be≈øetted with the Art of ≈øooth ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave authoritie to all manner of progno≈øtikes. Among≈øt other things hee ≈øpake at his death, he ≈øaide, he was much beholding to the Gods, and greatly thanked them, that they had not ≈øuffred him to be ≈ølaine ≈øodainely or by ≈øurprize, as having long before warned him both of the place and houre of his end; nor to die of a ba≈øe and ea≈øie death, more be≈øeeming idle and effeminate Per≈øons, nor of a lingring, langui≈øhing, and dolorous death; and that they had deemed him worthy to end his life ≈øo nobly in the cour≈øe of his victories and in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his glory. There had before appeared a vi≈øion vnto him, like vnto that of <hi>Marcus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> which fir≈øt threatned him in <hi>Gaule,</hi> and afterward even at the point of his death, pre≈øented it ≈øelfe to him in <hi>Per≈øia.</hi> The ≈øpeach he is made to ≈øpeake when he felt him≈øelfe hurt, <hi>Thou hast vanqui≈øhed √¥ Nazaraean;</hi> or as ≈øome wil have it; <hi>Content thy ≈øelf oh Nazaraean,</hi> would ≈øcarce have beene forgotten, had it beene believed of my te≈øtimonies, who being pre≈øent in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, have noted even the lea≈øt motions, and wordes at his death, no more than certaine other wonders, which they annex vnto it. But to returne to my theame, he had long before (as ≈øaith <hi>Marcellinus</hi>) hatched Pagani≈øme in his hart, but for≈øomuch as he ≈øaw all tho≈øe of his armie to be Chri≈øtians, he dur≈øt not di≈øcover him ≈øelfe. In the end, when he found him≈øelfe to be ≈øufficiently ≈øtrong, and dur≈øt publi≈øh his minde, he cau≈øed the Temples of his Gods to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and by all meanes endevoured to advance idolatrie. And to attaine his purpo≈øe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found in <hi>Constantinople</hi> the people very loo≈øe, and at ods with the Prelates of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian church, and cau≈øed them to appeare before him in his pallace, he in≈øtantly admoni≈øhed them to appea≈øe all their civill di≈ø≈øentions, and every one without hinderance or feare apply them≈øelves to follow and ≈øerve religion. Which he verie carefully ≈øollicited, hoping this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence might encrea≈øe the factions, and controver≈øies of the divi≈øion, and hinder the people, from growing to any vnity, and by con≈øequence from fortifying them≈øelves again≈øt him, by rea≈øon of their concord and in one mind-agreeing intelligence: having by the cruelty of ≈øome Chri≈øtians found, that <hi>There is no bea≈øt in the world, ≈øo much of man to be feared, as man.</hi> Loe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heere his very words, or very neare: Wherin this is worthy con≈øideration, that the Emperor <hi>Iulian,</hi> v≈øeth the ≈øame receipt of libertie of con≈øcience, to enkindle the trouble of civill di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øention, which our Kings employ to extingui≈øh.

                        <p>As farre as I remember I have read a like Hi≈øtory in ≈øome place of <hi>Appian,</hi> of one who purpo≈øing to e≈øcape the pro≈øcriptions of the <hi>Triumutrat</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to conceale him≈øelfe from the knowledge of tho≈øe who pur≈øued him, kept him≈øelfe clo≈øe and di≈øgui≈øed, adding this other invention to it, which was to counter feit blindne≈ø≈øe in one eye, who when he came ≈øomewhat to recouer his liberty, and would have left off the plai≈øter hee had long time worne over his eye, he found that vnder that maske he had altogether lo≈øt the ≈øight of it. It may be the action of his ≈øight was weakened, having ≈øo long continued without exerci≈øe and the vi≈øual vertue was wholy converted into the other eie: For, we may plainely perceive, that holding one eye ≈øhut, it convaieth ≈øome part of it's effect into his follow; in ≈øuch ≈øort as it

will ≈øwell and growe bigger. As al≈øo the idlenes, together with the warmth of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments and ≈øwathing, might very well drawe ≈øome goutie humor into the legge of <hi>Martials</hi> goutie ≈øellow. Reading in <hi>Frei≈øart,</hi> the vowe which a gallant troupe of young Engli≈øh-men had made, to weare their left eyes hoodwink's, vntill ≈øuch time as they ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe into <hi>France,</hi> and there performe ≈øome notable exploite of armes vpon vs, I have often laughed with my ≈øelfe to think what they would have imagined if as to the fore aleaged, it had hapned to them, and had all beene blinde of the left eye, at what time they returned to looke vpon their mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes, for who≈øe ≈øake they had made their vowe and vndertaken ≈øuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe. Mothers have great rea≈øon to chide their children when they counter≈øet to be blind with one eye, crompt backt, ≈øquint'-eyed, or lame, and ≈øuch other deformities of the body; for be≈øides that the body thus tender may ea≈øily receive ≈øome ill cu≈øtome, I know not how, it ≈øeemeth that fortune is glad to take vs at our word; And I have heard divers examples of ≈øome, who have falne ≈øicke in very deede, becau≈øe they had purpo≈øed to ≈øaine ≈øickenes. I have at all times enured my ≈øelfe, whether I be on hor≈øebacke or a foote, to carrie a good heavie wand or cudgell in my hand; yea I have endevored to doe it hand≈øomely, and with an effected kinde of countenance to continue ≈øo. Many have threatned me, that fortune will one time or other turne this my wantonnes into nece≈ø≈øitie. I pre≈øume vpon this, that I ≈øhould be the fir≈øt of my race, that ever was troubled with the gowt. But let vs ≈øomewhat amplifie this chapter, and patch it vp with another piece concerning blindnes. <hi>Plinie</hi> reports of one, who dreaming in his ≈øleepe, that he was blinde, awaking the next morning, was found to be ≈øtarke blinde, having never had any precedent ≈øickenes. The power of imagination may very well further ≈øuch things, as el≈øewhere I have ≈øhewed; And <hi>Plinie</hi> ≈øeemeth to be of this opinion; but it is more likely, that the motions, which the body ≈øelt inwardly (whereof Phi≈øitions, may if they plea≈øe, finde out the cau≈øe) and which tooke away his ≈øight, and were the occa≈øion of his dreame. Let vs al≈øo adde another ≈øtorie, concerning this purpo≈øe, which <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth in his Epi≈øtles. <hi>thou knowe≈øt</hi> (≈øaith he writing vnto <hi>Lucilius</hi>) <hi>that</hi> Harpa≈øte <hi>my wiues foole, is left vpon me as an hereditarie charge; for by mine owne nature, I am an enemie vnto ≈øuch mon≈øters, and if I have a de≈øire to laugh at a foole, I neede not ≈øeeke one farre; I laugh at my ≈øelfe.

For, if the contrarie hath not expre≈ø≈øely beene covenanted of all foure, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined party. If your fellow chance to faile, you have two vpon you, and not without rea≈øon: And to ≈øay, it is a Superchiery, as it is indeed: as being wel armed, to charge a man who hath but a piece of a ≈øword, or being ≈øound and ≈øtrong, to ≈øet vpon a man fore hurt. But if they bee advantages you have gotten fighting, you may v≈øe them without imputation. Di≈øparitie is not con≈øidered, and inequality is not balanced, but by the ≈øtate wherein the fight is begunne. As for the re≈øt you mu≈øt rely on fortune: and if alone or ≈øingle, you chance to have three vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, your other two companions being ≈ølaine, you have no more wrong done you, than I ≈øhould offer in Wars in ≈øtriking an enemie, whom at ≈øuch an advantage I ≈øhould finde grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with one of my Fellow Souldiers. The nature of ≈øocietie beareth, where troupe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt troupe (as where our Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> chalenged <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> one hundred again≈øt another hundred; three hundred again≈øt as many, as did the Argians again≈øt the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians; three to three, as were the <hi>Horatij</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Curatij</hi>) the pluralitie of either ≈øide is never re≈øpected for more than a ≈øingle man. Wher≈øoever there is company, the hazard is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed and di≈øordered. I have a private intere≈øt in this di≈øcour≈øe. For, my brother, the Lord of <hi>Matecoulom,</hi> being de≈øired in <hi>Rome,</hi> to ≈øecond and accompany a Gentleman, with whom he had no great acquaintance, who was defendant and challenged by another; The fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, my brother by chance found him≈øelfe confronted with one neerer and better knowne to him (I would faine be re≈øolved of the≈øe Lawes of honour, which ≈øo often ≈øhocke and trouble tho≈øe of rea≈øon) whom after he had vanqui≈øhed and di≈øpatched, ≈øeeing the two principalls of the quarrell yet ≈øtanding and vnhurt, he went to reskew his fellow. What could he do le≈ø≈øe? ≈øhould he have ≈øtoode ≈øtill, and (if chance would ≈øo have had it) ≈øee him defeated, for who≈øe defence he was entred the quarrell? What vntill then he had done was nothing to the purpo≈øe, and the quarrell was ≈øtill vndecided. All the curte≈øie you can, you ought ≈øurely v≈øe to your enemy, e≈øpecially when you have brought him vnder, and to ≈øome great di≈øadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; I know not how a man may v≈øe it, when anothers intere≈øt depends on it, where you are but acce≈ø≈øory, and where the quarrell is not yours. Hee could never be ju≈øt nor curteous, in hazard of him vnto whom he had lent him≈øelfe. So was he pre≈øently delivered out of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian pri≈øons by a ≈øpeedy and ≈øolemne letter of commendations from our King. Oh indi≈øcreete Nation! We are not contented to manife≈øt our follies, and bewray our vices to the world by reputation: but wee goe into forraine Nations and there in per≈øon ≈øhew them.

                           <hi>Shooting at Buts, Tiltings, Torneyes, Barriers, the true images of martiall combates, were the exerci≈øes of our forefathers.</hi> This other exerci≈øe is ≈øo much the le≈ø≈øe noble, by how much it re≈øpecteth but a private end; which again≈øt the lawes of ju≈øtice, teacheth vs to de≈øtroy one another, and euery way produceth euer mi≈øchievous effects. <hi>It is much more worthy, and beeter be≈øeeming, for a man to exerci≈øe him≈øelfe in things that a≈ø≈øure and offend not our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and which re≈øpect publike ≈øecuritie and generall glory. Publius Con≈øus,</hi> was the fir≈øt that ever in≈øtituted the Souldier to manage his armes by dexteritie and skill, and joyned arte vnto vertue, not for the v≈øe of private contentions, but for the wars and Roman peoples quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. A popular and civill manner of fencing. And be≈øides the example of <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Souldier, above all things, to aime and ≈øtrike at the face of <hi>Pompeyes</hi> men in the battell of <hi>Phar≈øalia:</hi> A thou≈øand other Chie≈øtaines and Generals have devi≈øed new fa≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of weapons, and new kindes of ≈øtriking, and covering of them≈øelves, according as the pre≈øent affaires required. But even as <hi>Philopoemen</hi> condemned wre≈øtling, wherein hee excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others, for≈øomuch as the preparations appertaining to this exerci≈øe differed from tho≈øe that belong to military di≈øcipline, to which he ≈øuppo≈øed, men of honour ≈øhould ammu≈øe and addict them≈øelves. Me thinkes al≈øo, that this nimblene≈ø≈øe or agilitie, to which men fa≈øhion and enure them≈øelves, their limbes, their turnings, windings, and timble-quicke motions, wherein youth is in≈øtructed and trained in this new ≈øchoole, are not onely vnprofitable, but rather contrary and domageable for the v≈øe of militarie combate: And we ≈øee our men doe commonly employ particular weapons, in their fence ≈øchooles, and peculiarly appointed for that purpo≈øe. And I have ≈øeene it di≈øallowed, that a gentleman chalenged to fight with Rapier and Dagger, ≈øhould pre≈øent him≈øelfe in the equipage of a man at armes; or that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhould offer to come with his cloake in≈øteade of a Dagger. It is worthy the noting, that <hi>Lachaz</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> ≈øpeaking of an apprenti≈ølage, how to manage armes, conformable to ours, ≈øaith, he could never ≈øee any notable warrior come of a ≈øchoole of fence, and e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from among the mai≈øters. As for them our owne experience confirmes as much. And for the re≈øt we may at lea≈øt ≈øay, they are ≈øufficiencies of no relation or corre≈øpondencie. And in the in≈øtitution of the children of his Common wealth, <hi>Plato</hi> interdicts the artes of ≈øtriking or playing with fi≈øts, devi≈øed by <hi>Amycus</hi> and <hi>Epeius,</hi> and to wre≈øtle, invented by <hi>Anthoeus</hi> and <hi>Cecyo:</hi> becau≈øe they aime at another end, then to adapt youth to warlike ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

and have no affinitie with it. But I digre≈ø≈øe much from my theame. The Emperour <hi>Mauricius,</hi> being forewarned by dreames<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and ≈øundry progno≈øtications, that one <hi>Phocas</hi> a Souldier at that time yet vnknowne, ≈øhould kill him, demanded of <hi>Philip</hi> his ≈øonne in law, who that <hi>Phocas</hi> was, his nature, his conditions, and cu≈øtomes, and how among≈øt other things <hi>Philip</hi> told him, he was a fainte, cowardly, and timorousfellow: The Emperour thereby pre≈øently concluded, that he was both cruell and a murtherer.

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Finde by experience, that there is great difference betweene the ≈øodaine fits and fanta≈øies of the ≈øoule, and a re≈øolute di≈øpo≈øition and con≈øtant habitude: And I ≈øee, there is nothing but we may attaine vnto, yea, as ≈øome ≈øay, to exceede Divinitie it ≈øelfe; for≈øomuch as it is more to become impa≈ø≈øible of him≈øelfe, then to be ≈øo by his originall condition: And that one may joyne a re≈øolution and a≈ø≈øurance of God to mans imbecilitie. But it is by fits. And in the lives of tho≈øe Heroes or noble worthies of former ages, are often found wonderfull parts, and which ≈øeeme greatly to exceede our naturall forces: but they are prankes or parts con≈øonant to truth: and it may hardly be believed, mans ≈øoule may ≈øo be tainted and fed with tho≈øe ≈øo high-rai≈øed conditions, that vnto it they may become as ordinary and naturall. It hapneth vnto our ≈øelves, who are but abortiue broodes of men, ≈øometimes to rowze our ≈øoule farre beyond her ordinary pitch, as ≈øtirred vp by the di≈øcour≈øes, or provoked by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others. But it is a kinde of pa≈ø≈øion, which vrgeth, mooveth, agitateth and in ≈øome ≈øorte ravi≈øheth her from out her ≈øelfe: for, that gu≈øt overblowne, and ≈øtorme pa≈øt, we ≈øee, it will vnawares vnbend and loo≈øe it ≈øelfe, if not to the lowe≈øt pitch, at lea≈øt to be no more the ≈øame ≈øhe was, ≈øo that vpon every ≈ølight occa≈øion, for a bird lo≈øt, or for a gla≈ø≈øe broken, we ≈øuffer our ≈øelves to be mooved and di≈øtempered very neere as one of the vulgar ≈øort. <hi>Fxcept order, moderation and con≈øtancie, I imagine all things may bee done by an indifferent and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive man.</hi> Therefore ≈øay wi≈øemen, that directly to judge of a man, his common actions mu≈øt ≈øpecially be controuled, and he mu≈øt every day be ≈øurpri≈øed in his worky-day clothes. <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rho,</hi> who framed ≈øo plea≈øant a Science of ignorance, a≈ø≈øaide (as all other true Philo≈øophers) to fa≈øhion his life an≈øwerable to his doctrine. And fora≈ømuch as hee maintained the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of mans judgement, to be ≈øo extreame, as it could take nor re≈øolution, nor inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and would perpetually ≈øu≈øpend it, ballancing, beholding and receiving all things, as indifferent: It is reported of him, that he ever keept him≈øelfe after one fa≈øhion, looke and countenance: If he had begunne a di≈øcour≈øe, he would end it, though the party to whom he ≈øpake, were gone: And if he went any where, he would not goe an inche out of his path, what let or ob≈øtacle ≈øomever came in his way; being kept from falls, from cartes or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents by his friends. For, to feare or ≈øhunne any thing, had beene to ≈øhocke his propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which remooved all election and certainty from his very ≈øen≈øes. He ≈øometimes ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him≈øelfe to be cut and cautherized, with ≈øuch con≈øtancie, as he was never ≈øeene ≈øo much as to ≈øhrug, twitch, move or winke with his eyes. It is ≈øomething to bring the minde to the≈øe imaginations, but more to joine the effects vnto it, yet is it not impo≈ø≈øible. But to joyne them with ≈øuch pre≈øeverance and con≈øtancie, as to e≈øtabli≈øh it for an ordinary cour≈øe; verily in the≈øe enterpri≈øes ≈øo farre from common v≈øe, it is almo≈øt incredible to be done. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is this, that he was ≈øometimes found in his hou≈øe, bitterly ≈øcolding with his ≈øi≈øter, for which being reproved, as hee that wronged his indifferencie: What? ≈øaid hee, <hi>mu≈øt this ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman al≈øo ≈øerve as a witne≈ø≈øe to my rules?</hi> Another time, being found to defend him≈øelfe from a dog: <hi>It is</hi> (replied he) <hi>very hard, altogether to dispoyle and ≈øhake off man:</hi> And man mu≈øt endevour and enforce him≈øelfe to re≈øi≈øt and confront all things, fir≈øt by effects, but if the wor≈øt befall, by rea≈øon and by di≈øcour≈øe.

If they be per≈øons of meane quality, the dead mans body is carried to the place where they intend to bury him, and there he is placed ≈øitting; his Widdow kneeling before him with hir armes clo≈øe about his middle, and ≈øo keepeth hir≈øelfe, while≈øt a Wall is erected vp about them both, which rai≈øed to the height of her ≈øhoulders, ≈øome of her kindred taking her by the head behind, wrings her neck about; and having given the la≈øt ga≈øpe, the wall is immediately made vp clo≈øe over their heades, wherein they remaine buried. In the ≈øame Country, there was ≈øomething like to this in their Gymno≈øophi≈øts, or wi≈øe-men, who not by meanaces-or compul≈øions of others, nor by the violence of a ≈øodaine humour but by the expre≈ø≈øe and voluntary profe≈ø≈øion of their rule, their maner was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they attained vnto a certaine age, or ≈øaw them≈øelves threatned by ≈øome ≈øickene≈ø≈øe, to cau≈øe a pile of Wood to be erected, and vpon it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>a rich bedde; and having cheerefully fea≈øted their friends and acquaintance, with ≈øuch a re≈øolution laide them≈øelves downe in that bedde, that fire ≈øet vnto it, they were never ≈øeene to ≈øtirre nor hand nor foote? and thus died one of them, named <hi>Calanus,</hi> in the pre≈øence of all the army of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. And who had not ≈øo made him≈øelfe away, was neither e≈øteemed holy nor ab≈øolutely happy among≈øt them? ≈øending his ≈øoule purged and purified by fire, after it had con≈øumed what≈øoever was mortall and iterre≈øtriall in it. This con≈øtant premeditation of al the life, is that which makes the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

The hapning makes the ≈øcience or knowledge, and not knowledge the happening. What we ≈øee come to pa≈ø≈øe, happeneth; but it might come to pa≈ø≈øe otherwi≈øe. And God in the eternall regi≈øter of the cau≈øes of happenings, which he hath in his pre≈øcience, hath al≈øo tho≈øe, which are called ca≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and the voluntary, which depend of the liberty, he hath given vnto our free wil, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth we ≈øhall faile, becau≈øe our will ≈øhall have beene to faile.

A notable man, great in yeares, in name, in dignity and in learning, vaunted him≈øelfe vnto me, that he was induced to a certaine mo≈øt important change of his religion, by a ≈øtrange and fanta≈øticall incitation: and in all things ≈øo il-concluding that I deemed the ≈øame ≈øtronger and more forcible, being taken contrary. He termed it a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and ≈øo did I, but in a different ≈øen≈øe. Their hi≈øtorians ≈øay, that per≈øwa≈øion having po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularly beene ≈øcattered among≈øt the Turkes, of the fatall and inflexible pre≈øcription of their dayes, doth apparantly ayde to warrant and emboulden them in dangers. And I know a great Prince, who happily thrives by it, be it he beleive it, or take it for an excu≈øe to hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe extraordinarily; provided fortune be not ≈øoone wearie to favour and backe him. There hath not happened in our memorie a more admirable effect of re≈øolution, than of tho≈øe two villaines that con≈øpired the death of the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> It is ≈øtrange how, the la≈øt, who perfourmed the ≈øame could be induced or encouraged to vndergoe ≈øuch an enterpri≈øe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his fellow (though he had re≈øolutely attempted it, and had all might be required for ≈øuch an action) had ≈øo ill ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, and mi≈øcarried. And <hi>in the≈øe ≈øteps, and with the ≈øame weapons, to goe and vndertake a Lord, armed with ≈øo late an in≈øtruction of di≈øtrust; mighty in friends and followers; pui≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant of bodily ≈øtrength; in his owne hall; amidde≈øt his ≈øervants and guarde; and in a Citty wholy at his devotion. It mu≈øt of force be ≈øaide, that in perfourming it, he employed a well-directed and re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lute hand, and a dreadle≈ø≈øe courage mooved by a vigorous pa≈ø≈øion.</hi> A Poynard is more ≈øure to wound a man, which for≈øomuch as it requireth more motion and vigor of the arme, than a pi≈øtole, it's ≈øtroke is more ≈øubject to be hindred or avoided. That the fir≈øt ranne not to an a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured death, I make no great doubt, for the hopes wherewith hee might be entertained could not harbour in a well ≈øetled and re≈øolute minde; and the conduct of his exploit, ≈øheweth, hee wanted no more that, then courage. The motions of ≈øo forcible a per≈øwa≈øion may be diver≈øe; for, our fanta≈øie di≈øpo≈øeth of her ≈øelfe and of vs as ≈øhe plea≈øeth. The execution committed neere <hi>Orleans</hi> had no coherence with this, wherein was more hazard, then vigor; the blow was not mortall, had not fortune made it ≈øo: and the enterpri≈øe to ≈øhoote on hor≈øe-backe and farre-off, and to one who mooved ≈øtill according to the motion of his hor≈øe was the attempt of a man, that rather loved to mi≈ø≈øe of his effect, then faile to ≈øave him≈øelfe. What followed did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly ≈øhew it. For, he was ≈øo amazed &amp; drunken with the thought of ≈øo haughty an execution, as he lo≈øt all his ≈øen≈øes, both to worke his e≈øcape, and direct his tongue in his an≈øweres. What needed he have done more, then recover his friends by cro≈ø≈øing of a river; It is a meane, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have ca≈øt my ≈øelfe in farre le≈ø≈øe dangers, and which I thinke of ≈ømall hazard, how broade ≈øoever, alwayes provided your hor≈øe finde an ea≈øie entrance, and on the further ≈øide you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øee an ea≈øie and ≈øhallow landing, according to the cour≈øe of the ≈øtreame of the water. The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when the horrible ≈øentence was pronounced again≈øt him, an≈øwered ≈øtowtly, <hi>I was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it, and I ≈øhall amaze you with my patience.</hi> The A≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øines, a nation depending of <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> are e≈øteemed among the Mahometi≈øts of a ≈øoveraigne devotion and puritie of maners; they hold, that the readie≈øt and ≈øhorte≈øt way to gaine Paradi≈øe, is to kill ≈øome one of a contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: therefore hath it often beene ≈øeene, that one or two in their bare doublets have vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to a≈ø≈øault mightie enemies, with the price of an a≈ø≈øured death, and without any care of their owne danger.

Neverthele≈ø≈øe I finde him ≈øomewhat malapert and bolde in that pa≈ø≈øage of his <hi>Methode of Historie,</hi> when he accu≈øeth <hi>Plutarke,</hi> not onely of ignorance (wherein I woulde have let him ≈øay his plea≈øure, for that is not within my element) but al≈øo that he often writeth, things, altogether incredible and meerely fabulous (the≈øe are his very words) If he had ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ≈øaid things otherwi≈øe than they are, it had beene no great reprehen≈øion: for, what we have not ≈øeene, we receive from others and vpon tru≈øt: And I ≈øee him ≈øometime, wittingly and in good earne≈øt report one and ≈øame ≈øtory diver≈øly: As, the judgemenns of three be≈øt captaines that ever were, ≈øpoken by <hi>Hanibal,</hi> is otherwi≈øe in <hi>Flaminius</hi> his life, &amp; otherwi≈øe in <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> But to taxe him, to have taken incredible and impo≈ø≈øible things for ready payment, is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe the more judicious author of the World of want of judgement.

And ≈øome there be le≈ø≈øe credible. As amonge≈øt others, that which he reportes of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who being fore wounded, gave ≈øo great a blow with a ≈øword vnto one of his enemies, armed at all a≈ø≈øayes, and with all pieces, as he cleft him from the Crowne of the head downe to the groine, ≈øo that the body fell in two pieces.

There was nothing according to their cu≈øtome, ≈øo much called their reputation in que≈øtion, and for which they endured more blame and ≈øhame, than to be ≈øurpri≈øed ≈øtealing. I am ≈øo well in≈øtructed of tho≈øe mens greatne≈ø≈øe of courage, that this report, doth not onely not ≈øeeme incredible to mee, as to <hi>Bodine,</hi> but I doe not ≈øo much as deeme it rare, or ≈øuppo≈øe it ≈øtrange: The Spartane ≈øtory is full of thou≈øands of much more rare and cruell examples; then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rate, it containeth nothing but myracle. Concerning this point of ≈øtealing, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> reporteth, that while≈øt hee lived, there could never be found any kinde of torment that might in any ≈øort compell the Aegyptians ≈øurprized filching (which was much v≈øed amonge≈øt them) to confe≈ø≈øe and tell but their names. A Spani≈øh Pea≈øant being laide vpon the racke, about the complices of the murther of the Pretor <hi>Lucius Pi≈øo,</hi> in the mid≈øt of his torments cried out, his friends ≈øhould not ≈øtir, but with all ≈øecuritie a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, &amp; that it was not in the power of any griefe or paine to wre≈øt one word of confe≈ø≈øion from him: and the fir≈øt day nothing el≈øe could po≈ø≈øibly be drawne from him: The next morrow as he was led toward the racke, to be tormented a new, he by ≈øtrong violence freed him≈øelfe from out his keepers hands, and ≈øo furiou≈øly ranne with his head again≈øt a Wall, that he bur≈øt his braines out, and pre≈øently fell downe dead. <hi>Epicharis,</hi> having glutted &amp; wearied the moody cruelty of <hi>Neroes</hi> Satellites or officers, and ≈øtoutly endured their fire, their beatings, &amp; their engins a whole day long, without any one voyce, or word of revealing hir con≈øpiracy, &amp; the next day after, being againe brought to the torture, with hir limbs bruzed &amp; broken, convayed the lace or ≈øtring of hir Gowne over one of the pillers of the Chaire wherein ≈øhe ≈øate, with a ≈øliding knot in it, into which ≈øodainely thru≈øting hir head, ≈øhe ≈øtrangled her≈øelfe with the weight of hir body: Having the courage to dye ≈øo, and ≈øteale from the fir≈øt torments; ≈øeemeth ≈øhee not purpo≈øely to have lent hir life to the triall of hir patience of the precedent day, only to mocke that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and encorage others to attempt the like enterprize again≈øt him? And he that ≈øhall enquire of our Argolettiers or Free-booters, what experiences they have had in the≈øe our late Civill wars, ≈øhall no doubt find effects &amp; examples of patience, of ob≈øtinacy and ≈øtif-neckedne≈ø≈øe in the≈øe our mi≈øerable dayes, and amid≈øt the effeminate, and puling worldlings farre beyond the Aegyptian, and well worthy to be compared to tho≈øe already reported of Spartan vertue. I know, there have beene found ≈øeely boores, who have rather endured to have their feet broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon a Greedyron, their fingers ends cru≈øht and wrung with the locke of a Pi≈øtole, their eyes all bloody to be thru≈øt out of their heades with wringing and wre≈øting of a corde aboute their foreheads, before they would ≈øo much as be ran≈øomed.

but to grieve and terrifie him, and who had patiently endured all that, and lo≈øt both ≈øpeech and ≈øen≈øe, fully re≈øolved (as him≈øelfe told me) rather to die a thou≈øand deaths (as verily, if you apprehend what he ≈øuffered, he pa≈øt more then one full death) then promi≈øe any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome; yet was he one of the wealthie≈øt husbandmen in all his countrie. How many have bin ≈øeene, who have patiently endured to be burnt and ro≈øted for vnknowne and wilful opinions, which they had borrowed of others: My ≈øelfe have knowne a hundred and a hundred wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for, the ≈øaying is, Gaskoine heads have ≈øome prerogative in that) whom you might ≈øooner have made to bite a red-hot piece of yron, then recant an opinion, they had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in anger.

And he who fir≈øt invented the tale of that woman, which by no threates or ≈øtripes, would leave to call her husband pricke-low≈øe, and being ca≈øt into a pond and duckt vnder water, lifted vp her hands, and joyning her two thumbs-nailes in act to kill lice above her head, ≈øeemed to call him lou≈øie ≈øtill, devi≈øed a fable, whereof in truth we dayly ≈øee the expre≈ø≈øe image in divers womens ob≈øtinacie and wilfulne≈ø≈øe.

And doubtle≈ø≈øe, it was al≈øo embelli≈øhed with ≈øundry rare ≈øeedes of vertue. I meane lively, natural and not counter≈øets.

                        <p>The examples of his mildne≈ø≈øe and clemencie, towards ≈øuch as had offended him, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: I meane, be≈øides tho≈øe he ≈øhewed during the civill warres, which (as by his owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings may plainely appeare) he v≈øed to blandi≈øh and allurehis enemies, to make them feare his future domination and victorie the le≈ø≈øe.

To ≈øuch of his Captaines as fled from him, to procure other conditions, he ≈øent them their weapons, their hor≈øes and all other furniture. The Citties he had taken by maine force, he freed to follow what faction they would, giving them no other gari≈øon, then the memorie of his clemencie and mildnes. In the day of his great battaile of <hi>Phar≈øalia,</hi> he expre≈øly inhibited, that vnle≈ø≈øe they were driven to vnavoidable extremitie, no man ≈øhould lay hands vpon any Romane cittizen. In my judgement the≈øe are very hazardous partes, and it is no wonder, if in the civill warres or tumultuous broiles, we have now on foote, tho≈øe that fight for the ancient lawes and ≈øtate of their countrie, as he did, doe not follow and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example.

                        <p>IT is reported of divers chiefe Generals in warre, that they have particularly affected ≈øome peculiar booke or other: as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great highly e≈øteemed <hi>Homer; Scipio Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eanus, Xenophon: Marcus Brutus, Polybius; Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Philip de Comines:</hi> And it is lately averred, that in ≈øome places, and with ≈øome men, <hi>Machiavell</hi> is much accompted of: But our late Mar≈øhall <hi>Strozzi,</hi> who had made e≈øpeciall choi≈øe to love <hi>Cae≈øar;</hi> without doubt, I thinke of all other cho≈øe be≈øt: for truely he ought to be the Breviarie of all true Souldiers, as beeing the ab≈øolute and perfect chiefe patterne of Military profe≈ø≈øion And God hee knowes with what grace, and with what decorum, hee hath embelli≈øhed this rich ≈øubject, with ≈øo pure a kinde of ≈øpeech, ≈øo plea≈øing and ≈øo ab≈øolutely perfect, that to my ta≈øte, there are no writing in the world, which in this ≈øubject may bee compared to his. I will heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter certaine particular and rare parts concerning his maner of warre, which yet remaine in my memory. His Armie beeing ≈øome what afrighted, vpon the report that ranne of the great forces, which king <hi>Iuba</hi> brought again≈øt him, in≈øtead of abating the opinion his ≈øoldiers had conceived of it, and to dimini≈øh the meanes or forces of his enemie, having cau≈øed them
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:12117:212"/>
to be a≈ø≈øembled altogether, thereby to a≈ø≈øure and incourage them, he tooke a cleane contrary cour≈øe, to that which in like ca≈øes we are accu≈øtomed to do: for he bad them troble them≈øelves no more to finde out the number of the forces, which his enemies brought again≈øt him, for him≈øelfe had already true knowledge &amp; certaine intelligence of them: and told them a number farre exceeding both the truth and report of them: following what <hi>Cyrus</hi> commandeth in <hi>Xenophon.</hi> For a ≈ømuch as the deceipt is not of like interre≈øt, for a man to finde his enemies in effect weaker then he hoped, then ≈øtronger indeede, having once conceived an opinion of their weakene≈ø≈øe. He enured all his Souldiers ≈øimply to obey, without controling, gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaying, or ≈øpeaking of their captaines de≈ø≈øeignes, which he never communicated vnto them, but vpon the la≈øt point of execution: and was plea≈øed, if by chance they had any inkling of them, ≈øo to deceive them, pre≈øently to change his opinion: And having prefixt a place to quarter-in at night, hee hath often beene ≈øeene to march further, and lengthen his journey, namely if the weather were foule, or if it rained. The Swizzers in the beginning of his warres in <hi>Gaule,</hi> having ≈øent toward him to give them free pa≈ø≈øage through the Roman coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and he being re≈øolved by force to empeach them, did notwith≈øtanding ≈øhew them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good lookes, and tooke, certaine dayes re≈øpit to give them an an≈øwere, during which time he might have lea≈øure to a≈ø≈øemble his Armie together. The≈øe poore people knew not how well he could husband time: For he often repeated, that <hi>the skill to embrace occa≈øisons in the nicke, is the chiefe≈øt parte of an ab≈øolute Captaine:</hi> And truely the diligence he v≈øed in all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, is incredible; and the like was never heard of. If he were not over con≈øciencious in that vnder colour of ≈øome treatie, parlie or accord, to take any advantage of his enemies: hee was as little ≈øcrupulous, in that <hi>he required no other vertue in his Souldiers but valour;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept mutinie and di≈øobedience, he puni≈øhed not grealy other vices. After his victories, hee often gave them the reines to all licentiou≈øne≈ø≈øe, for a while di≈øpen≈øing them from all rules of military di≈øcipline; ≈øaying moreover his ≈øouldiers were ≈øo well in≈øtructed, that though they were in theit gaye≈øt clothes, pranked vp, musked and perfumed, they would notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding runne furiou≈øly to any combate. And in truth hee loved to ≈øee them richly armed, and made them weare gilt, graven and ≈øilvered armours, that their care to keepe them cleane and bright, might make them more fierce, and readie to defend them≈øelves. Speaking to them, hee ever called them by the name of Fellow-≈øouldiers; a name v≈øed at this day by ≈øome Captaines; which his ≈øucce≈ø≈øour <hi>Augustus</hi> afterward reformed, e≈øteeming hee had done it for the nece≈ø≈øitie of his affaires, and to flatter the hearts of tho≈øe which followed him but voluntarily;</p>

Verely his tongue hath indivers places much be≈øtead, and done him notable ≈øervice, and even whil≈øt hee lived, his militarie eloquence was ≈øo highly regarded, that many of his Armie were ≈øeene to copie and keepe his orations; by which meanes divers volumes were filled with them, and continued many ages after his death, His ≈øpeech had particular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ≈øo that his familiar friends, and namely <hi>Augu≈øtus,</hi> hearing that rehear≈øed, which had beene collected of his, knew by the Phra≈øes and words, what was his or not.

But where occa≈øions of nece≈ø≈øitie were offered, and where the ≈øubject required it, there was never man that ≈øo little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his per≈øon. As for me, me ≈øeemeth I reade indivers of his exploits, a certaine re≈øolution rather to loo≈øe him≈øelfe, than to abide the brunt or ≈øhame to bee overthrowne. In that great battell, which he fought again≈øt tho≈øe of <hi>Turnay,</hi> ≈øeeing the vangarde of his Armie ≈øomewhat enclining to route, even as hee was, without ≈øhield or target, hee ranne headlong to the front of his enemies: Which many other times happened vnto him. Hearing once how his men were be≈øieged, hee pa≈øt di≈øguized through the mid≈øt and thicke≈øt of his enemies campe, ≈øo to encourage and awe them with his pre≈øence. Having cro≈ø≈øed the way to <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> with verie few forces, and perceiving the re≈øt of his Armie (the Conduct whereof hee had left vnto <hi>Antonius,</hi>) to bee ≈øomewhat ≈ølowe in comming, hee vndertooke all alone, to repa≈ø≈øe the Sea, notwith≈øtanding a violent and raging Tempe≈øt; and ≈øecretly ≈øtole him≈øelfe away to fetch the re≈øt of his forces: All the havens on that ≈øide, yea and all the Sea being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by <hi>Pompey,</hi> And concerning the enterpri≈øes hee vnder-went with armed hand, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, which in re≈øpect of the hazard, exceede all di≈øcour≈øe of militarie rea≈øon: for, with how weake meanes vndertooke hee to ≈øubdue the Kingdome of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and afterward to front the forces of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Iuta,</hi> which were tenne partes greater than his?

Which hee notwith≈øtanding vnder went: And after he had obtained ≈øo notable a battell of tho≈øe which were without, hee ≈øoone reduced tho≈øe that were be≈øieged in the Towne to his mercy.

The other point, which ≈øeemeth to be repugnant both vnto cu≈øtome and rea≈øon of Warre, is, that <hi>

But to returne to <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> hee became in time ≈øomewhat more ≈ølow, hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and con≈øiderate, as witne≈ø≈øeth his familiar friend <hi>Oppius;</hi> deeming, he ≈øhould not ≈øo ea≈øily hazard the honour of ≈øo many Victories which one onely di≈øa≈øter, or mi≈ø-encounter, might make him loo≈øe. It is that the Italians are wont to ≈øay, when they will or blame or reproach any man with this overdaring, or ra≈øh fond-hardine≈øle, which is often ≈øeene in yoong men, calling them, <hi>Bi≈øogno≈øid honore,</hi> as much to ≈øay as needie of honour: And that being yet hungrie, greedy and voyde of reputation, they have rea≈øon to ≈øeeke after it, what≈øoever it may co≈øt them; Which they ≈øhould never doe, that have already acquired the ≈øame.

At what time ≈øoever hee went to fight, he was accu≈øtomed to weare a verie rich garment, and of a ≈øheene and gari≈øh colour, that ≈øo he might the better be marked. When his Souldiers were neere≈øt vnto their enemies, he re≈øtrained and kept them very ≈øhort. When the ancient Graecians would accu≈øe or tax any man of extreame in≈øufficiencie, they v≈øed this common Proverbe; <hi>That he could neyther read nor ≈øwimme:</hi> And him≈øelfe was of this opinion, that the arte of ≈øwimming was mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary and beneficiall in Warre, and a Souldier might reape divers commodities by it. If hee were in ha≈øte, and to make ≈øpeede, he would ordinarily ≈øwimme over al the Rivers hee met withal: and loved greatly to travell on foote, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was wont. In <hi>Aegypt</hi> being on a time forced (to ≈øave him≈øelfe) to leape into a little Whirry or Boate, and ≈øo many of his people following him, that he was in danger to ≈øinke, hee rather cho≈øe to fling him≈øelfe into the Sea, which he did; and ≈øwimming came into his fleete, that was more than two hundred paces from him, holding his writing-Tables in his left hand out of the Water, and with his teeth drawing his Coate of Armes after him, that his enemies might not enjoy it: and this did hee being well ≈øtrucken in yeares.

To ≈øuch as are at the bathes, it is more healthfull to eat but little at night, that the water they are to drinke the next morning, finding the ≈øtomacke empty, and without any ob≈øtacle, it may worke the greater operation: on the other ≈øide, it is better to eat but a little at dinner, le≈øt a man might hinder the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the water, which is not yet perfect, and not to charge the ≈øtomacke ≈øo ≈øuddenly, after this other travell, and leave the office of dige≈øting vnto the night, which can better do it then the day; the body and ≈øpirit being then in continuall motion and action.

Loe heere the fir≈øt of my tales.

It is very likely they were ≈øuch ≈øtones as ours be, and cozen-germanes to them; which if it be, it is but vaine for ≈øuch as be troubled with the ≈øtone or gravell to hope to be cured, by meanes of a bea≈øts-blood, that was drawing neere vnto death, and ≈øuffered the ≈øame di≈øea≈øe. For, to aleadge the blood cannot participate of that contagion', and doth no whit thereby alter his accu≈øtomed vertue, it may rather be inferred, that nothing ingendreth in a body, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent and communication of all the parts.

                        <p>I was not long ≈øince in a company, where I wot not who of my fraternity, brought newes of a kinde of pilles, by true accompt, compo≈øed of a hundered and odde ≈øeverall ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; Whereat we laughed very heartily, and made our ≈øelves good ≈øport: For, what rocke ≈øo hard were able to re≈øi≈øt the ≈øhocke, or with≈øtand the force of ≈øo thicke and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a battery? I vnder≈øtand neverthele≈ø≈øe, of ≈øuch as tooke of them, that the lea≈øt graine gravell dained not to ≈øtirre at all. I cannot ≈øo ≈øoone give over writing of this ≈øubject, but I mu≈øt needes ≈øay a word or two, concerning the experience they have made of their pre≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they would have vs take as a warrantize or a≈ø≈øurance of the certainty of their drugges and potions. The greate≈øt number, and as I deeme, more than the two thirds of medicinable vertues, con≈øi≈øt in the quinte≈ø≈øence or ≈øecret propriety of ≈øimples, whereof we can have no other in≈øtruction but v≈øe and cu≈øtome. For, <hi>Quinte≈ø≈øence is no other thing than a quality, whereof we cannot with our rea≈øon finde out the cau≈øe.</hi> In ≈øuch trials or experiments, tho≈øe which they affirme to have acquired by the in≈øpiration of ≈øome Daemon, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to receive and allow of them (for, touching myracles, I meddle not with them) or be it the experiments drawne from things, which for other re≈øpects fall often in v≈øe with vs: As if in Wooll, wherewith we wont to cloth our ≈øelves, ≈øome ≈øecret ex≈øiccating or drying quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have by accident beene found, that cureth kibes or chilblaines in the heeles; and if in reddi≈øhes, we eat for nouri≈øhment, ≈øome opening or aperitive operation have beene di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that a Leprous man chanced to be cured, by meanes of a Cuppe of Wine he had drunke, for≈øomuch as a Viper was by fortune fallen into the Wine caske. In which example we finde the meane, and a very likely directory to this experience. As al≈øo in tho≈øe, to which Phy≈øitions affirme, to have beene addre≈ø≈øed by the examples of ≈øome bea≈øts. But in mo≈øt of other experiences, to which they ≈øay they came by fortune, and had no other guide but hazard, I finde the progre≈ø≈øe of this information incredible. I imagine man, heedfully viewing about him the infinite number of things, creatures, plants and met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. I wot not where to make him beginne his E≈ø≈øay; And ≈øuppo≈øe he ca≈øt his fir≈øt fanta≈øie vpon an Elkes-Horne, to which an ea≈øie and gentle credulity mu≈øt be given; he will be as farre to ≈øeeke, and as much troubled in his ≈øecond operation: So, many di≈øea≈øes and ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall circum≈øtances are propo≈øed vnto him, that before he come to the certainty of this point, vnto which the perfection of his experience ≈øhould arrive, mans wit ≈øhall be to ≈øeeke, and not know where to turne him≈øelfe; And before (amidde≈øt this infinity of things) hee finde out what this Horne is: Among≈øt the numberle≈ø≈øe di≈øea≈øes that are, what an Epilep≈øie is; the ≈øundrie and manifolde complexions in a melancholy man; So many ≈øea≈øons in Winter: So diver≈øe Nations among≈øt French-men; So many ages in age; So diver≈øe coele≈øtiall changes and alterations, in the conjunction of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Saturne;</hi> So ≈øeverall and many partes in a mans body, nay in one of his fingers. To all which being neyther guided by argument, nor by conjecture, nor by example, or divine in≈øpiration, but by the one ly motion of fortune; it were mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary, it ≈øhould be by a perfectly artificiall, well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and methodicall fortune. Moreover, ≈øuppo≈øe the di≈øea≈øe thorowly cured, how ≈øhall he re≈øt a≈ø≈øured, but that eyther the evill was come to his vtmo≈øt period, or that an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the hazard, cau≈øed the ≈øame health? Or the operation of ≈øome other thing, which that day he had eyther eaten, drunke or touched? or whether it were by the merite of his Grand-mothers prayers? Be≈øides, ≈øuppo≈øe this experiment to have beene perfect, how many times was it applied and begun a new; And how often was this long and tedious web of fortunes and encounters woven over againe, before a certaine rule might be concluded?

                        <p>MAdame, the la≈øt time it plea≈øed you to come and vi≈øite me, you found me vpon this point. And becau≈øe it may be, the≈øe toyes of mine may happily come to your hands: I would have them witne≈ø≈øe, their Authour reputeth him≈øelfe highly honoured, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours it ≈øhall plea≈øe you to ≈øhew them. Wherein you ≈øhall di≈øcerne the very ≈øame demeanor and ≈øelfe-countenance, you have ≈øeene in his conver≈øa≈øion. And could I have a≈ø≈øumed vnto my ≈øelfe any other fa≈øhion, than mine owne accu≈øtomed, or more honourable and better forme, I would not have done it: For, all I ≈øeeke to reape by my writings, is, they will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repre≈øent and to the life, pourtray me to your remembrance. The very ≈øame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and faculties, it plea≈øed your Lady-≈øhip to frequent and receive, with much more honor and curte≈øie, than they any way de≈øerve, I will place and reduce (but without alteration and change) into a ≈øolide body, which may happily continue ≈øome daies and yeares after mee: Where, when ≈øoever it ≈øhall plea≈øe you to refre≈øh your memory with them, you may ea≈øily finde them, without calling them to remembrance; which they ≈øcar≈øely de≈øerve. I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to continue the favour of your Friend-≈øhip towards mee, by the ≈øame qualities, through who≈øe meanes it was produced. I labour not to be beloved more and e≈øteemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being dead, than alive.

If I were one of tho≈øe, to whom the World my be indebted for prai≈øe, I would quit it for the one moytie, on condition it would pay me before-hand: And that the ≈øame would ha≈øten, and in great heapes environ me about, more thicke than long, and more full than la≈øting. And let it hardly vani≈øh with my knowledge, and when this ≈øweet alluring ≈øound ≈øhall no more tickle mine eares. It were a fond conceite, now I am ready to leave the commerce of men, by new commendations, to goe about, anew to beget my ≈øelfe vnto them.</p>
                        <p>I make no account of goods, which I could not employ to the v≈øe of my life. Such as I am ≈øo would I be el≈øewhere then in Paper. Mine arte and indu≈øtry have beene emploied to make my ≈øelfe of ≈øome worth. My ≈øtudy and endevour to doe, and not to write. I have applied all my skill and devoire to frame my life. Lo-heere mine occupation and my worke. I am a le≈ø≈øe maker of books, then of any thing el≈øe. I have de≈øired and aimed at ≈øufficiencie, rather for the benefite of my pre≈øent and e≈ø≈øentiall commodities, then to make a Store-hou≈øe, and hoard it vp for mine heires. Who≈øoever hath any worth in him, let him ≈øhew it in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, maners and ordinary di≈øcour≈øes; be it to treat of love or of quarrels, of ≈øport and play or bed-matters, at board or el≈øe-where; or be it in the conduct of his owne affaires, or private hou≈øhold matters. Tho≈øe whom I ≈øee make good bookes, having tattered ho≈øen and ragged clothes on, had they believed mee they ≈øhould fir≈øt have gotten them≈øelves good clothes.

So farre am I al≈øo from expecting, by ≈øuch trifles to gaine new honour to my ≈øelfe: as I ≈øhal think I make a good bargaine, if I loo≈øe not a part of that little, I had already gained.

Renowme or glory (were it that of <hi>Aymons</hi> foure ≈øons) is over-deerely bought by a man of my humour, if it co≈øt him but three violent fits of the chollike. Give me health a Gods name. Tho≈øe that love our Phy≈øicke, may likewi≈øe have their con≈øiderations good, great and ≈øtrong. I hate no fanta≈øies contrary to mine.

                        </argument>
                        <p>OThers fa≈øhion man, I repeat him; and repre≈øent a particular one, but ill made; and whom were I to forme a new, he ≈øhould be far other then he is; but he is now made. And though the lines of my picture change and vary, yet loo≈øe they not them≈øelves. The world runnes all on wheeles: All things therein moove without entermi≈ø≈øion; yea the earth, the rockes of <hi>Cauca≈øus,</hi> and the Pyramides of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> both with the publike and their owne motion. <hi>Constancy it ≈øelfe is nothing but a langui≈øhing and wauering dance.</hi> I cannot ≈øettle my obiect; it goeth ≈øo vnquietly and ≈øtaggering, with a naturall drunkenne≈ø≈øe. I take it in this plight, as it is at th'in≈øtant I ammu≈øe my ≈øelfe about it. I de≈øcribe not the e≈ø≈øence, but the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage; not a pa≈ø≈øage from age to age, or as the people reckon, from ≈øeaven yeares to ≈øeaven, but from day to day, from minute to minute. My hi≈øtory mu≈øt be fitted to the pre≈øent. I may ≈øoone change, not onely fortune, but intention. It is a counter-roule of divers and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accidents, and irre≈øolute imaginations, and ≈øometimes contrary: whether it be that my ≈øelfe am other, or that I apprehend ≈øubiects, by other circum≈øtances and con≈øiderations. How≈øoever, I may perhaps gaine ≈øay my ≈øelfe, but truth (as <hi>Demades</hi> ≈øaid) I never gaine-≈øay: Were my minde ≈øetled, I would not e≈ø≈øay, but re≈øolue my ≈øelfe. It is ≈øtill a Prenti≈øe and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer. I propo≈øe a meane life, and without lu≈øter: T'is all one. They fa≈øten all morall Philo≈øophy as well to a popular and priuate life, as to one of richer ≈øtuffe. <hi>Every man beareth the whole ≈øtampe of humane condition.</hi> Authors communicate them≈øelves vnto the world by ≈øome ≈øpeciall and ≈øtrange marke; I the fir≈øt, by my generall di≈øpo≈øition; as <hi>Michael de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne;</hi> not as a Grammarian, or a Poet, or a Lawyer. If the world complaine, I ≈øpeake too much of my ≈øelfe, I complaine, it thinkes no more of it ≈øelfe. But is it rea≈øon, that being ≈øo private in v≈øe, I ≈øhould pretend to make my ≈øelfe publike in knowledge? Or is it rea≈øon, I ≈øhould produce into the world, where fa≈øhion and arte have ≈øuch ≈øway and command, the raw and ≈øimple effects of nature; and of a nature as yet exceeding weake? <hi>To write bookes without learning, is it not to make a wall without ≈øtone or ≈øuch like thing?</hi> Conceites of mu≈øicke are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by arte; mine by hap. Yet have I this according to learning, that never man handled ≈øubject, he vnder≈øtood or knew, better then I doe this I have vndertaken; being therein the cunninge≈øt man alive.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that never man waded further into his matter, nor more di≈øtinctly ≈øifted the partes and dependances of it, nor arrived more exactly and fully to the end he propo≈øed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him≈øelfe. To fini≈øh the ≈øame, I have need of naught but faithfulne≈ø≈øe: which is therein as ≈øincere and pure as may be found. I ≈øpeake truth, not my belly-full, but as much as I dare; and I dare the more, the more I grow into yeares: for it ≈øeemeth, cu≈øtome alloweth old age more liberty to babbell, and indi≈øcretion to talke of it ≈øelfe. It cannot herein be, as in trades; where the Crafts-man and his worke doe often differ. Being a man of ≈øo ≈øound and hone≈øt conuer≈øation, write he ≈øo fooli≈øhly? Are ≈øuch learned writings come from a man of ≈øo weake a conver≈øation? who hath but an ordinary conceite, and writeth excellently, one may ≈øay his capacity is borrowed, not of him≈øelfe. A skilfull man, is not skilfull in all things: But a ≈øufficient man, is ≈øufficient euery where, even vnto ignorance. Heere my booke and my ≈øelfe march together, and keepe one pace. El≈øe-where one may commend or condemne the worke, without the worke-man; heere not: who toucheth one, toucheth the other. He who ≈øhall iudge of it without knowing him, ≈øhall wrong him≈øelfe more then me: he that knowes it,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:12117:232"/>
hath wholly ≈øatisfied mee. Happie beyond my merite, If I get this onely portion of publike approbation, as I may cau≈øe men of vnder≈øtanding to thinke, I had beene able to make v≈øe and benefit of learning, had I beene endowed with any: and de≈øerued better helpe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. excu≈øe wee heere what I often ≈øay, that I ≈øeldome repent my ≈øelfe, and that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience is contented with it ≈øelfe; not of an Angels or a hor≈øes con≈øcience, but as of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience. Adding euer this clau≈øe, not of ceremonie, but of true and e≈ø≈øentiall ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion; that <hi>I ≈øpeake inquiring and doubting, meerely and ≈øimply referring my ≈øelfe, from re≈øolution, vnto common and lawfull opinions.</hi> I teach not; I report: Noe vice is ab≈øolutely vice, which offendeth not, and a ≈øound iudgement accu≈øeth not: For, the deformitie and incommoditie thereof is ≈øo palpable, as peraduenture they haue rea≈øon, who ≈øay, it is chiefly produced by ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe and brought forth by ignorance; ≈øo hard is it, to imagine one ≈øhould know it without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it. <hi>Malice ≈øucks vp the greate≈øt part of her owne venome, and therewith impoy≈øoneth her≈øelfe. <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ice, leaueth, as an vlcer in the fle≈øh, a repentance in the ≈øoule, which ≈øtill ≈øcratcheth, and bloodieth it ≈øelfe.</hi> For rea≈øon effaceth other griefes and ≈øorrowes, but engendereth tho≈øe of repentance: the more yrke≈øome, becau≈øe inwarde: As the colde and heate of agues is more offen≈øiue then that which comes outward. I account vice (but each according to their mea≈øure) not onely tho≈øe which rea≈øon di≈øalowes, and nature condemnes, but ≈øuch as mans opinion bath forged as fal≈øe and erronious, if lawes and cu≈øtome authorize the ≈øame. In like manner there is not goodne≈ø≈øe but gladdeth an hone≈øt di≈øpo≈øition. There is truely I wot not what kinde or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, of well doing, which reioyceth in our ≈øelues, and a generous jollitie, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth a good con≈øcience. A minde couragiou≈ølie vicious, may happily furni≈øh it ≈øelfe with ≈øecurity, but ≈øhee cannot bee fraught, with this ≈øelfe-ioyning delight and ≈øatisfaction. It is noe ≈ømall plea≈øure, for one to feele him≈øelfe pre≈øerued from the contagion of an age ≈øo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as ours, and to ≈øay to him≈øelfe; could a man enter and ≈øee euen into my ≈øoule, yet ≈øhould he not finde me guilty, either of the affliction or ruine of any body, nor culpable of enuie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, nor of publike offence again≈øt the lawes, nor tainted with innouation, trouble or ≈øedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor ≈øpotted with fal≈øifying of my worde; and although the libertie of times alowed and taught it every man, yet could I neuer bee induced to touch the goods or diue into the pur≈øe of any <hi>French</hi> man; and haue alwayes liued vpon mine own, as well in time of war, as of peace: nor did I euer make v≈øe of any pooremans labour, without reward. The≈øe te≈øtimonies of an vn≈øpotted con≈øcience are very plea≈øing, which naturall ioy is a great benefit vnto vs; and the onely payment neuer faileth vs. To ground the recompence of vertuous actions, vpon the approbation of others, is to vndertake a mo≈øt vncertaine or troubled foundation, namely in an age ≈øo corrupt and times ≈øo ignorant, as this is: <hi>the vulgar peoples good opinion is iniurious.</hi> Whom tru≈øt you in ≈øeeing what is commendable; God keepe mee from beeing an hone≈øt man, according to the de≈øcription I dayly ≈øee made of honour, each one by him≈øelfe. <hi>Quae fuerant vitia, mores ≈øunt. What ear≈øt were vices, are now growne fa≈øhious.</hi> Some of my friendes, have ≈øometimes attempted to ≈øchoole me roundly, and ≈øift mee plainely, either of their owne motion, or envited by me, as to an office, which to a well compo≈øed minde, both in profit and lovingne≈ø≈øe, exceedeth all the duties of ≈øincere amity. Such have I euer entertained with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen armes of curte≈øie, and kinde acknowledgement. But now to ≈øpeake from my con≈øcience, I often found ≈øo much fal≈øe mea≈øure in their reproches and prai≈øes, that I had not greatly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if I had rather erred, then done well after their fa≈øhion. Such as wee e≈øpecially, who live a private life not expo≈øed to any gaze but our owne, ought in our hartes e≈øtabli≈øh a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone, and thereto touch our deedes and try our actions; and accordingly, now cheri≈øh, and now cha≈øti≈øe our ≈øelues. I haue my owne lawes and tribunall, to iudge of mee, whether I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øe my ≈øelfe more then any where els. I re≈øtraine my actions according to other, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them according to my ≈øelfe. None but your ≈øelf knowes rightly whether you be demi≈ø≈øe and cruel, or loyall and deuout. Others ≈øee you not, but ghe≈ø≈øe you by vncertaine coniectures: They ≈øee not ≈øo much your nature, as your arte. Adhere not then to their opinion, but hold vnto your owne. <hi>Tuo tibi iudicio e≈øt vtendum. Virtutis &amp; viciorum graue ip≈øius con≈øcientiae pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>

Con≈øidering that order is but a dumpi≈øh and drow≈øie vertue: To gaine a Battaile, perfourme an Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage, and gouerne a people, are noble and woorthy actions; to chide, laugh, ≈øell, pay, loue, hate, and mildely and iu≈øtly to conuer≈øe both with his owne and with him≈øelfe; not to relent, and not gaine-≈øay him≈øelfe, are thinges more rare, more difficult and le≈ø≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable.</p>

When I con≈øult with my age of my youthes proceedings, I finde that commonly, (according to my opinion) I mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in order. This is all my re≈øi≈øtance is able to performe. I flatter not my ≈øelfe: in like circum≈øtances, I ≈øhould euer bee the ≈øame. It is not a ≈øpot, but a whole dye, that ≈øtaynes mee.

It mu≈øt pinch my entrailes, and afflict them as deepely and throughly, as God him≈øelfe beholdes mee. When in negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, many good fortunes haue ≈ølipt mee for want of good di≈øcretion, yet did my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects make good choyce, according to the occurrences pre≈øented vnto them. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is euer to take the ea≈øier and ≈øurer ≈øide. I finde that in my former deliberations, I proceeded, after my rules, di≈øcreetely, for the ≈øubiects ≈øtate propounded to mee; and in like occa≈øions, would proceede a like; a hundred yeares, hence. I re≈øpect not what now it is, but what it was, when I con≈øulted of it. <hi>The con≈øequence of all de≈ø≈øignes con≈øi≈øtes in the ≈øea≈øons; occa≈øions pa≈ø≈øe, and matters change vnce≈ø≈øantlie.</hi> I have in my time runne into ≈øome gro≈ø≈øe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurde and important errors; not for want of good adui≈øe, but of good happe.

If my wit coulde neyther finde nor pre≈øage them, I am not offended with it; the function thereof is contained within it's owne limits. If the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe beate mee, and favour the ≈øide I refu≈øed; there is noe remedy; I fall not out with my ≈øelfe; I accu≈øe my fortune, not my endeuour: that's not called repentance. <hi>Phocion</hi> had giuen the Athenians ≈øome coun≈øell, which was not followed; the matter, again≈øt his opinion, ≈øucceeding happily; How now <hi>Phocion,</hi> (quoth one) art thou plea≈øed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath thriued ≈øo well? yea (≈øaide hee) and I am glad of it, yet repent not the adui≈øe I gaue.</p>
                        <p>When any of my friends come to mee for coun≈øell, I be≈øtowe it francklie and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, not as (well nigh all the worlde doth) wavering at the hazard of the matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the contrary of my meaning may happen, that ≈øo they may ju≈øtly finde fault with my adui≈øe: for which I care not greatly. For they ≈øhall doe mee wrong, and it became nor mee to refu≈øe them that dutie. I haue no body to blame for my faultes or misfortunes, but my ≈øelfe. For in effect I ≈øeldome v≈øe the adui≈øe of other vnle≈ø≈øe it be for complements ≈øake, and where I haue need of in≈øtruction or knowledge of the fact.

With mee they are but Flyes and Moathes, which di≈øtract my will. I little regarde mine owne opinions, other mens I e≈øteeme as little: Fortune payes mee accordingly. If I take no coun≈øell I give as little. I am not much ≈øought after for it and le≈ø≈øe credited when I give it: Neither knowe I any enterpri≈øe, either private or publike, that my adui≈øe hath directed and brought to conclu≈øion. Euen tho≈øe whome fortune had ≈øome-way tyde therevnto, have more willingly admitted the direction of others conceites, then mine.

                        <p>There is no office or occupation either weaker or ≈øtronger, then that of entertaining of ones thoughts according to the minde, what≈øoever it be.

It is the worke of Gods (≈øaith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) whence both their happine≈ø≈øe and ours proceedeth. Reading ≈øerves mee e≈øpecially, to awake my conceit by divers objects; to bu≈øie my judgement, not my memorie. Few entertainments then, ≈øtay mee without vigour and force. T'is true that courte≈øie and beautie po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe mee, as much or more, then waight and depth. And becau≈øe I ≈ølumber in all other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and lend but the ≈øuperficiall parts of my attention vnto them, it often befalleth mee, in ≈øuch kinde of weake and ab≈øurd di≈øcour≈øes, (di≈øcour≈øes of countenance) to blurt out and an≈øwer ridiculous toies, and fond ab≈øurdities, vnworthie a childe; or wilfully to hold my peace; therewithall more fooli≈øhly and incivilly. I have a kinde of raving fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie-full behaviour, that retireth mee into my ≈øelfe; and on the other ≈øide, a gro≈ø≈øe and childi≈øh ignorance of many ordinarie things; by meanes of which two qualities, I have in my daies committed five or ≈øix as ≈øotti≈øh trickes, as any one who≈øoever; which to my derogation may bee reported. But to follow my purpo≈øe, this har≈øh comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of mine makes me nice in conuer≈øing with men (whom I mu≈øt picke and cull out for the nonce) and vnfit for common actions. Wee liue and negotiate with the people: If their behaviour importune vs, if wee di≈ødaine to lend our ≈øelves to ba≈øe and vulgar ≈øpirits, which often are as regular as tho≈øe of a finer mould; and <hi>all wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is va≈øavourie, that is not conformed to common in≈øipience.</hi> Wee are no longer to intermeddle either with our, or other mens affaires: and both publike and private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake ≈øuch kinde of people.</p>
                        <p>The lea≈øt wre≈øted, and mo≈øt naturall proceedings of our minde, are the faire≈øt; the be≈øt occupations, tho≈øe which are lea≈øt forced.

Wee mu≈øt addre≈ø≈øe and ≈øtay our de≈øires, to things mo≈øt ea≈øie and neere≈øt. Is it not a fond-peevi≈øh humour in mee, to di≈øagree from a thou≈øand; to whom my fortune joineth mee, without whom I cannot live, to adhere vnto one or two, that are out of my commerce and conuer≈øation; or rather to a fanta≈øticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or fancie-full de≈øire, for a thing I cannot obtaine? My ≈øoft behaviours and milde manners, enemies to all ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe and foes to all bitterne≈ø≈øe, may ea≈øily have di≈øcharged mee from envie and contention. To bee beloved, I ≈øay not, but not to bee hated, never did man give more occa≈øion. But the coldne≈ø≈øe of my conuer≈øation, hath with rea≈øon robd mee of the good will of many; which may bee excu≈øed, if they interpret the ≈øame to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or wor≈øe ≈øen≈øe. I am mo≈øt capable of getting rare amities, and continuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite acquaintances. For ≈øo much as with ≈øo greedie hunger I ≈ønatch at ≈øuch acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances as an≈øwer my ta≈øte and ≈øquare with my humour.

                        <p>In vulgar worldly friend≈øhips, I am ≈øomewhat cold and barren; for my proceeding is not naturall, if not vnre≈øi≈øted and with hoi≈øed-full ≈øailes.

So that it is naturally a paine vnto mee, to communicate my ≈øelfe by halves, and with modification; and that ≈øervile or ≈øu≈øpicious wi≈øedome, which in the conver≈øation of the≈øe numerous and imperfect amities, is ordained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed

vnto vs: Pre≈øcribed in the≈øe daies e≈øpecially, <hi>Wherein one cannot ≈øpeake of the world but dangerou≈ølie or fal≈øelie.</hi> Yet I ≈øee, that who (as I doe) makes for his ende, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of his lyfe (I meane e≈ø≈øentiall commodities) mu≈øt auoyde as a plague, the≈øe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and quaintne≈ø≈øe of humour.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhould commend a high-ray≈øed minde, that could both bende and di≈øcharge it ≈øelfe: that where-ever hir fortune might tran≈øporte hir, ≈øhee might continue con≈øtant: that could di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe with hir neyghbour of all matters, as of hir building, of hir hunting and of any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; and entertaine with delight a Carpenter or a Gardiner.

Loe heare the mo≈øt and greate≈øt ≈øhare of learning I would a≈ø≈øigne them. There are ≈øome particular, retired and clo≈øe di≈øpo≈øitions.</p>
                        <p>My e≈ø≈øentiall forme is fit for communication, and proper for production: I am all outward and in apparance; borne for ≈øociety and vnto friend≈øhip. The ≈øolitude I love and commend, is e≈øpecially but to retire my affections and redeeme my thoughts vnto my ≈øelfe; to re≈øtraine and clo≈øevp, not my ≈øteppes, but my de≈øires and my eares, re≈øigning all forraigne ≈øolicitude and trouble, and mortally ≈øhunning all manner of ≈øeruitude and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; and not ≈øo much the throng of men as the importunity of affaires. Locall ≈øolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine≈ø≈øe (to ≈øay trueth) doth rather extend and enlarge mee outwardly; I give my ≈øelfe to State-bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and to the world, more willingly when I am all alone. At the Court, and in pre≈ø≈øe of people, I clo≈øe and ≈ølinke into mine owne skinne. A≈ø≈øemblies thru≈øt mee againe into my ≈øelfe.

Yea even in mine owne hou≈øe, in the midde≈øt of a numerous familie and mo≈øt frequented hou≈øes, I ≈øee people more then a good many, but ≈øeldome ≈øuch as I love to conver≈øe or communicate withall. And there I re≈øerve, both for my ≈øelfe, and others, an vnaccu≈øtomed libertie; making truce with ceremonies, a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and invitings, and ≈øuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble≈øome ordinances of our courte≈øie (O ≈øervile cu≈øtome and importunate manner) there every man demeaneth him≈øelfe as hee plea≈øeth, and entertaineth what his thoughts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; whereas I keepe my ≈øelfe ≈øilent, meditating and clo≈øe, without offence to my gue≈øts or friends.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the≈øe things have ≈øome affinitie; but therewithall great difference: their names and titles ≈øhould not thus be commixt: both are wronged ≈øo to bee confounded. <hi>Nobilitie is a worthy, goodly qualitie, aud introduced with good rea≈øon; but in as much as it dependeth on others, and may fall to the ≈øhare of my vicious and worthle≈ø≈øe fellowe, it is in e≈øtimation farre ≈øhorte of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> If it be a vertue, it is artificiall and vi≈øible; relying both on time and fortune; diuers in forme, according vnto countries; living and mortall; without birth, as the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogicall and common; by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion and ≈øimilitude; drawne along by con≈øequence, but a very weake one.

Tho≈øe of <hi>Calicut</hi> make of their nobility a degree aboue humane. Marriage is interdicted them, and all other vocations, ≈øauing warre. Of Concubines they may haue as many as they li≈øt, and women as many lechardes, without Jealou≈øie one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it is a capitall crime, and vnremi≈ø≈øible offence to contract or marry with any of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition: Nay they deeme them≈øelues di≈øparaged and polluted, if they haue but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in pa≈ø≈øing by. And as if their honour were much iniuried and interre≈ø≈øed by it, they kil tho≈øe who but approach ≈øome what to neare them.

I meane not for the conditions of his fortune, but for the qualities of his per≈øon. Few men have wedded their ≈øweet hearts, their para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes, but have come home by weeping Cro≈ø≈øe, and ere long repented their bargaine. And even in the other world, what an vnquiet life leades <hi>Iupiter</hi> with his wife, whom before hee had ≈øecretly knowen, and lovingly enioied? This is as they ≈øay, <hi>to beray the panier, and then put it on your head.</hi> My ≈øelfe have ≈øeene in ≈øome good place, love, ≈øhamefully and di≈øhone≈øtly cured by mariage: the con≈øiderations are to much different. Wee love without di≈øturbance to our ≈øelves; two divers and in them≈øelves contrary things. <hi>I≈øocrates</hi> ≈øaid, that the towne of <hi>Athens</hi> plea≈øed men, even as Ladies doe whom wee ≈øerve for affection. Every one loved to come thither, to walke and pa≈ø≈øe away the time: but none affected to wed it: that is to ≈øay, to endeni≈øon, to dwell and habituate him≈øelfe therein. I have (and that to my ≈øpight and griefe) ≈øeene husbands hate their wives, onely becau≈øe them≈øelves wronged them: How≈øoever, wee ≈øhould not love them le≈ø≈øe for our faults; at lea≈øt for repentance and compa≈ø≈øion they ought to be dearer vnto vs. The≈øe are different ends (≈øaith hee) and yet in ≈øome ≈øort compatible. Wedlocke hath for his ≈øhare honour, ju≈øtice, profit and con≈øtancie: a plaine, but more generall delight. Love melts in onely plea≈øure; and truly it hath it more tickli≈øh, more lively, more quaint, and more ≈øharpe: a plea≈øure inflamed by difficulty: there mu≈øt be a kinde of ≈øtinging, tingling and ≈ømarting. <hi>It is no longer loue, be it once without Arrowes, or without fire.</hi> The liberality of Ladies is to profu≈øe in marriage, and blunts the edge of affection and de≈øire.

When I behold the≈øe gallant formes of expre≈ø≈øing, ≈øo lively, ≈øo nimble, ≈øo deepe: I ≈øay not this is to ≈øpeake wel, but to thinke well. It is the quaintne≈ø≈øe or liveline≈ø≈øe of the conceit, that elevateth and puffes vp the words. <hi>Pectus e≈øt quod di≈øertum facit.

Which skill how little it is given to all, may plainly bee di≈øcerned by mo≈øt of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne French Writers.

My ≈øpeach is ≈øomewhat nicely iealous of attention and ≈øilence; if I be in any earne≈øt talke, who interrupteth me, cuts me off. In travell, even the nece≈ø≈øity of waies breakes off di≈øcour≈øes. Be≈øides that I mo≈øt commonly travell without company, which is a great helpe for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rea≈øonings; whereby I have ≈øufficient lea≈øure to entertaine my ≈øelfe. I thereby have that ≈øucce≈ø≈øe I have in dreames; In dreaming I commend them to my memory (for what I dream I doe it willingly) but the next morning, I can well call to minde what colour they were of, whether blith, ≈øad or ≈øtrange; but what in ≈øub≈øtance, the more I labour to finde out, the more I overwhelme them in oblivion. So of ca≈øuall and vnpremeditated conceits that come into my braine, nought but a vaine image of them remaineth in my memory; ≈øo much onely, as ≈øufficeth vnprofitably to make me chafe, ≈øpight and fret in pur≈øuite of them. Well then, leaving bookes a≈øide and ≈øpeaking more materially and ≈øimply; when all is done, I finde that <hi>love is nothing el≈øe but an in≈øatiate chirst of enioying a greedily de≈øired ≈øubiect.</hi> Nor <hi>Venus</hi> that good hu≈øwife, other, then a tickling delight of emptying ones ≈øeminary ve≈ø≈øels: as is the plea≈øure which nature giveth vs to di≈øcharge other parts: which becommeth faulty by immoderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defectiue by indi≈øcretion. To <hi>Socrates, loue is an appetite of generation by the mediation of beauty.</hi> Now con≈øidering oftentimes the rediculous tickling, or titilation of this plea≈øure, the ab≈øurd, giddy and hare-braind motions wherwith it to≈ø≈øeth <hi>Zeno,</hi> and agitates <hi>Cratippus;</hi> that vnadvi≈øed rage, that furious and with cruelty enflamed vi≈øage in loues lu≈øtfull and ≈øwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt effects: and then a graue, ≈øterne, ≈øeuere ≈øurly countenance in ≈øo fond-fond an action, that one hath pell-mell lodged our ioyes and filthes together: and that the ≈øupreme≈øt voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe both ravi≈øheth and plaineth, as doth ≈øorrow: I beleeve that which <hi>Plato</hi> ≈øaies to be true, that <hi>man was made by the Gods for them to toy and play withall.</hi>

T'is a trick of greedine≈ø≈øe, which it behoueth them to cloake with their arte, ≈øo ra≈øhly and fond-hardily to yeeld them≈øelues in gro≈ø≈øe.

alwayes their houre, that they may euer be ready to let vs enter. And whereas ≈øhe hath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our appetites ≈øhould make apparant ≈øhew and declaration, ≈øhe cau≈øed theirs to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed and inward: and hath furni≈øhed them with parts vnfit for o≈øtentation; and onely for defence. Such prankes as this, we mu≈øt leave to the Amazonian libertie. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great marching through <hi>Hircania, Thale≈øtris</hi> Queen of the Amazones came to meet him with three hundred lances of her ≈øex, all well mounted and compleately armed; having left the re≈øidue of a great armie, that followed hir, beyond the neighbouring mountaines. And thus aloud, that all might heare ≈øhe be≈øpake him; That the farre-re≈øounding fame of his victories, and matchle≈ø≈øe valour, had brought hir thither to ≈øee him, and to offer him hir meanes and forces, for the aduancing and furthering of his enterpri≈øes. And finding him ≈øo faire, ≈øo young and ≈øtrong, ≈øhe, who was perfectly accompli≈øhed in all his qualities, adui≈øed him to ly with hir that ≈øo there might be borne of the mo≈øt valiant woman in the world, and onely valiat man then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ≈øome great and rare creature for po≈øteritie. <hi>Alexander</hi> thanked hir for the re≈øt; but to take lea≈øure for hir la≈øt demands accompli≈øhment, he ≈øtaide thirteene dayes in that place, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which, he reuelled with as much glee, and fea≈øted with as great iollitie as po≈ø≈øibly could be deui≈øed, in honour and fauour of ≈øo couragious a Princes. Wee are well-nigh-in all things parciall and corrupted Iudges of their action, as no doubt they are of ours. I allow of truth as well when it hurts me, as when it helpes me. It is a foule di≈øorder, that ≈øo often vrgeth them vnto change, and hinders them from ≈øetling their affection on any one ≈øubiect: as wee ≈øee in this Godde≈ø≈øe, to whom they impute ≈øo many changes and ≈øeverall friends. But withall <hi>it is again≈øt the nature of loue, not to be violent, and again≈øt the condition of violence, to be constant.</hi> And tho≈øe who wonder at it, exclaime again≈øt it, and in women ≈øearch for the cau≈øes of this infirmitie, as incredible and vnnatural: why ≈øee they not how often, without any amazement and exclaiming, them≈øelues are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and infected with it? I might happily ≈øeeme more ≈øtrange to find any con≈øtant ≈øtay in them. It is not a pa≈ø≈øion meerely corporeall. <hi>If no end be found in coueteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, nor limit in ambition, a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelfe there is nor end nor limit in letchery,</hi> It yet continueth after ≈øacietie: nor can any man pre≈øcribe it or end or con≈øtant ≈øatisfaction: it ever goeth on beyond it's po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, beyond it's bounds. And if con≈øtancie bee peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ≈øome ≈øort more pardonable in them then in vs: They may readily alleage again≈øt vs, our ready inclination vnto day lie variety and new ware: And ≈øecondly alleage without vs, that they buy a pigge in a poake. <hi>Ione</hi> Queene of <hi>Naples</hi> cau≈øed <hi>Andreo≈ø≈øe</hi> her fir≈øt husband to be ≈øtrangled and hang'd out of the barres of his window, with a corde of Silke and golde wouen with her owne handes; becau≈øe in bed-bu≈øine≈ø≈øe ≈øhee found neither his members nor ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours an≈øwerable the hope ≈øhee had conceiued of him, by viewing his ≈øtature, beauty, youth, and di≈øpo≈øition, by which ≈øhe had formerly beene ≈øurpri≈øed and abu≈øed.

                        <p>Wee had need to bee ≈øollicited and tickled, by ≈øome biting agitation, as this is. See but what youth, vigour and iollitie it re≈øtored vnto wi≈øe <hi>Anacreon.</hi> And <hi>Socrates,</hi> when hee was elder then I am, ≈øpeaking of an amorous obiect: leaning (≈øaies hee) ≈øhoulder to ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and approaching my head vnto his, as we were both together looking vpon a booke, I felt, in truth, a ≈øudden tingling or prickling in my ≈øhoulder, like the biting of ≈øome bea≈øt, which more then five daies after tickled mee, whereby a continuall itching glided into my heart. But a ca≈øuall touch, and that but in a ≈øhoulder, to enflame, to di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and to di≈øtract a minde, enfeebled, tamed and cooled through age; and of all humane mindes the mo≈øt reformed. And why not I pray you? <hi>Socrates</hi> was but a man, and would neither bee nor ≈øeeme to bee other. Philo≈øophie contends not again≈øt naturall delights, ≈øo that due mea≈øure bee ioined therewith; and alloweth the moderation, not the ≈øhunning of

them. The efforts of her re≈øi≈øtance are employed again≈øt ≈øtrange and ba≈øtard or lawle≈ø≈øe ones. She ≈øaith, that <hi>the bodyes appetites ought not to be encrea≈øed by the minde.</hi> And wittily adui≈øeth vs, that we ≈øhould not excite our hunger by ≈øacietie; not to ≈øtuffe, in≈øteed of filling our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: to auoide all joui≈ø≈øance that may bring vs to want: and ≈øhunne all meat and drink, which may make vs hungry or thir≈øtie. As in the ≈øeruice of love, ≈øhe appoints vs to take an obiect, that onely may ≈øatisfie the bodies neede, without once moouing the mind: which is not there to have any doing, but onely to follow and ≈øimply to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the body. But have I not rea≈øon to thinke, that the≈øe precepts, which (in mine opinion are el≈øewhere ≈øomewhat rigorous) haue reference vnto a body which doth his office; and that a dejected one, as a weakned ≈øtomacke may be excu≈øed if he cheri≈øh and ≈øu≈øtaine the ≈øame by arte, and by the entercou≈øe of fantazie, to re≈øtore it the de≈øires, the delights and blithne≈ø≈øe, which of it ≈øelfe it hath lo≈øt? May we not ≈øay, that there is nothing in vs, during this earthly pri≈øon, ≈øimply corporall, or purely ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall? and that iniuriou≈ølie we di≈ømember a living man? that there is rea≈øon wee ≈øhould carrie our ≈øelues in the v≈øe of plea≈øure, at lea≈øt as fauourablie as we doe in the pangs of griefe? For example, it was vehement, even vnto perfection, in the ≈øoules of Saints, by repentance. The body had naturally a part therein, by the right of their combination, and yet might haue but little ≈øhare in the cau≈øe: and were not contented that it ≈øhould ≈øimply follow and a≈ø≈øi≈øt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ≈øoule: they haue tormented the body it ≈øelfe with conuenient and ≈øharpe puni≈øhments; to the end that one with the other, the body and the ≈øoule might a vie plunge man into ≈øorrow; ≈øo much the more ≈øaving, by how much the more ≈ømarting. In like ca≈øe, in corporall plea≈øures, is it not iniu≈øtice to quaile and coole the minde and, ≈øay, it mu≈øt thereunto be entrained, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a forced bond, or ≈øervile nece≈ø≈øitie? Shee ≈øhould rather hatch and cheri≈øh them, and offer and invite it ≈øelfe vnto them; the charge of ≈øwaying rightly belonging to her. Even as in my conceit, it is her part, in her proper delights, to in≈øpire and infu≈øe into the body all ≈øen≈øe or feeling which his condition may beare, and indevour that they may be both ≈øweet and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for him. For, as they ≈øay, tis good rea≈øon; that the body follow not his appetites to the mindes preiudice or dammage. But why is it not likewi≈øe rea≈øon, that the minde ≈øhould not follow hers to the bodies danger and hurt? I have no other pa≈ø≈øion that keepes mee in breath. What avarice, ambition, quarels, ≈øutes in law, or other contentions worke and effect in others, who as my ≈øelfe have no a≈ø≈øigned vacation, or certaine lei≈øure, love would performe more commodiou≈øly: It would re≈øtore me the vigilancie, ≈øobrietie, grace and care of my per≈øon; and a≈ø≈øure my countenance again≈øt the wrinckled frowns of age (tho≈øe deformed and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frownes) which el≈øe would blemi≈øh and deface the ≈øame; It would reduce me to ≈øerious, to ≈øound and wi≈øe ≈øtudies, whereby I might procure more love, and purcha≈øe more e≈øtimation: It would purge my minde from de≈øpaire of it ≈øelfe, and of its v≈øe, acquainting the ≈øame againe with it ≈øelfe: It would divert me from thou≈øands of irk≈øome tedious thoughts, and melancholie carking cares, wherewith the doting idlene≈ø≈øe and crazed condition of our age doth charge and comber vs: It would re≈øtore and heat, though but in a dreame, the blood which nature for≈øaketh: It would vphold the drooping chinne, and ≈øomewhat ≈øtrengthen or lengthen the ≈øhrunken finewes, decaied vigour, and dulled lives-blithene≈ø≈øe of ≈øilly wretched man, who gallops apace to his ruine. But I am not ignorant how hard a matter it is to attaine to ≈øuch a commoditie: Through weakene≈ø≈øe and long experience, our ta≈øte is growne more tender, more choi≈øe and more exqui≈øite. We challenge mo≈øt, when we bring lea≈øt; we are mo≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øirous to choo≈øe, when we lea≈øt de≈øerve to be accepted: And knowing our ≈øelves to bee ≈øuch, we are le≈ø≈øe hardy and more di≈øtru≈øtfull: Nothing can a≈ø≈øure vs to be beloved, ≈øeeing our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and their quality. I am a≈øhamed to be in the companie of this greene, blooming and boyling youth;</p>

onely God, and the trueth of our religion, which they per≈øwaded them to embrace, adding thereto ≈øome minatorie threates.

At another time, in one ≈øame fire, they cau≈øed to be burned all aliue foure hundred common men, and three ≈øcore principall Lordes of a prouince, whom by the fortune of warre they had taken pri≈øoners. The≈øe narrations we have out of their owne bookes: for they doe not onely auouche, but vauntingly publi≈øh them. <hi>May it be, they doe it for a te≈øtimony of their iu≈øtice or zeale toward their religion?</hi> verily they are wayes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and enemies to ≈øo ≈øacred an ende. Had they propo≈øed vnto them≈øelues to enlarge and propagate our religion, they would haue con≈øidered, that it is not amplified by po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of landes, but of men: and would have beene ≈øatisfied with ≈øuch ≈ølaughters, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of warre bringeth, without indifferently adding therevnto ≈øo bloody a butchery, as vpon ≈øavage bea≈øtes; and ≈øo vniver≈øall as fire or ≈øword could ever attaine vnto; having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øely pre≈øerued no more then ≈øo many mi≈øerable bond ≈ølaues, as they deemed might ≈øuffice for the digging, working and ≈øeruice of their mines: So that diuers of their chieftaines have beene executed to death, even in the places they had conquered, by the appointment of the Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> iu≈øtly offended at the ≈øeld-≈øeene horror of their barbarous demeanours, and well nigh all di≈øe≈øteemed, contemned and hated. God hath meritoriou≈øly permitted, that many of their great pillages, and ill gotten goods, have eyther beene ≈øwallowed vp by the revenging Seas in tran≈øporting them, or con≈øumed by the inte≈øtine warres and ciuill broyles, wherewith them≈øelues have devoured one another; and the greate≈øt part of them have beene ouer-whelmed and buryed in the bowels of the earth, in the very places they found them, without any fruite of their victory. Touching the obiection which ≈øome make, that the receipte, namely in the handes of ≈øo thrifty, wary and wi≈øe a Prince, doth ≈øo little an≈øwer the fore-conceaved hope, which was given vnto his predece≈ø≈øors and the ≈øaid former aboundance of riches, they mette withall at the fir≈øt di≈øcovery of this new-found world, (for although they bring home great quantitye of gold and ≈øiluer, we perceiue the ≈øame to be nothing, in re≈øpect of what might bee expected thence) it may bee an≈øwered, that the v≈øe of mony was there altogether vnknowne; and con≈øequently, that all their golde was gathered together, ≈øeruing to no other purpo≈øe, then for ≈øhew, ≈øtate and ornament, as a mooveable re≈øerued from father to ≈øonne by many pui≈ø≈øant Kings, who exhau≈øted all their mines; to collect ≈øo huge a heape of ve≈ø≈øels and ≈øtatues for the ornament of their Temples, and embelli≈øhing of their Pallaces: whereas all our golde employed in commerce and trafficke betweene man and man. Wee mince and alter it into a thou≈øand formes: wee ≈øpend, wee ≈øcatter and di≈øperce the ≈øame to ≈øeverall v≈øes. Suppo≈øe our Kings ≈øhould thus gather and heape vp all the golde they might for many ages hoarde vp together, and keepe it clo≈øe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch't.

They beleeued the ≈øtate of the worlde, to bee divided into fiue ages, and in the life of fiue ≈øucceeding Sunnes, whereof foure had already ended their cour≈øe or time; and the ≈øame which now ≈øhined vpon them, was the fifth and la≈øt. The fir≈øt peri≈øhed together with all other creatures, by an vniver≈øall inundation of waters. The

The third, was con≈øumed by a violent fire, which burned and de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all. The fourth by a whirling emotion of the ayre and windes, which with the violent fury of it ≈øelfe, remooued and ouerthrew diuers high mountaines: ≈øaying, that men dyed not of it, but were tran≈øformed into Munkeis. (<hi>Oh what impre≈ø≈øions doth not the weakene≈ø≈øe of mans beliefe admit?</hi>) After the con≈øummation of this fourth Sunne, the world continued fiue and twenty yeares in perpetuall darkene≈ø≈øe: in the fifteenth of which one man and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were created, who renewed the race of man-kinde. Ten yeares after, vpon a certaine day, the Sunne appeared as newly created: from which day beginneth euer ≈øince the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their yeares. On the third day of who≈øe creation, died their ancient Gods, their new ones haue day by day beene borne ≈øince. In what manner this la≈øt Sunne ≈øhall peri≈øh, my aucthor could not learne of them. But their number of this fourth change, doth iumpe and meete with that great coniunction of the Starres, which eight hundred and odde yeares ≈øince, according to the A≈øtrologians ≈øuppo≈øition, produced diuers great alterations and ≈øtrange novelties in the world. Concerning the proud pompe and glorious magnificence, by occa≈øion of which I am fallen into this di≈øcour≈øe, nor <hi>Greece,</hi> nor <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Aegipt,</hi> can (bee it in profit, or difficultie or nobility) equall or compare ≈øundrie and diuers of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. The cawcy or high-way which is yet to bee ≈øeene in <hi>Peru,</hi> errected by the Kings of that countrie, ≈øtretching from the citty of <hi>Quito,</hi> vnto that of <hi>Cu≈øco</hi> (containing three hundred leagues in length) ≈øtraight, euen, and fine, and twentie paces in breadth, curiou≈øly paved, ray≈øed on both ≈øides with goodly, high ma≈øonrie-walles, all along which, on the inner ≈øide there are two continuall running ≈øtreames, plea≈øantly be≈øet with beautious trees, which they call <hi>Moly.</hi> In framing of which, where they mette any mountaines or rockes, they haue cut, rai≈øed and leuelled them, and filled all hollow places with lime and ≈øtone. At the ende of euery dayes journey, as ≈øtations, there are built ≈øtately great pallaces, plentiou≈øly ≈øtored with all manner of good victuals, apparrell and armes, as well for daylie way-fairing men, as for ≈øuch armies that might happen to pa≈ø≈øe that way. In the e≈øtimation of which worke I haue e≈øpecially con≈øidered the difficulty, which in that place is particvlarly to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. For they built with no ≈øtones that were le≈ø≈øe then ten foote ≈øquare: They had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to cary or tran≈øport them, then by meere ≈øtrength of armes to draw and dragge the carriage they needed: they had not ≈øo much as the arte to make ≈øcaffolds; nor knew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deui≈øe, then to rai≈øe ≈øo much earth or rubi≈øh, again≈øt their building, according as the worke ri≈øeth, and afterwarde to take it a way againe. But returne we to our coaches. In ≈øteade of them, and of all other carrying bea≈øtes they cau≈øed them≈øelues to be carryed by men, and vpon their ≈øhoulders. This la≈øt King of <hi>Peru,</hi> the ≈øame day hee was taken, was thus carried vpon rafters or beames of ma≈ø≈øiue Golde, ≈øitting in a faire chaire of ≈øtate, likewi≈øe all of golde, in the middle of his battaile. Looke how may of his porters as were ≈ølaine, to make him fall (for all their endeuour was to take him aliue) ≈øo many others, and as it were auye, tooke and vnder-went pre≈øently the place of the dead: ≈øo that he could never be brought down or made to fall, what ≈ølaughter ≈øo ever was made of tho≈øe kinde of people, vntill ≈øuch time as a hor≈øeman furiou≈øly ranne to take him by ≈øome parte of his body, and ≈øo pulled him to the ground.</p>

I aime not that way: I love my ≈øelfe too well. When I thinke to grow, it is but meanely; with a forced and coward aduancement; fit for me: yea in re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in wi≈øedome, in health, in beauty and al≈øo in riches. But this credite, this a≈øpiring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, this over≈øwaying authority, ≈øuppre≈ø≈øeth my imagination.

The popular makes the King to bee of wor≈øe condition then a Carter: and hee that extolleth Monarchie, placeth him both in power and ≈øoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many ≈øteps aboue the Gods. Now the incommoditie of greatne≈ø≈øe, which heere I have vndertaken to note and ≈øpeake of, (vpon ≈øome occa≈øion lately befalne mee) is this. There is peraduenture nothing more plea≈øing to the commerce of men, then the <hi>E≈ø≈øayes,</hi> which wee through iealou≈øie of honour or valour, make one again≈øt another, bee it in the exerci≈øe of the body or of the minde: wherein ≈øoueraigne greatne≈ø≈øe, hath no true or e≈ø≈øentiall part. Verily, it hath often ≈øeemed vnto mee, that through over much re≈øpect, Princes are therein v≈øed di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefully and treated iniuriou≈øhe: For, the thing whereat (in my youth) I was infinitely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, was, that tho≈øe which were trained and ≈øchooled with mee, ≈øhould for beare to doe it in good earne≈øt, becau≈øe they found mee vnworthy to bee with≈øtood or to re≈øi≈øt their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. It is that wee dayly ≈øee to happen vnto them; euery man finding him≈øelfe vnworthy to force him≈øelfe again≈øt them. If one perceive them never ≈øo little affected to have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, there is none but will ≈øtriue to yeelde it them, and that will not rather wrong his glory, then offend theirs: No man imployeth more diligence then needes hee mu≈øt to ≈øerue their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. What ≈øhare haue Princes in the throng, where all are for them? Mee thinkes I ≈øee tho≈øe <hi>Paladines</hi> of former ages, pre≈øenting them≈øelues in iou≈øtes, tiltings and combates, with bodies and armes enchanted. <hi>Bri≈ø≈øon</hi> running again≈øt <hi>Alexander,</hi> counterfetted his cour≈øe: <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> chid him for it: but hee ≈øhould haue cau≈øed him to bee whipt.

The horror of cruelty drawes me neerer vnto clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then any patterne of clemencie can po≈ø≈øibly win mee. A cunning rider or skilfull hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth not ≈øo properly teach mee, to ≈øit well on hor≈øe-backe, as doth one of our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, or a Venetian by ≈øeeing him ride. And an ill manner of ≈øpeech doth better reforme mine, then any well-poli≈øhed forme of ≈øpeaking. The ≈øotti≈øh countenance of another, doth dayly adverti≈øe and forewarne me.

Ielou≈øie, glory and contention, driue, ca≈øt and rai≈øe me aboue my ≈øelfe. And an vni≈øon or con≈øent, is a qualitie altogether te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and weari≈øome in conference. But as our minde is fortified by the communication of regular and vigorous ≈øpirits; it cannot well be expre≈ø≈øed, how much it loo≈øeth and is ba≈øtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized, by the continuall commerce and frequentation, we have with ba≈øe, weake and dull ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. No contagion ≈øpreds it ≈øelfe further then that. I know by long experience what an ell of it is worth. I love to conte≈øt and di≈øcour≈øe, but not with many, and only for my ≈øelfe. For, to ≈øerue as a ≈øpectacle vnto great men, and by way of contention<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for one to make a glorious ≈øhew of his ready wit and running tongue; I deeme it a profe≈ø≈øion farre vnfitting a man of honor. Sotti≈øhnes is an ill quality, but not to be able to endure it, and to fret and vex at it, as it hapneth to me, is another kinde of imperfection, which in opportunity is not much behinde ≈øotti≈øhnes: and that's it I will now accu≈øe in my ≈øelfe: I doe with great liberty and facilitie, enter into conference and di≈øputation: for≈øomuch as opinion findes but a hard ≈øoile to enter and take any deepe roote in me. No propo≈øitions amaze me, no conceit woundeth me, what contrarietie ≈øoever they have to mine. There is no fantazie ≈øo frivolous or humour ≈øo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, that in mine opinion is not ≈øortable to the production, of humane wit. We others, who debarre our judgement of the right to make conclu≈øions, regard but negligently the diuer≈øe opinions: and if wee lend it not our judgement, wee ea≈øily affoord it our eares. Where one ≈øcale of the ballance is altogether empty. I let the other waver too and fro, vnder an old wiues dreames. And me ≈øeemeth, I may well be excu≈øed, if I rather accept an odde number, then an even: Thur≈øday in re≈øpect of Friday, if I had rather make a twelfth or fourteenth at a table, then a thirteenth: if when I am trauelling I would rather ≈øee a Hare coa≈øting, then cro≈ø≈øing my way: and rather reach my left, then my right foote, to be ≈øhod. All ≈øuch fond conceits, now in credit about vs, de≈øerue at fea≈øt to be li≈øtned vnto. As for me, they only beare away inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ≈øurely they do ≈øo. Vulgar and ca≈øuall opinions are yet of ≈øome waight, which in nature are ≈øomthing els then nothing. And who wadeth not ≈øo far into them, to auoide the vice of ≈øuper≈øtition, falleth happily into the blame of wilfulne≈ø≈øe. The contradictions then of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

doe neither offend nor moove, but awaken and exerci≈øe me. Wee commonly ≈øhunne correction whereas we ≈øhould rather ≈øeeke and pre≈øent our ≈øelves vnto it, chiefly when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the way of conference, and not of regency. At every oppo≈øition, wee con≈øider not whether it be iu≈øt; but be it right or wrong, how we may avoide it: In ≈øteede of reaching our armes, we ≈øtretch forth our clawes vnto it. I ≈øhould endure to be rudely handled and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my friends, though they ≈øhould call me foole, coxcombe or ≈øay I raved. I love a man that doth ≈øtoutly expre≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe, among≈øt hone≈øt and worthy men and who≈øe wordes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer his thoughts. We ≈øhould fortifie and harden our hearing, again≈øt the tenderne≈ø≈øe of the cerimonious ≈øound of wordes. I love a friendly ≈øociety and a virile and con≈øtant familiarity: An amitie, which in the earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe and vigor of it's commerce, flattereth it ≈øelfe: as love in bitings and bloody ≈øcratchings. It is not ≈øufficiently generous or vigorous, except it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and quarelous: If ≈øhe be civili≈øed and a skilfull arti≈øte: if it feare a ≈øhocke or free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and have hir ≈øtarting hoales or forced by-wayes. <hi>Neque enim di≈øputari ≈øine repreher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øione pote≈øt.

The pa≈ø≈øion of choller hath already wounded his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: trouble, before rea≈øon hath ≈øeazed vpon it. It were both profitable and nece≈ø≈øary, that the determining of our di≈øputations, might be decided by way of wagers; and that there were a materiall marke of our lo≈ø≈øes: that we might better remember and make more accoumpt of it: and that my boy might ≈øay vnto me: Sir, if you call to minde; your conte≈øtation, your ignorance and your ≈øelfe-wilfulne≈ø≈øe, at ≈øeverall times, co≈øt you a hundred crownes the la≈øt yeare: I fea≈øt, I cherri≈øh and I embrace truth, where and in whom ≈øoever I finde it, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and merily yeeld my ≈øelfe vnto hir; as ≈øoone as I ≈øee but hir approach, though it bee a farre-off, I lay downe my weapons and yeeld my ≈øelfe vanqui≈øhed. And alwayes provided, one per≈øi≈øt not or proceede therein, with an over imperious ≈øtiffne≈ø≈øe or commanding ≈øurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; I am well plea≈øed to be reprooved. And I often accomodate my ≈øelfe vnto my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øers, more by rea≈øon of civilitie, then by occa≈øion of amendment: loving by the facilitie of yeelding, to gratifie and fo≈øter their liberty, to teach or adverti≈øe mee. It is notwith≈øtanding no ea≈øie matter to draw men of my times vnto it. They have not the courage to correct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they want the hart to endure correction: And ever ≈øpeake with di≈ø≈øimulation in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence one of another. I take ≈øo great a plea≈øure to bee judged and knowne, that it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to me, in whether of the two formes I be ≈øo. Mine owne imagination doth ≈øo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and condemne it ≈øelfe, that if another doe it, all is one vnto me; e≈øpecially ≈øeeing, I give his reprehen≈øion no other aucthoritie then I li≈øt. But I ≈øhall breake a ≈øtraw or fall at ods with him, that keepes him≈øelfe ≈øo alo≈øt; as I know ≈øome, that will fret and chafe if their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be not believed, and who take it as an iniury, yea and fall out with their be≈øt friends, if they will not follow it. And that <hi>Socrates</hi> ever ≈ømiling, made a collection of ≈øuch contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were oppo≈øed to his di≈øcour≈øe, one might ≈øay, his force was cau≈øe of it; and that the advantage being a≈ø≈øuredly to fall on his ≈øide, he tooke them as a ≈øubject of a new victory. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈ø≈øe we ≈øee on the contrary, that nothing doth ≈øo nicely yeeld our ≈øence vnto it as the opinion of preheminence and di≈ødaine of the adver≈øary. And that by rea≈øon, it rather befits the weake≈øt to accept of oppo≈øitions in good part, which re≈øtore and repaire him. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ≈øeeke more the conver≈øation of ≈øuch as curbe me, then of tho≈øe that feare me. It is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øavory and hurtfull plea≈øure, to have to doe with men, who admire and give vs place. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øthenes</hi> commanded his children, never to bee boholding vnto, or thanke any that ≈øhould command them. I feele my ≈øelfe more lu≈øtie and cranke for the victory I gaine over my ≈øelfe, when in the heate or fury of the combate, I perceive to bend and fall vnder the power of my adver≈øaries rea≈øon, then I am plea≈øed with the victory, I obtaine of him by his weakene≈ø≈øe. To conclude, I receave all blowes and allow all attaints given directly, how weake ≈øoever: but am very impacient at ≈øuch as are ≈øtrucken at randan and without order, I care but little for the matter, and with me opinions are all one, and the victory of the ≈øubject in a manner in different. I ≈øhall quietly conte≈øt a whole day, if the conduct of the controve≈øie be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with order and decorum. It is not force nor ≈øubtiltie, that I ≈øo much require, as forme and order. The forme and order, dayly ≈øeene in the altercations of Shepheards, or contentions

                        <p>Their di≈øcour≈øe holdes on his cour≈øe. If they prevent one another, if they ≈øtay not for, at lea≈øt they vnder≈øtand one another. A man doth ever an≈øwere ≈øufficiently well for mee, if hee an≈øwere what I ≈øay. But when the di≈øputation is confounded and orderle≈ø≈øe, I quit the matter, and betake me to the forme, with ≈øpight and indi≈øcretion: and embrace a kinde of debating, tea≈øty, headlong, malicious and imperious, whereat I afterward blu≈øh. <hi>It is impo≈ø≈øible to treate quietly and di≈øpute orderly with a foole.</hi> My judgement is not onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted vnder the hand of ≈øo imperious a mai≈øter, but my con≈øcience al≈øo. Our di≈øputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be forbidden and puni≈øhed, as other verball crimes. What vice rai≈øe they not, and heape vp together, beeing ever ≈øwayed and commaunded by choller? Fir≈øt wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into enmity with the rea≈øons, and then with the men. Wee learne not to di≈øpute, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to contradict: and every man contradicting and being contradicted, it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth, that the fruit of di≈øputing, is to loo≈øe and to di≈øanull the trueth. So <hi>Plato</hi> in his common wealth, forbiddeth fooli≈øh, vnapt and ba≈øe-minded ≈øpirits, to vndertake that exerci≈øe. To what purpo≈øe goe you about to que≈øt or enquire that which is with him, who hath neither good pace nor proceeding of woorth? No man wrongs the ≈øubject, when he quits the ≈øame, for want of meanes to treat or mannage it. I meane not a ≈øchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall and arti≈øt meane, but intend a naturall meane, and of a ≈øound vnder≈øtanding. What will the end bee? one goeth Ea≈øtward, and another We≈øtward: They loo≈øe the principall, and ≈øtray it in the throng of incidents. At the end of an houres wrangling, they wot not what they ≈øeeke for: one is high, another low, and another wide. Some take holde of a word, ≈øome of a ≈øimilitude. Some forget what was obiected again≈øt them, ≈øo much are they engaged in the pur≈øuite and thinke to follow them≈øelues, and not you. Some finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues weake-backt, feare all, refu≈øe all, and at the very entrance mingle the ≈øubiect and confound the purpo≈øe: or in the heate of the di≈øputation, mutine to holde their peace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: through a ≈øpightfull ignorance, affecting a proud kinde of contempt, or a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh mode≈øty auoydiug of contention.

I am of opinion, that both in <hi>Plato</hi> and in <hi>Xenophon, Socrates</hi> di≈øputeth more in favour of the di≈øputers, then in grace of the di≈øputation: and more to in≈øtruct <hi>Euthydemus</hi> and <hi>Protagoras</hi> with the knowledge of their impertinency, then with the impertinency of their arte. He takes hold of the fir≈øt matter, as he who hath a more profitable end, then to cleare it; that is, to cleare the ≈øpirits he vndertaketh to manage and to exerci≈øe. Agitation, ≈øtirring and hunting is properly belonging to our ≈øubject or drift; we are not excu≈øable to conduct the ≈øame ill and impertinently, but to mi≈ø≈øe the game, and faile in taking, that's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter. <hi>For wee are borne to que≈øt and ≈øeeke after trueth; to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe it belongs to a greater power.</hi> It is not (as <hi>Democritus</hi> ≈øaid) hidden in the deepes of abi≈ø≈øe: but rather eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in infinite height of diuine knowledge. <hi>The world is but a Schoole of inqui≈øition.</hi> The matter is not who ≈øhall put in, but who ≈øhall runne the faire≈øt cour≈øes. As well may hee play the foole that ≈øpeaketh truely, as hee that ≈øpeaketh fal≈øely: for wee are vpon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not vppon the matter of ≈øpeaking. My humour is, to haue as great aregarde to the forme, as to the ≈øub≈øtance; as much re≈øpect to the Aduocate, as to the cau≈øe; as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> appointed wee ≈øhould doe. And I day lie ammu≈øe my ≈øelfe to reade in authors, without care of their learning: therein ≈øeeking their manner, not their ≈øubiect. Euen as I pur≈øue the communication of ≈øome famous wit, not that hee ≈øhould teach mee, but that I may know him; and knowing him (if he de≈øerue it) I may imitate him. Every one may ≈øpeake truely, but to ≈øpeake orderly, methodically, wi≈øely and ≈øufficiently, few can doe it. So fal≈øehood proceeding of ignorance doth not offend mee; ineptne≈ø≈øe and trifling doth. I haue broken-off diuers bargaines, that would haue beene very commodious vnto me, by the impertinencie of their conte≈øtation, with whome I did bargaine. I am not mooued once a yeare, with the faults or ouer≈øights of tho≈øe, over whom I have power: but touching the point of the ≈øotti≈øhine≈ø≈øe and fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe of their allegations, excu≈øes, and defences, rude and bruti≈øh, wee are every day ready to goe by the eares. They neyther vnder≈øtand what is ≈øaid nor wherefore, and even ≈øo they an≈øwer; a thing able to make one di≈øpaire. I feele not my head to ≈øhock hard but by being hit with another. And I rather enter into compo≈øition with my peoples vices, then with their ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe, importunity and fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe. Let them doe le≈ø≈øe, prouided they be capable to doe. You liue in hope to enflame their will: But <hi>of a block there is nothing to bee hoped for, nor any thing of worth to bee enioyed.</hi> Now, what if I take things otherwi≈øe then they are? So it may bee: And therefore I accu≈øe my impatience. And fir≈øt I hould, that it is equally vicious in him, who is in the right, as in him, that is in the wrong: For, it is ever a kinde of tyrannicall ≈øharpene≈ø≈øe, not to be able to endure a forme different from his: and verily, ≈øince there is not a greater fondne≈ø≈øe, a more con≈øtant gulli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, or more heteroclite in≈øipidity then for one to move or vex him≈øelfe at the fondne≈ø≈øe, at the gulli≈øhne≈ø≈øe, or in≈øipidity of the world: For it principally formalizeth and moveth vs again≈øt our ≈øelves: and that Philo≈øopher of former ages ≈øhould never have wanted occa≈øion to weepe, ≈øo long as he had con≈øidered him≈øelfe. <hi>Mi≈øo,</hi> one of the ≈øeaven ≈øages (a man of a Timonian di≈øpo≈øition and Democraticall humour) being demanded, where-at hee laughed alone; he an≈øwered, becau≈øe I laugh alone; How many follies doe I ≈øpeake and an≈øwer every day, according to my ≈øelfe; and then how much more frequent according to others? And if

I bite mine owne lips at them, what ought others to doe? <hi>In fine, wee mu≈øt live with the quicke, and let the water runne vnder the bridge, without any care, or at lea≈øt without alteration to vs.</hi> In good ≈øooth, why meet we ≈øometimes with crooked, deformed, and in body mi≈øhapen men, without falling into rage and di≈øcontent, and cannot endure to light-vpon a froward, skit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh, and ill-ranged ≈øpirit, without falling into anger and vexation?

And as one amazed at the greatne≈ø≈øe of ≈øome bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, I have ≈øomtimes vnder≈øtood by tho≈øe who had atchieved them, both their motives and addre≈ø≈øes: wherein I have found but vulgar advi≈øes: and the mo≈øt vulgar and v≈øed, are peradventure the ≈øure≈øt and mo≈øt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the practi≈øe, if not for the ≈øhew. And what if the plaine≈øt rea≈øons are the be≈øt ≈øeated: the meane≈øt, ba≈øe≈øt and mo≈øt beaten, are be≈øt applied vnto affaires? To maintaine the auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Kings-coun≈øell, it is not requi≈øite, that prophane per≈øons ≈øhould be partakers of it, and looke further into it, then from the fir≈øt barre. To vphold it's reputation, it ≈øhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced vpon credit, and at full.

                        <p>Wherefore I ≈øay well, that how≈øoeuer, events are but weake te≈øtimonies of our worth and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. I was now vpon this point, that we need but looke vpon a man aduanced to dignity; had we but three dayes before knowne him to bee of little or no worth at all: an image of greatne≈ø≈øe, and an Idea of ≈øufficiencie, doth in≈øen≈øibly glide and creepe into our opinions; and wee per≈øwade our ≈øelues, that increa≈øing in ≈øtate and credit and followers, hee is al≈øo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in merit. Wee iudge of him, not according to his worth; but after the manner of ca≈øting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, according to the prerogatiue of his ranke. But let fortune turne hir wheele, let him againe decline and come downe among≈øt the vulgar multitude; euery one with admiration enquireth of the cau≈øe, and how he was rai≈øed ≈øo high. Good Lord, is that he? will ≈øome ≈øay. What? knew he no more? had he no other skill when hee was ≈øo aloft? Are Princes plea≈øed with ≈øo little? Now in good ≈øooth wee were in very good hands, will others ≈øay. It is a thing my ≈øelfe have often ≈øeene in my dayes. Yea the very maske of greatne≈ø≈øe, or habite of maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty, repre≈øented in Tragedies, doth in ≈øome ≈øort touch and beguile vs. The thing I adore in Kings, is the throng of their adoratores. All inclination and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion is due vnto them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the mindes. My rea≈øon is not framed to bend or ≈øtoope; my knees are. <hi>Melanthius</hi> being demanded, what he thought of <hi>Diony≈øius</hi> his tragedy, an≈øwered, I haue not ≈øeene it, ≈øo much was it over-clouded with language. So ≈øhould tho≈øe ≈øay, that judge of great mens di≈øcour≈øes: I haue not vnder≈øtood his di≈øcour≈øe, ≈øo was it ouerdarkned with grauity, with greatnes and with maie≈øty. <hi>Anti≈øthenes</hi> one day per≈øwaded the Athenians, to command, that their a≈ø≈øes ≈øhould as well be employed about the manuring of grounds, as were their hor≈øes: who an≈øwered him, that the A≈ø≈øe was not borne for ≈øuch ≈øeruice: that's all one (quoth he) there needs but your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for it: for the mo≈øt ignorant and incapable men you imploy about the directing of
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:12117:269"/>
your warres, leaue not to become out of hand mo≈øt worthy, onely becau≈øe you employ them. Wherevpon depends the cu≈øtome of ≈øo many men, who canonize the king, whom they haue made among≈øt them, and are not contented to honour him, vnle≈ø≈øe they al≈øo adore him. Tho≈øe of <hi>Mexico,</hi> after the cerimonies of his con≈øecration are fini≈øhed, dare no more looke him in the face: but as if by his royalty, they had deified him, they afterward deeme him to bee a God: among≈øt the oathes, they make him ≈øweare <hi>to maintain their religion, to keepe their lawes, to de≈øend their liberties, to be valiant, iu≈øt and debonaire;</hi> hee is al≈øo ≈øworne to make the Sunne march in his accu≈øtomed light: in time of need to cau≈øe the cloudes ≈øhowre downe their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; to enforce riuers to runne in their right wonted chanels; and compell the earth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all nece≈ø≈øary things for his people. I differ from this common fa≈øhion, and more di≈øtru≈øt ≈øufficiencie, when I ≈øee it accompanied with the greatnes of fortune, and applanded by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commendation. We ≈øhould heedfully marke, of what con≈øequence it is, for a man to ≈øpeake in due time, to choo≈øe fit opportunity, to breake or change his di≈øcour≈øe with a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrale authority: to defend him≈øelfe from others oppo≈øitions, by a nod or moouing of the head, by a ≈ømile, a ≈øhrug or a ≈øilence, before an a≈ø≈øembly, trembling with reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect. A man of mon≈øtrous fortune, chancing to ≈øhoote his boult, and giue his opinion vpon a frivolous ≈øubiect, which but je≈øtingly was to≈ø≈øed too and fro at his table, beganne ever thus; he cannot choo≈øe but be a lyer, or an ignorant a≈ø≈øe, that will ≈øay otherwi≈øe then, &amp;c. Follow this Philo≈øophicall point, out commeth a dagger, and there is ≈øome mi≈øchiefe. Loe here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduerti≈øment; from whence I reape good v≈øe; Which is, that in di≈øputations and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, all good ≈øeeming wordes, ought not pre≈øently to be allowed and accepted. Mo≈øt men are rich of a ≈øtrange ≈øufficiency. Some may chance to ≈øpeake a notable ≈øaying, to give a good an≈øwere, to v≈øe a witty ≈øentence, and to propound it, without knowing the force of it. That a man holdeth not all he borroweth, may peraduenture be verified in my ≈øelfe. A man ≈øhould not alwayes yeeld, what truth or goodnes ≈øoever it ≈øeemeth to containe. A man mu≈øt either combat the ≈øame in good earne≈øt, or draw-backe, vnder colour of not vnder≈øtanding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: to try on all parts, how it is placed in it's author. It may fortune, that we ≈øhut our ≈øelues vp, and further the ≈øtroake, beyond its bearing. I haue ≈øometimes in nece≈ø≈øity and throng of the combat, employed ≈øome reuiradoes or turnings, which beyond my intent, have prooved fal≈øe offers. I but gave them by tale, and they were received by waight. Euen as when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with a vigorous man; I plea≈øe my ≈øelfe to anticipate his conclu≈øions: I ea≈øe him the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to interpret him≈øelfe, I endeuour to preuent his imperfect and yet budding imagination: the order and pertinencie of his vnder≈øtanding for warneth and menaceth a farre off: of the≈øe others I doe cleane contrary; a man mu≈øt vnder≈øtand or pre≈øuppo≈øe nothing but by them. If they judge in generall termes: <hi>This is good; that's naught:</hi> and that they iump right; ≈øee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fortune, that iumpeth for them. Let them a little circum≈øcribe and re≈øtraine their ≈øentence; wherefore it is, and which way it is. The≈øe vniuer≈øall judgements, I ≈øee ≈øo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ≈øay nothing at all. They are men, that ≈øalute a whole multitude, in throng and troupe. Such as have true knowledge of the ≈øame, ≈øalute and marke it by name and particularly. But it is a hazardous enterpri≈øe. Whence I haue oftner and dayly ≈øeen, to happen that wits weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded, intending to ≈øhew them≈øelues ingenious, by ob≈øeruing in the reading of ≈øome worke, the point of beaury: ≈øtay their admiration with ≈øo bad a choi≈øe, that in liew of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs the authors excellencie, they ≈øhew vs their owne ignorance.

This care wee owe to ours, and this a≈ø≈øiduitie of correction and in≈øtruction: but to preach to him that fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øeth by, or ≈øway the ignorance or fondne≈ø≈øe of him wee meete next, is a cu≈øtome I cannot well away with. I ≈øeldome v≈øe it, even in ≈øuch di≈øcour≈øes as are made to mee; and I rather quit all, then come to the≈øe far-fetcht and magi≈øtrale in≈øtructions.

And then; what finde you faire≈øt in your owne worke? is it that or this part? the grace or the matter, the inuention, the iudgement, or the learning? For I ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perceiue, that <hi>a man mi≈ø≈øeth as much in iudging of his owne worke, as of anothers.</hi> Not onely by the affection, he therein imployeth; but becau≈øe he hath not ≈øufficiencie to know, nor skill to di≈øtingui≈øh it. The worke of it's owne power and fortune, may ≈øecond the worke-man, and tran≈øport him beyond his inuention and knowledge. As for me, I iudge not the worth of anothers worke more ob≈øcurely then of mine owne: and place my E≈ø≈øayes ≈øometimes lowe, ≈øometimes high, very vncon≈øtantly and doubtfully. There are dyuers bookes profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by rea≈øon of their ≈øubjects of which the author reapeth no commendations at all: And good bookes, as al≈øo good workes, which make the workeman a≈øhamed.

Po≈øterity ≈øhall reape ≈øingular profit by ≈øuch compo≈øitions: but I, what honour, except by my good fortune? Many famous bookes are of this condition.</p>

What if he have borrowed the matter and empaired the forme? as many times it commeth to pa≈ø≈øe. Wee others that have little practi≈øe with bookes, are troubled with this; that when wee meet with any rare or quaint inuention in a new Poet, or forcible argument in a Preacher, we dare not yet commend them, vntill we have taken in≈øtruction of ≈øome wi≈øe man, whether that part be their owne or another bodies. And vntill then I ever ≈øtand vpon mine owne guard. I come lately from reading ouer, (and that without any intermi≈ø≈øion) the ≈øtory of <hi>Tacitus</hi> (a matter not v≈øuall with me; it is now twenty yeares, I never ≈øpent one whole houre together vpon a booke) and I have now done it, at the in≈øtant reque≈øt of a gentleman, whom <hi>France</hi> holdeth in high e≈øteeme; as well for his owne worth and valour, as for a con≈øtant forme of ≈øufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and goodnes, apparantly ≈øeene in divers brethren of his. I know no author, that in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like regi≈øter entermixeth ≈øo many con≈øiderations of manners, and particular inclinations. And I deeme cleane contrary, to what hee thinketh: who being e≈øpecially to follow the lives of the Emperours of his time, ≈øo divers and extreme in all manner of forme, ≈øo many notable and great actions, which, namely their crueltie produced in their ≈øubiects: he had a more powerfull and attractiue matter, to di≈øcour≈øe and relate, then if hee had beene to ≈øpeake or treat of battles and vniver≈øall agitations. So that I often finde him barren, ≈øleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie running-over tho≈øe glorious deaths, as if he feared to attediate and mole≈øt vs with their multitude and continuance. This forme of hi≈øtorie is much more profitable: <hi>Publike inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, depend more on the conduct of fortune: priuate on ours.</hi> It is rather a iudgement, then

a deduction of an hi≈øtory: therein are more precepts, then narrations: It is not a booke to reade, but a volume to ≈øtudy and to learne: It is ≈øo fraught with ≈øentences, that right or wrong they are hudled vp: It is a ≈øeminary of mortall, and a magazine of pollitique di≈øcour≈øes, for the proui≈øion and ornament of tho≈øe, that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe ≈øome place in the managing of the world. He ever pleadeth with ≈øolide and forcible rea≈øons; after a ≈øharpe and witty fa≈øhion: follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected and laboured ≈øtile of his age: They ≈øo much loved to rai≈øe and puffe them≈øelues vp, that where they found neither ≈øharpene≈ø≈øe nor ≈øubtility in things, they would borrow it of wordes.

His intention and canua≈øing for the gouernment of affaires, hath not beene exempted from ambition, nor cleared from revenge: and his owne friends haue feared, that had he gotten the victory, it would have tran≈øported him beyond the limites of rea≈øon; but not vnto an vnbridled and raging mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure.

                        <p>That his narrations are naturall and right, might happily be argued by this: That they doe not alwayes exactly apply them≈øelues to the conclu≈øions of his iudgments; which hee pur≈øueth according to the cour≈øe hee hath taken, often beyond the matter hee ≈øheweth vs; which hee hath dained to ≈øtoope vnto with one only glance. He needeth no excu≈øe to have approoved the religion of his times, according to the lawes which commaunded him, and beene ignorant of the true and perfect wor≈øhip of God. That's his ill fortune, not his defect. I have principally con≈øidered his iudgement, whereof I am not every where throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued.

If your neighbours ≈øervant be fighting with his companion, if a di≈øh be overthrowen, you but laugh at it: you ≈øleepe quietly while≈øt Sir ≈øuch a one is bu≈øie ca≈øting vp of accounts, and over-≈øeeing his ≈øtocke with his ≈øteward, and all about your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion for to morrow. I ≈øpeake according to mine opinion: omitting not in generall to thinke, how plea≈øing an ammu≈øement it is to certaine natures, to ≈øee a quiet and pro≈øperous hou≈øhold, directed by a formall and guided by a regular order. But not intending to fa≈øten mine owne errours and inconveniences to the matter: Nor to gaine-≈øay <hi>Plato,</hi> who deemeth that the happie≈øt occupation any man can follow, is, to apply him≈øelfe to his owne private bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, without inju≈øtice. When I iourney, I have nothing to care for but my ≈øelfe, and how my money is laid out: which is di≈øpo≈øed with one onely precept. Over-many parts are required in hoarding and gathering of goods: I have no skill in it. In ≈øpending, I have ≈øome knowledge, and how to give my expences day; which indeed is it's principall v≈øe. But I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it over-ambitiou≈øly, which makes it both vnequall and deformed: and be≈øides that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate in one and other vi≈øage. If it appeare and make a good ≈øhew, if it ≈øerve the turne, I indi≈øcreetly goe after it; and as indi≈øcreetly re≈øtraine my ≈øelfe, if it ≈øhine or ≈ømile not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee. What≈øoever it bee, either Art or nature, that imprints this condition of life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by relation to others, it doth vs much more hurt then good. In going about to frame apparances according to the common opinion, wee defraud our ≈øelves of our owne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profits. Wee care not ≈øo much, what our ≈øtate, or how our being is, in vs and in effect, as wee doe how and what it is, in the publike knowledge of others. Even the goods of the minde, and wi≈øedome it ≈øelfe, ≈øeeme fruitle≈ø≈øe vnto vs, if onely enioied by vs: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it bee ≈øet foorth to the open view and approbation of ≈øtrangers. There are ≈øome, who≈øe gold runnes by ≈øtreames in places vnder ground, and that imperceptible: others extend the ≈øame in plates and leaves: So that to ≈øome, pence are worth crownes, to others the contrary: the world iudging the employment and value, according to the outward ≈øhew. All over-nice care and curious heed about riches, hath a touch or a ta≈øte of avarice. Even their di≈øpending and over regular and artificiall liberalities are not worth a warie heede-taking, and countervaile not a painefull diligence. Who ≈øo will make his expence even and ju≈øt, makes it ≈øtrict and forced. Either clo≈øe-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or employing of money, are in them≈øelves things indifferent; and admit no colour of good or evill, but according to the application of our will. The other cau≈øe that drawes mee to the≈øe iourneies or vagaries, is the di≈ø≈øent or di≈øparitie in the pre≈øent manners of our ≈øtate: I could ea≈øily comfort my ≈øelfe with this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard of the publike intere≈øt;</p>

                        <p>To conclude, I ≈øee by our example, that the ≈øocietie of men doth hold and is ≈øewed together, at what rate ≈øoever it be: where ever they be placed, in mooving and clo≈øing, they are ranged and ≈øtowed together; as vneven and rugged bodies, that orderle≈ø≈øe are hudled in ≈øome clo≈øe place, of them≈øelves finde the way to be vnited and ioined together one with another: and many times better, then Art could have di≈øpo≈øed them. King <hi>Philip</hi> a≈ø≈øembled a rabble of the mo≈øt leaud, reprobate and incorrigible men he could finde out, all which he placed in a Citie, which of purpo≈øe he had cau≈øed to be built for them, of whom it bare the name. I imagine, that even of their vices, they erected a politike contexture among≈øt them≈øelves, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and iu≈øt ≈øocietie. I ≈øee not one action, or three, or a hundred, but even divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, admitted and commonly v≈øed: ≈øo extravagant (namely in di≈øloyaltie) and ≈øo barbarous in inhumanitie, which in my conceit, are the wor≈øt and mo≈øt execrable kinde of vices, that I have not the heart ≈øo much as to conceive them without horrour: All which I in a manner admire as much as I dete≈øt. The exerci≈øe of the≈øe egregious villanies, beareth a brand of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and hardine≈ø≈øe of minde, as much as of error and irregular confu≈øion. <hi>Nece≈ø≈øitie compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth, and a≈ø≈øembleth men together.</hi> This ca≈øuall combining is afterward framed into lawes. For, there have beene ≈øome as barbarou≈øly-≈øavage, as humane opinion could po≈ø≈øible produce, which notwith≈øtanding have kept their bodies in as good health and ≈øtate, in long life, as tho≈øe of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> could doe. And to ≈øay true, all the≈øe de≈øcriptions of policie, fained by Art and ≈øuppo≈øition, are found ridiculous and fooli≈øh, to bee put in practi≈øe. The≈øe great and long-continuing altercations, about the be≈øt forme of ≈øocietie, and mo≈øt commodious rules to vnite vs together, are altercations onely proper for the exerci≈øe of our wit: As in arts, divers ≈øubiects are found, that have no e≈ø≈øence but in agitation and di≈øputing, without which they have no life at all. Such an Idea of policie, or picture of government, were to be e≈øtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed in a new world; but we take a world already made and formed to certaine cu≈øtomes: wee engender not the ≈øame as <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> nor beget it as <hi>Cadmus.</hi> By what meanes ≈øoever we have the privilege to re-erect and range the ≈øame anew, wee can very hardly wre≈øt it from the accu≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med habit and fold it hath taken, except we breake all. <hi>Solon</hi> being demanded, whether hee had e≈øtabli≈øhed the be≈øt lawes he could for the Athenians: an≈øwered, yea of tho≈øe they would have received: with ≈øuch a ≈øhift doth <hi>Varre</hi> excu≈øe him≈øelfe; ≈øaying, that if hee were newly to beginne to write of religion, he would plainly tell what his beleefe were of it: But being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die received, he will ≈øpeake more of it according to cu≈øtome, then to nature. Not to ≈øpeake by opinion, but con≈øonant to truth, the mo≈øt excellent and be≈øt policie, for any nation to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, is that vnder which it hath maintained it ≈øelfe. It's forme and e≈ø≈øentiall commoditie doth much depend of cu≈øtome. We are ea≈øily di≈øplea≈øed with the pre≈øent condition: yet doe I hold that to wi≈øh the government of few, in a popular e≈øtate: or in a Monarchie, another kinde of policie, it is a manife≈øt vice and meere follie.</p>

                        <p>So was the good Lord of <hi>Pibrac</hi> wont to ≈øpeake of it, whom we have lately lo≈øt: a man of ≈øo quaint and rare wit, of ≈øo ≈øound iudgement, and of ≈øo milde and affable behaviour. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely lo≈ø≈øe of whom, with that of the Lord of <hi>Foix,</hi> both fatally hapning to vs at one time, are ≈øurely lo≈ø≈øes of great con≈øequence vnto our crowne. I wot not well, whether <hi>France,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt all the men it hath left, is able to affoord vs two ≈øuch other Gentlemen, as may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ≈øinceritie and worth, or in ≈øufficiencie and iudgement, for the coun≈øell of our Kings, match the≈øe two Ga≈øcoynes. They were two mindes diver≈øly faire; and verily, if we re≈øpect the corrupted age wherein we live, both rare and gloriou≈øly-≈øhining, every one in her forme. But alas, what de≈øtinie had placed them on the Theater of this age, ≈øo di≈ø≈øonant and different in proportion from our deplorable corruption, and ≈øo farre from agreeing with our tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ≈øtormes? Nothing doth ≈øo neerely touch and ≈øo much overlay an e≈øtate, as innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Only change doth give forme to iniu≈øtice, and ≈øcope to tyrannie.</hi> If ≈øome one peece be out of ≈øquare, it may be vnderpropt: one may oppo≈øe him≈øelfe again≈øt that, which the alteration, incident, and corruption, naturall to all things, doth not too much elonge and draw vs from our beginnings and grounded principles: But to vndertake to re-erect and found againe ≈øo huge a ma≈ø≈øe, and change or remoove the foundations of ≈øo va≈øt a frame, belongeth only to them, who in ≈øtead of purging, deface; and in lieu of clean≈øing, ≈øcrape out: that will amend particular faults by an vniver≈øall confu≈øion, and cure di≈øea≈øes by death: <hi>Non tam commutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darum qu√†m overtendarum rerum cupidi. Not ≈øo de≈øiro√∫s to have things altered, as overthrowen.</hi> The world is fondly vnapt to cure it ≈øelfe: So impatient with that which vexeth or grieveth it, that it only aimeth to ridde it ≈øelfe of it, never regarding at what rate. Wee ≈øee by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand examples, that it doth ordinarily cure it ≈øelfe at it's owne charges: <hi>To be freed from a pre≈øent evill, is no perfect cure, except there be a generall amendment of condition.</hi> The end of a skilfull Chirurgion, is not to mortifie the bad fle≈øh, it is but the beginning and addre≈ø≈øing of his cure: he aimeth further, that is, to make the naturall to grow againe, and reduce the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his due being and qualitie. Whoever propo≈øeth onely to remoove what gnaweth him, ≈øhall be to ≈øeeke: for <hi>good doth not nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øucceed evill:</hi> another, yea a wor≈øe evill may ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it. As it hapned vnto <hi>Ce≈øars</hi> murderers, who brought the common-wealth to ≈øo di≈øtre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a plunge, that they repented them≈øelves they ever medled with the ≈øame. The like hath ≈øince fortuned to divers, yea in our daies. The French that live in my times, know very well what to ≈øpeake of ≈øuch matters. <hi>All violent changes and great alterations, di≈øorder, di≈øtemper and ≈øhake a ≈øtate very much.</hi> He that ≈øhould rightly re≈øpect a ≈øound recovery or ab≈øolute cure, and before al other things thorowly con≈øult about it, might happily grow ≈ølaoke in the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and beware how he ≈øet his hand vnto it. <hi>Pacuvius Calavius</hi> corrected the vice of this manner of proceeding by a notable example. His fellow Citizens had mutined again≈øt their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates; He being a man of eminent authoritie in the City of <hi>Capua,</hi> found one day the means to ≈øhut vp the Senate in the Guildhall or Palace, then calling the people together in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, told them; That the day was now come, wherein with full and vnre≈øi≈øted libertie, they might take vengeance of the tyrants, that had ≈øo long and ≈øo many waies oppre≈ø≈øed them, all which he had now at his mercy, alone and vnarmed. His opinion was, that orderly by lots, they ≈øhould be drawen out one after another: which done, they might particularly di≈øpo≈øe of every one: and what≈øoever ≈øhould be decreed of them, ≈øhould immediately be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted vpon the place; provided they ≈øhould therewithall pre≈øently advi≈øe and re≈øolve to nominate and e≈øtabli≈øh ≈øome hone≈øt and vndetected man, to ≈øupply the roome of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, le≈øt their Citie ≈øhould remaine void of due officers. To which they granted, and heard no ≈øooner the name of a Senatour read, but a loud exclamation of a generall di≈øcontent was rai≈øed again≈øt him: which <hi>Pacuvius</hi> perceiving, hee reque≈øted ≈øilence, and thus be≈øpake them. My countrey-men, I ≈øee very well, that man mu≈øt be cut off, hee is a pernicious and wicked member; but let vs have another ≈øound-good man in his place; and whom would you name for that purpo≈øe? This vnexpected ≈øpeech bred a di≈øtracted ≈øilence; each one finding him≈øelfe to ≈øeeke and much confounded in the choi≈øe. Yet one,

who was the bolde≈øt-impudent among≈øt them, nominated one whom he thought fitte≈øt; who was no ≈øooner heard, but a generall con≈øent of voices, louder then the fir≈øt, followed, all refu≈øing him: as one taxed with a hundred imperfections, lawfull cau≈øes and iu≈øt obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vtterly to reject him. The≈øe contradicting humours growing more violent and hot, every one following his private grudge or affection, there en≈øued a farre greater confu≈øion and hurly-burly in drawing of the ≈øecond and third Senatour, and in naming and choo≈øing their ≈øucce≈ø≈øours; about which they could never agree. As much di≈øorder and more con≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion about the election, as mutuall con≈øent and agreement about the demi≈ø≈øion and di≈øpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. About which tumultuous trouble, when they had long and to no end laboured and wearied them≈øelves, they began, ≈øome heere, ≈øome there, to ≈øcatter and ≈øteale away from the a≈ø≈øemblie: every one with this re≈øolution in his minde, that <hi>the olde≈øt and be≈øt knowen evill, is ever more tolerable, then a fre≈øh and vnexperienced mi≈øchiefe.</hi> By ≈øeeing our ≈øelves piteou≈øly to≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in continuall agitation: for what have we not done?</p>

I adde, but I correct not: Fir≈øt, becau≈øe he who hath hypotheki≈øed or engaged his labour to the world, I finde apparance, that he hath no longer right in the ≈øame: let him, if hee be able, ≈øpeake better els where, and not corrupt the worke he hath already made≈øale-off; Of ≈øuch people, a man ≈øhould buy nothing, but after they are dead: let them throughly thinke on it, before they produce the ≈øame. Who ha≈øtens them? My booke is alwaies one: except that according as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goes about to renew it, that the buyers depart not altogether empty-handed, I give my ≈øelfe law to adde thereto (as it is but vncoherent chocky, or ill joined in-laid-worke) ≈øome ≈øupernumeral embleme. They are but over-waights, which di≈øgrace not the fir≈øt forme, but give ≈øome particular price vnto every one of the ≈øucceeding, by an ambitious pety ≈øubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whence notwith ≈øtanding, it may ea≈øily happen, that ≈øome tran≈øpo≈øition of chronology is thereto commixt: my reportes taking place according to their opportunity, and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver according to their age. Secondly, for≈øomuch as in regard of my ≈øelfe, I feare to loo≈øe by the exchange: My vnder≈øtanding doth not alwayes goe forward, it ≈øometimes goes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo backeward: I in a manner di≈øtru≈øt mine owne fanta≈øies as much, though ≈øecond or third as I doe when they are the fir≈øt; or pre≈øent, as pa≈øt. <hi>We many times correct our ≈øelves as fooli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as we taxe others vnadvi≈øedly.</hi> I am growne aged by a number of yeares ≈øince my fir≈øt publications, which were in a thou≈øand five hundred and foure ≈øcore.

Publike fauor hath given me ≈øome more bouldnes, then I hoped for: but the thing I feare mo≈øt, is to breed a glutting ≈øaciety. I would rather ≈øpur, then bee weary. As a wi≈øeman of my time hath done. Commendation is ever plea≈øing, from whom, from whence, or wherefore ≈øo ever it come: yet ought a man to be informed of the cau≈øe, if he will iu≈øtly plea≈øe and applaud him≈øelfe therewith. Imperfections them≈øelues haue their meanes to be recommended. Vulgar and common e≈øtimation, is little happy if it come to encounter: And I am deceiued, if in my dayes, the wor≈øt compo≈øitions and ab≈øurde≈øt bookes have not gained the credit of popular breath. Verily I am much beholding to diuers hone≈øt men, and I thanke them, that vouch≈øafe to take my endeuours in good parte. There is no place where the deffects of the fa≈øhion doe ≈øo much appeare, as in a matter, that in it ≈øelfe hath nothing to recommend it. Good reader blame not me, for tho≈øe that pa≈ø≈øe here, either by the fantazie or vnwarine≈ø≈øe of others: for every hand, each workman, brings his owne vnto them. I neither medle with orthography (and would onely have them follow the ancient) nor with curious pointing: I have ≈ømall experience in either. Where they altogether breake the ≈øence, I little trouble my ≈øelfe therewith; for at lea≈øt they di≈øcharge me. But where they will wre≈øt-in and ≈øub≈øtitute a fal≈øe ≈øence (as often they doe) and wyre-draw me to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, then they ≈øpoile me. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, when the ≈øentence is not ≈øtrong or ≈øinnowie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meaning, an hone≈øt man may reject it to be mine. Hee that ≈øhall know how little laborious I am and how framed after mine owne fa≈øhion, will ea≈øily beleeve, I would rather endite anew, as many more other E≈ø≈øayes, then ≈øubject my ≈øelfe to trace the≈øe over againe, for this childi≈øh correction. I was ≈øaying erewhile, that being plunged in the deepe≈øt mine of this new kinde of mettall, I am not onely deprived of great familiarity with men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cu≈øtome from mine; and other opinions, by which they holde together by a knot, commanding all other knots: but am not al≈øo without ≈øome hazard, among≈øt tho≈øe, with whom all things are equally lawfull: mo≈øt of which cannot now adayes empaire their market towarde our ju≈øtice: whence the extreame degree of licenciou≈øne≈ø≈øe proceedeth.

in lo≈ø≈øe appearing (as Lawyers ≈øay) more then vnto my ≈øelfe. And ≈øome there bee, that in chollericke heate and humourous fury will cracke and vaunt much, that will performe a great deale le≈ø≈øe then my ≈øelfe, if once wee come to an equall ballance. As a hou≈øe at all times freely open, much frequented, of great haunt and officious in entertaining all ≈øortes of people (for I could never bee induced, to make an implement of warre thereof: which I perceive much more willingly to bee ≈øought-out and flocked vnto, where it is furthe≈øt from my neighbours) my hou≈øe hath merited much popular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And it were a hard matter to gourmandize my ≈øelfe vpon mine owne dung-hill: And I repute it a wonderfull and exemplar ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe, that having vndergone ≈øo many ≈øtormie-wrackes, ≈øo divers changes and tumultuous-neighbour agitations, it doth yet to this day continue free, and (as I may ≈øay) an vndefiled virgine from ≈øhedding of blood, ≈øpoile or ≈øacking. For, to ≈øay true, it was po≈ø≈øible for a man of my di≈øpo≈øition to e≈øcape from a con≈øtant and continuall forme, what≈øoever it was. But the contrary inva≈øions, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtile incur≈øions, alternations and vici≈ø≈øitudes of fortune, round about me, have hetherto more exa≈øperated, then mollified the humor of the country: and recharge mee with dangers and invincible difficulties. I have e≈øcaped. But it greeveth me that it is rather by fortune: yea and by my di≈øcretion then by ju≈øtice: And it vexeth me, to bee without the protection of the lawes and vnder any other ≈øafegard, then theirs. As things now ≈øtand, I live more then halfe by the favour of others; which is a ≈øevere obligation. I would not bee endebted for my ≈øafety, neither to the goodne≈ø≈øe, nor to the goodwill of other great men, which applaude them≈øelves with my liberty and legalitie; nor to the facilitie of my predece≈ø≈øours or mine owne manners: for, what if I were other then I am? If my demeanour, the libertie of my conver≈øation, or happily alliance, binde my neighbours: It is a cruelty, that they ≈øhould acquit them≈øelves of it, in ≈øuffring mee to live, and that they may ≈øay; wee give him a free and and vndi≈øturbed continuation of divine ≈øeruice, in the chaple of his hou≈øe, whil≈øt all other Churches round about him are by vs prophaned and de≈øerted; and wee freely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and pardon him the fruition of his goods and v≈øe of his life, as hee maintaineth our wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and in time of neede keepeth our cattle. It is long ≈øince, that in my hou≈øe, wee have a ≈øhare in <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Athenians prai≈øe, who was the generall ≈øtorier, depo≈øitary and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of his fellow-cittizens goods and pur≈øes. I am now of opinion, that a man mu≈øt live by lawe and authoritie, and not by recompence or grace. How many gallant men have rather made choi≈øe to loo≈øe their life, then be endebted for the ≈øame? I ≈øhunne to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ≈øelfe to any manner of obligation. But aboue all, to which bindes mee by dutye of bondes of honour. <hi>I finde nothing ≈øo deare, as what is given mee: and that becau≈øe my will remaines engaged by a title of ingratitude:</hi> And I more willinglye receaue ≈øuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as are to bee ≈øould. A thing ea≈øie to bee beleeved; for the≈øe I give nothing but money; but for tho≈øe, I give my ≈øelfe. The bonde that houldes mee by the lawe of hone≈øtie, ≈øeemeth to mee much more vrgent and forcible, then that of ciuill compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. I am more gentlye tide by a Notarie, then by my ≈øelfe. Is it not rea≈øon, that my con≈øcience bee much more engaged to that, wherein ≈øhee hath ≈øimplie and onely beene tru≈øted? Els, my faith oweth nothing; for ≈øhee had nothing lent hir. Let one helpe him≈øelfe with the confidence or a≈ø≈øurance hee hath taken from mee. I would much rather breake the pri≈øon of a wall or of the lawes, then the bonde of my worde. I am nicely ≈øcrupulous in keeping of my promi≈øes, nay almo≈øt ≈øuper≈øticious; and in all ≈øubiects I commonly pa≈ø≈øe them vncertaine and conditionall. To ≈øuch as are of no waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty con≈øequence, I adde force with the jealou≈øie of my rule: ≈øhee rackes and chargeth mee with hir owne intere≈øt. Yea, in ≈øuch enterpri≈øes as are altogether mine owne and free, if I ≈øpeake the word, or name the point, mee thinkes I pre≈øcribe the ≈øame vnto mee: and that to give it to anothers knowledge, it is to preordaine it vnto him≈øelfe. Me ≈øeemes I ab≈øolutely promi≈øe, when I ≈øpeake. Thus I make but ≈ømall bragge of my propo≈øitions. The condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I make of my ≈øelfe, is more mooving, forcible and ≈øevere, then that of the judges, who onely take me by the countenance of common obligation: the con≈øtraint of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience is more rigorous and more ≈øtrictly ≈øevere: I faintly follow tho≈øe duties, to which I ≈øhould bee haled, if I did not goe to them. <hi>Hoc ip≈øum it a iu≈øtum e≈øt quod rect√® fit, ≈øi volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarium.

And tho≈øe which in the behalfe of <hi>Soliman</hi> the Emperor were ≈øent to the Emperour of <hi>Calicut,</hi> did ≈øo vex him at the hart, that hee did not onely vtterly reject and ≈øcornfully refu≈øe them; ≈øaying, that neither him≈øelfe nor his predece≈ø≈øors before him, were accu≈øtomed to take any thing, and that their office was rather to give; but be≈øides he cau≈øed the Amba≈ø≈øadors, to that end ≈øent vnto him, to be ca≈øt into a deepe dungeon. When <hi>Thetis</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi>) flattereth <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> when the Lacedemonians flatter the Athenians, they doe not thereby intend to put them in minde of the good they have done them, which is ever hatefull, but of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they have received of them. Tho≈øe I ≈øee familiarly to employ and make v≈øe of all men, to begge and borrow of all men, and engage them≈øelves to all men, would doubtle≈ø≈øe never doe it, knew they as I doe, or ta≈øted they as I have done, the ≈øweete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a pure and vndepending libertie: and if therewithall (as a wi≈øeman ought) they did duly ponder what it is for a man to engage him≈øelfe into ≈øuch an obligation, or libertie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving bond. It may happily be paide ≈øometimes, But it can never be vtterly di≈ø≈øolved. It is a cruell bondage, to him that loveth, throughly and by all meanes to have the free ≈øcope of his libertie. Such as are be≈øt and mo≈øt acquainted with mee, know, whether ever they ≈øaw any man living, le≈ø≈øe ≈øoliciting, le≈ø≈øe craving, le≈ø≈øe inportuning or le≈ø≈øe begging, then I am, or that le≈ø≈øe employeth or chargeth others, which if I be, and that beyond all moderne example, it is no great wonder, ≈øithence ≈øo many parts of my humours or manners contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereunto. As a naturall kinde of ≈øtubborne≈ø≈øe; an impatience to be denied; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of my de≈øires and de≈ø≈øeignes; and an in≈øufficiencie or vntowardline≈ø≈øe in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of affaires; but aboue all, my mo≈øt fauoured qualities, lethall ≈øloathfulne≈ø≈øe, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine liberty. By all which meanes, I have framed an habite, mortally to hate, to be behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any creature els, or to depend of other, then vnto and of my ≈øelfe. True it is, that before I employ the beneficence or liberalitie of an other, in any light or waighty occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, ≈ømall or vrgent neede ≈øoever: I doe to the vtmo≈øt power employ all that ever I am able, to auoide and forbeare it. My friends doe ≈øtrangelie importune and mole≈øt me, when they ≈øolicite and vrge mee to entreate a third man. And I deeme it a matter of no le≈ø≈øe charge and imputation, to di≈øingage him that is endebted vnto mee, by making v≈øe of him, then to engage my ≈øelfe vnto him that oweth mee nothing. Both which conditions being removed, let them not looke for any comber≈øome, negotious and carefull matter at my hands (for I have denounced open warre vnto all manner of carke and care) I am commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly ea≈øie and ready in times of any bodies nece≈ø≈øitie. And I have al≈øo more avoyded to receave, then ≈øought to giue: which (as <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øaith) is al≈øo more facile. My fortune hath afforded me ≈ømall meanes to benefit others and that little ≈øhe hath be≈øtowed on me, the ≈øame hath ≈øhee al≈øo meanely and indifferently placed. Had ≈øhee made mee to bee ≈øo borne that I might have kept ≈øome ranke among≈øt men, I would then have beene ambicious in procuring to bee beloved, but never to bee feared or admired. Shall I expre≈ø≈øe it more in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie? I would have had as much regarde vnto plea≈øing, as vnto profiting. <hi>Cyrus</hi> doth mo≈øt wi≈øelye, and by the mouth of an excellent Captaine and al≈øo a better Philo≈øopher, e≈øteeme his bountie and pri≈øe his good deedes, farre beyonde his valour and aboue his warlike conque≈øts.

I have learn't to frame my journies after the Spani≈øh fa≈øhion, all at once and out-right; great and rea≈øonable. And in extreme heats, I travell by night, from Sunne-≈øet to Sunne-ri≈øing. The other fa≈øhion, confu≈øedly and in ha≈øte to bait by the way and dine, e≈øpecially in Winter, when the daies are ≈øo ≈øhort, is both trouble≈øome for man, and incommodious for hor≈øe. My Iades are the better, and hold out longer. No hor≈øe did ever faile me, that held out the fir≈øt daies iourney with me. I water them in all waters; and onely take care of their la≈øt watering, that before I come to mine Inne they have way enough to beat their water. My ≈ølothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe to ri≈øe in the morning, alloweth ≈øuch as follow mee ≈øufficient lea≈øure to dine, before wee take hor≈øe.

of them is ≈øomewhat new and ≈øtrange, and out of v≈øe, it giveth detraction to faire play. Yet is it true, that to him, who will goe about loyally to iniure me, me thinkes I doe ≈øufficiently affoord him matter, whereby he may detract and ≈ønarle at my avowed and knowen imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and wherewith hee may be ≈øatisfied, without vaine contending and idle skirmi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If my ≈øelfe by preoccupating his di≈øcovery and accu≈øation, hee thinkes I barre him of his ≈ønarling, it is good rea≈øon hee take his right, towards amplification and exten≈øion: Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence hath her rights beyond ju≈øtice: And that the vices, whereof I ≈øhew him the rootes in mee, he ≈øhould amplifie them to trees. Let him not onely employ there unto tho≈øe that po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øe mee, but tho≈øe which but threaten mee. Injurious vices, both in qualitie and in number. Let him beate mee that way. I ≈øhould willingly embrace the example of <hi>Dion</hi> the Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. <hi>Antigonus</hi> going about to ≈øcoffe and quip at him touching his birth and off-≈øpring, he interrupted him and tooke the word out of his mouth: I am (≈øaid hee) the ≈øonne of a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølave, a butcher, branded for a rogue, and of a whoore, whom my father by rea≈øon of his ba≈øe fortune, tooke to wife: Both were puni≈øhed for ≈øome mi≈ødeede. Being a childe, an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator bought me as a ≈ølave, liking me for my beautie and comeline≈ø≈øe; and dying, left mee all his goods; which having tran≈øported into this citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> I have applied my ≈øelfe vnto Philo≈øophie. Let not Hi≈øtorians bu≈øie them≈øelves in ≈øeeking newes of mee. I will at large blaz on my ≈øelfe, and plainely tell them the whole di≈øcour≈øe. <hi>A generous and free-minded confe≈ø≈øion doth di≈øable a reproch and di≈øarme an iniurie.</hi> So it is, that when all Cards be told, me ≈øeemes, that I am as oft commended as di≈øprai≈øed beyond rea≈øon. As al≈øo me thinks, that even from my infancie, both in ranke and degree of honour, I have had place given mee, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above and more, than le≈ø≈øe and beneath that which appertained to mee. I ≈øhould better like to be in a countrie, where the≈øe orders might either be reformed or contemned. Amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt men, after that ≈øtriving or altercation for the prerogative or vpper hand in going or ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, exceedeth three replies, it becommeth incivill. I neither feare to yeeld and give place, nor to follow and proceed vnju≈øtly, ≈øo I may avoid ≈øuch irke≈øome and importunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtations. And never did man de≈øire precedencie or place before me, but I quitted the ≈øame without grudging. Be≈øides the profit I reape by writing of my ≈øelfe, I have hoped for this other, that if ever it might happen my humours ≈øhould plea≈øe or ≈øympathize with ≈øome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt man, he would before my death ≈øeeke to be acquainted with me, or to overtake mee.

Had it beene a matter of la≈øting continuance, it ≈øhould have beene compiled in a better and more poli≈øhed language: According to the continuall variation, that hitherto hath followed our French tongue. Who may hope, that it's pre≈øent forme ≈øhall be in v≈øe fifty yeares hence?

But to make an end of my weake humours: I confe≈ø≈øe, that in travelling I ≈øeldome alight in any place or come to any Inne, but fir≈øt of all I ca≈øt in my minde whether I may conveniently lie there, if I ≈øhould chance to fall ≈øicke; or dying, die at my ea≈øe and take my death quietly. I will, as neere as I can be lodged in ≈øome convenient part of the hou≈øe, and in particular from all noi≈øe or ≈øtinking favours; in no clo≈øe, filthy or ≈ømoaky chamber. I ≈øeeke to flatter death by the≈øe frivolous circum≈øtances: Or as I may rather ≈øay, to di≈øcharge my ≈øelfe from all other trouble or encombrance; that ≈øo I may wholly apply and attend her, who without that ≈øhall happily lie very heavy vpon me. I will have her take a full ≈øhare of my lives ea≈øes and commodities; it is a great part of it and of much con≈øequence, and I hope it ≈øhall not belie what is pa≈øt. Death hath ≈øome formes more ea≈øie then others, and a≈ø≈øumeth divers qualities; according to all mens fantazies. Among the naturall ones, that proceeding of weakene≈ø≈øe and heavy dulne≈ø≈øe, to me ≈øeemeth gentle and plea≈øant. Among the violent I imagine a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice more hardly, then a ruine that overwhelmes me: and a cutting blow with a ≈øword, then a ≈øhot of an harquebu≈øe: and I would rather have cho≈øen to drinke the potion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> then wound my ≈øelfe as <hi>Cato</hi> did. And though it bee all one yet doth my imagination per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a difference, as much as is betweene death and life, to ca≈øt my ≈øelfe into a burning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, or in the channell of a ≈øhallow river. <hi>So fooli≈øhly doth our feare re≈øpect more the meane, then the effect.</hi> It is but one in≈øtant; but of ≈øuch moment, that to pa≈ø≈øe the ≈øame according to my de≈øire, I would willingly renounce many of my lives-dayes. Since all mens fantazies, finde either exce≈ø≈øe or diminution in her ≈øharpen≈ø≈øe; ≈øince every man hath ≈øome choi≈øe betweene the formes of dying, let vs trie a little further, whether we can finde out ≈øome one, free from all ≈øorrow and griefe. Might not one al≈øo make it ≈øeeme voluptuous, as did tho≈øe who died with <hi>Anthonic</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra?</hi> I omit to ≈øpeake of the ≈øharpe and exemplar efforts, that philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophy and religion produce. But among≈øt men of no great fame, ≈øome have beene found (as one <hi>Petronius,</hi> and one <hi>Tigillinus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>) engaged to make them≈øelves away, who by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈ø≈øe of their preparations have in a manner lulled the ≈øame a≈øleepe. They have made it pa≈ø≈øe and glide away, even in the mid≈øt of the ≈øecurity of their accu≈øtomed pa≈øtimes and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton recreations: Among≈øt harlots and good felowes; no ≈øpeech of comfort, no mention of will or te≈øtament, no ambitious affectation of con≈øtancie, no di≈øcour≈øe of their future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no compunction of ≈øinnes committed, no apprehen≈øion of their ≈øoules-health, ever troubling them; amid ≈øports, playes, banketting, ≈øurfetting, chambring, je≈øting, mu≈øicke and ≈øinging of amorous ver≈øes: and all ≈øuch popular and common entertainments. Might not wee imitate this manner of re≈øolution in more hone≈øt affaires and more commendable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts? <hi>And ≈øince there are deaths good vnto wi≈øe men and good vnto fooles, let vs find ≈øome one that may be good vnto ≈øuch as are betweene both.</hi> My imagination pre≈øents me ≈øome ea≈øie and milde countenance thereof, and (≈øince we mu≈øt all die) to bee de≈øired.

But I, who for the mo≈øt part never travell, but for plea≈øure, will neither bee ≈øo ill advi≈øed, nor ≈øo ≈øimply guided. If the way be fowle on my right hand, I take the left: If I find my ≈øelfe ill at ea≈øe or vnfit to ride, I ≈øtay at home. Which doing, and ob≈øerving this cour≈øe, in very truth I ≈øee no place, and come no where, that is not as plea≈øant, as convenient and as commodious as mine owne hou≈øe. True it is, that I ever finde ≈øuperfluitie ≈øuperfluous: and ob≈øerve a kinde of trouble≈øomene≈ø≈øe in delicatene≈ø≈øe and plenty. Have I omitted or left any thing behind me that was worth the ≈øeeing? I returne backe; It is ever my way, I am never out of it. I trace no certaine line, neither right nor crooked. Comming to any ≈øtrange place, finde I not what was tould mee? As it often fortuneth, that others judgements agree not with mine, and have mo≈øt times found them fal≈øe, I grieve not at my labour: I have learned that what was reported to bee there, is not. I have my bodies complexion as free, and my ta≈øte as common, as any man in the world. The diver≈øity of fa≈øhions betweene one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, concerneth mee nothing, but by the varieties-plea≈øure. <hi>Each cu≈øtome hath his rea≈øon.</hi> Bee the trenchers or di≈øhes of wood, of pewter or of earth: bee my meate boyled, ro≈øted or baked; butter or oyle, and that of Olives or of Wall-nuts; hot or colde; I make no difference; all is one to me: And as one, that is growing old, I accu≈øe the generous facultie; and had neede that delicatne≈ø≈øe and choi≈øe, ≈øhould ≈øtay the indi≈øcretion of my appetite, and ≈øometime ea≈øe and ≈øolace my ≈øtomacke. When I have beene out of <hi>France,</hi> and that to do me curte≈øie, ≈øome have asked me, whether I would be ≈øerved after the French maner, I have je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted at them, and have ever thru≈øt-in amonge≈øt the thicke≈øt tables and fulle≈øt of ≈øtrangers. I am a≈øhamed to ≈øee our men be≈øotted with this fooli≈øh humor, to fret and chafe, when they ≈øee any fa≈øhions contrary to theirs. They thinke them≈øelves out of their element, when they are out of their Village. Where ever they come they keepe their owne country fa≈øhions, and hate, yea and abhorre all ≈øtrange maners: Meete they a countriman of theirs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> they fea≈øt that good fortune: And what doe they? Marry clo≈øe and joyne together, to blame, to condemne and to ≈øcorne ≈øo many barbarous fa≈øhions as they ≈øee. And why not Barbarous, ≈øince not French? Nay happily they are the better ≈øort of men, that have noted and ≈øo much exclaimed again≈øt them. Mo≈øt take going out but for comming home. They travell clo≈øe and covered, with a ≈øilent and incommunicable wit, defending them≈øelves from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ≈øome vnknowne ayre. What I ≈øpeake of ≈øuch, puts mee in minde in the like matter, of that I have heretofore perceived in ≈øome of your yoong Courtiers. They onely conver≈øe with men of their coate; and with di≈ødaine or pitty looke vpon vs, as if we were men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. Take away their new fangled, my≈øterious and affected courtly complements, and they are out of their bya≈øe. As farre to ≈øeeke and ≈øhort of vs, as we of them. That ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is true; That <hi>An honest man is a man compounded.</hi> Cleane contrary, I travell fully glutted with out fa≈øhions: Not to ≈øeeke Gaskoines in <hi>Sicilie;</hi> I have left over many at home.

And which is more, me ≈øeemeth, I have not met with many maners, that are not worth ours. Indeede I have not wandred farre, ≈øcar≈øly have I lo≈øt the ≈øight of our Chimnies. Moreover, mo≈øt of the ca≈øuall companies you meete withall by the way, have more incommodity than plea≈øure: a matter I doe not greatly take hold of, and le≈ø≈øe now that age dooth particularize and in ≈øome ≈øort ≈øeque≈øter me from common formes.

The one inconvenience is yrke≈øome, the other trouble≈øome: but yet the la≈øt is (in my conceipt) more rude. <hi>It is a rare, chaunce and ≈øeld-≈øeene fortune, but of exceeding ≈øolace and inestimable woorth, to have an honest man, of ≈øingular experience, of a ≈øound iudgement, of a re≈øolute vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and constant re≈øolution, and of manners comformable to yours, to accompany or follow you with a goodwill.</hi> I have found great want of ≈øuch a one in all my voyages.

                        <p>IN regard of the common ≈øort of men, few things touch mee, or (to ≈øpeake properly) ≈øway me: For it is rea≈øon they touch, ≈øo they po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe-vs not.

I am not wedded vnto many things, and by con≈øequence, not pa≈ø≈øionate of them. I have my ≈øight cleare, but tied to few objects: My ≈øen≈øes delicate and gentle; but my apprehen≈øion and application hard and dull: I engage my ≈øelfe with difficulty.

he faines, he yeelds, hee deferres at his plea≈øure according to the occa≈øions of nece≈ø≈øity: hee failes of his attempt, without torment or affliction: ready and prepared for a new enterpri≈øe. He marcheth alwayes with the reines in his hand. Hee that is be≈øotted with this violent and tyrannicall intention, doth nece≈ø≈øarily declare much indi≈øcretion and inju≈øtice. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his de≈øire tran≈øports him. They are ra≈øh motions, and if fortune helpe not much, of little fruit. Philo≈øophie wills vs to bani≈øh choller in the puni≈øhment of offences; not to the end revenge ≈øhould be more moderate, but contrary, more weighty and ≈øurely ≈øet on: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this violence ≈øeemeth to bee a let. Choller doth not onely trouble, but wearieth the executioners armes. This pa≈ø≈øionate heat dulleth and con≈øumes their force. As in too much ≈øpeede, <hi>fe≈øtinatio tarda e≈øt; Hastine≈ø≈øe is ≈ølow.</hi> Ha≈øte makes wa≈øte, and hinders and ≈øtayes it ≈øelfe: <hi>Ip≈øa ≈øe velocitas implicat; Swiftne≈ø≈øe entangles it ≈øelfe.</hi> As for example, according as by ordinarie cu≈øtome I perceive, covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe hath no greater let, then it ≈øelfe. The more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and extended it is, the le≈ø≈øe effectuall and fruitfull. Commonly it gathers wealth more ≈øpeedily being masked with a ≈øhew of liberality. A very hone≈øt Gentleman and my good friend, was likely to have endangered the health of his body, by an over pa≈ø≈øionate attention and earne≈øt affection to the affaires of a Prince, who was his Mai≈øter. Which Mai≈øter hath thus de≈øcribed him≈øelfe vnto me: That as another, hee di≈øcerneth and hath a feeling of the burthen of accidents: but ≈øuch as have no remedie, hee pre≈øently re≈øolveth to ≈øuffer with patience: For the re≈øt, after hee hath appointed nece≈ø≈øary provi≈øions, which by the vivacitie and nimblene≈ø≈øe of his wit hee ≈øpeedily effects, hee then attends the event with quietne≈ø≈øe. Verily, I have ≈øeene in him at one in≈øtant a great carele≈øne≈ø≈øe and liberty, both in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and countenance: Even in important and difficult affaires. I finde him more magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and capable, in bad then in good fortune. His lo≈ø≈øes are to him more glorious, than his victories; and his mourning than his triumphs. Con≈øider how in meere vaine and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous actions, as at che≈ø≈øe, tennis and ≈øuch like ≈øports, this earne≈øt and violent engaging with an ambicious de≈øire to winne, doth pre≈øently ca≈øt both minde and limmes into di≈øorder and indi≈øcretion. Wherein a man doth both dazle his ≈øight and di≈øtemper his whole body. Hee who demeaneth him≈øelfe with mo≈øt moderation both in winning and loo≈øing, is ever nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt vnto him≈øelfe, and hath his wits be≈øt about him. The le≈ø≈øe hee is mooved or pa≈ø≈øionate in play, the more ≈øafely doth he governe the ≈øame, and to his greater advantage. We hindet the mindes ≈øeazure and holdfa≈øt, by giving her ≈øo many things to ≈øeize vpon. Some wee ≈øhould onely pre≈øent vnto her, others fa≈øten vpon hir, and others incorporate into hir. Shee may ≈øee and feele all things, but mu≈øt onely feede on hir ≈øelfe: And bee in≈øtructed in that which properly concerneth hir, and which meerely belongeth to her e≈ø≈øence and ≈øub≈øtance. <hi>The lawes of nature teach vs what is iu≈øt and fit for vs.</hi> After the wi≈øe-men have told vs, that according to nature no man is indigent or wanteth, and that each-one is poore but in his owne opinion, they al≈øo di≈øtingui≈øh ≈øubtilly, the de≈øires proceeding from Nature, from ≈øuch as grow from the di≈øorders of our fanta≈øie. Tho≈øe who≈øe end may be di≈øcerned are meerely hers; and ≈øuch as flie before vs and who≈øe end we cannot attaine, are properly ours. <hi>Want of goods may ea≈øily be cured, but the poverty of the minde, is incurable.</hi>

in their pa≈ø≈øion. Their di≈øcretion hath no other choi≈øe but what plea≈øeth them and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their cau≈øe.

But truely they wrong the ju≈øt partes, when they ≈øeeke to helpe them with fraude or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts. I have alwayes contradicted the ≈øame. This meane is but for ≈øicke braines: The healthy have ≈øurer and hone≈øter wayes to maintaine their re≈øolutions and excu≈øe all contrary accidents. The Heavens never ≈øaw ≈øo weighty a di≈øcord and ≈øo harmefull a hatred, as that betweene <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> nor ever ≈øhall heereafter: Mee ≈øeemeth notwith≈øtanding, I ≈øee in tho≈øe noble and Heroicall mindes, an exemplar and great moderation of the one toward the other. It was a jelou≈øie of honour and emulation of command, which tran≈øported them, not to a furious and indi≈øcreete hatred; without malice or detraction. In their ≈øharpe≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites, I di≈øcover ≈øome reliques of re≈øpect and cinders of well-meaning affection. And I imagine, that had it beene po≈ø≈øible, either of them de≈øired rather to effect his purpo≈øe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out overthrowing his competitour, than by working his vtter ruine. Note how contrarie the proceeding was betweene <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius.</hi> We mu≈øt not runne headlong after our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and private intere≈øts.

From which naturall ≈ølackne≈ø≈øe, one mu≈øt not therefore inferre any proofe of di≈øabilitie: For, <hi>Want of care and lacke of iudgement are two thinges:</hi> And le≈ø≈øe vnkindne≈ø≈øe and ingratitude toward tho≈øe Citizens, who to gratifie me, employed the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt of all the meanes they could po≈ø≈øibly; both before they knew me and ≈øince. And who did much more for me, in appoynting me my charge the ≈øecond time, then in choo≈øing me the fir≈øt. I love them with all my heart, and wi≈øh them all the good that may be. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if occa≈øion had beene offered, I would have≈øpared nothing to have done them ≈øervice. I have ≈øtirred and laboured for them, as I doe for my ≈øelfe. They are a good people, warlike and generous; yet capable of obedience and di≈øcipline, and fit for good employment, if they be well guided. They ≈øay likewi≈øe, that I pa≈ø≈øed over this charge of mine without any deede of note or great ≈øhew. It is true. Moreover, they accu≈øe my ce≈ø≈øation, when as all the world was convicted of too much dooing: I have a mo≈øt nimble motion, where my will doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie me. But this point is an enemie vnto per≈øeverance. Who≈øoever will make v≈øe of mee, according to my ≈øelfe, let him employ me in affaires, that require vigor and liberty: that have a ≈øhort, a ≈øtraight, and therewithall a hazardous cour≈øe: I may peradventure ≈øomewhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile therein. Whereas if it be tedious, craftie, laborious, artificiall and intricate, they ≈øhall doe better to addre≈ø≈øe them≈øelves to ≈øome other man. All charges of importance are not difficult. I was prepared to labour ≈øomewhat more earne≈øtly, if there had beene great neede. For it lyes in my power, to doe ≈øomething more than I make ≈øhew-of, and than I love to doe. To my knowledge, I have not omitted any motion that duty required earne≈øtly at my hands. I have ea≈øily forgotten tho≈øe, which ambition blendeth with dutie and cloketh with her title. It is they, which mo≈øt commonly fill the eyes and eares, and ≈øatisfie men. Not the thing it ≈øelfe, but the apparance payeth them. If they heare no noi≈øe, they imagine we ≈øleepe. My humours are contrary to turbulent humours. I could pacifie an inconvenience or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without troubling my ≈øelfe, and cha≈øti≈øe a di≈øorder without alteration.</p>
                        <p>Have I neede of choller and inflammation; I borrow it, and therewith maske my ≈øelfe: My maners are mu≈øtie, rather wallowi≈øh then ≈øharpe.

This image of <hi>Socrates</hi> his di≈øcour≈øe, which his friends have left vs, we only approve it, by the reverence of publicke approbation. It is not of our owne knowledge: they are not according to our v≈øe. Might ≈øuch a man be borne now adayes, there are but few would now e≈øteeme him.

Is not in genuity (according to vs) co≈øin-germaine vnto ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe, and a quality of reproach? <hi>Socrates</hi> maketh his ≈øoule to moove, with a naturall and common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

For, in <hi>Cato,</hi> it is manife≈øtly ≈øeene, to be an out-right proceeding, far-above &amp; beyond the common: By the brave exploites of his life, and in his death, hee is ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be mounted vpon his great hor≈øes. Whereas this man keepes on the ground, and with a gentle and ordinary pace, treateth of the mo≈øt profitable di≈øcour≈øes, and addre≈ø≈øeth him≈øelfe both vnto death and to the mo≈øt thorny and crabbed cro≈ø≈øes, that may happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cour≈øe of humane life. It hath indeede fortuned, that the worthie≈øt man to be known, and for a patterne to be pre≈øented to the world, he is the man of whom we have mo≈øt certaine knowledge. He hath beene declared and enlightned by the mo≈øt cleare-≈øeeing men, that ever were; the te≈øtimonies wee have of him, are in faithfulne≈ø≈øe and ≈øufficiency mo≈øt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable. It is a great matter, that ever he was able to give ≈øuch order vnto the pure imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a childe, that without altring or wre≈øting them, he hath thence produced the faire≈øt effects of our minde. He neither repre≈øents it rich nor high-rai≈øed; but found and pure: and ever with a blithe and vndefiled health. By the≈øe vulgar ≈øprings and naturall wards: by the≈øe ordinary and common fanta≈øies, ≈øans mooving or without vrging him≈øelfe, hee erected not onely the mo≈øt regular, but the highe≈øt and mo≈øt vigorous opinions, actions and cu≈øtomes, that ever were.

borrowed from arte, or from learning. The ≈øimple≈øt may there know their meanes and might: it is impo≈ø≈øible to goe further backe or lower. He hath done humane nature a great kindene≈ø≈øe, to ≈øhew what and how much ≈øhe can doe of her ≈øelfe. Wee are every one richer then we imagine, but we are taught to borrow, and in≈øtructed to ≈øhift; and rather to make v≈øe of others goods and meanes, then of our owne. There is nothing whereon man can ≈øtay or fix him≈øelfe in time of his neede. Of voluptuou≈øne≈ø≈øe, of riches, of plea≈øure, of power, hee ever embraceth more, then hee can gra≈øpe or hold.

But in ≈øo ≈øaying, I ≈øuppo≈øe, that according to his wonted v≈øe, he did but je≈øt: and ≈øo excellent a mind, did never frame it ≈øelfe. I cannot often enough repeate, how much I e≈øteeme beauty, ≈øo powerfull and advantagious a quality is ≈øhe.

So hath not the fir≈øt <hi>Scipio.</hi> One ≈øame word in Greeke importeth faire and good. And even the Holy-Gho≈øt calleth often tho≈øe good, which he meaneth faire. I ≈øhould willingly maintaine the ranke of the goods, as imployed the ≈øong, which <hi>Plato</hi> ≈øaith to have beene triviall, taken from ≈øome auncient Poet; <hi>Health beeuty</hi> and <hi>riches. Aristotle</hi> ≈øaith, that the right of commaunding, doth of duty belong to ≈øuch as are faire; and if haply any be found, who≈øe beauty approached to that of the Gods images, that veneration is equally due vnto them.

Not onely in men that ≈øerue me, but in bea≈øtes al≈øo, I con≈øider the ≈øame within two inches of goodne≈ø≈øe. Yet me thinkes, that the ≈øame feature and manner of the face and tho≈øe linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which ≈øome argue certaine inward complexions, and our future fortunes, is a thing that doth not directly nor ≈øimply lodge vnder the Chapter of beauty and ill favourdne≈ø≈øe; no more than all good favours, or cleerene≈ø≈øe of aire, doe not alwayes promi≈øe health; nor all fogges and ≈øtinkes, infection, in times of the plague. Such as accu≈øe Ladies to contradict the beauty, by their manners, gue≈ø≈øe not alwayes at the truth. For, <hi>In an ill favourd and ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed face, may ≈øometimes harbour ≈øome aire of probitie, and tru≈øt.</hi> As on the contrary, I have ≈øometimes read betweene two faire eyes, the threats of a maligne and dangerous ill-boding nature. There are ≈øome fauourable Phy≈øiognomies; For in a throng of victorious enemies, you ≈øhall pre≈øently ammidde≈øt a multitude of vnknowen faces, make choi≈øe of one man more than of others, to yeeld your≈øelfe vnto and tru≈øt y√≤ur life; and not properly by the con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beauty. A mans lo√≤ke or aire of his face, is but a weake warrant; notwith≈øtanding it is of ≈øome con≈øideration. And were I to whippe them, I would more rudely ≈øcourge ≈øuch as maliciou≈øly bely &amp; betray the promi≈øes, which Nature had charactred in their front. And more ≈øeverely would I puni≈øh malicious craft in a debonaire apparance and in a mild promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing countenance.

To progno≈øticate future ≈øucce≈ø≈øes of them, be matters I leave vndecided.

                        <p>And which makes a contrary ≈øhew to that of <hi>Socrates.</hi> It hath often betided me, that by the ≈øimple credite of my pre≈øence and a≈øpect, ≈øome that had no knowledge of me, have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tru≈øted vnto it, were it about their owne affaires or mine. And even in forraine countries, I have thereby reaped ≈øingular and rare favours. The≈øe two experiments, are hapily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be particularly related. A <hi>quidam</hi> gallant, determined vpon a time to ≈øurpri≈øe both my hou≈øe and my ≈øelfe. His plot was, to come riding alone to my gate, and in≈øtantly to vrge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. I knew him by name<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and had ≈øome rea≈øon to tru≈øt him, being my neighbour and ≈øomewhat alide vnto me. I pre≈øently cau≈øed my gates to be opened, as I do to all men. He comes-in all afrighted, his hor≈øe out of breath; both much hara≈ø≈øed. He entertaines me with this fable; that within halfe a league of my hou≈øe he was ≈øodainely ≈øet-vpon by an enemie of his, whome I knew well and had heard of their quarrell: that his foe had wondrou≈øly put him to his ≈øpurres; that being ≈øurpri≈øed vnarmed, and having fewer in his company then the other, he was glad to runne away, and for ≈øafety had made ha≈øte to come to my hou≈øe, as to his ≈øanctuary: That he was much perplexed for his men, all which he ≈øuppo≈øed to be either taken or ≈ølaine. I endevoured friendly to comfort and ≈øincerely to warrant and refre≈øh him. Within a while came gallopping foure or five of his Souldiers, amazed, as if they had beene out of their wits, ha≈øting, to be let-in: Shortly after came others, and others<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> all proper men, well mounted, better armed, to the number of thirty or there abouts, all ≈øeeming di≈øtracted for feare, as if the enemie that pur≈øued them had beene at their heeles. This my≈øterie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ≈øummon my ≈øu≈øpicion. I was not ignorant of the age wherin I lived, nor how much my hou≈øe might bee envied: and had ≈øundry examples of others of my acquaintance, that had beene ≈øpoiled, be≈øet and ≈øurpri≈øed thus and thus. So it is, that perceiving with my ≈øelfe, there was nothing to be gotten, though I had begunne to v≈øe them kindly, if I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and being vnable to rid my ≈øelfe of them and cleare my hou≈øe without danger and ≈øpoiling all; as I ever doe, I tooke the plaine≈øt and naturall well meaning way, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded they ≈øhould be let in and bid welcome. And to ≈øay truth, I am by nature little ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious or mi≈øtru≈øtfull, I am ea≈øily drawen to admit excu≈øes and encline to mild interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I take men according to common order, and ≈øuppo≈øe every one to meane as I doe, and

believe the≈øe perver≈øe and tretcherous inclinations, except I be compelled by ≈øome autenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call te≈øtimonie, no more then mon≈øters or miracles. Be≈øides, I am a man that willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ≈øelfe vnto fortune, and carele≈øly ca≈øt my ≈øelfe into her armes: Whereof hitherto I have more ju≈øt cau≈øe to commend my≈øelfe, then to complaine. And have found her more circum≈øpect and friendly<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> carefull of my affaires, then I am my ≈øelfe. There are certaine actions in my life, the conduct of which may ju≈øtly be termed difficult, or if any be ≈øo di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, prudent. And of tho≈øe, ≈øuppo≈øe the third part of them to be mine owne; truely the other two are richly hirs. We are to blame, and in my conceit we erre, that we doe not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and ≈øo much as we ought, tru≈øt the heavens with our≈øelves. And pretend more in our owne conduct, then of right appertaines vnto vs. Therefore doe our de≈ø≈øeignes ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mi≈øcarry, and our intents ≈øo ≈øeldome ≈øort to wi≈øhed effect. The heauens are angry, and I may ≈øay envious of the exten≈øion and large priviledge we a≈øcribe vnto the right of humane wi≈øedome, to the prejudice of theirs: and abridge them ≈øo much the more vnto vs, by how much more we endeuour to amplifie them. But to come to my former di≈øcour≈øe. The≈øe gallants kept ≈øtill on hor≈øebacke in my court, and would not alight: their Captaine with me in my hall, who would never have his hor≈øe ≈øet-vp, ≈øtill ≈øaying that he would not ≈øtay, but mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily withdraw him≈øelfe, ≈øo ≈øoone as he had newes of his followers. He ≈øaw him≈øelfe ma≈øter of his enterpri≈øe, and nothing was wanting but the execution. Hee hath ≈øince reported very often, (for he was no whit ≈øcrupulous or afraid to tell this ≈øtory) that my vndaunted lookes, my vndi≈ømaide countenance, and my liberty of ≈øpeech, made him reject all manner of trea≈øonable intents or trecherous de≈ø≈øeignes. What ≈øhall I ≈øay more? He bids me farewell, calleth for his hor≈øe, gets vp, and offreth to be gone, his people having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their eies fixed vpon him, to ob≈øerve his lookes and ≈øee what ≈øigne he ≈øhould make vnto them: much amazed to ≈øee him be gone, and wondring to ≈øee him omit and for≈øake ≈øuch an advantage. An other time, tru≈øting to a certaine truce or ce≈ø≈øation of armes, that lately had beene publi≈øhed through our campes in <hi>France,</hi> as one ≈øu≈øpecting no harme, I vndertooke a journey from home, through a dangerous and very tickli≈øh country; I had not rid far, but I was di≈øcovered, and behold three or foure troupes of hor≈øemen, all ≈øeverall wayes, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, with purpo≈øe to entrap me: One of which overtooke mee the third day; where I was round be≈øet and charged by fifteene or twenty Gentlemen, who had all vizardes and ca≈øes, followed aloofe-off by a band of Argoletiers. I was charged, I yeelded, I was taken and immediately drawne into the bo≈øome of a thicke Wood, that was not far-off; there puld from my Hor≈øe, ≈øtripped with all ≈øpeed, my truncks and cloke<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> bags rifled, my box taken; my Hor≈øes, my equipage and ≈øuch things as I had, di≈øper≈øed and ≈øhared among≈øt them. We continued a good while among≈øt tho≈øe thorny bu≈øhes, conte≈øting and ≈øtriving about my ran≈øome, which they racked ≈øo high, that it appeared well I was not much knowen of them.

To conclude, the mo≈øt precious jewell they pre≈øented me, was my liberty; as for my other things, I cared not greatly at that time. What the true cau≈øe of ≈øo vnlockt for a change and ≈øo ≈øodaine an alteration was, without any apparent impul≈øion, and of ≈øo wonderfull repentance, at ≈øuch a time, in ≈øuch an opportunity and ≈øuch an enterpri≈øe, fore-meditated, con≈øulted and effected without controlement, and which through cu≈øtome and the impiety of times was now become lawfull, (for at the fir≈øt brunt I plainely confe≈ø≈øed, and genuinly told them what ≈øide I was of, where my way lay, and whither I was riding) I verily know not yet, nor can I give any rea≈øon for it. The chiefe≈øt among≈øt them vnmasked him≈øelfe, told mee his name and repeated diver≈øe times vnto me, that I ≈øhould acknowledge my deliverance to my countenance, to my boldne≈ø≈øe and con≈øtancy of ≈øpeech, and be beholding to them for it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch as they made me vnworthy of ≈øuch a misfortune; and demanded a≈ø≈øurance of me for the like curte≈øie.

No quality is ≈øo vniver≈øall in this ≈øurface of things, as variety and diver≈øity. The Greekes, the Latines, and wee v≈øe for the mo≈øt expre≈ø≈øe examples of ≈øimilitude, that of egs. Some have neverthele≈ø≈øe beene found, e≈øpecially one in <hi>Delphos,</hi> that knew markes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene egges, and neuer tooke one for another. And having diver≈øe Hennes, could rightly judge which had laid the egge. di≈ø≈øimilitude doth of it ≈øelfe in≈øinuate into our workes, no arte can come neere vnto ≈øimilitude. Neither <hi>Perozet</hi> nor any other carde-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker can ≈øo indu≈øtriou≈øly ≈ømoothe or whiten the backe≈øide of his cardes, but ≈øome cunning gam≈øter will di≈øtingui≈øh them, onely by ≈øeeing ≈øome other player handle or ≈øhuffle them. Re≈øemblance doth not ≈øo much make one, as difference maketh another. Nature hath bound her≈øelfe to make nothing that may not be di≈ø≈øemblable- Yet doth not the opinion of that man greatly plea≈øe mee, that ≈øuppo≈øed by the multitude of lawes, to curbe the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judges, in entting out their mor≈øells. He perceived not, that there is as much liberty and exten≈øion in the interpretation of lawes, as in their fa≈øhion. And tho≈øe but mocke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, who thinke to dimini≈øh our debates and ≈øtay them, by calling vs to the expre≈ø≈øe word of ≈øacred Bible.

Wee ≈øee how farre hee was deceived. For wee have in <hi>France</hi> more lawes then all the world be≈øides; yea more then were needefull to governe all the worlds imagined by <hi>Epicurus: Vt olim flagitijs, ≈øic nunc legibus labor amus. As in times pa≈øt we were ≈øicke of offences, ≈øo now are we of lawes.</hi> As wee have given our judges ≈øo large a ≈øcope to moote, to opinionate, to ≈øuppo≈øe and decide, that there was never ≈øo powerfull and ≈øo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious a liberty. What have our lawmakers gained with chu≈øing a hundred thou≈øand kindes of particular ca≈øes, and adde as many lawes vnto them? That number hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, with the infinite diver≈øity of humane accidents. The multiplying of our inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ≈øhall never come to the variation of examples. Adde a hundred times as many vnto them, yet ≈øhall it not followe, that of events to come, there be any one found, that in all this infinite number of ≈øelected and enregi≈øtred events, ≈øhall meete with one, to which hee may ≈øo exactly joyne and match it, but ≈øome circum≈øtance and diver≈øity will remaine, that may require a diver≈øe con≈øideration of judgement. There is but little relation betweene our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are in perpetuall mutation, and the fixed and vnmooveable lawes. The mo≈øt to be de≈øired, are the rare≈øt, the ≈øimple≈øt and mo≈øt generall. And yet I believe, it were better to have none at all, then ≈øo infinite a number as wee have. Nature gives them ever more happy, then tho≈øe wee give our ≈øelves.

This done, The Iudges are adverti≈øed by the Officers of a ≈øub-alternall Court, not far-off, that they have certaine pri≈øoners in hold, that have directly confe≈ø≈øed the fore≈øaid murther, and thereof bring mo≈øt evident markes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens. The que≈øtion and con≈øultation is now in the former Court, whether for all this, they might interrupt, or ≈øhould deferre the execution of the ≈øentence pronounced again≈øt the fir≈øt. They con≈øider the novelty of the example and con≈øequence thereof, and how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the judgement. They conclude, that the condemnation hath pa≈ø≈øed according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Law, and therefore the Iudges are not ≈øubject to repentance. To be ≈øhort, the≈øe mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretches are con≈øecrated to the pre≈øcriptions of the Law. <hi>Philip,</hi> or ≈øome other, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ≈øuch an inconvenience, in this manner. He had by an irrevocable ≈øentence condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one to pay another a round ≈øumme of money for a fine. A while after, the truth being di≈øcovered, it was found, he had wrongfully condemned him. On one ≈øide was the right of the cau≈øe, on the other the right of judiciary formes. He is in ≈øome ≈øort to ≈øatisfie both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ≈øuffering the ≈øentence to ≈øtand in full power: and with his owne pur≈øe recompenced the intere≈øt of the condemned. But hee was to deale with a reparable accident, my poore ≈ølaves were hanged irreparably. How many condemnations have I ≈øeene more criminall, than the crime it ≈øelfe? All this put me in minde of tho≈øe auncient opinions; That <hi>Hee who will doe right in gro≈ø≈øe, mu≈øt needes doe wrong by retaile; and iniu≈øtly in ≈ømall things, that will come to doe iu≈øtice in great matters;</hi> That humane iu≈øtice is framed according to the modell of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicke, according to which, what≈øoever is profitable is al≈øo ju≈øt and hone≈øt: And of that the Stoickes hold, that Nature her ≈øelfe in mo≈øt of her workes, proceedeth again≈øt iu≈øtice: And of that which the Cyreniaques hold, that there is nothing ju≈øt of it ≈øelfe: That cu≈øtomes and lawes frame ju≈øtice. And the Theodorians, who in a wi≈øe man allow as ju≈øt, all manner of theft, ≈øacriledge and paillardi≈øe, ≈øo he thinke it profitable for him. There is no remedy: I am in that ca≈øe, as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was, and if I can otherwi≈øe chu≈øe, will never put my ≈øelfe vnto a man that ≈øhall determine of my head; or con≈øent that my honour or life, ≈øhall depend on the indu≈øtry or care of mine atturney, more then mine innocency. I could willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture my ≈øelfe, and ≈øtand to that Law, that ≈øhould as well recompence me for a good deed, as puni≈øh me for a mi≈ø-deede: and where I might have a ju≈øt cau≈øe to hope, as rea≈øon to feare. <hi>Indemnitie is no ≈øufficient coyne for him, who doeth better than not to tre≈øpa≈ø≈øe.</hi> Our Law pre≈øents vs but one of hir hands, and that is her left hand. <hi>Who≈øoever goes to Law, doth in the end but loo≈øe by it.</hi> In <hi>China,</hi> the policy, arts and government of which kingdome, having neither knowledge or commerce with ours; exceed our examples in divers partes of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and who≈øe Hi≈øtories teach me, how much more ample and diver≈øe the World is, than either we or our forefathers could ever enter into.

them≈øelves, not onely to warrant them≈øelves, but al≈øo to get ≈øomething: Not ≈øimply to be paid, but liberally to be rewarded. No judge hath yet, God be thanked, ≈øpoken to me as a judge, in any cau≈øe what≈øoever either mine or another mans; criminall or civill. No pri≈øon did ever receive me, no not ≈øo much as for recreation to walke in. The very imagination of one, maketh the ≈øight of their out≈øide ≈øeeme irke≈øome and loath≈øome to mee. I am ≈øo be≈øotted vnto liberty, that ≈øhould any man forbidde me the acce≈ø≈øe vnto any one corner of the Indiaes I ≈øhould in ≈øome ≈øort live much di≈øcontented. And ≈øo long as I ≈øhall finde land or open ayre el≈øewhere, I ≈øhall never lurke in any place, where I mu≈øt hide my ≈øelfe. Oh God, how hardly could I endure the mi≈øerable condition of ≈øo many men, confined and immured in ≈øome corners of this kingdome, barred from entring the chiefe≈øt Citties, from acce≈ø≈øe into Courts, from conuer≈øing with men, and interdicted the v≈øe of common wayes, onely becau≈øe they have offended our lawes. If tho≈øe vnder which I live, ≈øhould but threaten my fingers end, I would pre≈øently goe finde out ≈øome others, where≈øoever it were. All my ≈ømall wi≈øedome, in the≈øe civill and tumultuous warres, wherein we now live, doth wholly employ it ≈øelfe, that they may not interrupt my liberty, to goe and come where ever I li≈øt. Lawes are now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in credit, not becau≈øe they are e≈ø≈øentially ju≈øt, but becau≈øe they are lawes. It is the my≈øticall foundation of their authority; they have none other; which availes them much: They are often made by fooles. More often by men, who in hatred of equality, have want of equity; But ever by men, who are vaine and irre≈øolute Authours. There is nothing ≈øo gro≈ø≈øely and largely offending, nor ≈øo ordinarily wronging as the Lawes. Who≈øoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth them becau≈øe they are ju≈øt, obeyes them not ju≈øtly the way as he ought. Our French Lawes doe in ≈øome ≈øort, by their irregularity and deformity, lend an helping hand vnto the di≈øorder and corruption, that is ≈øeene in their di≈øpen≈øation and execution. Their behe≈øt is ≈øo confu≈øed, and their commaund ≈øo incon≈øtant, that it in ≈øome ≈øort excu≈øeth, both the di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and the vice of the interpretation, of the admini≈øtration and of the ob≈øervation. What≈øoever then the fruit is wee may have of Experience, the ≈øame which we draw from forraine examples, will hardly ≈øtead our in≈øtitution much; if we reape ≈øo ≈ømall profit from that wee have of our ≈øelves, which is mo≈øt familiar vnto vs: and truely ≈øufficient to in≈øtruct vs of what wee want. I ≈øtudy my ≈øelfe more than any other ≈øubject. It is my ≈øupernaturall Metaphi≈øike, it is my naturall Philo≈øophy.</p>

                        <p>Phy≈øitians commonly enfold and joine their rules vnto profit, according to the violence of ≈øharpe de≈øires or earne≈øt longings, that incidently follow the ≈øicke, No longing de≈øire can be imagined ≈øo ≈øtrange and vicious, but nature will apply her≈øelfe vnto it. And then how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie is it to content ones fanta≈øie? In mine opinion, this part importeth all in all; at lea≈øt more and beyond all other. The mo≈øt grievous and ordinary evills are tho≈øe, which fancy char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs withall. That Spani≈øh ≈øaying doth every way plea≈øe me: <hi>Deffienda me Dios de my. God defend me from my ≈øelfe.</hi> Being ≈øicke, I am ≈øory I have not ≈øome de≈øire may give mee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to ≈øatiate and cloy the ≈øame: Scar≈øly would a medicine divert me from it, So doe I when I am in health: I hardly ≈øee any thing left to be hoped or wi≈øhed-for. It is pittie a man ≈øhould be ≈øo weakned and enlangui≈øhed, that hee hath nothing left him but wi≈øhing. The arte of Phy≈øicke is not ≈øo re≈øolute, that what≈øoever wee doe, wee ≈øhall bee void of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to doe it. Shee changeth and ≈øhee varieth according to climates; according to the Moones; according to <hi>Fernelius;</hi> and according to <hi>Scala.</hi> If your Phy≈øitian thinke it not good that you ≈øleepe, that you drinke wine, or eate ≈øuch and ≈øuch meates: Care not you for that; I will finde you another that ≈øhall not be of his opinion. The diver≈øity of phy≈øicall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and medicinall opinions, embraceth all manner of formes. I ≈øaw a mi≈øerable ≈øicke man, for the infinite de≈øire he had to recover, ready to bur≈øt, yea and to die with thir≈øt; whom not long ≈øince another Phy≈øitian mocked, vtterly condemning the others coun≈øell, as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him. Had not hee be≈øtowed his labour well? A man of that coate is lately dead of the ≈øtone, who during the time of his ≈øickene≈ø≈øe v≈øed extreame ab≈øtinence to with≈øtand his evill; his fellowes affirme that contrary, his long fa≈øting had withered and dried him vp, and ≈øo concocted the gravell in his kidnies. I have found, that in my hurts and other ≈øickene≈ø≈øes, earne≈øt talking di≈øtempers and hurts me as much as any di≈øorder I commit. My voice co≈øts me deare, and wearieth me; for I have it lowd, ≈øhrill and forced: So that, when I have had occa≈øion to entertaine the eares of great men, about weighty affaires, I have often troubled them with care how to moderate my voice, This ≈øtory de≈øerveth to bee remembred and to divert me. A certaine man, in one of the Greeke ≈øchooles ≈øpake very lowde, as I doe; the mai≈øter of the ceremonies ≈øent him word, hee ≈øhould ≈øpeake lower: let him (quoth he) ≈øend mee the tune or key in which he would have me ≈øpeake. The other replied, that hee ≈øhould take his tune from his eares to whom he ≈øpake. It was well ≈øayd, ≈øo hee vnder≈øtood him≈øelfe: Speake according as you have to doe with your auditory. For if one ≈øay, let it ≈øuffice that he heareth you; or, governe your ≈øelfe by him: I do not thinke he had rea≈øon to ≈øay ≈øo. The tune or motion of the voyce, hath ≈øome expre≈ø≈øion or ≈øignification of my meaning: It is in me to direct the ≈øame, that ≈øo I may the better repre≈øent my ≈øelfe. There is a voyce to in≈øtruct one to flatter, and another to chide. I will not onely have my voyce come to him, but peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to wound and pierce him. When I brawle and rate my lackey, with a ≈øharpe and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing tune; were it fit he ≈øhould come to me and ≈øay, Ma≈øter ≈øpeake ≈øoftly, I vnder≈øtand and heare you very well? <hi>E≈øt quaedam vox ad auditum accomod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If thou tel me, it is a dangerous and mortall evill,: what others are not ≈øo? For, it is a kinde of phy≈øicall cou≈øenage, to except any, and ≈øo they goe directly vnto death: what matter is it, whether they goe by accident vnto it; and ea≈øily ≈ølide on either hand, toward the way that leadeth vs therevnto?

For want of naturall memory I frame ≈øome of paper. And when ≈øome new ≈øymptome or accident commeth to my evill, I ≈øet it downe in writing: whence it proceedeth, that having now (in a manner) pa≈ø≈øed over and through all ≈øortes of examples, if any a≈øtoni≈øhment threaten mee; running and turning over the≈øe my loo≈øe memorialles (as <hi>Sybillaes</hi> leaves) Imi≈ø≈øe no more to finde to comfort me with ≈øome favourable progno≈øtication in my former pa≈øt experience.

For, the conduct of this di≈øtribution, having ≈øo long beene con≈øtituted, it is to be ≈øuppo≈øed that Nature will not change this cour≈øe, and no other wor≈øe accident ≈øhall follow, then that I feele. Moreover, the condition of this di≈øea≈øe is not ill ≈øeeming to my ready and ≈øodaine complexion. When it but faintly a≈ø≈øailes mee, it makes mee afraid, becau≈øe it is like to continue long: But naturally it hath certaine vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and violent exce≈ø≈øes.

When <hi>Socrates</hi> (after he had his yrons or fetters taken from him) felt the plea≈øure or tickling of that itching, which their weight and rubbing had cau≈øed in his legges; he rejoyced, to con≈øider the neere affinity that was betweene paine and plea≈øure: how they combined together by a nece≈ø≈øary bond; ≈øo that at turnes they enter-engender and ≈øucceede one an other: And cry out to good <hi>Ae≈øope,</hi> that hee ≈øhould from that con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration have taken a proper body vnto a quaint fable.

                        <p>There is ≈øo much hazard and ≈øo many degrees before one can be brought to ≈øafety, that heee is never at an end. Before you can leave off your cover-chiefe and then your night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cappe; before you can the ayre againe, or have leave to drinke Wine, or lye with your Wife, or eate melons, it is much, if you fall not into ≈øome relap≈øe or new mi≈øery. The gravell hath this priviledge, that it is cleane carried away. Whereas other maladies, leave ever ≈øome impre≈ø≈øion and alteration, which leaveth the body ≈øu≈øceptible or vndertaking of ≈øome new infirmity; and they lend one an other their hands. Such are to be excu≈øed, as are contented with the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion they have over vs, without extending the ≈øame, and without introducing their ≈øequell: But courteous, kind and gracious are tho≈øe, who≈øe pa≈ø≈øage brings vs ≈øome profitable con≈øequence. Since I have had the ≈øtone-chollike, I finde my ≈øelfe di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of other accidents: more (as me thinks) then I was before, and neuer had ague ≈øince. I argue, that the extreame and frequent vomites I endure, purge me; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide, the di≈øta≈øtes and ≈øtrange ab≈øtinences I tolerate, disge≈øt my offending humours: and Nature voydeth in the≈øe ≈øtones and gravell, what≈øoeuer is ≈øuperfluous and hurtefull in her. Let no man tell me, that it is a medicine too deere ≈øold. For, what availe ≈øo many loath≈øome pills, ≈øtincking potions, cauterizings, inci≈øions, ≈øweatings, ≈øetons, dyets and ≈øo divers fa≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of curing, which, becau≈øe we are not able to vndergoe their violence and brooke their importunity, doe often bring vs vnto our graves? And therefore, when I am ≈øurpri≈øed, I take it as phy≈øicke: and when I am free, I take it as a con≈øtant and full deliverance. Lo here an other particular favour of my di≈øea≈øe, which is, that he in a manner, keepes his play a-part, and let's mee keepe mine owne; or el≈øe I want but courage to doe it: In his greate≈øt emotion, I have held out tenne houres on Hor≈øe-backe with him. Doe but endure, you neede no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule or regiment: Play, dally, dyne, runne, be game≈øome, doe this, and if you can, doe the other thing, your di≈øorder and debauching will rather availe than hurt it. Say thus much to one that hath the pox, or to one that hath the gowt, or to one that is belly-broken or cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur≈øt. Other infirmites have more vniver≈øall bonds, torment farre-otherwi≈øe our actions, pervert al our order, and engage all the ≈øtate of mans life vnto their con≈øideration: Whereas this doth only twitch and pinch the skinne, it neither medleth with your vnder≈øtanding, nor with your will, tongue, feete nor hands, but leaves them all in your di≈øpo≈øition; it rather rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth and awaketh you, then deterre and drouzie you. The mind is wounded by the burning of a feaver ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by an Epilep≈øie, confounded by a migrane, and in conclu≈øion, a≈øtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and di≈ømayed by all the di≈øea≈øes that touch or wound the whole ma≈ø≈øe of his body, and it's noble≈øt partes: This never medleth with it. If therefore it go ill with it, his be the blame: ≈øhe bewrayeth, ≈øhe for≈øaketh and ≈øhe di≈øplaceth her≈øelfe. None but fools will be per≈øwaded, that this hard, gretty and ma≈ø≈øie body, which is concocted and petrified in our kidneis, may be di≈ø≈øolved by drinks.

This other peculiar commodity I ob≈øerue, that it is an infirmity, wherein we haue but little to divine.
