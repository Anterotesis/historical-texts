            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE TRVE Copie of a Letter ſent from the Lord of DVNGARVAN, ſonne to the Earle of <hi>Corke,</hi> to Sir <hi>Arthur Magennis,</hi> a worthy Knight in ENGLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Would have made you acquainted with the troubles which daily increaſe more and more to our great ſorrow: the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate of our County of Corke is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to expreſſe; but opportunity hath not ſo well fitted, as to give you a more timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereof. The rebels have ſo farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached into the body of our County, that they are become Maſters of the moſt part thereof, divers Lords being newly revolted to them.
<pb facs="tcp:105267:3"/>
Amongſt the reſt, the Lord ANTRIM, within the Province of Munſter, about a fortnight agone, is revolted, with many ſouldiers that were under his command, and have committed great ſlaughters on the Proteſtants, with extreame cruelty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane maſſacres, yet have they beene va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly reſiſted by Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi> and his Forces: who hath proved himſelfe a ſtout ſouldier, and faithfull ſubiect to the King of England; and hath taken from the Rebels divers Forts and Caſtles, and keepes the ſame well manned with good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Our Armie ſet forwards towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, to give them an incounter on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt was a ſeven-night; but they hearing thereof, withdrew themſelves to the confines of our County, where they have muſtred their Army, and raiſed it there to twentie thouſand; which being perceived, wee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ioyne with Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> and the Scots in thoſe parts, which they accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and marching towards the Rebels, they tooke the Field, where was a battell fought between us; where (God bee praiſed) wee loſt but one hundred men, whereof our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt loſſe was the Lord <hi>Fawklands</hi> brother: and the adverſe party loſt above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb facs="tcp:105267:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
five hundred, as wee conceived: upon which they drew backe to their Trenches, the skirmiſh holding ſome eight houres, our force being not ſo ſtrong as we wiſhed we were enforced to retire to ſtrengthen our army, in which time the Rebells repleniſhed, and augmented theirs, but we failed in our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, for many of onr ſouldiers ſides with the Rebells revolted from our command by which means we were ſo weakened that we could not again take the field without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger of the loſſe of our whole army; the Rebells being ſix to one, upon which we were enforced to retire to a town near adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in which was a good caſtle, fortifying the ſame aſwell as we could for our ſecuritie, there intending to ſtay till we have aid from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or Scotland which we daily write for, and without which not onely this County, but even the whole kingdome of Ireland is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope utterly loſt: many Biſhops are alſo revolted, Aid is daily ſent from forram parts ſo that they are encreaſed to that ſtrength that they are able to bring 50000 fighting men in the field: They have put hard for <hi>Corke</hi> and have entrenched themſelves neer <hi>Dublin,</hi> divers great perſonages in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie have alſo revolted, they have ſet forth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations declaring, they take arms for their
<pb facs="tcp:105267:4"/>
King and are the Queens army, for a tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Religion, and for the defence of the lawes of that land, ſo farre, as they ſerve their deſires and wills, I therefore conceive that perpetuall warre is to be expected in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till they are fully vanquiſhed, and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not then free from Mutinies and Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, Except all Papiſts be baniſhed that Land, and the Kingdome, inhabited with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſubiection to the King of England, as are Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Wee expected aid from England, both of Men, Ammunition, and money, before this time; but the diſtractions and diviſions in that Kingdome, wee conceive hath hindered their proceedings in their intentions therein; Here are 3000. <hi>Scots</hi> arived, of which we are right glad, and we expect aſſiſtance from <hi>Denmark,</hi> which when we have, and alſo from <hi>England,</hi> I make no doubt, but by the bleſſing of God, <hi>Ireland</hi> will againe be reduced to their due ſubiection to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> which is all the news opportunitie will give me leave to write at this time.</p>
