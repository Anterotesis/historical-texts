            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF thou hast perused the said Pamphlet against the People called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> entituled <hi>[The Case of the Quakers]</hi> we desire thee
to read over this following Answer; But if thou art not pleased so to
do, thou art requested (according to the Rule of Equity) not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
prejudice, nor to censure the said People upon the meer report
and reproaches of their Adversarys, it being unjust to pass a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a People without hearing them, upon the bare Reports of
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>However, this Disadvantage we are put upon in the Eyes of the
World, that our Enemies will be our Judges, and that at the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Father of Lyes.</p>
            <p>Be pleased to take notice, that while our Adversary scoffs at our
Plea, as that our Conscience will not allow us to Swear, he saith, <hi>we
actually do Swear,</hi> in as solemn and August a Form as 'tis possible for
the Tongue of Man to express, in our saying, <hi>God, who is the Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Hearts knows, that it is with a Holy Respect, &amp;c.</hi> And thus
he does not only render us to contradict our own Doctrine, but also in
like manner represents the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as frequently confirming his
Sayings with an Oath in these and such Expressions, <hi>God is my
Witness; I say the Truth in Christ; I Lye not; The God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, that I Lye not, &amp;c.</hi> which
were in his Epistles to the Saints, and not formal Swearing on the
four Evangelists before the Magistrates. Howbeit he is mistaken in
his Reckoning these and such like words a most solemn and august
Form of <hi>Actual Swearing:</hi> And what can he argue from hence, but
that <hi>Paul</hi> most highly swore in his Epistles upon a sacred Account,
therefore we ought to Swear before Rulers in Courts? which follows


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58875:3"/>
not, though he reckons we do Swear in saying, <hi>God knows:</hi> But
does not perswade the Magistrates to accept of it for an Oath, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vilifies us. However, herein we are not of his Mind, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostles or primitive <hi>Christians</hi> did swear, or held it lawful;
for we make a Difference between earnest Affirmations, and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and they did really speak the Truth in Christ, unto which God
was Witness; and this was in a state so n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arly related to God, as that
of being <hi>in Christ,</hi> wherein they could neither speak nor do any thing
against the Truth: But the state of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law was
much inferiour to this, wherein their Swearing by the Lord (as the
Chief Judge and Revenger of Falshood and Injury) was in a more
remote state, when they formally bound themselves by an Oath, or
conditional Curse, which was a Bond upon their Souls, when they
feared it (as few do now who are in the Swearing Nature) But there
is no need for the true <hi>Christians</hi> in Christ to use Imprecations, or to
pronounce any conditional Curse against themselves to bind their Souls;
and we have not so learned Christ, as thus to Swear or Curse; but to
say the Truth in Christ, unto which God is witness, which is not to
<hi>Swear</hi> the Truth in Christ, nor to bind our Souls with an Implicite
Curse in his Name (knowing also, that the Penalty from God of all Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
is the Lake of Misery, as well as of false Swearers) For, where
did the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>I Swear</hi> the Truth in Christ? Howbeit, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
our Conscience, as to our simple Affirmation or Denyal in
<hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> be question'd, we have proposed to those in Power thus,
<q>That we desire and request, that you will be pleased to Enact and
Provide, that in stead and place thereof, as the Cases may require,
our <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> may be accepted and taken; and if we break
our <hi>Yea</hi> and our <hi>Nay,</hi> which is Christ's solemn Form of sound words,
and which is his Gospel Command, which we stand to and for, then
let us suffer the same Penalty as they that can Swear, and break their
Oaths:</q> This we have left to the serious Consideration of those in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and not to the Prejudice of malicious men, such as our Opposer,
who, like a Busy Body, hath vainly spent his Labour against us.</p>
            <p>This is written on behalf, and in the Person of the People of God called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
and their Evangelical Testimony, by some who are Lovers of the
said People, and the Souls of all Men.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Nature and Extent of Oaths, not a Property of True
Christians.</head>
               <p>LEt the serious Reader judge, whether our Opposer <hi>J. S.</hi>
hath taken a Christian Way and Method to convince us
of Error or not, by Vilifying and Railing, calling us
<hi>Monsters of men, impudent, obstinate and reprobate-minded men,</hi>
as in his second and sixth pages; and on serious Examination of
his Matter, we shall find it as ineffectual for the same End, as in
his first Argument, to prove the Lawfulness of Swearing. He
Instanceth <hi>Paul</hi>'s saying, <hi>God is my Witness,</hi> Rom. 1. 9. <hi>I say the
Truth in Christ; I Lye not; my Conscience also bearing me witness
in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 9. 1. Together with 2 Cor. 1. 23. chap.
11. 37. Gal. 1. 20. Phil. 1. 8. 1 Thess. 2. 10. <hi>Ye are Witnesses,
and God also.</hi> And these Forms of Speech he saith, are sacred
Oaths; and that the Definition of an <hi>Oath</hi> in the common Notion
of Mankind, <hi>is nothing else but the calling God to Witness to the truth
of what we say,</hi> p. 2. It appears that he varies, and is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58875:4"/>
about the definition of an Oath; for one while he saith, <hi>It is
the Invocation of God's Name, a most solemn Invocation of the
Divine Majesty;</hi> Another while it is <hi>the Denouncing of a Curse;</hi>
p. 4. Another while <hi>a man's calling God for a Witness against his
Soul, daring him to his Face, challenging the Divine Vengeance to
do its worst in case he swear falsly,</hi> p. 13. Now, Reader, be
pleased to observe, first, his Variation and Contradiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his saying, <hi>An Oath</hi> is <hi>nothing else</hi> but a calling God to
witness, and the pronouncing <hi>of a Curse, daring God to his Face,
challenging Divine Vengeance to do its worst.</hi> As for the first, We
cannot be convinced that it makes up a <hi>formal Oath</hi> among <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to whose Testimony God is Witness as he was to <hi>Paul</hi>'s.
As for the latter, It is more then an Oath, and savours of high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
unbecoming a Christian-Spirit, either to <hi>dare God to
his Face,</hi> or <hi>challenge Divine Vengeance.</hi> Besides, if those very
words of Paul, <hi>God is my Witness,</hi> make up a formal Oath by him,
then we ask, If his saying, My Conscience bearing me witness,
and Ye are Witnesses, doth not (by the same Reason) make up
a Formal Oath, by his Conscience, and by those Saints to whom
he wrote? And were not this most grosly to charge <hi>Paul</hi> with
Transgression both of Law and Gospel? Whereas in a Formal
Oath, as made amongst Men, there is, <hi>First,</hi> Swearing by the
Great God intended; <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Imprecation or Curse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some Ceremony or
Sign used<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Gen. 24. 9. <hi>and</hi> 47. 29, 31. But our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser hath brought us no Scripture for Kissing and Laying the Hand on a Book.</note> besides the bare words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
or calling upon God (or <hi>so help
me God)</hi> For that the same Invocation
may as well be used without an Oath, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in our praying for God's Help and
Assistance.</p>
               <p>The words, <hi>So help me God,</hi> or <hi>I call God to witness,</hi> may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
without any Intent of Swearing, as well as in an Oath; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
his Help, and simply as owning him for Witness to the Truth
spoken in Christ, which, as such, is not an Oath; but when thus
intended<note n="*" place="margin">Iuramentum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod mente juratur.</note> viz. <hi>So let</hi> me <hi>have</hi> or <hi>want</hi> the
<hi>Help</hi> of God according as I speak the Truth;
or <hi>so</hi> let God be Witness, or judge <hi>for</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
me: In this latter Sense is an Oath implying a Curse; as,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58875:4"/>
Let God be Witness or Judge against me if I speak not the Truth;
but the bare words, <hi>so God help me,</hi> or God is my <hi>Witness,</hi> or <hi>God
knows</hi> I speak the Truth in Christ, <hi>I Lye</hi> not, cannot be a Swearing
(nor a Formal Oath) without an Intention thereof, or of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation
or Execration implyed,<note place="margin">Num. 5. 24.</note> as of old some
time an Oath of Cursing was used among the
<hi>Jews;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 28.</note> and there are several Sorts of Oathes,
and several Wayes or Ceremonies expressing Formal Swearing, as
among the <hi>Heathen, Laying the Hands upon the Altar,</hi> and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Gods;<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jurare aras.</hi> Hor. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 2. &amp; 47. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant <hi>putting his
Hand under his Thigh;</hi> the Angel <hi>Lifting up the
Hand towards Heaven;</hi> among the professed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
a Laying the Hand upon a Bible, and Kissing
it,</hi> or <hi>Swearing upon the four Evangelists</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Pope's Imposition.) However, we taking the last, as
the Magistrates general Sense of an Oath; the Definition thereof
is not so much the Matter in Controversie, as the Lawfulness or
Unlawfulness of <hi>Swearing</hi> among <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Instance, that <hi>Jacob</hi> Swore by the Fear of his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi>
proves not that <hi>Laban</hi>'s simply saying <hi>God is Witness,</hi> makes up a
formal Oath; seeing he also said, This Heap <hi>(viz.</hi> of Stones) is
Witness between me and thee, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. VVill any presume
to say, That he Swore by the Heap of Stones, which was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or a Memorial? His accusing St. Paul, <hi>notwithstanding
Christ's prohibition, that he did frequently confirm his Sayings with an
Oath;</hi> is both a gross Abuse of <hi>Paul,</hi> and contradicts this man's
confessing that he delivered the Truth with <hi>great Demonstration of
the Spirit</hi> and <hi>of Power,</hi> and that <hi>by Manifestation</hi> of the Truth
he commended himself to every man's <hi>Conscience</hi> in the Sight of
God, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4, 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 2. Surely the Demonstration of
the Spirit, and Manifestation of the Truth, was not Swearing to
every man's Conscience; for there was no need of Swearing where
the Truth was so manifest among the Saints. But to say, that <hi>Paul</hi>
did frequently confirm his Sayings <hi>with an Oath,</hi> renders him both
of very little Power, Manifestation or Credit, as a Minister of
Christ among his Saints and Churches (none of them excepted)
and them also to have as little Knowledge and Confidence of <hi>Paul</hi>
and his Testimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58875:5"/>
Further, He varies between saying, <hi>God is Witness,</hi> and mens cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him for a Record <hi>against their Soul;</hi> where he brings <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
for a Proof that <hi>Paul</hi> Swore in these words: If so, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
is not constant to himself, nor with other Fathers, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <hi>There are some Speeches which have the form
of an Oath,</hi> which are not Oathes, but are Remedies for the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
as the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> willing to shew his Love,
said, Yea, or by your Rejoycing, &amp;c. for he was not disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Doctrine of the Gospel, who was intrusted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
but he gave a small word in the Form of an Oath; that their
Rejoycing was most desirous to him he shewed by such a manner
of Speech.</q> Thus far <hi>Basil,</hi> though we know the Particle <hi>[by]</hi>
is not alwayes a Note of Swearing.</p>
               <p>In his second Argument he grants, that Justice may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
according to the Rule of the Gospel by the Testimony of
Two or Three Witnesses, <hi>Mat. 18. 16. but not of one without an
Oath</hi> (as taking in God to witness with him) where there is but one
Witness, as in the Case instanced, <hi>Exed.</hi> 22. 10, 11. However,
that Testimony of Two or Three Witnesses may decide a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
without an Oath; and where there is but one faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
God is Witness with him and for him therein, and hath a
Witness for him in men's Consciences. And the Law-makers (to
whom we have applyed, and not to such busie Opposers as this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
against us) have Power to make Provision for such a one as
cannot for Conscience sake Swear, that his Testimony may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
instead of an Oath, especially he being willing to undergo the
same Penalty that is due to perjured Persons, if he be found false
in his Testimony, as we have proposed; however, this Opposer
takes little notice thereof. And many in Authority have confessed
our Proposition therein to be fair and sufficient, and not at all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to obstruct the Administration of Justice, nor to patronize
Injustice, as is most falsly insinuated against us, pag. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his third Argument he asserts,</hi> That the Spirit of Christ in the
Old Testament Prophets did commend Swearing by God, as that which
was to be the practice of his Elect Servants in the <hi>Christian-Church,</hi>
after his Rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> and chusing the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58875:5"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We deny this Assumption, that they did so commend
Swearing, as a Practice to continue in the Christian-Church among
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> For Christ and his Apostles Prohibition of
Swearing <hi>at all, either by Heaven or Earth, or any other Oath,</hi> was
of an Universal Extent to both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that come to be
of the Christian-Church, both forbidding such Swearing, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> of old time used under the Law, viz. by the Lord; and the
Apostate <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> Swearing by Idols, or the Creatures,
or any Oath whatsoever.</p>
               <p>He attempts to prove his Assumption from <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 15. And
ye shall leave your Name for a Curse to my Chosen; <hi>that is</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the people that I shall chuse from among the</hi> Gentiles <hi>shall use
your Name in Execration, when they have a mind to denounce a
Curse, &amp;c.</hi> And this he brings to prove <hi>Swearing</hi> a Practice to
continue amongst God's Elect Servants in the Christian-Church:
And so he would perswade them, not only to <hi>Swear</hi> contrary to
Christ's Command, but to use <hi>Execrations,</hi> and to denounce a
<hi>Curse</hi> when they have a mind, as he supposes; which is contrary to
Christ and his Apostles Doctrine, who taught the Elect to Bless
those that Curse them, and to Bless, and Curse not; for, to Bless
God and Curse man ought not to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his fourth Argument he saith,</hi> The Spirit of Christ, which was
in the Prophets, fore-told; That in the Time of the Gospel the Lord's
people should Swear by his Name, as an Evidence of their Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This we also deny, together with his high Applause of
Swearing, <hi>as an Evidence of man's Conversion</hi> in the Time of the
Gospel, and as <hi>Divine Service</hi> and <hi>Homage,</hi> and as <hi>denoting an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Act of saving Confession to God,</hi> and as <hi>a part of Divine
Worship,</hi> and as <hi>a Sign, Witness and Argument of</hi> Egypt<hi>'s Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
and the <hi>Language of</hi> Canaan, a <hi>pure Language, which God
promised to restore to all Nations at the Coming of Christ; yea, the
Condition of God's accepting men for his people, the Condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
us as sincere Disciples, the Way of God's People;</hi> as may be
seen in his 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 14th pages. All these
high Commendations he attributes to Swearing by the Lord; As if
all those that so Swear must needs be such great Converts, divine
Worshippers, attained to the pure Language of <hi>Cananan,</hi> highly


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58875:6"/>
accepted of God, sincere Disciples in God's Way, &amp;c. Mark
here, <hi>Swearing by the Lord</hi> is this man's Gospel, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all his Felicity; but such Ignorance and silly Stuff what ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
man cannot see? His Proof is, <hi>Isa</hi> 45. 23. and Chap.
19. 18. In the first it is said, I have Sworn by my self, the Word
is gone out of my Mouth in Righteousness, and shall not return,
that to me every Knee shall bow, every Tongue shall <hi>swear.</hi> In
the second it is said, In that day shall five Cities in the Land of
<hi>Egypt</hi> speak the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>swear</hi> to the Lord of
Hosts. There shall be an Altar to the Lord in the midst of the
Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. Here he applies <hi>Swearing</hi> to Gospel-Times,
so takes <hi>Swearing</hi> as literally under the Gospel, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
as under the Law, but not the <hi>Altar;</hi> but confesseth, that
the <hi>Altar here specified is no other then that which</hi> St. Paul <hi>menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
Heb. 13. 10. <hi>We have an Altar, &amp;c.</hi> that is, saith he, <hi>Christ's
Stable-Throne of Grace,</hi> p. 8. So that the <hi>Altar</hi> he interprets fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively
under the Gospel, but <hi>swearing</hi> literally; see his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion:
Whereas if the <hi>Altar</hi> be Christ's Stable-Throne of Grace,
then by the same Reason he should have said, that by <hi>Swearing</hi> is
intended a <hi>Gospel-Confession,</hi> according to the Apostle's own words,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. where mentioning the Prophets words before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Every Tongue shall <hi>swear,</hi> he saith, Every Tongue shall
<hi>confess</hi> to God. And likewise <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. And that every Tongue
should <hi>confess</hi> that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the
Father. It is not, every Tongue shall <hi>swear,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that Jesus

                  </gap>, shall <hi>confess,</hi> the same word
that is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. And with the Mouth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,</hi>
or <hi>Confession</hi> is made to Salvation; And likewise in <hi>John</hi>
4. 2. Every Spirit that <hi>confesseth</hi> that Jesus Christ is come in the
Flesh is of God, there is the same word. He doth not make
<hi>swearing</hi> that Jesus is the Christ, that Proof; nor commend <hi>swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to God in the Gospel, as an infallible Mark of man's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the Condition of God's accepting them as sincere Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as our Opposer doth: For many both can and do Swear by
God, that never came to such Acceptance, nor to such a Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, as is to God's Glory, which proceeds from a heart
that <hi>believes to Salvation;</hi> For that no man can thus confess to God,
or say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58875:6"/>
But many can and do Swear without the Holy Ghost, therefore
true <hi>Confession</hi> is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> and not <hi>Swearing.</hi> It is true, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
from a believing Heart is an Evidence of Men's Conversion,
and not making <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>Swearing,</hi> which this Man seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
appertains to <hi>common humane Infirmity,</hi> p. 1. And what was
that Infirmity upon which Swearing was occasioned under the Law,
but man's Diffidence, Jealousie or Distrust, which if they had
fulfilled the Principal and Royal Law of Love both to God and
one another, there would have been no such occasion of Distrust?
Therefore <hi>Swearing</hi> was neither Moral, Perpetual nor Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
as some suppose; nor is it essential to the Divine Worship
of God (as this man vainly thinks) which is in Spirit and Truth;
for that Worship was both before <hi>Swearing,</hi> and is performed
without Swearing. That God himself <hi>swore</hi> by himself, who could
<hi>not swear</hi> by a greater, we deny not; But if this must be made an
Argument, that therefore in this man may imitate God, who is
his Maker, we deny the Consequence; for this were to set up a
Creature in the Creator's place: Nay, as good an Argument did
the Serpent bring when he said, Ye shall be as God's, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To</hi> J. S. <hi>his saying,</hi> That to Swear by the Lord of Hosts is to
speak the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that pure Lauguage which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
&amp;c. that pure and undefiled Religion, which was at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to man in Paradice, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. First,</hi> That God promised to return to his People a
pure Language, we own; and that they should serve him with one
Consent; therefore they should not need to Swear one to another,
or be Swearers under the Gospel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor doth he prove
by Scripture, that <hi>to swear by the Lord of Hosts</hi> was that pure and
undefiled Religion, which was at first revealed to Man in Paradice;
For this is to tell the World, that God taught <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to
Swear to each other in the State of Innocency, when there was no
Occasion of Swearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his fifth Argument to prove</hi> Swearing in Gospel Times, the
Condition of God's accepting Men for his People, such a Condition,
as upon the fulfilling thereof he will number them among his Disciples,
and account them his People that do, <hi>viz.</hi> learn to Swear by his Name,
<hi>p. 11. For Proof of this erroneous Assertion he cites</hi> Jer. 12. 16.
<hi>And it shall come to pass, that if they will diligently learn the Way


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58875:7"/>
of my People, to</hi> Swear <hi>by my Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord liveth, as they
taught my People to</hi> Swear <hi>by</hi> Baal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This was in the Prophets Time; and to be fulfilled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law; There is not the same Reason for <hi>Christians</hi> under
the Gospel, to swear by the Lord to divert them from Swearing by
false Gods, as there was in those former dayes: For those that had
learned to swear by <hi>Ball,</hi> viz. <hi>As</hi> Baal <hi>liveth, by the Life of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 12. which was opposed by swearing, <hi>As the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi>
under the Law, and now <hi>confessing</hi> his Name, and making
<hi>Confession</hi> to his Glory under the Gospel. His telling us of <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Learning</hi> to Swear by God's Name, and a learning this way
of God's People, &amp;c. p. 12, 14, 15. is, as if he should tell us, that
to <hi>swear by the Name of the Lord</hi> is such a difficult and hard Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that men must be very diligent to learn it, and therein come
into God's Way and Condition of Acceptance; when Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
Lyars, Dissemblers, &amp;c. can easily and do frequently tread
that Path, and walk in that Way of Swearing both in and out of
Courts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. S. saith,</hi> Men may confess God in Prayer and Thanksgiving,
and Attendance upon the Word and Sacraments, and yet not glorifie
him sufficiently in order to God's accepting of them as true Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
in order to his reputing them living Stones fit to be laid in the
Walls of his House, the Church, except to those who are mentioned;
and all other wayes of expressing their Homage they add this of
Swearing by his Name; except they learn diligently withal to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Omnisciency, Omnipotency, &amp;c. by Swearing by his
Fearful Name: Where this most solemn Invocation is denyed him he
esteems all other Acts of Invocation not serious enough to obliege him
that tenders them to a sincere Confession, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Oh, what lamentable Doctrine &amp; sad Work is this! What
is this but to tell the World, that they cannot acceptably confess
God, nor sufficiently glorifie him, either in Prayer, Thanksgiving,
Attendance on the Word, &amp;c. unless withal they add thereto a
<hi>Swearing</hi> by his Fearful Name? which is to teach or tell People,
<hi>When they go to Prayer, to Church,</hi> or else-where, <hi>they must go
there to Swear;</hi> and also in their Attendance upon the <hi>Word, while
the Minister is preaching the people must swear;</hi> and from thence,
<hi>the more they Swear, the more they perform Divine Worship;</hi> which


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58875:7"/>
therefore must needs be most effectually done where there is most
frequent <hi>Swearing,</hi> and (as his words are) DARING GOD
TO HIS FACE. And then a farther Abuse against God is, That
<hi>without Swearing by his Name</hi> (which he reckons a daring him to his
Face) <hi>he esteems all other Acts of Invocation and Prayer not seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough to express a sincere Confession:</hi> Oh sad! As if God did
not regard a sincere Soul and upright Heart in his Devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Swearing;</hi> or regarded not the Sighing and Breathing of the
Needy, when he is worshipped in the Spirit and in the Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, J. S. in Justification of</hi> Swearing by the Name of God,
<hi>saith;</hi> God esteems this as the Highest and most August Act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship that the Creature can possibly exhibit to him, and as that
which eminently contains all others, and comprehends the whole Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel, all the wayes of God's People confessing to him;
and that Swearing by God implies the whole Worship of God, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is such a Commendation of Swearing as we never
read of before; and such a Way of expressing the whole Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, and the whole Condition of the Gospel, as neither
God nor Christ ever taught him; Nor yet did ever God say, when
he allowed Swearing, that he allowed it as the <hi>highest and most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
Act of Divine Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'tis to be considered yet, whether this highest Act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, that eminently contains all others, to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
by the Laity to all sorts of People without Distinction, be not
the highest Degree of Prophanation; or otherwise, Whether
the Admistration thereof do make Clarks of Courts, Ministers of
the Gospel and of the Clergy as well as Parish Clarks, yea,
or nay?</p>
               <p>Having taken notice of his high Commendation of <hi>swearing</hi> by
the Lord, and the Advantage he hath promised thereupon, as no
less then God's accepting them that so swear as sincere Disciples,
and of his ingrafting them into his Evangelical Church; Now let
us take notice of his Threats against such as refuse to <hi>swear,</hi> or to
learn this Way of Confessing God by <hi>swearing. It renders man
obnoxious to the Dint of his Fearful Doom; I will utterly pluck up
and destroy that Nation; And that God doth reject them; And that
he will not let them escape unpunished who will not learn to swear by


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58875:8"/>
his Name in Judgment, Righteousness and Truth they shall perish,
&amp;c.</hi> p. 14. But they that abide in the Doctrine of Christ and his
Apostles who said, Swear not at all, they will not fear such Threats;
nor do they value this man's vain Flourish, Boasting and Reviling,
nor his threatning <hi>Familists, Anabaptists, Catharists, Quakers</hi>
with <hi>Destruction,</hi> if they will not <hi>learn</hi> diligently to <hi>swear,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what Christ learns us; and because of Oaths the Land
mourns; and God's Hand and Controversie is against such Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of Christ's Doctrine and Urgers of Men to swear: Does
not Christ say, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life? And must
not we walk in him the New and Living Way, and obey his
Commands?</p>

before, <hi>neither by any other Oath;</hi> As if this man
should tell us, that <hi>Swearing by the Lord</hi> is <hi>no</hi> Oath: Who also

in the Law, when Swearing by the Lord was not only
lawful but expresly commanded,</hi> Deut. 6. 13. &amp; 10. 20. All which
is answered by Christ himself, where he recites what was said in
old time in this Case of Swearing; as namely, It hath been said by
them of old time, Thou shalt not Forswear thy self, but shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Lord thy Oathes: But I say unto you, Swear not at
all; neither by Heaven, &amp;c. But let your Communication be
<hi>Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay, &amp;c.</hi> Which makes it very plain, that here
was more forbidden by Christ then what was by the Law, his
words in this holding parallel with his very next words; Ye have
heard that it hath been saith, An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for
a Tooth; but I say unto you, That ye resist not Evil; but whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall smite thee on thy right Cheek, turn to him the other
also, <hi>vers.</hi> 38, 39. Did not Christ himself hereby forbid his

an Obligation to prevent them from going af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
other Gods, as is evident by the very

<hi>Love</hi> they bear to the Lord are engaged to speak the Truth in Yea
and Nay without an Oath, as Christ &amp; his Apostles have taught. So
the Difference lies here, the <hi>Jews</hi> when bound by an Oath, they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Oath, or the Curse contained or implyed in it (they Swearing
by the Great God, as chiefly to be feared them, with regard to his
Power to judge and avenge, &amp;c.) and this was for a time some tye
upon them, to prevent them from going after other Gods. The
True <hi>Christians</hi> are bound in their Consciences by the Royal and
Evangelical Law of <hi>Love</hi> (which was before Swearing was, and
takes away the Occasion of Oaths) to serve God, and speak the
Truth every man to his Neighbour without Swearing. So that
the Disparity between the State under the Law and that under the
Gospel lies here; Under the Law, Thou shalt fear the Lord, and
Swear by his Name: Under the Gospel, Thou shalt so Love the
Lord as to speak the Truth, and confirm it in Yea and Nay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being bound by an Oath. Now judge, serious Reader,
which of these do express more Love, Respect and Honour to
God; whether he that's bound by an Oath not to go after other
Gods, and to speak the Truth as fearing an Oath and the Curse
(which was the better use of Oaths, which now few that use them
regard) or he that is bound in Conscience to speak and do Truth
without an Oath, whose word Yea and Nay is more binding to
him, and of more Value and Credit then men's Swearing, Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Curses? And likewise between man and man and
Neighbours, which do express most Love one to another and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in each other, they that will not believe one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Oathes and Curses, or they that will (like <hi>Christians)</hi> speak
the Truth, and believe one another's plain and simple Yea, Yea,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58875:9"/>
and Nay, Nay, as Christ and his Apostle has commanded? Such are
the true <hi>Christians</hi> and People of God, as are come to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Evangelical Prophesie; Surely they are my People,
Children that will not Lye, and so was he their Saviour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.
8. And the Remnant of <hi>Israel</hi> shall not speak Lyes, neither shall
a Deceitful Tongue be found in their Mouth.</p>
               <p>But to return to Christ and his Apostles express Prohibition: But
I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, &amp;c. nor by
ANY OTHER <hi>Oath.</hi> Hereby <hi>Christians</hi> are so plainly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Swearing in any Case, as Christ forbids an Eye for an Eye,
and a Tooth for a Tooth, or hating thine Enemy, see <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 39,
44. Or else, what Coherence is there in his Words, and what
Difference is there between the Dispensation of the Law and that
of the Gospel, if (as this man sayes) Christ here forbids nothing
but what was forbid in the Law? By which he renders Christ as thus
speaking, It hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
Forswear thy self, but shalt perform to the Lord thine Oaths;
<hi>And I say the same,</hi> Instead of, But I say unto you, Swear not at
all. And likewsie ye have heard that it hath been said, An Eye for
an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; <hi>And I say the same to you,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of, But I say unto you, Resist not Evil, &amp;c. And so this
would make Christ still leave his Followers in the Fighting Reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Nature; as this man's limiting his words for Swearing as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did, renders Christ as leaving his Followers but still in the
same <hi>common Humane Infirmity</hi> (as his words are) and weak Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting
and unsteady Condition, as the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Works of
the Law were in, who were allowed to Swear by the Lord, as a
Prevention from running after other Gods, and to remove Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
or Hard Thoughts out of the Minds one of another, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Case mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Upon the words, <hi>Neither by any other Oath,</hi> J. S. adds, Swear
not at all, by Heaven, Earth, or any other of <hi>those Forms of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Creature,</hi> that Christ forbad the use of, p. 17. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the words of the Apostle, who well knew the Mind of Christ,
extend farther, as not only a forbidding a Swearing by Heaven or
Earth, but also by ANY OTHER OATH. But mark, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after this Oath-Vindicator hath opposed Swearing by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Earth or the Creature, he contradicts himself in the same

in such Forms of Oaths, yet it is implyed; and therefore we are
not to use such Forms in our common Speech any more then the Name
of God himself, but in Reverence, and in extreme Necessity,</hi> p. 17.
So that by this he allows of such a Form as Swearing by Heaven or
Earth, that thereby they may Swear <hi>by God</hi> that dwells therein;
when before they are not at all to Swear by Heaven, Earth or
<hi>any other</hi> of <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that undertakes to confute the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and yet contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in one and the same page; As much as to say, We may not
Swear by any of those Forms, as by Heaven or Earth, yet we
must <hi>swear by such Forms of Oaths,</hi> as by <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> that
we may <hi>Swear by him</hi> that made them and dwells therein, being his
Throne and Footstool; whereas it is confessed on all hands, that to
<hi>Swear by Heaven or Earth, or any other Creature,</hi> is absolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
but Swearing by the Lord on a Book or otherwise, is the
Matter in Controversie. But this man further in his own Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
saith; <hi>As to the Forms of Swearing, whether God's Name
be expresly mentioned in them, or only implyed by mentioning some of
his Creatures with respect to him; as when we call Heaven and Earth
to bear witness to what we say, I do not find any Difference between
them, either in Point of Lawfulness or Obligation, by the People of
God or God himself in any Age,</hi> p. 19.</p>
               <p>He finds little to purpose then, but what is to his own Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Confusion, that one while confesses it unlawful to swear
by Heaven, Earth, or any other Creature; and another while
finds no difference between Swearing by Heaven or Earth without
mentioning the Name of God, and Swearing by God himself: And
yet in his second page, his Definition of <hi>an Oath is nothing else</hi> but
a calling God to Witness; but here he hath found something else;
for an Oath in his 19th page is, <hi>calling Heaven and Earth to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Oh, what a Labyrinth of Confusion is this man in! It is
true, that Christ reproved the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharisees</hi> Folly and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in saying, Whosoever Sweareth by the Temple, it is nothing;
but whosoever shall Swear by the Gold of the Temple, he is a
Debtor: See his Reproof upon them <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 16, &amp;c. He also


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58875:10"/>
addeth ver. 22. <hi>He that sweareth by Heaven, sweareth by the Throne
of God, and him that sitteth thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this man in allowing such Forms of Oaths, as a Swearing
by Heaven, &amp;c. because therein, it is both a Swearing by the
Throne of God and him that sitteth thereon, he represents Christ
as contradicting himself, who said, <hi>Swear not
at all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hilary comment. on Mat. Canon 4. on Mat. 5. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, &amp;c.</hi> So
that he forbids both Swearing in general, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such Forms of Oaths as this man allows
of, as a Swearing by the Throne of God, and by him that sitteth
thereon. And we do not find that Christ allows the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
to use any such Form of Oaths, as Swearing by Heaven, and
therein by God, any more then he allowed them to swear either
by the Temple, or by the Gold of the Temple; either by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
or by the Gift that is upon it; But rather reproves them with,
<hi>Ye Fools and Blind; Wo to you</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Pharisees, <hi>Hypocrites,
&amp;c.</hi> He is so far from telling them, that to <hi>swear</hi> by Heaven, and
so by God, was the <hi>most August Act of Divine Worship,</hi> as this man
hath affirmed; and yet saith, We are not to use such Forms <hi>but in
extream Necessity;</hi> which in his sense is to tell us, <hi>We are not to
perform the Worship of God, or the most August Act thereof, but in
extream Necessity:</hi> For he sayes, That Swearing implies the whole
Worship of God, p. 13. And that he is not Glorified sufficiently
in order to God's Accepting us either in Prayer, Thanksgiving or
Attending upon his Word, <hi>unless we add Swearing by his Name:</hi>
But who besides himself of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will believe
such Doctrine? By the same Reason that God interprets it, as an
Affront offered to him when Perjury is committed in the Name
of an Idol, this man's idolizing Swearing, as implying the <hi>whole
Worship of God,</hi> and as being the <hi>most August Act</hi> of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
God may justly interpret as an Affront offered to him, and
a Depraving his Worship, who was and is truly loved and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in the Spirit and in the Truth, before mens Oaths and
Swearing were, and when they are ended.</p>

To which we say, <hi>First,</hi> Let it be considered, whether their
Rejoycing was God their Maker; if not, as we know none holds,
then whether this man hath not rendered <hi>Paul</hi> highly a Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor

that is not God, as also by the Rejoycing of others; for

thus, <hi>Verily I dye daily for your Rejoycing, or

                  <q>And likewise <hi>J. S.</hi> represents the primitive <hi>Christians,</hi> who
sufferd under the <hi>Pagan</hi> Persecutions the most exquisite Torments
rather then to Swear by the Heathen Gods or the Genij of the
Emperors; yet <hi>by the Health</hi>

                     <hi>of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Tertullian</hi> assureth us they did; and as
saying, <hi>We</hi> Christians <hi>Swear by the Health of

Majesty of the Emperor: And also addeth, That the Form of the
Military Oath, which the <hi>Christian</hi> Soldiers took in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s
time is thus laid down, <hi>By the Majesty of the Emperor, &amp;c.</hi> And saith, That in such Forms of <hi>Swearing, though we name some
Creatures, yet we Swear not ultimately by that Creature,</hi>
                  </q> pag. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> However <hi>Tertullian</hi> represents these Martyrs as
<hi>Swearing</hi> by the <hi>Health</hi> of the Emperor, and those afterwards
by the <hi>Majesty</hi> of the Emperor; The Truth of the first is a
Matter in Question, especially since Swearing by a Creature hath
been accounted unlawful both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can such an Example (if true) be Warrant to any to take
such a Form of Oath, as by the Health of a Man or Creature.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither is <hi>Swearing</hi> by the Health of the Emperor any
more warrantable; And did not both these Oaths savour of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism?</hi>
which if any esteemed <hi>Christians,</hi> came under and took,
it was more a Condescension for Fear then any Example to be
followed.</p>
               <p>And his saying, <hi>That though we name some Creature, yet we swear


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58875:11"/>
not ultimately by that Creature;</hi> yet however, it implies a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in part by that Creature: And how well this agrees with his
accounting a Lawful Oath but a calling God to witness, or a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only by his Name, let the ingenuous Reader judge; or with
<hi>Tertullian</hi> his Sense of the said Swearing by the Health of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
viz. <hi>Per salutem Imperatoris, salvum esse volumus quod Deus
voluit; et hoc nobis pro magno juramento est:</hi> We acknowledge that
Emperors are set over the Nations by the Will of God, and what
is by the Will of God we will or wish that God may save; and
this to us is for or instead of a great Oath. And the same WE
also will or desire, that is, the Well-fare of <hi>Caesar</hi> or the <hi>King,</hi> as
acknowledging God's Power or Hand in setting him up; For that
<hi>Promotion comes not from the East, nor from the West, &amp;c.</hi> but
from the Lord, who putteth down one and setteth up another as he
pleaseth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His accusing the</hi> Quakers <hi>for</hi> wresting <hi>those Passages afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
we pass by among the rest of his Slanders. But his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
That</hi> no People upon the Earth were more scrupulously tender
of taking solemn promissory Oaths then the <hi>Jews</hi> were at that time
when our Saviour gave them this Prohibition, <hi>pag. 24. from</hi>
Joeseph Antiq. <hi>l. 18. cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>This makes for us; for were not promissory Oaths as well as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertory
allowed under the Law? And if they were tender of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
promissory Oaths, they were more fitted for Christ's univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Prohibition of Oaths, as they were in some measure prepared
for Christ by <hi>John's</hi> Baptism.</p>
               <p>He tells us, That the <hi>Jews could swallow such Camel-Oaths as by
Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 24. And is not he himself guilty of the same?
Could not he <hi>swallow such Camel-Oaths</hi> where he allows the use of
such Forms, as Swearing by Heaven; &amp;c. because Gods Name is
implyed? And he that sweareth by Heaven, sweareth by him
whose Throne it is, which he accounts lawful, pag. 17, 19. But
in pag. 24. To Swear by Heaven or <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are <hi>Camel-Oaths:</hi>
What Credit can this man's Work against us be of? He reckons
that Christ's words may be applyed to their <hi>Stipulations by Oath
in their private Contracts and mutual Trading;</hi> whenas Christ's
Prohibition, as explained by the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> is general; But


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58875:12"/>
his applying it to an Oath in private Contracts, seems to grant,
That Christ did forbid something of this kind that was used under
the Law as well as in a publick manner: And there seems no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why Christ's words should be only thus applyed, unless men
were more clear of Corruption and Fraud in private Contracts
then in publick Testimonies; or why Christ's general words [For
whatsoever is more then these cometh of Evil, or of the Evil
One] should extend only to the private and not to the publick, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not to us: However, they whom the Evil One leads to Lye
for any Self-Interest, what Credit is to be given to their <hi>Swearing?</hi>
And is it not evident, how little the Custom thereof sweyes with
their Consciences by the Injury and Injustice many suffer, and the
long Continuance of Contests, Law-Suits and Quarrels? And a
man would think, that there should be less need of Swearing in
the Magistrates Presence then in private Covenants and Contracts;
because it is the Magistrates Wisdom to search and find out the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in his Power to punish the False Witness, and be a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to him; but in Private only the Fear and Terror of God in
men's Consciences can restrain them from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:<note place="margin">See <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 9. &amp; 31. 53. &amp; 21. 23. &amp; 26. 28. &amp; 47. 31.</note>
However, what's more evident, then
that private Oaths and Covenants thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man were in use both before

Christ's Prohibition to extend to an Oath
in private Contracts between man and man,
and yet reckoning, that he forbids nothing but
what was forbidden in the Law, we cannot
but wonder at such wonderful and frequent Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. S. saith.</hi> Applying Christ's Prohibition to solemn Oaths, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Promissory or Assertory, or to any but common-Discourse-Oaths,
makes Christ a Transgressor of the Law. I Tremble at the Thought
of this Consequence, which as naturally flows from the <hi>Quakers</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He hath cause rather to Tremble because of his own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and perverse Talk, thus to tye up Christ's Prohibition so fully
explain'd, in Opposition to former Oaths and Swearing under the
Law (even those to the Lord, which surely were solemn and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

where he forbids his to <hi>swear at all;</hi> adding, neither by

all Legal Proceeding, or proclaiming an Indemnity to Thieves,
Murderers, Blasphemers, and all sorts of injurious Persons, or
turning of <hi>Hell</hi> loose in the Kingdom of God (as this man blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously
words it) That Christ came not to destroy the Law,
but to fulfil it, in answering the End of it, as in this Particular;
where Swearing under the Law was a kind of Bond upon their
Soul to speak or do that which was Right and Just in the Sight of
God and Men, the greater Weight still was upon this then upon
those words and Ceremonies of <hi>Swearing,</hi> which though Christ
ended <hi>Swearing,</hi> and the Law thereof, with many other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
Ceremonies and Shadows; yet he did not come either to
stop Justice or to indulge Malefactors, he being the End of the
Law for Righteousness; and yet unto his own forbids some things
the Law allowed, as that, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a
Tooth;</hi> though he was for overcoming of Evil with that which was
Good.</p>

what manner of Person he had been. <hi>Secondly, Neither can they

                  </gap>as the Prohibition is plain and
positive, Above all things Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither
by the Earth, neither by <hi>any other Oath;</hi> but this man will still
have <hi>some other Oath:</hi> So whether must we believe him or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>James,</hi> judge Reader. And though we do not look on
Swearing as worse then Adultery or Man-slaughter, as is queried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the words, <hi>Above all things Swear not;</hi> yet doubtless the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saw the Consequence of it might be bad, and sad enough, or
else he would not so strictly have Forbidden it to the Twelve
Tribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. S.</hi> makes these the Consequences of our sticking to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Command of Christ and his Apostle, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi>'s calling
God to witness <hi>came from an Evil spirit.</hi> That our Saviour, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as he said Amen, Amen, had those words put into his Mouth <hi>by
the Evil One,</hi> pag. 31.</p>
               <p>To the first we say, No; it was Christ, the Son of God, that spoak
in <hi>Paul,</hi> whose Witness God is; and the Son's simply owning the
Father for his Witness we do not look upon as making up a
Formal Oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:58875:13"/>
To the second; Neither can we own that our Saviour swore as
often as he said <hi>Amen,</hi> or Verily, Verily, which was but a Note of
Affirmation, and not of Swearing, and more then Yea, Yea,
Nay, Nay.</p>
               <p>Again, He infers, That the Elect Angel which Christ sent from
Heaven to communicate the Knowledge of future things to St.
<hi>John was inspired by the Devil</hi> when he swore by him that liveth
forever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, that he was not; for he spoak as God's Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
or Ambassadour, having a peculiar Commission, Power and
Dispensation therein, which men may not imitate, which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
through the Law and the Prophets, in which the Swearing
was; and wherein the Angels were sent as God's Messengers and
Representatives, Ministring Spirits and Servants to the whole Seed
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Heirs of Salvation, to whom God's Promise
was confirmed by an Oath: And this was a Vision represented in
Figures.</p>
               <p>His telling us, That Christ prohibits the use of [whatsoever is
more] <hi>to be intrinsecally Evil,</hi> pag. 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though Oaths when lawful, could not be accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally
Evil; yet there was an Evil that was an Occasion of
Oaths, before permitted among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as that of Diffidence,
Jealousie, Instability, Liableness to run after other Gods, and to
do Injustice, Distrust one of another, &amp;c. and as this man
confesseth, <hi>common humane Infirmity, Ambiguity,</hi> pag. 1. and
pag. 17. How plain is it, it was Weakness, Distrust and Fear in

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch,</hi> which was the cause of his requiring <hi>Abraham</hi> to
Swear, that he would not deal falsly with him; and a Covenant
with <hi>Isaac,</hi> that he would do them no Hurt? <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 23. and
chap. 26. 28. Therefore Christ's words are plain, <hi>Let your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
be Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay; for whatsoever is more then
these</hi> (that is, in Affirming and Denying) <hi>cometh of Evil,</hi> or <hi>of
the Evil One.</hi> And many Things, Ceremonies, Circumstances
and Shadows under the Law, that in themselves were not intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
evil, did wax old, and grew out of use, and vanished, as the
old Covenant it self did, being accounted Weak, Insufficient and
of a Decaying Nature, when a higher and more eminent Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
was brought in, as that of the New Covenant, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> J. S. <hi>his Consequence and Doctrine appears both Gross,
Impious and Antichristian, where he saith;</hi> That if the <hi>Christian</hi>-Churches
do not perform Homage to the God of Truth by Swearing
as well as Blessing in his Name, if their Tongues do not as well Swear
as their Knees bow to him, then the <hi>Christian</hi>-People are not the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Then the Blessed Jesus is not the Christ <hi>of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

insolently to attempt the engaging of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church to
Swearing as well as Blessing; yea, to Cursing, and daring God

rendering <hi>Swearing</hi> such an eminent Proof of Demonstration of
the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s Coming, against the <hi>Jews</hi> Opinion of him, and as
reasonable as to tell us, that the effectual Means to convince the
<hi>Jews</hi> that Jesus is the Christ, is <hi>to swear</hi> that he is so, instead of
the Apostle's plain <hi>Confession</hi> of him, that Jesus is the Christ, who
preferred Confession instead of Swearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, His scornful Talk of the</hi> Reign of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Christ,
<hi>and saying,</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> Gloss defrauds God of his due Homag,
robs the King of Saints of one of the Prime Jewels of his Crown,
presents the Ever-blessed Jesus in the Form of an Impostor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and False
Christ, leads directly to the Gulf of Gross Infidelity and Denyal of
Christ, <hi>pag.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>This is as Wicked and Blasphemous as his Consequence before,
and shews this man to be a most gross Idolater in thus unscriptural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applauding of <hi>Swearing,</hi> as <hi>the Prime Jewel of the King of
Saints his Crown;</hi> whereas the King of Saints and his Servant have
plainly forbidden Swearing, which is not to make the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Holy Prophets, as to their spiritual Intent and End (which
was to <hi>confess</hi> to God and to Christ) as is falsly inferred. And as


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58875:14"/>
falsly he represents the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as saying, <hi>Christ should teach his
Disciples to Swear, The Lord liveth:</hi> but where the Prophets so
say we are all to seek; but not where they testifie against Swearing,
see <hi>Jer. 23. 10. Hosea</hi> 4. 15. chap. 2. 3. <hi>Zach. 5. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Zeph.
1. 5. Eccles.</hi> 9. 2. But if Swearing were that Divine Homage,
or included the whole Worship of God that is to be among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
why is Christ so silent in it and the Apostles, as not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to command it, but on the contrary, expresly forbid it? Or if
Swearing were the most August Act of Divine Worship, surely the
Apostle <hi>James</hi> instead of saying, Above all things my Brethren <hi>swear
not,</hi> should have said, Above all things my Brethren <hi>swear ye.</hi>
There was a time when the <hi>Iews</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eared an Oath; but through the
Custom of <hi>Swearing</hi> they run into <hi>False Swearing:</hi> And though
they said, The Lord liveth, yet surely they <hi>swore falsly;</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of Oaths the Land mourned, and this Land mourneth. And
therefore even in the Prophets time <hi>Oaths</hi> &amp; <hi>Swearing</hi> were testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against; as, Though thou <hi>Israel</hi> play the Harlot, yet let not <hi>Iudah</hi>
sin; Come not ye unto <hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>thaven,</hi>
not <hi>swear</hi> The Lord liveth, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 15. If it be said, that this
forbidding to <hi>Swear</hi> was because of their Wickedness and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
we say, by the same Reason we may now testifie against
<hi>Swearing,</hi> and for Conscience sake cannot uphold the Custom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
nor submit to the Imposition thereof, though this man is not
ashamed for all this Abuse and Prophanation, to urge and applaud it
as the highest Act of Divine Worship, and the Condition of God's
receiving people; which, if it could be granted, as it is not, it
only signifies thus much, That only the Righteous, and such as are
converted to God, must <hi>swear,</hi> and that upon a very sacred Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
to God himself.</p>
               <p>Now judge, serious Reader, what the Tenor of this man's
Work amounts to; it is that Righteous Men must obliege them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to God and adore him by <hi>Swearing:</hi> What is this to <hi>swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to men in litigious Courts? And what is this to the Imposition
of Oaths we desired the Parliament to remove?</p>
               <p>Under the <hi>Law</hi> Oaths were used in two respects, namely, <hi>First,</hi>
To prevent and end Strife among men (and these both in private and

                  </gap>o God himself, or between man and man, And
man and God; or <hi>Swearing</hi> to man, and <hi>Vowing</hi> to God: See

29. chap. 5. 12. Now this man's Work renders <hi>Swearing by
God</hi> in general to be the highest Act of Divine Worship, which
only they that are converted to God can perform in his Sense;
and such none of the Wicked or Unconverted are capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Judge whether this Distinction be made in the usual Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Swearing;</hi> or, Hath this man taken so much Pains with
the Magistrates as to instruct and warn them, not to impose Oaths
upon the Unconverted, nor especially upon those Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by the Bishops? For it needs must be granted on all hands,
That they that are Wicked and Unchristian, prophane the Name
of the Lord if they <hi>swear</hi> by him; and they must needs partake
of their Sin who force them to it: And as for the Converted and
Righteous, they are of Credit; and there is no need to force
them to <hi>Swear,</hi> being under a greater Bond and Covenant with
God then that of Oaths imposed by man, Christ being to them
their Covenant and Bond, the End of Oaths under the Law, and
the Substance of God's Oath to the Heirs of Promise. So we
leave this man's Doctrine for all serious Readers to judge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi>

<hi>Polycarpus</hi> and those <hi>Christian</hi>-Martyrs, refused to <hi>Swear</hi> by the
Good Fortune of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which is as we cited before. 2. But
why makes this man such a Difference between the Good Fortune
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Prosperity?</p>
               <p>He tells us, p. 20. That <hi>Tertullian</hi> assureth us, That the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Christians,</hi> who suffered under the <hi>Pagan</hi> Persecutions, who
would not <hi>swear</hi> by the Genij of the Emperors, have <hi>sworn</hi> by the
Health of the Emperors, <hi>Tertull. Apolog.</hi> c. 32. Whatever
<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of those <hi>Christians,</hi> it doth not invalidate our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Instance of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> who was a more eminent Martyr, and
clear in his Testimony then many others; For what is more plain
in Ecclesiastical History, then that some Christian-Martyrs excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many of the more weak <hi>Christians,</hi> both in their Courage,
Valour, Patience, Nobility and Clearness in bearing their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?
And we did not say, that all the former <hi>Christians,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58875:17"/>
and Fathers since the Apostles dayes refused to <hi>swear,</hi> as we
do, but many did; and therefore said, we have of many more
given some Instances and Testimonies of such Primitive <hi>Christian</hi>-Martyrs
and Fathers, &amp;c. the <hi>Case,</hi> p. 9. And also its confessed,
that the <hi>Christians</hi> prayed for the Emperor's Health, and wished
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Prosperity, which to them was instead of a great Oath,
<hi>Tertull. ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though <hi>J. S.</hi> would insinuate, <hi>That</hi> Polycarpus <hi>did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to Swear upon the Account of Christ's Inhibition, but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
of the Form of the Oath;</hi> saying, <hi>That the true Criterion was
this, That the</hi> Gentiles <hi>would have had the Martyrs swear by the Idols,
but the Martyrs would not swear but by the God of Truth,</hi> pag. 38.
See the Man's Contradiction to himself, and to what he saith
<hi>Tertullian</hi> assures us, viz. <hi>That without the least scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
they have sworn by the Health of the Emperor.</hi> Oh strange!
and yet would not swear but by the God of Truth: Was there no
Difference between the Health of a Wicked Persecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and the God of Truth? If <hi>Polycarpus</hi> had then profered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>J. S.</hi> his Account of those Martyrs, <hi>viz.</hi> By the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
God I wish or pray for the Health of the Emperor; or
else, if this would not have pleased his Persecutors, when they
urged him to swear by the Fortune of <hi>Caesar,</hi> he had then answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Well, I will <hi>swear</hi> by the Prosperity or Health of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
probably he might have come off at a more easie rate then he
did; as many Temporizers have evaded Suffering in our dayes.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with <hi>Polycarpus;</hi> 
                  <q>The Proconsul urged him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times to swear by the Fortune of <hi>Caesar:</hi> To whom <hi>Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
answered, If thou requirest this Vain-Glory, that I protest
the Fortune of <hi>Caesar,</hi> as thou sayest, seigning thou knowest me
not who I am, hear freely, I am a <hi>Christian;</hi> and if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
to know the Doctrine of <hi>Christianity,</hi> appoint the day and
thou shalt hear it. The Proconsul commanded the Beadle thrice
in the midst of the Theatre: <hi>Polycarpus</hi> confesseth himself a
<hi>Christian:</hi> The Multitude both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> inhabiting
<hi>Smyrna</hi> cryed with one Voice, <hi>That</hi> Polycarpus <hi>must be Burnt
quick;</hi> upon which the Multitude forth-with carried Logs, and
Wood, and Sticks out of their Shops and Bootks, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58875:17"/>
the <hi>Iews</hi> served promptly (after their wonted manner) for
that purpose, &amp;c.</q> See the Account at large, <hi>Euseb.</hi> l. 4. chap. 15.</p>
               <p>So it appears that both the out-ragious <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were for
<hi>swearing</hi> by their Heathen Gods, and those hypocritical <hi>Iews,</hi> who
were commanded to <hi>swear</hi> only by the True God, both joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to murder this Eminent and Valiant Christian-Martyr, who
would have taught the Proconsul the Christian Doctrine, which
contains an express Prohibition of <hi>Swearing;</hi> and whose Refusing
to <hi>Swear</hi> by the Good Fortune of <hi>Caesar</hi> appears to be (as he was
a <hi>Christian,</hi> from Christ's Prohibition) with respect to him, as
well as upon the Account of the Impiety of the Form of the Oath
it self, though those furious <hi>Heathens</hi> and envious <hi>Iews</hi> were not
fit to hear all his Reason on that Account. Consider that <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
reporteth <hi>(Lib. 3. against Heres.)</hi> That <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was not only
instructed by the Apostles, and conversant with many who saw
Christ; but also of the Apostles ordained Bishop of <hi>Smyrna—</hi>
who lived long,<note place="margin">Euseb. l. 4. c. 14.</note> and was very old, and at length fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
this Life with most Glorious and most renowned
Martyrdom, when he had continually taught that
which he learned of the Apostles: And that he converted
many of the Hereticks unto the Church of God, preaching the
one and only Truth received of the Apostles. To which we
add, It is not then probable that he should teach the <hi>Iews</hi> Doctrine,
for <hi>swearing</hi> by the Lord either to God or men; much less that he
taught men to <hi>swear</hi> by the Health of <hi>Caesar:</hi> But rather that he
taught them as Christ and his Servant <hi>Iames</hi> did, Not to <hi>swear</hi> at
all, by Heaven. Earth, or any other Oath; seeing he continually
taught that which he had learnt of the Apostles. 2. It is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he should so plainly contradict the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
My Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, nor by
Earth, nor by any other Oath; as to say, My Brethren, Ye may
either Swear by God that you wish <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Prosperity; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
You may Swear by the Health of <hi>Caesar</hi> the Emperor, though
not by his Good Fortune. For if he had thus taught, as this man
implies of the primitive <hi>Christians,</hi> he had taught quite contrary
to the said Apostle.</p>
               <p>And its also said by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eus. l. 4. c. 14.</note> There is extant an
Epistle of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi> very


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58875:18"/>
profitable for such as are careful of their Salvation, where they
may know the true Character of Faith and Rule of Doctrine.
And 'tis said, <hi>Polycarpus</hi> maketh mention hereof, (viz. of <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. l. 3. c. 32.</note>
the Martyr his Epistle to the Church at <hi>Smyrna)</hi>
in the Epistle under his Name unto the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
writing thus, <q>I bereech you all that you be Obedient,
and exercise Patience, which you have throughly seen, not only in
blessed <hi>Ignatius, Rufus</hi> and <hi>Zosimus,</hi> but in divers of your selves,
in divers of the Apostles, and in <hi>Paul,</hi> with the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
&amp;c.</q> Now it is not likely that <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> exhorting them
so to Obedience as to follow the Apostle's Doctrine and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
should yet hold it lawful to <hi>Swear</hi> either by the Health of the
Emperor, or by God, both contrary to the Law and the Gospel,
and to the express Doctrine and earnest Admonition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>James, Jam</hi> 5. 12. It is also said, <hi>(Euseb.</hi> lib. 5. chap. 23.)

                     </gap>tus</hi> able to perswade <hi>Polycarpus</hi> that he should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that which he had alwayes observed with <hi>John</hi> the Disciple of
the Lord, and the rest of the Apostles, with whom he had been
conversant. It is not probable then, that he should be perswaded
not to retain Christ and his Apostles Doctrine, Swear not at all,
neither by Heaven, &amp;c. nor by any other Oath, to teach the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
that they might <hi>Swear</hi> by the <hi>Health</hi> of the Emperor, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. S</hi>'s accusing the <hi>Quakers</hi> with comparing the Oath which the
Proconsul tendered to <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> to that Form of Oath which is
in use in this Kingdom, and therewith aspersing the King and both
Houses of Parliament with the Crime of <hi>Heathenish</hi> Idolatry.
These are both very Malicious &amp; False, for no such Comparison was
intended by us: There was no mention of that Form of Oath
which is in use in this Kingdom, but of that which was required of
<hi>Polycarpus</hi> by the Fortune of <hi>Caesar</hi> (which was then their Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Oath) which he could not <hi>swear</hi> for Conscience sake, because
he was a <hi>Christian;</hi> no more then we now can for Conscience sake,
because we are <hi>Christians,</hi> and Christ and his Apostle have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us expresly not to Swear at all. So that the Comparison
lies between his being oblieged in Conscience as a <hi>Christian,</hi> not
to take that Oath; and our being oblieged in Conscience to Christ,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58875:18"/>
and in Obedience to his Doctrine, not to Swear at all, or take these
Oaths, because of Christ's Prohibition, there being yet a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the Objects sworn by.</p>
               <p>2ly, That <hi>Ponticus</hi> and <hi>Blandina,</hi> who were Martyrs, and
cruelly tormented to Death by the <hi>Heathens</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the Reign
of <hi>Antoninus Verus,</hi> Ann. 179. refused to Swear, being often ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
is plain, <hi>Euseb.</hi> l. 5. cap. 1. And that they contemning the
<hi>Heathen</hi> Idols refused to Swear by them, is not denyed: But that
they were bound in Conscience to this Refusal, only because of
the Impiety of the Form of the Oath, and not also upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Christ's Prohibition, is deny'd by us, and not proved by
<hi>J. S.</hi> For 'tis probable enough it was on the Account of both,
they suffering both as <hi>Christians</hi> who respected Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Doctrine, and so near the Apostles dayes. Besides, it
was most necessary for the Martyrs in those dayes openly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and testifie against the <hi>Heathen</hi> Idols, in refusing to Swear by
them, being not called to Swear by the True God; without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that <hi>Basilides,</hi> who of a Persecutor was made a Martyr,
who was a Souldier, and of Authority in the <hi>Roman</hi> Host, being
required to give an <hi>Oath</hi> in a Matter concerning his Fellow-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
deny'd to do it, plainly affirming, <hi>He was a Christian,</hi> and
therefore suffered Death about <hi>Ann. Christi</hi> 205. For this see
<hi>Euseb.</hi> lib. 6. chap. 4. and <hi>Acts &amp; Mon.</hi> 1 Vol. p. 71. The
Matter here, so far as 'tis cited <hi>J. S.</hi> cannot deny, and yet saith,
<hi>I must make bold to set down the Book which they have omitted,</hi> Fox
Vol. 1. fol. 71. which is not true; the Book is set down before his
Eyes, but not all <hi>J. Fox</hi>'s words cited where he addeth, <hi>Their Oath
then was wont to be by the Idols and the Emperor;</hi> this is <hi>Jo. Fox</hi>'s
Addition: Whereas <hi>Eusebius</hi> hath it more positive, thus, <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides</hi>
being required of his Fellow-Souldiers to Swear for some Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
or other, affirmed plainly, It was not Lawful for him to
Swear; for he said, He was a <hi>Christian;</hi> and he would in very
deed Protest or witness the same, see <hi>Euseb.</hi> l. 6. c. 4. The
Truth of it is, We cannot see how to reconcile <hi>J. S</hi>'s Work, or to
make it consistent with it self, or in History, That these primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Christians</hi> and Martyrs could without Scruple of Conscience
Swear by the <hi>Health</hi> or <hi>Prosperity</hi> of the Emperor, and yet refuse
to Swear by his <hi>Good Fortune,</hi> or that they could take such a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

Oath, even in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, as by the <hi>Majesty</hi> of the

This</hi> J. S. <hi>confesseth</hi> comes home
to the Point, if the Allegation
be faithful; but if this Plow-man
be <hi>Chaucer Jack upland,</hi> as by
his stile he seems to be, I never
read, <hi>saith he,</hi> that he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized
a Martyr, or dubbed a
Father of the Church, though
he be Dad of <hi>English</hi> Poets: Nor
do I think his Romance will pass
among Rational Men for Good
Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Here this Opposer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
more of one affected to
<hi>Popery,</hi> then with the Plow-man's
Complaint against the
Pope. As for his guessing who
penn'd that Complaint, it is of
little value, while he sleights and
scoffs at the thing it self, more
like one Popishly affected then
a real <hi>Protestant;</hi> However,
whether the Plow-man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was penn'd by any Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
or Father of the Church or
no, it was owned by the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
as their Sense in those days,
and recorded among the Martyrs Testimonies for Christ, &amp; against


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58875:19"/>
the Pope: And however he sleights or jeers <hi>Chaucer,</hi> hath he
not been owned as a witty <hi>Wickliffian,</hi> and a Witness in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
against the usurping Clergy in his time?</p>
               <p>5ly. He sleightly shuffles off the Instances of <hi>John Wickliff,
William Swinderby,</hi> and the poor <hi>Christians</hi> in those dayes, their
Testimonies against Swearing, and against the Pope and Prelates
compelling Men to Swear, &amp;c. as if they were only applicable to
Oaths in Contracts, or by any Creature, or idly, &amp;c. But he hath
nothing against our Citations, whereas what we have cited of
<hi>William Swinderby</hi> extends farther then this man's Limitation; As
the 14th Article against him was, that he should say, That no man
ought to Swear for any thing, but simply without an Oath to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
or Deny; and if he Swears he sins, <hi>Act. Mon.</hi> 1 vol. fol. 614.
Its true, he answered to this. That men should not Swear by any
Creature by the Law of God;<note place="margin">K. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. Anno 1391.</note> but he further declares
his Mind and Sense in his Appeal from the Bishop's
Sentence to King <hi>Richard</hi> 2. and his Council, in
these words, Whereas <hi>Christ</hi>'s Law forbids <hi>Swearing,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s
Law justifies <hi>Swearing,</hi> and compels men thereto, <hi>Act. &amp; Mon.</hi>
1 vol. fol 618. [note that in the former he speaks with reference
to <hi>God's Law,</hi> in the latter to <hi>Christ's Law]</hi> which no doubt was
the Opinion of many more, as appears by the Plow-man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
which otherwise had not so been preserved and propagated
as it was. And it appears from that Doctrine received among the
poor <hi>Christians</hi> in this Nation, that neither the Pope, nor the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
neither any other Ordinary can compel any man to Swear by
any Creature of God, or by the Bible-Book, <hi>Act. Mon.</hi> 1 vol.
fol 687. which Opinion among others their Persecutors
sought to make them renounce and abjure. By this it appears they
opposed the Popes compelling men to swear upon the Bible Book,
wherein they also swear by the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By his saying,</hi> Those Martyrs that held that all Oaths that be
made for any Contract or Bargain were Vnlawful.</p>
               <p>However, it was matter of Conscience to them that so held, &amp;c.
It appears then, that they held something unlawful that was used of
old time, both before and under the Law, contrary to <hi>J. S.</hi> p. 15.
For both before and under the Law there were private Oaths and


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58875:20"/>
Swearing in some Contracts and Covenants between man and
man, as well as publick before Judges; And if the Martyrs Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against the Pope's Compulsion reacht only private Oaths,
we ask, Where did ever the Pope's Law compel Men to Swear in
their private Bargains between man and man? and why are men
put upon Swearing in their Account for their Tyths, more then in
their private Contracts about them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. S.</hi> would seem cordially to concur with <hi>William Thorpe</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
as being only against <hi>Swearing</hi> by the Book, by any
Creature, &amp;c. Whereas when <hi>William Thorpe</hi> was demanded to
kneel down, and touch the holy Gospel-Book, and kiss it, saying,
So help me God, and this holy Doom; he argues largely against
it, concluding thus, Therefore to Swear upon a Book is to
Swear by Creatures, and this Swearing is ever unlawful; adding
further, This Sentence witnesses <hi>Chrysostom</hi> plainly, blaming them
greatly that bring forth a Book to Swear upon; charging Clarks,
that in no wise they constrain any Body to Swear, whether they
think a man to Swear True or False, <hi>Act. Mon.</hi> 1 vol. fol. 701.
See how plain it is that <hi>William Thorpe</hi>'s words were against Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a Book, by God, (or <hi>as help me God)</hi> and against force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Body to Swear True or False; so that the said <hi>William
Thorpe</hi> did not only condemn the <hi>Papists</hi> common Swearing by

fol. 701, 702. Now what <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> whom he alledgeth, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
in this Case against Swearing, is very plain and positive from
the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy unquestioned, <hi>Tom. 1. Hom.</hi> 17. p. 217. (pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that in his other, <hi>Tom. Homil.</hi> 12. if questioned) where he
saith, <q>What therefore if some require an Oath, and impose a
Necessity of Swearing; let the Fear of God be more powerful
then all Necessity: For if thou wilt alwayes object such Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
thou wilt keep nothing of those things that are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
—What is more then Yea and Nay? To Swear, not to
Forswear, seeing none need to be taught that <hi>that</hi> is of Evil, and
not so much superfluous as contrary; for that is superfluous which
is added needlesly, which certainly is an Oath; if Evil, how
then was it commanded in the Law?—That is now Adultery,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58875:20"/>
which was then allowed—Weakness required then—for
unless those things had gone before, the other had not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
been received—Their Vertue is now shown—Swearing
was permitted heretofore by the Law, lest men should worship
Idols, or <hi>swear</hi> by Idols; it brought them to solid Meat. What
Evil then is it to <hi>swear?</hi> much without doubt—but <hi>now</hi> after
so many Arguments of Power, but not <hi>then</hi>—We must study
to do above the old Commandment—Unless your Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
exceed, &amp;c. Some come so far short of it, that they
refuse not only to Swear, but even do Forswear—If to Swear
be Evil, Perjury is great Evil.</q> With much more to the same
purpose, his Assertions and Reasons being general, extending to
all <hi>swearing;</hi> and goes on to exhort and deter men from sleighting

               <p>Concerning <hi>Elizabeth Young,</hi> who was brought to Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes before the <hi>Catholick</hi> Inquisitors of Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Pravity, as they stiled themselves; her refusing to Swear <hi>J. S.</hi>
confines to these Reasons, First, <hi>Because she would not betray her
Christian-Friends.</hi> 2dly, <hi>Because of the Needlesness to Swear
whether she was a Man or a Woman,</hi> she affirming her self to be a
Woman, that being determinable without an Oath by Search:
Whereas her Reason is more general then either of these two
hinted; For when Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> said to her, Thou shalt be Racked
Inch-meal, thou Traitorly Whore and Heretick; but thou shalt
Swear before a Judge before thou go. To this <hi>Eliz. Young</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
Sr. I understand not what an Oath is, and therefore I
will take no such Oath upon me. Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> said, She refuseth
to Swear upon the four Evangelists before a Judge; for I my self
and Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> have had her before us four times, but we cannot
bring her to Swear. Then said the Bishop, Why wilt thou not
Swear before a Judge, &amp;c? <hi>Eliz.</hi> My Lord, I will <hi>not Swear that
this Hand is mine.</hi> No, said the Bishop, and why? <hi>Eliz.</hi> Christ
saith, that <hi>whatsoever is more th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay, it
cometh of Evil</hi> see the Relation more at large where it is quoted.
Observe that the Reason of her refusing to <hi>swear</hi> was more general
then <hi>J. S.</hi> relates: It was not only because she would not betray
her Friends, or because of the Unnecessariness of the Oath; But
because, <hi>first,</hi> She scrupled an Oath it self, saying, I understand


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58875:21"/>
not what an Oath is. <hi>2dly,</hi> Because of Christ's saying, Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is more then Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay, it cometh of Evil.
And <hi>3dly,</hi> It is plain she refused to Swear upon the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
and before a Judge to a thing that was True. Therefore
<hi>J. S.</hi> hath greatly abused this sincere Woman and Martyr, in
Restraining her Testimony against Swearing from its general
Tendence.</p>

in any Case to <hi>Swear;</hi> as may be plainly seen by Bishop <hi>Vshers</hi>
own Account, <hi>De Success.</hi> c. 6. pag. 161, 162. where he saith,
The old <hi>German</hi> Author, who wrote of the Doctrine and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> saith, That the Occasion of this Error (viz.
<hi>Refusing to Swear)</hi> was, the frequent Use of <hi>Swearing</hi> for light
Causes, and because Men fall into Perjuries; and addeth a quaint
similitude, saying, That the Hereticks who never <hi>swear,</hi> are like
the Devil, whom we never read to have Sworn. But (saith <hi>Vsher)</hi>
They who have learned of Christ, let your Speech be Yea, Yea,
Nay, Nay; for whatsoever is more is of that Evil One, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.
37. will judge the <hi>Papists</hi> (with whom the frequent Custom of
<hi>Swearing</hi> for light Causes is grown in use) much liker this Evil
Devil then the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who (as is evident from the Relation
of the <hi>Popish Inquisitor)</hi> used only to say, Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay;
avoiding a Lye and an Oath. And in the following page he sayes, But
that these <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Waldenses)</hi> are as far from Lyes and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as those false Friers are from Truth and Modesty, I bring those
two Inquisitors cited in the said Article for Witnesses; The one
whereof writes thus of the <hi>Leonists</hi> or <hi>Waldenses,</hi> They are aware
of Detraction, and of Scurrilousness, and of a Lye, and of an
Oath: The other thus, In Words they are Cautious; Lyes, Oaths,
and all things that are Naturally Dishonest they avoid. To which
may be added also a third, namely, that <hi>German</hi> which pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a Writing of the Doctrine and Behaviours of the <hi>Waldenses;</hi>
They teach to avoid a Lye, Detraction and an Oath. And so <hi>Vsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
argues thus, Because their Adversaries confess they avoid Oaths,
therefore to charge them with Forswearing is an Absurdity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Truth or Modesty.</p>
               <p>So that denying to <hi>swear</hi> is thus far commended, as that
it clears them from the possibility of Forswearing and Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary-Swearing;
wherein (he sayes) the <hi>Papist,</hi> their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
are more like the Devil: And so is ours in Lying; for he
perverts it thus in <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Name. From their <hi>Forswearing</hi> he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues

us, saying, <hi>Where are your Eyes? Where is your Conscience, who

<hi>His Judgment was far enough from the Opinion of the</hi> Quakers;

                  <hi>Reply,</hi> This is just the manner of the <hi>Papists</hi> underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
the Martyrs Testimonies, by endeavouring to fasten
Retractations and Recantations upon them; and because

this man has thus darkly and unfairly represented <hi>Walter
Brute</hi> as so doubtful in that Particular Opinion against
Oaths, and so ready to retract it, be pleased, Reader, to
hear <hi>Walter Brute</hi>'s own words in the page before cited, &amp;
how far he submitted in saying, <hi>I</hi> Walter Brute <hi>submit
my self principally to the Evangely of Jesus Christ, and to
the Determination of holy Kirk, and to the Sentence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the four Doctors, viz.</hi> Augustine, Ambrose,
Jerome <hi>and</hi> Gregory. Judge, we pray, what Retractation
is this: And should not our Opposer have shewed us, where
he retracted that Opinion aforesaid against <hi>Oaths,</hi> if he
could? or where ever he acknowledg'd himself convinc'd
that this was <hi>an Error?</hi> His Submission was principally to
the <hi>Evangely</hi> (or <hi>Gospel) of Jesus Christ,</hi> which <hi>J. S.</hi> leaves
out, as he doth <hi>[holy]</hi> before <hi>[Church]</hi> we hope he will not
charge <hi>W. Brute,</hi> that he design'd a Submission contrary to
the <hi>Gospel of Jesus Christ,</hi> being that principal <hi>thing</hi> without
which the other could not determine. But we do not find
that <hi>W. Brute</hi> retracted any more in the words above, then
he did sometime before,<note place="margin">Act. Mon. I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

thus, <hi>If any man will shew me that I Err in my
Writing or Sayings by the Authority of sacred Scripture, or by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

his Determination; But as for the bare words of any Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
Christ only excepted, I will not simply believe, except
he be able to establish them by the Truth of Experience, or of
the Scripture.</hi> Now consider, Reader, that this was but a
Submission conditionally proposed, any more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">Fol. 653.</note>
and that some time after this he positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrote against Oaths, for which we refer thee
to the Quotations: And this conditional Submission
seems rather to argue his Belief, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of Error herein, no more then the Bishop of

on his own Defence.<note place="margin">Fol. 625.</note> And has it not been
a common thing with many established in the
Truth, to propose such conditional Submissions to be
convinced, and receive Information by or according to
the Holy Scriptures? For our parts, we do not find this
man's Representation of <hi>Walt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r Brute</hi> to have so much as
a face of Truth in it, or that he was either doubtful of,
or did recant of that Opinion charged against him by
the publick Notary, viz. <hi>That he held that it is not lawful
for</hi> Christians <hi>for any Cause in any Case, to swear by the Creator,
neither by the Creature;</hi> But rather that he was positive in
this amongst his last Testimonies against the Pope and

               <p>As for J. S. his Conclusion, pag. 43. it savours both
of Scorn, and Envy, and a Persecuting Spirit, that would
instigate the King and Parliament to afflict us, as if <hi>we
were not Conscientious in what we profess,</hi> but we knowing the
contrary in our Consciences, as being therein oblieged to
Christ and his Command, we sleight our Enemies Flouts

               <p>The man seems herein wilfully to shut his Eyes; for
the said Order is very plain for Liberty of Conscience,
and Freedom from the Imposition of Oaths, unto those
Inhabitants who refus'd the taking the accustom<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Oaths,
and who instead thereof, proffered as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do <hi>That
their Yea should stand instead of an Oath, and the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
thereof be punished as perjured Persons;</hi> which with the
Advice of the Governour and Council of <hi>Zealand</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
ordained and confirmed, <hi>That this Peoples Yea
aforesaid should stand instead of an Oath before the Magistrates
of the said City</hi> [A Noble President to our Purpose]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58875:25"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> have refused to pay Church-Duties,
and thereby Rob the Royal Exchequer, which is partly supplyed
out of Tenths and First Fruits.</p>
               <p>To the first, of refusing to pay <hi>Church-Duties;</hi> it seems
he means <hi>Tythes to the Priests:</hi> And must we therefore not
be allowed the Liberty of our Consciences, but be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to Ruin, Loss of Estates and Livelihoods, because we
cannot pay Tenths to the Priests? Oh hard Man and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Judge! that respects more the Pope's Yoak and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Imposition, then the Lives or Liberties of
<hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects and True <hi>Christians:</hi> And his imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Indulgence for us, if we did not refuse to pay the
Priests Tythe, is like as to tell us, <hi>We may have the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Consciences if we will be Conformable:</hi> Oh generous
<hi>Indulgence</hi> to such as need it not! Could our Consciences
serve us to <hi>Conform, Pay Tythes, Uphold Priests, &amp;c.</hi> what
needed we make Address for Liberty? His charge of
<hi>Robbing the Royal Exchequer</hi> is envious and false, shewing a
Persecuting Spirit: The Priests <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yth-Barns are not the
<hi>Royal Exchequer;</hi> we cannot help to fill them: They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Tyths of us, not only of our Lands, but of the Fruits
and Encrease of our Labours and Industry (a manifest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion)
and their Demand of them is as <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi>
and on a <hi>Religious Account,</hi> as claiming a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> in
neither of which are we sati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied, nor can we own either;
and we have reason to think, that the King is more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to them about the First Fruits, then they are to us,
and doth not so severely prosecute or strictly look after
them as they do to us, having caused many deeply to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
both in Persons and Estates, and made grievous Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
by taking away and spoiling mens Goods, driving
away their Cows, Oxen, &amp;c. many times more then the
value of the Tvthe, besides the sweeping away House-hold
Goods, and exposing many poor industrious Families


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58875:26"/>
to Ruin; as also the many long &amp; tedious Imprisonments,
which they have caused many to suffer in till Death. But
when have we refused to pay our <hi>Civil-Duties</hi> or <hi>Taxes,</hi>
being in a Capacity, that is, out of Bonds and Sufferings,
which have disabled many? And if the King and Great
Council of the Nation were pleased to repeal those old
Laws inforcing the Payment of Tythes, and to convert
them into some <hi>necessary civil Use,</hi> as for the <hi>Poor,</hi> or some
<hi>National Service</hi> and <hi>Benefit,</hi> it would appear whether we
should not pay our parts, and whether the Royal Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
would not be conveniently supplyed without the
Tenths from the Priests.</p>
               <p>As for our Desire of being exempted from taking an
Oath, because our Consciences will not allow us to swear,
to this our Adversary adds, viz. <hi>When you actually do Swear in
as solemn &amp; august a Form, as its possible for the Tongue of man to
express, even then when you say, You dare not Swear; God, who
is the Searcher of Hearts, knows, that it is with a Holy Respect
to the Reputation of</hi> Christianity, <hi>the Evangelical Dispensation
and to Christ's express Prohibition, &amp;c.</hi> This Person has given
us various Definitions of an Oath; of which he reckons
that to say, <hi>God who is the Searcher of Hearts knows,</hi> is a most
solemn &amp; august Form of Swearing: But surely he egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
misseth in this; for at this rate of defining a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
form of an Oath, we shall scarce know how to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Name of God in any <hi>serious</hi> or <hi>solemn Way,</hi> either
in Prayer, Thanksgiving, Appeal to him either as witness
for us, or singly as desiring that the Truth may be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in any case; but this must all be lookt upon as a most
solemn and august Form of Swearing, if the Name of God
be but mention'd, when no Swearing is intended, nor any
Imprecation or Ceremony of an Oath used: But how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
doth this contradict his granting, there may be a
confessing the true God in Prayer, in Thanksgiving, &amp;c.


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58875:26"/>
without Swearing, in his counting such Confession of God
<hi>not sufficient or acceptable, except they add Swearing by his Name;</hi>
so that however the Name of God may be solemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
without Swearing: And if on some weighty Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
a <hi>Christian</hi> be moved to say, <hi>God knows I Lye not, God is
my Witness:</hi> How can this be a solemn Oath or Swearing,
when he neither intends it nor useth the Ceremony of an
Oath, nor any Imprecation or Curse?</p>
               <p>For there is a plain Difference between a man's earnestly
appealing to God by way of Imprecation, <hi>as the great Judge
of Heaven and Earth, Avenger of Injury and Falshood;</hi> And ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
committing or resigning his Cause unto God, that he
may discover the Truth <hi>(being Witness thereof)</hi> to others,
when it is or may be doubted or question'd: As in a Case
of moment, wherein I know &amp; am sure the Truth is on my
side, while others may doubt or question me, if I appeal,
commit or resign my Cause to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as knowing him to be
my Witness therein) it is singly with a Desire, that he may
enlighten their Understandings, &amp; bring them to know the
Truth of my Cause; and for that End I both trust him, and
leave it with him; and not at all with any Ceremony of an
Oath, nor any <hi>Imprecation, Invocating of God for Witness (or
Judge) against my Soul;</hi> for what need of that when I know
I am clear? What need I be under any such Bond, as the
Fear of a <hi>Curse</hi> to bind me to speak the Truth, <hi>whenas I
am both ascertained of and engaged in the Truth, and my Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Reputation
and Soul's Peace is naturally concerned in it?</hi> And
on the other hand, if any should wilfully or knowingly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
false Things without binding their Souls with an Oath
or conditional Curse, <hi>that will not hinder the Curse, Judgment
or Reward of false Swearers from coming upon them, nor secure
the Guilty.</hi>
