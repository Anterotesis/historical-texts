         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>common-good,</hi> our present <hi>unnaturall warres</hi> would soone be <hi>determined,</hi>
our greatest <hi>differences</hi> easily <hi>reconciled,</hi> our foraine <hi>Irish, French, Walloon Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Forces,</hi> brought in to cut our <hi>English Protestants</hi> and their Religions
throats, before our faces, (at which horrid spectacle I wonder all <hi>English</hi>
spirits rise not up with unanimous indignation in stead of joyning with them)
easily expulsed, our remaining <hi>Grievances</hi> speedily <hi>redressed,</hi> our disordered
<hi>Church Reformed,</hi> our <hi>Pristine Peace</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> restored, yea <hi>entayled</hi> to us
and our <hi>Posterities</hi> for ever; whereas the private <hi>selfe-ends, selfe-interests,</hi> of
some ambitious, covetous, malicious, treacherous, timerous <hi>publicke persons,</hi>
(who serve no other <hi>Deity, Majesty,</hi> or <hi>Republicke,</hi> but <hi>themselves</hi> alone) have
most shamefully imbroyled, betrayed, and endangered both our <hi>Kingdoms, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Liberties, Religion, Properties,</hi> yea, all the <hi>blessings</hi> we formerly
enjoyed; whose <hi>names</hi> and <hi>memories</hi> shall be ever execrable to all <hi>Posteritie</hi>
upon <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Soules, Bodies,</hi> eternally <hi>tortured</hi> in <hi>hel,</hi> (without repentance)
for this their inhumane, unchristian <hi>Treachery,</hi> and <hi>Realme-destroying, Church-subverting
selfe-seeking,</hi> detestable both to God and Men.</p>
            <p>To conjure downe such base degenerous <hi>private spirits</hi> to the <hi>infernall pit,</hi>
or else to elevate and inflame them with great heroicke <hi>publike thoughts,</hi> there
is nothing more effectuall (in my weake apprehension) than the <hi>well-grounded
knowledge, serious study,</hi> and <hi>full vindication</hi> of such <hi>publike Truthes,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Publike Governement,</hi> and the <hi>Soveraigne Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Parliaments, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
Magistrates,</hi> People as are here debated, ratified, freed from those <hi>blacke
aspersions</hi> of <hi>sedition, faction, rebellion, treason, conspiracy, mutiny, singularity,
disloyalty,</hi> and the like, which sordid <hi>Sycophants,</hi> selfe-seeking <hi>Monopolists,
Courtiers, Royallists,</hi> or malignant <hi>Delinquents,</hi> have most injuriously cast upon
them to delude the world; which long obscured <hi>Truthes,</hi> though they may
seeme dangerous <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> and upstart <hi>Enthusiasmes,</hi> at the first proposall, to
many ignorant, seduced Soules, kept over long in <hi>Cymmerian</hi> darkenesse, by those <hi>Aegyptian</hi> taske-masters, who have studyed to increase and perpetuate
their bondage; Yet upon serious examination will prove to be most ancient,
indubitable <hi>Verities,</hi> universally received, beleeved, practised, by most <hi>Realmes</hi>
and <hi>Nations</hi> in the Universe, from the beginning of Monarchy till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and the contrary received opinions, to be but the vaine, empty Braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
lying fancies of a few illiterate, impolitick Court-Chaplaines, Lawyers,
Sycophants, who never dived into the Principles Constitutions, Lawes,
<pb facs="tcp:29602:4"/>
Histories of States and Realmes, or into the true originall grounds of <hi>Regall,
Regnall, Popular,</hi> or <hi>Parliamentary Iurisdictions;</hi> and writ onely to <hi>flatter Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to purchase honour, gaine, or favour to themselves;</hi> without any respect at
all to <hi>Verity,</hi> or the <hi>Common good,</hi> which never entred into their narrow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
thoughts.</p>
            <p>What entertainement these <hi>New-published common Truthes,</hi> are like to find
in <hi>Court,</hi> and elsewhere among many men, I may easily conjecture by that
ingrate requitall Your <hi>Honours</hi> have received from them, for all your <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
paines, cost, diligence, service</hi> for the <hi>Publike safety.</hi> Never did any <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> deserve halfe so well as this, for their indefatigable labours
night and day, almost three whole yeares space together, for the <hi>Common
good:</hi> Yet never was any halfe so ill requited. Never did any demerit greater
<hi>publike applause;</hi> never any underwent halfe so many vile Libellous <hi>reproaches,
slanders,</hi> of all sorts, even for <hi>well-doing;</hi> and that not onely in vulgar <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>
but in <hi>Presse</hi> and <hi>Pulpit</hi> too. Never did Parliament in any age sit
<hi>halfe so long, or doe halfe that worke,</hi> or get any such <hi>publike establishment,</hi> as this;
and yet all our Parliaments put together, were never so much opposed, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
secretly conspired against, or openly assaulted with armed violence to
dissolve and ruine them, as this one alone; against whom not onely the <hi>Pope</hi>
with all his <hi>Antichristian Members,</hi> at home and abroad, but (which is almost
a Miracle, not formerly heard of in any age) both <hi>King, Queene, Prince, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Counsellors, Courtiers;</hi> yea divers <hi>Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of both Houses, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their <hi>owne Protestations,</hi> have utterly deserted it, yea bent all their
policies, wits, Forces together, to dissolve and null it, (and in it all future
Parliaments,) as no Parliament at all, but as an Assembly of obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
<hi>Traytors,</hi> and <hi>Rebels;</hi> when as all your <hi>Actions, Proceedings, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Protestations,</hi> proclaime you nothing lesse, yea the <hi>best-deserving Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Assembly</hi> that ever this Nation was blessed with, and those <hi>Heroicke
Champions,</hi> who have lately regained, resetled (as farre as <hi>humane Lawes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
can secure them) our lost, at least decayed <hi>Liberties, Lawes, Priviledges,
Religion,</hi> in despite of all oppositions, and utterly suppressed that confederated
Triumvirate (of the <hi>Counsel-chamber, Starchamber,</hi> and <hi>High-Commission</hi>)
which had almost enthralled us in more than <hi>Aegyptian bondage,</hi> and resolved
to detaine both us and our Posterity under it, without the least hopes of any
<hi>enfranchisement.</hi> Never were there halfe so many publike regall <hi>Protestations,
Declarations, Proclamations, Oathes, Remonstrances,</hi> solemnely made and
published to the world, for the <hi>inviolable preservation of all just Rights</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament,</hi> as there have beene in this; and yet never were there
so <hi>many apparent violations</hi> of the undoubted <hi>Rights and Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in all former ages whatsoever, as in this one Parliament onely, now at
<pb facs="tcp:29602:4"/>
last so far affronted, by open <hi>Proclamation,</hi> (even against an Act of Parliament,
passed by the King and both Houses when fullest,) to be Proclaimed to the
world, <hi>No Parliament at all,</hi> but a meere <hi>factious, seditious Conventicle.</hi> Which
how inconsistent it is with other former <hi>Oathes</hi> &amp; <hi>Protestations,</hi> let all wise men
judge. However; this may be some good <hi>incouragement</hi> to your <hi>Honours,</hi> and
<hi>My selfe</hi> too, that if all his Majesties solemne Printed <hi>Protestations, Oathes,
Proclamations, Remonstrances</hi> to his people and all the world, with dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
<hi>imprecations</hi> on <hi>himselfe and his Posterity,</hi> to maintaine the <hi>Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties

are pretended, your <hi>Honourable proceedings,</hi> and these my <hi>polemicall Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

Parliaments,</hi>
the <hi>Subjects</hi> Liberties, Lawes, and our Religion against all <hi>Opposites</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,)
cannot but finde most <hi>gracious acceptation</hi> with his <hi>Majesties</hi> owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

            <p>However, Your <hi>Honours</hi> kinde, favourable entertainment, and Noble

and will misconster them, as they have done other of my <hi>Writings,</hi> to my

Me and them, against all adverse Powers and Detractions whatsoever: and
if I chance to suffer any future hard measure, of what kinde soever, for doing

it is found by daily experience, that many of his Majesties Subjects who
adhere in their hearts to the Popish Religion, by the infection drawne from
thence, and by the wicked and divellish counsell of Iesuites, Seminaries, and
other persons dangerous to the Church and State, are so farre perverted in
the point of their loyalties and due obedience unto the Kings Majesty, and
the Crowne of England, as they are ready to entertaine and execute any Treasonable Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Practices, as evidently appeares by that more then barbarous and horrible attempt to
have blowne up with Gunpowder, the King, Queene, Prince, Lords and Commons in the
House of Parliament assembled, tending to the utter subversion of the whole State, lately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by the instigation of Iesuites and Seminaries, and in advancement of their Religion
by their Schollars taught and instructed by them for that purpose. <hi>With the Statutes of</hi>

and not at any time after to passe or remove above five miles from thence, under paine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting

of other Princes Christian, that some good course might be taken (by a generall Councell, free,

of the Protestant Faith,</hi> now cordially protect and assist King <hi>Charles,</hi> without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
any thing against his Crowne or Person, who hath lately made and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
so many <hi>Protestations,</hi> and <hi>Declarations, that he will never imbrace, nor countenance
Popery, but most resolutely Defend, and Advance the Protestant Religion;</hi> and makes this
one principall motive (how truely, he taketh Heaven and Earth to witnesse) of his
present taking up of Armes? Will they (thinke you) spend their lives for King

of Gunpowder to blow up both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament?</hi> Will those secure his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty

Can those prove really royall to his Majesty and his Royall Posterity, who would have blowne up him and all his Royall House at once, even long before he had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity?

                     <hi>two yeares last past or more,</hi> have beene labouring with might and maine to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowne
his Majesty, and utterly extirpate the Protestant Religion by horrid conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
and force of Armes, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and are now there acting the last Scene of this
most barbarous bloudy Tragedy; likely to spend their dearest bloud in fighting for
the preservation of his Majesties Crowne and the Protestant cause in <hi>England,</hi> if
this onely be the reall quarrell, as is speciously pretended? Or will any of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
who within these three yeares, have by force of Armes, both in <hi>Catalonia,
Portugall,</hi> and elsewhere, revolted from, and cast off their allegiance to their owne most Catholicke King, to set up others of the same Religion in his Tribunall for
their greater advantage; put to their helping hands to establish his Majesty (the
most Protestant King) in his regall Throne, admit it were really, not fictitiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
to be shaken by the Parliament? Certainly, if the ground of this unnatural
warre be such as these ill Counsellors pretend, they would never be so farre besotted
as to make choyce of such unfitting Champions as Papists, for such a designe, who
are very well knowne to be the greatest enemies and malignants of all others, both
to King, Kingdome, Religion, Parliament, whose joynt destructions (what ever
these ill Counsellors pretend) is questionlesse the onely thing really intended by the Popish party in this warre, as the proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the introducing of foraine,
the raising of domestick Popish Forces, the disarming of Protestants, and Arming
Papists with their Harnesse, clearely demonstrate to all whom prejudice hath not
blinded.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may evidence to these pernicious Counsellors, and all the world, how
dangerous, how unsafe it is to his Majesty, to the Kingdome, to put Armes into
Papists hands, and make use of them to protect the Kings person, or Crowne; I
shall desire them to take notice both of the Papists traiterous Doctrine, and Practise,
in these three particulars they maintaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the Pope by a meere divine right, is the sole and supreme Monarch of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29602:9"/>
whole world, and all the Kingdomes in it, to dispose of them at his pleasure, to whom and when
he will, without giving any account of his actions. That all Emperours and Kings are but
his vassals, deriving, and holding their Crownes from him by base unworthy services, worse
then villenage; that they call, and repute them their Popes vassals, curs, packe-asses with Bels
about their neckes, and use them like such, if they offend the Pope. <hi>For full proofe whereof

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> alone without a Councell, may lawfully excommunicate, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
depose both Emperours, Kings, and Princes; and dispose of their Crownes and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
unto others; That it is meete and necessary he should excommunicate and deprive all
Kings, who are either Heretickes or Apostates (as they repute all protestant Princes) or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
of the Common-wealth: That as soone as such Princes are actually excommunicated,
or notoriously knowne to be Heretickes or Apostates, their Subjects are <hi>ipso facto</hi> absolved
from their governme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t, and Oathes of Allegiance whereby they were bound unto them; and
may, yea ought to take up Armes against them to deprive them of their Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That such hereticall, tyrannicall, oppressing Kings may be killed, poysoned, or
slaine by open force of Armes, not onely lawfully, but with glory and commendations;
That this is to be executed by Catholikes; and that it is not onely an heroicall, but merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
act, worthy the highest Encomiums; and a Saint-ship in the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender.</p>
                  <p>These two last propositions you may read abundantly proved by the words of
Popish writers, and forty examples of severall Emperours, Kings and Princes, which
Popes and Papists have excommunicated, deprived, violently assaulted and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

and for a King to be of more authority then his Kingdome, it were too absurd; Ergo, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought the Pope to be above the Church. In every well ordered Kingdome, it ought specially
to be desired, that the whole Realme should be of more authority then the King; which if it
happened contrary, were not to be called a Kingdome, but a Tyranny. And like as oftentimes
Kings, which doe wickedly governe the Common-wealth and expresse cruelty, are deprived of

set up another in his place, which shall sweare to rule and governe uprightly, and

the Greeke and Romane Emperours, and most Christian Kings, and States, and ours among
others:) That the Kingdome in Parliament Assembled, is above the King, as a Generall
Councell is paramount the Pope: <hi>which they manifest by five reasons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because Kings were first created and instituted by their Kingdomes and
people; not their Kingdomes and people by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because they were ordained onely for their Kingdomes and peoples
service and welfare, not their Kingdomes and people for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because their Kingdomes and people, as they at first created, so they
still limit and confine their royall Jurisdiction by Laws, to which they are and ought
to be subject.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because they oblige them by a solemne Oath, to rule according, and
to be obedient unto the Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, because they have power to depose them in case they contemne the Lawes,
and violently rob and spoyle their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>This then being the Doctrine of Papists concerning the Power and Superiority
of Parliaments, Peeres, and Kingdomes over their Kings, they have least ground of
all others, to taxe this Parliament or its Advocates, as guilty of Treason, and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
upon the Crowne, for a more moderate claime then this amounts to, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29602:10"/>
the King or his ill Counsell no ground to expect more moderation and loyalty
from Popish then Protestant Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that Popish Parliaments, Peeres, and Prelates have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
challenged and exercised a greater Jurisdiction over their Kings, then this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or any other, since the embracing of the Protestant Religion, ever claimed;
and doe in a great measure disclaime.</p>
                  <p>For, first of all, they have challenged and executed a just and legall power (as
they deemed it) to depose their Kings, for not governing according to Law; for
following and protecting evill Counsellours, and Officers; oppressing their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and making warre against them. This is evident, not onely by the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

                  <p>Secondly, our Popish Parliaments, Peeres and Prelates have oft translated the

so after <hi>William</hi> the Conquerors decease, <hi>Anno 1087. Robert</hi> the elder brother was
pretermitted, and <hi>William Rufus</hi> the younger brother crowned and established in the
Throne: After whose death <hi>Henry</hi> the first, his younger brother (though not next
heire) was elected King by the Clergy, Nobles and Commons, (<hi>who refused to admit
of any King but with capitulations and caveats to their owne liking) upon faire promises for
reforming bad and rigorous Lawes, remission of Taxes exacted on the Subjects, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the chiefe causers of them, and a solemne Oath to frame good Lawes, and ratifie
Saint Edwards Lawes;</hi> all which he really performed. So after the death of <hi>Richard
the first, Iohn Earle of Morton</hi> was established and crowned King, and his Nephew
<hi>Arthur,</hi> the right heire, disinherited. And he dying, his sonne <hi>Henry</hi> the third was
elected and crowned, and <hi>Lewis</hi> (made King in his fathers life by the Barons) remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
The like we finde in the case of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 4. K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. and <hi>Richard</hi> the third,
made Kings by Acts of Parliament, by our Popish Prelates and Nobles with the
Commons consent, upon unlawfull or doubtfull Titles, by way of usurpation,
and the right hereditary line put by. Such a transcendent power and jurisdiction as
this to disinherit the right heire and transferre the Crowne to whom they thought
meetest, neither the present nor any other Protestant Parliaments, Peeres or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ever exercised, though Popish Parliaments, Prelates, Lords, and Commons
have thus frequently done it; of which you may reade more in 25 <hi>H. 8. c. 22. 26

summoned Parliaments in the Kings name, and forced the King to call a Parliament
without and against his full consent. Thus</hi> Anno 1214.<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. Paris hist. p. 243. <hi>to</hi> 255. Daniel, p. 142, 143, 144.</note> 
                     <hi>the Barons petitioned
Kings</hi> Iohn <hi>to confirme</hi> Magna Charta <hi>and their Liberties tendered to him; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard them read, in great indignation asked;</hi> Why the Barons did not likewise
demand the Kingdome? <hi>and swore,</hi> that he would never grant those Liberties whereby
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29602:12"/>
himselfe should be made a servant: So harsh a thing is it (<hi>writes</hi> Daniel) to a power
that hath once gotten out into the wide liberty of his will, to heare againe of any reducing
within his circle: not considering, how those who inherit Offices succeed in the Obligation of
them, and that the most certaine meanes to preserve unto a King his kingdome, is to possesse them with the same conditions that he hath inherited them. <hi>The Barons hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
raise a great Army at</hi> Stamford, <hi>wherein were 2000. Knights besides Esquires,
constituting</hi> Robert Fitz-Walter <hi>their Generall, intituling him,</hi> the Marshall of the
Army of God and holy Church; seize upon the Kings Castles: and the Londoners sending
them a privie message to joyne with them, and deliver up the City to be guided by their discretion: thither they repaire, and are joyfully received under pact of their indempnity.
After which they sent Letters to the Earles, Barons, and Knights throughout England, who seemed (although fainedly) to adhere to the King, exhorting them with a commination, <hi>that
as they loved the indemnity of their goods and possessions, they should desert a
perjured King, and that adhering faithfully to them, they should with them stand
immovably, and effectually contend for the Liberties and peace of the kingdome.
which if they contemned to doe, they would with Armes and Banners displayed,
march against them as publike enemies, subvert their Castles, burne their houses, and
edifices, and not cease to destroy their Ponds, Parkes, and Orchards:</hi> Whereupon all
the Lords, Knights, and people deserting the King, who had scarce seven Knights in all
left with him, confederated themselves to the Barons. The King seeing himselfe generally
forsaken, counterfeits the Seales of the Bishops, and writes in their names to all Nations;
<hi>that the English were all turned Apostates, and whosoever would come to invade
them, he, by the Popes consent, would conferre upon them al their lands and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
But this devise working no effect in regard of the little credit they gave to and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
they had in the King, the truth being knowne, all men detested such wickednesses and
forgeries, and so the King fell into his owne snares; Hereupon the King fearing the Barons
would take all his Castles without any obstacle, though he conceived an inexorable hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them in his heart, yet he craftily dissembled, that he would make peace with them for
the present; ut cum furtim surrexisset, in dissipata agmina acrius se vindicaret; &amp; qui
in omnes non poterat, in singulos desaeviret. <hi>Wherefore sending</hi> William Marshall
Earle of Pembroke to them, with other credible messengers, he certified them, that for the good
of peace, and the exaltation and honour of his kingdome, he would gladly grant them the
Lawes and Liberties they desired; commanding the Lords by the same messengers that they
should provide a fit day and place, where they might meete and prosecute all these things:
Who related all these things deceitfully imposed on them, without fraud to the Barons at
<hi>London;</hi> who appointed the King a day to come and conferre with them in a Meade
betweene <hi>Stanes</hi> and <hi>Windsor,</hi> called <hi>Running-meade;</hi> on the 15. day of Iune. Where
both parties meeting at the day, and conferring, the King perceiving his forces too weake
for the Barons, who were innumerable, easily granted their subscribed Lawes and Liberties
without difficulty, and confirmed them with his Charter, Hand, Seale, Oath, Proclamations,
and other assurances, <hi>which you shall heare anon: This meeting</hi> Daniel <hi>and others

when <hi>France</hi> was in her flourishing Estate, and the Princes and Lords were of souple

and assured at certaine seasons of the yeare. For in times of Peace foure Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were holden yearely, or three at the least. And the same was used under the

by the Registers of the Court, that by hinderance of warre against the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Flemmings,</hi> there was not any Parliament during some yeares;) And the King
by his Ordinance, dated the Munday after Mid-lent, <hi>An.</hi> 1302. (set downe in the

his Subjects there should be every yeare two Parliaments at Paris, and in other Provinces;</hi> as

preached before the King, freely told him, <hi>That if he did not remove from him Peter Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Winchestor, and Peter de Rivallis (his malignant Counsellors) he could never be quiet:</hi>
And <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> a Clergy man also of a pleasant wit, seconding <hi>Roberts</hi> advise, told

with Horse and Armes (as now alas we see they doe) and not trusting the <hi>Peicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Faith (as we have now cause to mistrust the perfidious papists, and malignant
Cavaliers) and seeing no footsteps of peace (our present condition) refused to come
at the appointed day; sending the King word by solemne Messengers, <hi>that he should
without any delay remove Peter Bishop of Winchester, and the other Poictovines out of his
Court, which if he refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would drive him, with his wicked Counsellors, out of the Kingdome, and consult about creating
a new King.</hi> These things thus acted, the King was much dejected in mind, and all
his Court too, hanging downe their heads, and fearing not a little, lest the errors of
the Sonne should become worse then the Fathers errors, whom his Subjects indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to depose from his Royall Throne, almost detruded him to that name,

                  <p>But the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> with other his ill Counsellors, and <hi>Poictovine</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,

to be apprehended where ever they were within the kingdom: he likewise sends

himselfe discharged of that obligation by which he was tyed to the King,

better consideration, did againe promise and affirme; That by advise of his great
Councell, all that was amisse should be rectified and amended; And at the day and
place appointed, he holds a great conference with the Lords; But the evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
he followed, suffered him not to make good his promise. For when divers
there present, greatly in the Kings favour, with sundry Preachers and Fryers, whom
the King was wont to reverence and hearken to, <hi>Humbly beseeched, and earnestly exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the King to make peace with his Barons and Nobles,</hi> and to embrace them with due
affection,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments present case.</note> being his naturall Subjects, whom without any judgement by their Peeres
he had banished, destroying their Manours, Woods, Parkes, Ponds; and being
led and seduced by evill Counsels, lesse regarded his faithfull Subjects, (whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
blood would not permit them to bow downe) than Forainers; and which is
worse, called them Traytors, by whom he ought to settle the peace, order the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and dispose the affaires of his kingdome: The Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (offended
it seemes at Peeres) takes the word out of the Kings mouth, and answers; That
<hi>there are not Peeres in England, as in the Realme of France; and that therefore the King of
England, by such Iusticiars as himselfe pleaseth to ordaine, may banish any offenders out of the
Realme, and by judiciall processe condemne them.</hi> Which insolent speech the <hi>English</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
relished so harshly, that they presently with one voyce threatned to accurse
and excommunicate by name the Kings principall wicked Counsellers; of whom
<hi>Winchester being the foreman,</hi> appealed; whereupon they accursed (and I would our
Bishops would doe so now, if the <hi>God-dam-me Cavaliers</hi> accurse not themselves
sufficiently) all such as alienated the heart of the King from his Subjects, and all others
that perturbed the peace of the Realme; and so the hoped Accomodation vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
into greater discontents. Hereupon the Earle Marshall and other Lords with
their Forces, fell pell mell upon the Kings Army, slew divers of his Forrainers; and
in conclusion drew him to such straits, that enforced him to be capable of better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise:
Then <hi>Edmund</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> elect, with other suffragan Bishops,
bewailing the estate of the kingdome, presented themselves before the King at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
telling him as his loyall liegeman (and O that some Bishop or faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if there be any such about his Majesty, would now deale thus clearely with
him, touching his evill Counsellors!) <q>That the Counsell of <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
and his complices, which now he had and used, was not sound nor safe,
but evill and dangerous to himselfe and his Realme: First, for that they hated
and despised the <hi>English,</hi> calling them Traytors, turning the Kings heart from the
love of the people, and the hearts of the people from him, as in the Earle Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,
whom (being one of the worthiest men of the Land) by sowing false tales
they drave into discontentment. Secondly, that by the Counsell of the said <hi>Peter,</hi>
his Father King <hi>Iohn,</hi> first lost the hearts of his people, then <hi>Normandy,</hi> then other
lands, and finally wasted all his treasure, and almost <hi>England</hi> also, and never after
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29602:16"/>
had quiet. Thirdly, that if the Subjects had now beene handled according to Justice
and law, &amp; not by their ungodly Counsels, these present troubles had not hapned,
but the Kings lands had remained undestroyed, his treasure unexhausted. Fourthly,
that the Kings Councell is not the Councell of peace but of perturbation, because
they that cannot raise themselves by peace, must raise themselves by the troubles &amp;
dis-inherison of others. Fifthly, that they had the Treasure, Castles, Wardships, and
strength of the kingdome in their hands, which they insolently abused, to the
great hazard of the whole estate, for that they made no conscience of an Oath,
Law, Justice, or the Churches censures. Therefore we, O King, speake of these

beseech and admonish you, to remove such a Councell from about you; and (as
it is the usage in other Realmes) governe yours by the faithfull and sworne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
thereof. <hi>To which the King in briefe answered;</hi> That he could not suddainely
put off his Councell, and therefore prayed a short respite.<note n="*" place="margin">Speed lbid.</note> Nothing had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>preserved the King more,</hi> Than that he could without griefe forgoe any favorites,
if he were nearely pressed; the contrary quality whereof hath beene the cause of
finall desolation to so many Princes. For though choyce of Counsellers be for the
most part free, yet by common intendment they should be good; or how ever they
are, or are not; it is madnesse to hazard a Crowne, or lose the love of a whole
Nation, rather than to relinquish or diminish a particular dependance, for which
the publique must not be hazarded, nor subverted; The King therefore, in this
point not infortunate, commands Bishop <hi>Peter</hi> from his Court, to keepe residence
at his Cure, without once medling in State affaires, removes all his evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,
deprives them of their Offices, and puts good men in their places, and
commands all <hi>Poictovians</hi> and Foraine Forces to depart the Realme, receives all
his Nobles unto favour, restoring them to their lost Offices, Lands, Castles, admits
them into his Court and Councell; puts all his ill Counsellours, and Delinquent
Officers to their legall trials and fines. And for <hi>Peter Rivales,</hi> his Treasurer, he
was so incensed against him for his ill Counsell, that he sware he would plucke
out his eyes, were it not for reverence of his holy Orders.</q> And at his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Westminster</hi> the King sitting in person with his Justices upon the Bench,
and shooting <hi>Rivales</hi> through with an angry eye, spake thus to him. <q>O thou
Traytor, by thy wicked advise, I was drawne to set my Seale to those Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Letters, for the destruction of the Earle Marshall, the contents whereof were
to me unknowne; and by thine and such like Counsell, I banished my naturall
Subjects, and turned their mindes and hearts from me. By thy bad counsell and
thy complices, I was moved to make warre upon them to my irreparable losse, and
the dishonour of my Realme, in which enterprise I wasted my Treasure, and lost
many worthy persons, together with much of my Royall respect. Therefore, I
exact of thee an accompt, and thou shalt be carryed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> to
deliberate till I am satisfied.</q> And thus were these civill warres and differences
reconciled, ill Counsellors removed, enormities reformed, Delinquents punished,
(not without reducing store of coyne to the King) and peace established in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Which History, I have more largely recited, because most of its passages are
Parallel to the Kings, and his evill Counsellors present proceedings, on the one
hand, and to the Parliaments in some sort, on the other hand in the premises; and I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29602:16"/>
doubt not but they will prove parallels in the conclusion, to the terrour and just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of all ill counsellors, Cavalieres, and Delinquents, the contentment of all
good Subjects joy, and re-establishment of our peace in truth and righteousnesse.</p>

shut up, and guarded. The Parliament being begun, the Lords propounded sundry
Articles to the King, which they had immutably resolved on, to which they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his assent. The chiefe points whereof were these: <hi>That the King should firmely
keepe and conserve the Charter and Liberties of</hi> England, <hi>which King</hi> John <hi>his Father
made, granted, and ratified with an Oath, and which himselfe had so often granted, and
sworn to maintaine inviolable, and caused all the infringers of it, to be horribly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by all the Bishops of</hi> England, <hi>in his owne presence, and of all his Barons; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was one of the Excommunicators. That such a one should be made their Chiefe Iustice,

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:29602:17"/>
To these their necessary Counsels and provisions, they did frequently, and most
constantly, by way of advice, desire the King to condescend, swearing and giving
their mutuall Faith and hands one to another; That they would not desist to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
their purpose, neither for losse of money or Lands, nor love, nor hate; no nor
yet for life or death of them or theirs; till they had cleared <hi>England</hi> (to which
they and their forefathers were borne) from upstarts and aliens, and procured lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Lawes. The King hearing this, and that they came exquisitely armed that so
he and his aliens might be enforced, if they would not willingly assent, tooke his
corporall Oath (and his Sonne Prince <hi>Edward</hi> also) that he would submit to their
Counsels, and all those their Ordinances, for feare of perpetuall imprisonment;
The Lords having by an Edict, threatned death to all that resisted: Which done, all
the Peeres and Prelates took their Oath; To be faithfull to this their Ordinance; and
made all who would abide in the Kingdome, to swear they would stand to the triall
of their Peeres; the Arch-Bishops and Bishops solemnely accursing all that should
rebell against it. And <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>Romans,</hi> the Kings younger brother comming

taken from him against the Kings will, and given to</hi> Thomas Arundell <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ely;
Whereupon both the Houses gave halfe a tenth and halfe a fifteene, <hi>to be disposed of
as the Lords thought fit, for the defence of the Realme.</hi> The Parliament was no sooner
dissolved, but the King recals <hi>de la Pole</hi> and other ill Counsellors to the Court, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them greater favour then before: In so much that at <hi>Christmas,</hi> the King made
<hi>de la Pole sit at his owne table, not in the usuall garment of a Peere, but of a Prince, out of
a stomacke and hatred against the Peeres, whom from thenceforth be never regarded but fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly,
and then fals to plot the death of the Duke of</hi> Glocester <hi>and other Nobles, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his ill Counsellors;</hi> For which purpose he appoints a meeting at <hi>Nottingham
Castle, with a few persons generally ill-beloved, ill-adwised, and ill-provided.</hi> The course
agreed upon by the King and that ill-chosen Senate was, first, to have the opinion of
all the chiefe Lawyers; (who saith <hi>Speed, seldome faile Princes in such turnes</hi>) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
certaine Articles of Treason, within whose nets they presumed the reforming
Lords were; and if the Lawyers concluded those Articles contained Treasonable
matters, then umder a shew of justice they should be proceeded against accordingly.
The Lawyers (who were the very men, which in the last Parliament, gave advice to
the Lords to do as they did) now meeting were demanded: <hi>Whether by the Law of the
Land, the King might not disanull the Decrees of the last Parliament?</hi> They joyntly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>he might, because he was above the Lawes;</hi> (a most apparent errour) confessing;
<hi>that themselves had in that Parliament decreed many things, and given their judgement, that
all was according to Law, which they acknowledged to be altogether unlawfull.</hi> The King
thus informed, appointeth a great Councell at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and withall sends for the Sheriffes of Shires, to raise Forces against the Lords; who denyed, saying, <hi>that they could not raise any competent forces or Armes against them, the whole Counties were so
addicted to their favours;</hi> and being further willed; <hi>to suffer no Knights to be chosen
for their Shires, but such as the King and his Councell should name;</hi> they answered; that
the election belonged to the Commons, who favored the Lords in all, and would keepe their usuall
customes; (a good precedent for our present Sheriffes) whereupon they were
dismissed. Then were the Lawyers and Judges (<hi>Robert Trefilian</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
called before the King, to determine the judgements of Treasons against the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29602:19"/>
Lords to be legall and to set their Seales thereto, which they did: Meane time the
King and Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> sent messengers to hire what Forces they could, <hi>That they
might stand with them if need were against the Lords in the day of battle:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Note this.</note> 
                     <hi>Many of which
answered, that they neither could nor would stand against the Lords, whom they knew for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
intimately to love the King, and to endevour all things, study all things, doe all things
for his honour: yet many out of simplicity, thinking themselves to be hired, promised to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
upon the Kings notice:</hi> The Lords hearing of these proceedings were much sadded;
<hi>being conscious to themselves of no guilt worthy the Kings so great indignation.</hi> The Duke of
<hi>Glocester</hi> sent his purgation upon Oath by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> to the King; who
inclining to credit the same, was in an evill houre diverted by <hi>De la Pole.</hi> The Duke
hereupon makes his and their common danger knowne to the rest of the Lords: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they severally gather Forces, that they might present their griefes to the
King; How he favoured Traytors, not onely to them, but to the Publique, to the
imminent danger of the Realme, unlesse it were speedily prevented. The King on
the other side (by Trayterous Counsellours advise) sought how to take them off
single, before they were united: but in vaine, by reason their party was so great.
Meane time, some peaceable men procured, that the Lords should repaire safe to
<hi>Westminster,</hi> and there be heard. Thither approaching, they are advertised by some,
(who had sworne on the Kings behalfe for good dealing to be used during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim)
that in the <hi>Mewes</hi> by <hi>Charing-Crosse,</hi> a thousand armed men (which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings privity Sir <hi>Thomas Trivet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Brambre</hi> knights, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have laid for their destruction) attended in ambush. The King sweares
his innocency, promising safe conduct to the Lords if they would come; who
thereupon came strongly guarded, and would trust no longer. The King sitting in
Royall State in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall; the Lords present themselves upon their knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: and being required by the Lord Chancellor; Why they were in warlike
manner assembled at <hi>Haring gye Parke,</hi> contrary to the Lawes? their joynt answer
was: <hi>That they were assembled for the good of the King and kingdome, and to weed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, such Traytors as he continually held with him;</hi> The Traytors they named to be-
<hi>Robert de Vere,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland; Alexander Nevill,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke; Michael

Brambre,</hi> that false knight of <hi>London,</hi> with others: To prove them such, <hi>They threw
downe their Gloves, as gages of challenge for a triall by the Sword.</hi> The King hereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
as knowing they were all hidden out of the way; <hi>This shall not be done so, but
at the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>xt Parliament</hi> (which shall be the morrow after Candlemas) <hi>all parties shall
receive according as they deserve.</hi> And <hi>now to you my Lords; How or by what authority durst
you presume to levy Forces against me in this Land? did you thinke to have terrified mee by
such your presumption? Have not I men and armes, who</hi> (if it pleased me) <hi>could environ
and kill you like sheepe? Certainely in this respect I esteeme of you all no more than of the basest
Scullions in my kitchins.</hi> Having used these, and many like high words, he tooke up
his Unckle the Duke from the ground, where he kneeled, and bade all the other
rise. The rest of the conference was calme, and the whole deferred till the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
then shortly to be holden at <hi>Westminster.</hi> In the meane time (that the
world might see, how little able the King was to equall his words with deeds) a
Proclamation was set forth, in which the King (before any tryall) cleareth the
Lords of Treason, names tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e persons for unjust accusers, whom the Lords had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29602:19"/>
before nominated. The Lords neverthelesse thought not good to sever themselves,
but kept together for feare of the worst; which fell out for their advantage: For
the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> (with the Kings privity, such was his false dissimulation) had
gathered a power in <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Cheshire:</hi> which they intercepting neare <hi>Burford</hi> and
<hi>Bablecke,</hi> slew Sir <hi>William Molineux,</hi> leader of the <hi>Cheshire</hi> men, and made the Duke
to flye in great feare. Among the Dukes carriages was found (as the devill, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God would have it) certaine Letters of the Kings to the said Duke, by which
their Counsels were plainely discovered. The Lords hereupon march with speed
up to <hi>London,</hi> having an Army of forty thousand men, the Lord Mayor and City
doubtfull whether to displease the King or Lords, upon consultation receive the
Lords into the City, and supply their Army with provisions in the Suburbs; Which
the King hearing of, seemed to slight them, saying;<note n="*" place="margin">Note the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and policy of protracting.</note> 
                     <hi>Let them lye here till they have
spent all their goods, and then they will returne poore and empty to their houses, and then I shall
speake with and judge them one after another,</hi> The Lords hearing this, were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved, and swore, <hi>They would never remove thence, till they had spoken with him face
to face.</hi> And forthwith sent some to guard the Thames, lest the King should slip out
of their hands, and then scoffe at them. The King being then in the Tower, and
seeing himselfe every way encompassed, sent a message to the Lords, that he would
treat with them; who thereupon desired him, <hi>That he would come the next day to West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,
where they would declare their desire to him:</hi> The King replyed, <hi>That he would not
treat with them at Westminster, but in the Tower.</hi> To which the Lords answered, <hi>That
it was a suspicious place, because traines might there be laid for them, and dangers prepared
to destroy them;</hi> Whereupon the King sent word, <hi>They should send thither two hundred
men or more, to search and view all places, lest any fraud should lye hid.</hi> Upon which the
Lords repaired to the Tower, and in the Kings Bed-chamber, laid open to him brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all his conspiracy, in causing them indirectly to be indicted; <hi>They object to him
his mutability, and underhand working, producing his owne Letters to the Duke of Ireland,
to raise an Army to destroy them; together with the French packets they had intercepted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appeared he had secretly practised to flye with the Duke of Ireland into France, to deliver
up Callice to the French Kings possession, and such pieces as the Crowne of England held in those
parts; whereby his honour might diminish, his strength decay, and his fame perish.</hi> The
King seeing this, knew not what to doe, especially because he knew himselfe nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
depressed. At last craving leave, they left him confounded and shedding teares,
yet upon condition, that he should come to <hi>Westminster</hi> the next day, where hee
should heare more, and treate of the necessary affaires of the kingdome; Which he
promised to doe, retaining the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> to sup with him. But before he
went to bed (O the ficklenesse of weake Princes, and faithlessenesse of their royall
words and Protestations!) some whisperers telling him, that it was not decent, safe,
nor honourable for the King to goe thither, he changed his resolution. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
hearing this, were very sad, and discontented, and thereupon sent him word,
<hi>That if he came not quickely according to appointment, they would chuse them another King,
who both would and should obey the Counsell of his Peeres.</hi> The King strucke with this
dart, came the next day to <hi>Westminster,</hi> there attending his Nobles pleasures. To
whom (after few discourses) the Nobles said; <hi>That for his honour, and the benefit of
his kingdome, all Traytors, whisperers, flatterers, evill instruments, slanderers, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
persons should be banished out of his Court and company, and others substituted in their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29602:20"/>
places, who both knew how, and would serve him more honourably and faithfully.</hi> Which
when the King had granted (though with sorrow) they thought fit that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Nevill Archbishop of Yorke, Iohn Fordham, Bishop of Durham,</hi> with sundry other
Lords, knights, and Clergy men should be removed and kept in strait prison, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
such accusations as should be objected against them the next Parliament. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they were apprehended forthwith and removed from the Court: After the
feast of <hi>Purification,</hi> the Parliament (much against the Kings will, who would have
shifted it off at that time) began at <hi>London.</hi> The first day of the Session, <hi>Fulthorpe,</hi>
and all the rest of the Judges were arrested, <hi>as they sate in judgement on the Bench;</hi> and
most of them sent to the Tower: <hi>for that having first over-ruled the Lords with their
Counsels and direction, which they assured them to be according to Law, they afterward at
Nottingham, gave contrary judgement to what themselves had determined formerly. Tresili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
the chiefe Justice prevented them by flight, but being apprehended and brought
backe to the Parliament in the forenoone, had sentence to be drawne to Tiburne
in the afternoone, and there to have his Throate cut, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>The King seeing these proceedings, by advise of his ill Counsellors,<note n="*" place="margin">Graft. p 348, 349. 150, 151.</note> absented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from his Parliament, and sent <hi>Michael de la Pole</hi> then Lord <hi>Chancellor, to demand
foure fifteenes in his name, of the Commons, for that without lesse he could not maintaine his
estate and outward warre.</hi> To which the body of the Parliament made answer; <hi>that
without the King were present, they would make therein no answer; and that unlesse the King
would remove him from his Chancellorship, they would no further meddle with any Act this
Parliament.</hi> The King upon this sent to the Commons, <hi>that they should send to Eltham,</hi>
(where he then lay,) 40. <hi>of the wisest and best learned of the Commons, who in the name
of the whole House should declare unto him their minde,</hi> Upon which message the House
were in more feare then before; for there went a talke, <hi>that the King intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
divers of them, which followed not his minde, either that way, or at a banquet appointed to
be made purposely at</hi> London, <hi>if</hi> Nicholas Exton <hi>the Mayor of</hi> London <hi>would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
thereunto; at which time the Duke of</hi> Glocester <hi>should have beene taken.</hi> Wherefore
the Lords and Commons assembled together, agreed with one assent, <hi>that the Duke
of Glocester, and Bishop of Ely, should in the name of the whole Parliament be sent to the King
to Eltham;</hi> which was done, and the King well pleased that they should come. When
they came into his presence they most humbly saluted him, and said. <q>Most high

                        </gap>e Lord, the Lords and Commons of this your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
assembled, with most humble subjection unto your most royall Majesty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
your most gracious favour; so that they may live in tranquillity and peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you, to the pleasure of God and wealth of the Realme. On whose behalfe we
also shew unto you, that one old statute and landable custome is approved, which
no man can deny; That the King our Soveraigne Lord may once in the yeare law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
summon his high Court of Parliament, and call the Lords and Commons
thereunto, as to that which is the highest Court of this Realme: In which Court
all equity and justice must shine, even as the Sunne when it is at the highest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
poore and rich may take refreshing: where also must be reformed all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
wrongs, exactions and enormities within the Realme, and there to
consult with the wise men for the maintenance of the Kings estate. And if it might
be knowne that any persons within the Realme or without intended the contrary,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29602:20"/>
there also must be devised how such evill weeds might be destroyed. There also must
be studyed and soreseene, that if any charge doe come upon the King and his
Realme, how it may be well and honourably supported and sustained. Hitherto
it is thought by the whole Realme, that your Subjects have lovingly demeaned
themselves to you, in ayding you with substance to the best of their powers; and
they desire to have knowledge, how and by whom these goods be spent. One thing
resteth yet to declare in their behalfe unto you:<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Nota.</hi> The King should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once in forty dayes.</note> how that by an old Ordinance,
they have an Act, if the King absent himselfe forty dayes not being sicke, but of
his owne minde (not heeding the charges of his people, nor their great paines)
will not resort to his Parliament; they then may lawfully returne home to their
houses:</q> And now Sir, you have beene absent a longer time, and yet refuse to come
amongst us; which greatly is our discomfort: (And our Parliaments present case.)
To this the King answered by these words: <hi>Well, we doe consider that the people and
Commons goe to rise against us; wherefore we thinke we can doe no better than to aske ayde of
our Cosin the French King, and rather submit us to him, than to our owne Subjects.</hi> The
Lords answered: <hi>Sir, that Counsell is not best, but a way rather to bring you into danger.
For it is well knowne, that the French King is your ancient enemy, and your greatest adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
and if he set foot once within your Realme, he will rather dispoyle you, invade you, and
depose you from your estate Royall, than put any hand to helpe you, &amp;c. And as that King
cannot be poore that hath rich people; so cannot he be rich that hath poore Commons. And all
these inconveniences be come by the evill Counsell which are about you. And if you put not your
helping hand to the redresse of the premises, this Realme of England shall be brought to nought
and utter ruine, which clearely shou'd be laid to your default, and in your evill Counsell: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in the time of your Father, this Realme throughout all the world was highly esteemed,
and nothing ordered after these wayes. Wherefore we be sent unto you to exhort you to sequester
all such persons as might be the occasion of ruine either of you or else of your Realme.</hi> By these
good perswasions the King was appeased, <hi>and promised within three dayes after to come
to the Parliament, and to condescend to their Petitions; And according to his appointment he
came.</hi> Where soone after <hi>Iohn Fordham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> was discharged of the

the time of this Parliament, the King received a guard of 4000. Archers, all <hi>Cheshire</hi>
men, as if he would have gone in battle against enemies, so that divers came armed
to the Parliament out of feare. These <hi>Cheshire</hi> men were rude and beastly people,

                     <hi>that they accounted the King to be their fellow, and

And if any man presumed to complaine to the King of them, he was soone rid out
of the way, no man knew why, nor by whom, so that in effect they did what they
listed. In this Parliament the King <hi>having made the Speaker, and a great part of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
proud, ambitious men of the Commons House to be of his side, to act what he required
them; he then prevailed likewise with the Upper House, first with the Prelates, then with the
Lords, more out of feare of him, then any reason;</hi> by meanes whereof the Commission,
Charters of pardon, and Acts made in Parliament in the 10. and 11. yeares of his

odious to his people, that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> landing in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>whole

which the Laity gave him the ninth, and the Clergy the tenth penny of their goods.

                     <hi>Writers, that a generall Councell once lawfully summoned by
the Pope and met, cannot be dissolved by him againe at his pleasure, without the Councels
consent, before all the Churches affaires be therein setled: Vpon which resolution these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
continued together and deposed sundry Popes notwithstanding their Buls to dissolve them,
to keepe themselves in their chaires.</hi> This is apparent; first by the Ancient Treatise, <hi>Of
the manner of holding Parliaments in England:</hi> which informes us; <hi>That the first
day of the Parliament, publike Proclamations ought to be made in the City or Towne where
the Parliament is kept; That all those who would deliver Petitions or Bils to the Parliament,
should deliver them in a certaine time: That the Parliament should not depart so long as any
Petition made thereto hangeth undiscussed or undecided, or at the least to which there is not
made a determinate answer: the Kings Majesty being desirous of his grace and favour to
give the Subject redresse of any injury, not to suffer his people to goe unsatisfied. Hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
of the Parliament</hi> OUGHT TO BE <hi>in such manner. First,</hi> IT OUGHT
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29602:23"/>
TO BE <hi>demanded, yea and publickely proclaimed in the Parliament, and within the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of the Parliament, whether there be any that hath delivered a Petition to the Parliament,
and hath not received answer thereto? If there be none such, it is supposed that every one is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed,
or else answered unto at the least, So far forth as by Law it may be. And then all may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</hi>
Hence it was, that in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. c. 16, 17, 18, 19. Divers Petitions not read nor answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Parliament, by reason of shortnesse of time, and not determined sitting the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
were by special Acts of Parliament referred to divers Lords and Commons,
to examine, answer, and plainely determine all matters contained in the said Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
as they should thinke best by their good advise and discretion; even out of
Parliament; which they heard and determined accordingly, and made binding
Acts thereupon, as appeares by the Statutes themselves. This Doctrine was very
well knowne to <hi>King Iohn, Henry</hi> the 3. <hi>Edward the 2. Richard</hi> the 2. <hi>Henry</hi> the 6.
and <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. the Parliaments which opposed, and deposed most of them, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and continuing sitting, both before and after their deposing, sore against their
wills, as the fore-remembred histories manifest; else no doubt they would have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up all these Parliaments at their pleasure, and never permitted such Acts and
Judgements to passe against themselves, Favorites, ill Counsellours, pretended Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
had they lawfull power to dissolve them, summoned in their names, or
the Parliaments actually determined by their depositions, or resignations, as we find
they did not, and none ever yet held they did. King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. fearing the losse
of his Crowne, or some restraints by Lawes, in the 11. yeare of his Reigne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
this question among others, to his Judges at <hi>Nottingham</hi> Castle; which (for
ought I finde) was never doubted before.<note n="b" place="margin">

thence or not?</hi> Whereunto it was of one minde answered, <hi>That he may: And if any
would proceed in the Parliament against the Kings will, he is to be punished as a Traytor.</hi>
For which opinion and others, some of these Judges and Lawyers (as <hi>Tresilian</hi>

his highest Court, and grand <hi>Councell of the Realme,</hi> the Parliament, or disable them
to fit to redresse the kingdomes and Subjects severall grievances, or secure the Realm
from danger; Which if he might lawfully doe at his pleasure, without the Houses
joynt assents, there would necessarily follow, not onely a deferring and deniall, but
likewise a fayler of Justice in the highest Court of Justice; which these Acts disable
the King (who is so farre inferior to the Law, that he cannot so much as delay the
smallest proceedings of it in any Court or Session, by his supreame power, by any
meanes whatsoever) to effect in his meanest Courts, much lesse then in the greatest;
from whence the subversion of Lawes, Liberty, Justice, and the whole Realme would
ensue. If any therefore cavill at the <hi>Act for continuance of this Parliament, till both

when they meete, shall not be dissolved without their consents for fifty dayes space next after

on the Crowne, but an ancient Priviledge of Parliament, both claimed, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
and resolved in times of Popery, in an higher degree then now it is. And
thus you see how in these particulars, the Popish Parliament, Prelates, Lords and
Commons in former times, have claimed and exercised farre greater Priviledges and
Jurisdictions, than this or any other Protestant Parliament hath hitherto claimed
or practised: which I hope, will forever silence the clamourous tongues of all ill
Counsellours, Courtiers, Royalists, Malignants, Papists, and Cavaliers against
the present Parliament, of whose highest (yet moderate) proceedings, themselves
alone have beene the occasions, and therefore (of all others) have least cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:29602:24"/>
and tends much to the vindication both of the <hi>Priviledges, Honour, and Iurisdictions
of our High Court of Parliament,</hi> (now so much undervalued, because not really known
to most) and to the justification of the proceedings in this present Parliament, which
many out of ignorance and malice so much declaime against both by word and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in a most licentious manner; I shall take a little liberty to demonstrate the
truth of it, by such convincing reasons and Authorities, as no rationall man (I hope)
shall be able to contradict, but must necessarily submit to.</p>
                  <p>First, it is undeniable that<note n="e" place="margin">

all the Kings Patents, Charters, Commissions, Proclamations, Grants, Warrants, Writs,
and Commitments whatsoever, whether they be Legall; yea to cancell or repeale them in case
they be illegall, mischievous, or onerous to the Subject, not onely without but against the Kings
consent, and mandate to the contrary;</hi> as appeares by infinite precedents in this and all
foremer Parliaments, the scourges of Monopolists, Patentees and Projectors, the Pests
of the Commonwealth. The like power have all other Courts of Justice within the
kingdome in some degree, when such Charters and Writs of the King are brought
judicially before them, because they are Courts of the <hi>Law, to which the King and
all his Actions are and must be subject.</hi> Now that which can thus question, cancell, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull,
revoke the Kings owne Royall Charters, Writs, Commissions, Patents, &amp;c.
though ratified with the Great seale and regall power, even against his will, must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
be a Soveraigne power and Authority, which in point of Law and Justice
is superiour to the King. This is <hi>Bractons</hi> resolution, <hi>l. 2. c. 16. f. 34. a,</hi> and <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taesl.

even against his personall, though not legall Will, which is the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is unquestionably true, that in all cases of difference betweene the
King, and all or any of his Subjects, though they concerne the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi>
and the highest branches thereof, the Parliament is the supreamest and most proper
Judge, and its resolution (from which there is no appeale to any higher tribunall)
shall finally binde not onely all the Subjects, but the King himselfe, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his owne personall disassent. This is manifest by the many late resolutions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Knight-hood and Taxes, the Commission of Array,</hi> and the like, which obliege both
King and Subject; the <hi>King in receiving justice, in such cases, being subject to the Law as

and for them. Now as every Creator, is of greater power and authority than its creature, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29602:25"/>
every cause greater then its effect: So the Authority and power of the people which creates the
Prince and Princely power, and augments or limits it as there is cause, must needs be greater,
then the Prince or royall power. Who though he be greater than any private subject or magistrate,
over whom he rules; yet he is still inferiour to all the people and kingdome, whose Servant or

Foraine Authorities in this point, which are infinite; I shall onely acquaint you

                  <p>
                     <hi>Andrew Horne,</hi> an eminent Lawyer in <hi>Edward</hi> the first his Reigne, in his <hi>Myrrour
of Iustices;</hi> Chap. 1. Sect. 2. p. 7, 8, 9. writes thus of the originall institution of our
English Monarches. <hi>After that God had abated the Nobility of the Britaines, who rather
used force than right, he delivered it to the most humble and simple of all the neighbour Nations,
the Saxons; who came from Germany to conquer it, of which Nation there have beene forty
Kings, all which held themselves to have</hi> COMPANIONS. <q>These Princes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this Land <hi>England,</hi> which before was named <hi>Greater Britaine.</hi> These after great
warres, elected from among them a King to Reigne over them, to governe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and to maintaine and defend their persons and goods in peace, by the
Rules of Law (or Right:) And at the beginning they caused the King to sweare,
that he will maintaine the holy Christian faith to the utmost of his power, and
guide his people by Law, without respect to any person, and shall be obedient to
suffer (or undergoe) Law, as well as others of his people. And afterwards this
Realme was turned to an heritage, according to the number of the Companions,
who divided the Realme into 38. Counties, and delivered each one a County to
keepe and defend from Enemies, according to every ones estate. And although
the King ought to have no Peeres in the Land, yet because if the King of his owne
wrong should offend against any of his people, neither he, nor any his Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
can be both Judge and Party; OF RIGHT IT BEHOVES, that
the King should have COMPANIONS, for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whose Vicar he is on earth, when be came to redeeme mankinde, made choyse of this way especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to destroy the workes of the Devill, using not the strength of his power, but the reason of his
justice, and so would be</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> under the Law, that he might redeeme those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

some of greater, others of lesser power; some elective, others successive; proceeding
meerely from the peoples free consents and institution, and that the ancient <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Aethiopian,</hi> and other Kings, were subject to, and not above their Lawes, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sundry passages out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> concerning the originall of kingdomes. <hi>Chap.</hi>
13. He proceeds thus: <q>A People that will raise themselves into a kingdome or
other Politique body, must ever appoint one to be chiefe Ruler of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
which in kingdomes is called a King. In this kinde of Order, as out of an
<hi>Embryo</hi> ariseth a body naturall, ruled by one head, because of a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
associated by the consent of Lawes, and communion of wealth, ariseth a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which is a body mysticall, governed by one man as by an head. And like
as in a naturall body, the heart is the first that liveth, having within it blood,
which it distributeth among the other members, whereby they are quickned;
semblably in a body Politique, THE INTENT OF THE PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE
is THE FIRST LIVING THING, having within it blood;
that is to say, Politique provision for the Utility and wealth of the same people;
which it dealeth forth and imparteth AS WELL TO THE HEAD as
to the Members of the same body, whereby the body is nourished and maintained,
&amp;c. Furthermore, the Law under which a multitude of men is made a people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth
the forme of sinews in the body naturall; because that like as by sinews
the joyning of the body is made sound; so by the Law, (which taketh the name
<hi>a Ligando,</hi> from binding) such a Mysticall body is knit and preserved together,
and the members and bones of the same body, (whereby is represented the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the wealth, whereby that body is sustained) doe by the Lawes, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
body by sinewes, retaine every one their proper function. And as the head
of a body naturall cannot change his Sinewes, nor cannot deny nor with-hold
from his inferiour members, cheir proper powers, and severall nourishments of
blood: SO NEITHER CAN THE KING (who is the head of the
Politique body) CHANGE THE LAWES OF THAT BODY,
nor with-draw from the said people THEIR PROPER SUBSTANCE
AGAINST THEIR WILLS OR CONSENTS. For such a
King of a kingdome politique, is made and ordained for THE DEFENCE
OF THE LAWES OF HIS SUBJECTS, and of their bodies
and goods. WHEREUNTO HE RECEIVETH POWER OF
HIS PEOPLE, SO THAT HEE CANNOT GOVERNE
HIS PEOPLE BY ANY OTHER LAW. <hi>Chap. 14. be addes,</hi> No
Nation did ever of their owne voluntary minde incorporate themselves into a
kingdome FOR ANY OTHER INTENT, BUT ONELY TO
THE END, that they might thereby with MORE SAFETY THEN
BEFORE MAINETAINE THEMSELVES, and enjoy THEIR
Goods free from such misfortunes and losses as they stood in feare of. And of
this intent should such a Nation be defrauded utterly, IF THEIR KING
MIGHT SPOYLE THEM OF THEIR GOODS, WHICH
BEFORE WAS LAWFULL FOR NO MAN TO DOE.
And yet should such a people be much more injured, if they should afterwards be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29602:26"/>
governed by Foraine and strange Lawes, and such peradventure as they deadly
hated and abhorred, and most of all, if by those Lawes their substance should be
diminished; for the safeguard whereof, as also for their honour, and of their
owne bodies, THEY OF THEIR OWNE FREEWILL
SUBMITTED THEMSELVES TO THE GOVERNE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT
OF A KING. NO SUCH POWER FREELY
COULD HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THEM; and yet IF
THEY HAD NOT BEENE, SUCH A KING COULD
HAVE HAD NO POWER OVER THEM.</q> And <hi>Chap. 36. f.</hi>
86. He concludes thus. <q>The King of <hi>England,</hi> neither by himselfe nor his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
imposeth no Tallages, Subsidies or any other burthens on his Lieges, or
changeth their Lawes, or make new ones without the concession or assent OF

there were no Prelates or Barons of the Parliament, and the temporall Lords were very

owne person, and speaketh in the behalfe of himselfe alone. But in the Knights, Citizens,
and Burgesses are represented the Commons of the whole Realme, and every of these giveth not
consent onely for himselfe, but for all those also for whom be is sent. And the King with the
consent of his Commons had ever a sufficient and full authority, to make, ordaine, and establish

good and wholesome Lawes for the Commonwealth of his Realme. Wherefore the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

defence of the kingdome or People, yet the kingdome and people may remaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and another succeed him in that office of trust, (In which respect a Politique
body differs from a Naturall, that it hath life, continuance, and meanes to guide,
defend, and Order it selfe, though the King and head be cut off by death.) But if
the Realme and People be destroyed, though the King survive them</hi> as a Man, <hi>yet
he must necessarily perish in and with them</hi> as a King, <hi>since he cannot possibly be a
King without a kingdome and people; for whose good and safety alone he was
made a King. Hence</hi> Aristotle, Polit. l. 3. c. 4. <hi>and</hi> Marius Salamonius, de Principatu, l. 2.
p. 50. <hi>define a Principality, to be</hi> A just Government for the benefit of the people, respecting
onely the publique good and welfare, not its owne private advantage. <hi>Hence</hi> Plato de Repub.
l. 1. <hi>thus describes the Office of a Prince towards the Common-wealth.</hi> That as he
is a Prince, he neither mindes nor commands what is advantagious to himselfe, but what is
beneficiall to his Subjects; and whatever he saith or doth, he saith and doth it for the profit and
honour of the Republicke; <hi>which</hi> Cicero <hi>in his Offices hath more elegantly thus transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi>
As the defence, so the procuration of the Common-weale is to be managed to be benefit
of those who are committed, not of those to whom it is committed. <hi>And</hi> de Finibus l. 3. A good
and wise man, not ignorant of his civill Office, is more carefull of the utility of all, than of

made principally and solely for the Subjects benefit, if good; their prejudice, if ill:
therefore the whole Kingdome (represented in and by both Houses, not the King)
knowing much better what is good or bad for themselves, than the King alone, it

                  <p>This is the ground of that notable Rescript of the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

                  <p>Fifthly, It is cleare, that all Acts which give any Subsidie, Taxes, Penalties, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faitures

Acts of the Parliament and Courts themselves, which are lawfull; not of the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

out of the Realme; all good and binding Lawes, as appeares by 28 H. 8. c. 17.
which altered, and 33 H. 8. c. 22, which declareth the Law in these particulars. A
cleare demonstration, that the Parliament is the most absolute Supreame power, and
Law-giver, not the King.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, The King hath little or no hand in making, but onely in assenting
to Lawes, when they are made by the Houses; as the usuall forme of passing Acts
<hi>(Le Royle veult, The King wills (or assents to) it,</hi> not before, but after they have
passed both Houses, imports: which assent of his, if the Bils be publike and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Common good, is not meerely arbitrary at the Kings will, but the
King by Oath and duty is bound to give it, and the Lords and Commons may in
justice demand it of meere right, as I shall shew anon. His Royall assent then, though
it be the last act which compleates Bils, and makes them Lawes, yet since it is but
an assent to a Law formerly made by both Houses, which he cannot alter in any
point: Yea, an assent, which the King in Honour, Law, Justice, Duty, by vertue of
his Coronation Oath, is bound to give, as appeares by the Prefaces of most Statutes,
the Statute of <hi>Provisours,</hi> 25 E. 3. Parl. 6. 20 E. 3. and other Acts) it is so farre from
proving the King the Supreame power and Law-giver, that it manifests the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that this power principally resides in both the Houses, not the King.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, The kingdomes Soveraignty and supreame jurisdiction above the
King is most apparent by those Coronation Oathes, which Parliaments and the
kingdome anciently, long before, or at leastwise in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, before and
ever since the Conquest, have prescribed to our Kings ere they would accept of them
for their Soveraignes, of which I shall give you a short account.</p>

to feare God: to love and observe his Commandements, and cause them to be observed through
his whole kingdome: He ought also to set up good Lawes and customes, such as be wholesome
and approved, such as be otherwise, to repeale them and thrust them out of his kingdome.</hi> Item,
<hi>he ought to doe Iustice and Iudgement in his kingdome, by the counsell of the Nobles of his
Realme. All these things ought the King in his owne person to doe, taking his Oath upon the
Evangelists, and the blessed Reliques of Saints; swearing in the presence of the whole State
of his Realme (as well of the temporalty as of the spiritualty) before he be Crowned of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
and Bishops. Three servants the King ought to have under him as Vassals, fleshly lust,

would establish and observe</hi> RIGHTEOUS LAWES; <hi>and that he would utterly

but as a regular Prince submitted himselfe to the Orders of the kingdome; desirous

part, the ancient Lawes of the Land, and introduce new hard Lawes of his owne, written in the
Norman tongue, which the people understood not, and the Iudges wrested at their pleasures,
to the forfeiture of Goods, Lands, Life. Hereupon the Nobility and Natives, seeking to cast off
these snares and fetters of his Lawes, set up Edgar Atheling for their King and Generall once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
&amp; fell into a new conspiracy, raising great forces, &amp; resolving to make the sword their judge.</hi>
The <hi>King hereupon by Lanfrankes advise, who as Rehoboams sages, gave him counsell, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to beare with their abuses, rather than hazard the ruine of all in fight, appointed a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at Berkhamsteed, Anno 1172. Where the King entring parley with the English Nobility,
did so farre winde himselfe into their good opinions, that they all forthwith laid downe their
weapons. And he for his part fearing to lose the Crowne with shame, which he had gotten with
effusion of so much blood, gave his Oath upon the holy Evangelists, and the reliques of Saint
Albane the Martyr</hi> (the same being ministred to him by Abbot <hi>Fredericke) swearing
to observe, and inviolably to keepe the ancient Lawes of this Land, and most especially those
compiled by King Edward the Confessor;</hi> though (as the event soone shewed) he little
meant to doe as he promised. Peace thus established; this conference ended, and the
Kings Oath received, the <hi>English</hi> Armies disband themselves, as dreaming they had
now good fortune by the foote, and hoping the greatest stormes of their dangers
were past; which presently proved but a vaine surmise. For King <hi>William</hi> having

and be indeed some choyce man, and picked out for some eminency of his vertues, according to the
example and similitude of Saul the first anointed King, whom God set over his people, though
neither the Sonne of a King nor of any royall descent. So after him likewise David the son of
Iesse; the one for being valorous, and a person fitting Royall dignity, the other for being holy
and humble minded. To shew, that whosoever in a kingdome excelleth all in valour and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
ought to surmount all in Rule and Authority: yet so, as that, if any of the Of-spring of
a deceased King surpasseth others, it is fit joyntly to consent in election of such a one. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29602:34"/>
we have spoken in favour of eminent Earle <hi>John,</hi> who is present, the Brother of our most
illustrious King <hi>Richard</hi> now deceased, wanting an heire of his body; whom being provident,
valiant, and truely noble, we having invocated the grace of the holy Spirit, have all unanimously
<hi>ELECTED,</hi> as well in regard of his Merits, as of his royall Blood. <hi>Neither durst any
doubt or demurre on these things, knowing that the Arch-bishop had not thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
without cause. Wherefore Earle</hi> Iohn, <hi>and all men approving this speech, they
ELECTED and ASSUMED the Earle for their King, and cryed out saying,</hi> Let
the King live. <hi>But the Arch-bishop being afterwards demanded, why he had spoken
these things? answered,</hi> That he was assured by some divining foresight, that King <hi>John</hi>
would worke the ruine of the kingdome, corrupt the Crowne, and precipitate it into great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
<hi>And</hi> that he might not have the reines free to doe this, he <hi>OUGHT TO BE CHOSEN BY ELECTION, NOT BY SUCCESSION. King</hi> Iohn <hi>at this
his Coronation was involved in a</hi> threefold Oath: <hi>namely,</hi> That hee should love holy
Church and its Ministers, and preserve it harmelesse from the incursion of Malignants; That
abolishing perverse Lawes, he should substitute good ones, and exercise Right judgement in
the kingdome of England. <hi>After which he was</hi> adjured by the Arch-bishop, in the behalfe of
God, and strictly prohibited, not to presume to accept this honour unlesse he fully purposed in
his minde, actually to fulfill what he had sworne. <hi>To which he answering,</hi> promised that
by Gods assistance he would bona fide keepe those things which he had sworne. <hi>After which
he rightly setled the affaires of</hi> England <hi>by the counsell of his Nobles, and then pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over into</hi> Normandy. <hi>But how ill he kept this his Oath, with others of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and how he violated the Statutes of</hi> Magna Charta <hi>and</hi> De Foresta, <hi>which he
had confirmed with his hand, seale, Oath, Proclamations, the Bishops Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
yea, the Popes Bull, within three moneths after he had confirmed them, and procured a dispensation of his Oath, an abrogation of these Lawes from the
Pope, making bloody warres upon his Barons and Subjects (who confiding to those
confirmations and royal promises expected no such strange performances) spoyling,

That the King in all his Oathes and promises did so farre transgresse the bounds of truth, that the Prelates and

That though be sometimes humbled himselfe, confessing that he had beene often bewitched by ill counsell, and
promised with a great Oath solemnely taken upon the Altar and Coffin of Saint <hi>Edward,</hi> that he would plainely and fully correct his former Errors, and graciously condescend to his naturall Subjects good counsell; yet his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
preceding breaches of Oathes and promises, Se penitus incredibilem reddiderunt, made him altogether

and Subjects, have deemed the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> not meerely successive and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary,
though it hath usually gone by descent, but <hi>arbitrary and elective,</hi> when they
saw cause, many of our Kings comming to the Crowne without just hereditary
Title, by the Kingdomes, Peeres, and people <hi>free election onely</hi> confirmed by subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Acts of Parliament, which was then reputed a sufficient Right and Title; by
vertue whereof they then reigned and were obeyed as lawfull Kings, and were then
and yet so acknowledged to be; their right by <hi>Election of their Subjects</hi> (the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
whereof doe yet continue in the solemne demanding <hi>of the peoples consents</hi> at

in any Parliaments: whence the statute of 1 E. 4. c. 1. &amp; 9 E. 4. f. 2, declares King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4. 5. and 6. <hi>to be successively Kings of England indeed, and not of right, yet
not usurpers because they came in by Parliament.</hi> Onely <hi>Richard the third, (who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously
murthered Edward the 5. his Soveraigne, and violently usurped his Crowne, at
first, before any Parliament gave it him, compelling the Lords and Commons afterwards

could not continue without an head and governour, and therefore first, <hi>they agreed

were read and made knowne to all the Lords, Nobles, and Commons of the Realme,
they then consulted how the Realme should be governed from thenceforth. And after good
deliberation, and consultation of the foresaid Articles of the Kings evill government, they
concluded:</hi> THAT SUCH A MAN WAS NOT WORTHY TO BE A KING,

that</hi> Edward <hi>his eldest sonne, who was there present, and was rightfull heire, should be
crowned King in stead of his Father,</hi> SO THAT HE WOULD TAKE ABOUT

All these things concluded, they ELECTED his son <hi>Edward</hi> King in the great

(where he was kept prisoner) to declare unto him not only the determination of the

Commonweale would never suffer toraigne any longer.</hi> They finally told him, <hi>That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he did of himselfe renounce his Crowne and Scepter, the people would neither endure
him, nor any of his children as their Soveraigne; but disclaiming all homage and fealty,
would elect some other for king, who should not be of the blood.</hi> This message strucke
such a chilnesse into the King, that he fell groveling to the earth in a swoun; which
the Earle of <hi>Leicester</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> beholding, run unto him, and with
much labour recovered the halfe dead King, setting him on his feet: who being
come to himselfe, the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> running over the former points, concludes,
saying, as in the person of the Commonwealth, <hi>That the king must resigne his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
to his eldest sonne; or, after the refusall, suffer</hi> THEM TO ELECT SUCH A
PERSON AS THEMSELVES SHOULD JUDGE TO BE MOST FIT AND
ABLE TO DEFEND THE KINGDOME. The dolorous King having heard
this speech, brake forth into sighes and teares, &amp; made at the last this answer, to this
effect, <hi>That he knew, that for his many sinnes he was fallen into this calamity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had the lesse cause to take it grievously. That he much sorrowed for this, that the
people of the kingdome were so exasperated against him, as that they should utterly abhor
his any longer rule and soveraignty: and therefore he besought all that were there present,
to forgive and spare him being so afflicted. That neverthelesse it was greatly to his
good pleasure and liking, (seeing it could none other be in his behal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29602:37"/>
was so gracious in their sight, and therefore he gave them thanks for chusing him their
King.</hi> This being said, then was a proceeding to the short Ceremonies of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,

renounced all homage and allegiance to the said <hi>Edward of Carnarvan,</hi> late King, in
these words following, I <hi>William Trussell,</hi> IN THE NAME OF ALL MEN

the day and yeer abovesaid, betweene the houres of eight and nine of the clock
before noone, were present in the chiefe Chamber of the Kings lodging within
the said place of the Tower, where was rehearsed to the King by the mouth of the
foresaid <hi>E. of Northumb.</hi> that before time at <hi>Conway</hi> in north Wales, the King being
there at his pleasure and liberty, promised unto the <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> then
<hi>Thomas Arundell.</hi> and unto the said <hi>Earle of Northumberland,</hi> that <hi>for insufficiency
which he knew himselfe to be of, to occupie so great a charge as to governe this Realm of
England, he would gladly leave off, and renounce the right and title, as well of that, as of
his title to the Crowne of France,</hi> and <hi>his Majestie, unto Henry Duke of Hertford;
and that to doe in such convenient wise, as by the learned men of this Landit should most
sufficiently be by them devised and ordained.</hi> To the which rehearsall the King in our
said presences answered benignly and said, <hi>That such promise he made, and so to the
same he was at that houre in full purpose to perform and fulfill, saving that he desired first
to have personall speech with the said Duke, and with the Archbishop of Canterbury his
Couzens: And furthermore, he desired to have a Bill drawn of the said Resignation,</hi> that
he <hi>might be made perfect in the rehearsall thereof.</hi> After which Copy by me the said
<hi>Earle</hi> delivered, we the said Lords and others departed. And upon the same after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone
the King desired much of the comming of the <hi>Duke of Lancaster,</hi> at the last
the said <hi>Duke,</hi> with the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of Canterbury, entred the foresaid Chamber,
bringing with them the Lord <hi>Ros,</hi> the Lord <hi>Burgeiney,</hi> &amp; the Lord <hi>Willoughbie,</hi> with
divers others: where after due obeysance done by them unto the King, he fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
and with a glad countenance to us appearing, talked with the said <hi>Archbishop</hi>
and <hi>Duke</hi> a good season. And that Communication finished, the King with a glad
countenance in presence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> us, and the other above rehearsed, said openly, <hi>That he
was ready to renounce and resigne all his Kingly Majestie in manner and forme as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seasons had promised: And although he had and might sufficiently have declared his
renouncement by the reading of another meane person, yet he for the more surety of the
matter, and for the said resignation should have his full force and strength, he therefore
read the Scroll of resignation himselfe in manner and forme as followeth. In the Name of
God, Amen. I</hi> Richard <hi>by the grace of God, King of England and of France, and
Lord of Ireland, acquit and assoile all Archbishops, Bishops, and other Prelates secular
or religious, of what dignity, degree, state, or condition that they be of; and also all
Dukes, Marquesses Earles, Barons, Lords, and all mine other liege men both spirituall
and secular, of what manner of name or degree they be from their Oath of fealty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and all other Deeds and Priviledges made unto me, and from all manner of Bonds
of Allegeance and Regality or Lordship, in the which they were or be bound to me, or in any
otherwise constrained, and them their heires and successours for evermore from the same
Bonds and Oaths I release, deliver, acquit, and let them for ever be free, dissolved and

acquit, and to be harmlesse for so much as belongeth to my person, by any manner way or
title of right that to me might follow of the foresaid things or any of them: And also I
resigne all my Kingly Dignity, Majesty, and Crowne, with all the Lordships, Power,

and Possessions to me in any manner of wise pertaining, what name or condition they
be of, out take the Lands and Possessions for me and mine obite purchased and bought. And
I renounce all right and colour of right, and all manner of title of possession and Lordship
which I ever had or have in the same Lordships and possessions, or any of them, or to them,
with any manner of rights belonging or appertaining unto any part of them: And also the
rule and governance of the same Kingdome and Lordships, with all ministrations of the

best manner and forme that I may, and with deed and word I leave off and resigne them,
and go from them for evermore, saving alway to my successors Kings of England, all the
Rights, Priviledges and appurtenances to the said Kingdome and Lordships abovesaid
belonging and appertaining: For well I wote and acknowledge, and deem my selfe to be
and have bin unsufficient and unable, and also unprofitable, and for mine open deserts not
unworthy to be put down: And I sweare upon the holy Evangelists here presently with
my hands touched, that I shall never repugne to this resignation, dimission, or yeelding
up, nor never impugne them in any manner by word or by deed, by my selfe, nor by none
other; nor I shall not suffer it to be impugned in as much as in me is, privily nor apart:
but I shall have, hold, and keep this renouncing, dimission, and leaving up for firme and
stable for evermore in all and in every part thereof, so God me helpe and all Saints, and
by this holy Evangelist by me bodily touched and kissed: And for more record of the
same, here openly I subscribe and signe this present Resignation with mine owne hand.</hi>
And forthwith in our presences, and other, subscribed the same, and after deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> saying, <hi>That if it were in his power, or at
his assignment, he would that the Duke of Lancaster there present should be Successour
and King after him.</hi> And in token thereof, he took a Ring of gold from his finger,
being his Signet, and put it upon the said <hi>Dukes</hi> finger, desiring and requiring the
Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to shew and make report unto the Lords of the Parliament of
his voluntary Resignation, and also of his intent and good minde that he bare
toward his Cousin the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to have him his Successour and King after
him. And this done, every man took their leave, and returned to their own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Upon the morrow following, being Tuesday, and the last day of September,
all the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, with also the Commons of the said Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
assembled at Westminster, where, in the presence of them, the</hi> Archbishop
of Yorke, <hi>according to the Kings desire, shewed unto them seriously the voluntary
Renouncing of the King, with also the favour which he ought unto his Cousin
the</hi> Duke of Lancaster <hi>for to have him his Successour: And over that shewed
unto them the Scedule or Bill of Renouncement, signed with King</hi> Richards <hi>hand.
After which things in order by him finished, the question was asked first of the
Lords,</hi> If they would admit and allow that Renouncement? <hi>The which when it was of
the Lords granted and confirmed, the like question was asked of the Commons,
and of them in like manner affirmed. After which admission it was then decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
That notwithstanding the foresaid renouncing so by the Lords and Commons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it were needfull unto the Realme, in avoiding of all suspicions and surmises of

before done by the said Richard late King of England, to the end that they might be first
openly shewed to the people, and after to remain of Record among the Kings Records.
<hi>The which were drawn and compiled, as before is said, in 38. Articles, and there
shewed readie to be read: but for other causes then more needfull to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the reading of the said Articles at that season were deferred and put off.
Then forsomuch as the Lords of the Parliament had well considered this volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <p>After which sentence thus openly declared, the said Estates admitted forthwith

visited us. I tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t his peculiar people, and sent us a Man to have the rule over us, and
put by Children, that before time ruled this land after childish conditions, as by
the works of them it hath right lately appeared, to the great disturbance of all this
Realme, and for want and lack of a man: For as saith the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.
14. When I was a childe I savoured and spake as a childe; but at the time when I came
to the state of a man, then I put by all my childish conditions.</hi> The Apostle saith, he
savoured and spake as a childe in whom is no stedfastnesse or constancy; for a
childe will lightly promise, and lightly he will breake his promise, and doe all
things that his appetite giveth him unto, and forgeteth lightly what he hath done.
By which reason it followeth, that needs great inconvenience must fall to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that a Childe is ruler and Governour of; nor is it possible for that Kingdom
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29602:39"/>
to stand in felicity where such conditions reigne in the head and ruler of the same.
But now wee ought all to rejoyce, that all such defaults bee expelled, and that a
Man and not a Childe shall have Lordship over us, to whom it belongeth to have
a sure reine upon his tongue, that he may be knowne from a Childe, or a Man
using childish conditions; of whom I trust I may say as the wise man saith in his
Proverbs, <hi>Blessed be the man that hath wisdome, and that aboundeth in prudence:</hi> For
that man that is ruled by sapience, must needs love and dread our Lord God; and
whoso loveth and dreadeth him, it must consequently follow, that he must keep his
Commandements. By force whereof he shall minister true Justice unto his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and do no wrong nor injury to any man, so that then shall follow the words
of the wise man, which he rehearsed in Proverbs 10. <hi>The blessing of our Lord God
shall alight upon the head of the King, being a just and right wise man, for the tongue of
him worketh not iniquity and injustice, but the tongue of the wicked and sinners covereth
iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> And who that worketh or ministreth Justice in due order, he not only safe
guardeth himselfe, but also holdeth the people in a surety of restfulnesse, of the
which ensueth peace and plenty: and therefore it is said of the wise King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Eccles. 10. Blessed and happy is that land, of which the King or Ruler is noble
and wise, and the Princes be blessed that live in his time.</hi> As who would say, They
may take example of him to rule and guide their Subjects; for by the discretion
of a noble and wise man, being in authority, many evils are sequestred and put
apart, and all dissemblers put unto silence; for the wise man considereth well the
great inconveniences which daily now grow of it, where the childe or insipient
drinketh the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>weet and dilicious words unadvisedly, and perceiveth not intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ication
which they be mingled or mixt with, till he be invironed and wrapped
in all danger, as lately the experience thereof hath been apparent to all our
sights and knowledges, and not without the danger of all this Realm, and all
was for lacke of wisdome in the Ruler, which deemed and taught as a childe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sentence of wilfulnesse and not of reason; so that while a childe reigned,
selfe will and lust reigned, and reason with good conscience was outlawed, with
Justice, stedfastnesse, and many other vertues. But of this perill and danger wee
be delivered by the especiall help and grace of God, because he that now ruleth
is not a childe, but perfect in reason, for he commeth not to execute his owne
will, but his will that sent him, that is to wit, Gods will, as a man unto whom
God of his abundant grace hath given perfect reason and discretion to discerne
and deem as a perfect man; wherefore of this man we shall not onely say, that he
shall dwell in wisdome, but as a perfect man, and not a childe, he shall thinke and
deem, and have such circumspection with him, that hee shall diligently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke
and see that Gods will be done, and not his: and therefore now I trust the
words of the wise man, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. shall be verified in our King, saying, <hi>A wise
and discreet Iudge shall now deeme his people, and the Dominion or Lordship of a discreet
wise man shall stand stedfast;</hi> whereupon shall then follow the second verse of the
same Chapter, saying, <hi>Like as the Head and Soveraigne is replenished with all sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and vertue in guiding of his people, administring to them Law with due and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Iustice, so shall the Subjects be garnished with awe and loving dread, and
beare unto him, next God, all honour, truth, and allegiance.</hi> So that then it may bee
concluded with the residue of the foresaid verses, Such as the Ruler of the City
is, such then be the inhabitants of the same: So that consequently it followeth,
A good Master maketh a good Disciple: And likewise, an evill King or Ruler
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29602:40"/>
shall lose his people, and the Cities of his Kingdome shall be left desolate and
uninhabited. Wherefore thus I make an end, in stead of a childe, wilfully doing
his lust and pleasure without reason, now shall a man be Lord and Ruler, that is
replenished with sapience and reason, and shall governe the people by skilfull
doings, setting apart all wilfulnesse and pleasure of himselfe; so that the word
that I began with, may be verified in him, <hi>Ecce quia vir dominabitur in populo,</hi> the
which our Lord grant, and that he may prosperously reign unto the pleasure of
God, and wealth of his Realm. Amen,</p>
                     <p>The which Oration being thus finished, and the people answering with great
gladnesse, Amen. The King standing upon his feet, said unto the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
present. <hi>Sirs, I thanke you, my Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and all the
States of this Land, and doe you to understand, that it is not my will that any man think
that by the way of conquest I would disinherit any man of his heritage, franchise, or
other rights that he ought to have of right, nor for to put him out of that which he now
enjoyeth, and hath h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

private persons as have beene against the good purpose and the common profit of the
Realme.</hi> And this speech thus finished, all Sheriffs and other Officers were put in
their Authorities, which season for the time that the Kings Sea was void, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
every man departed. And at afternoon were Proclamations made in accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
places of the City in the name of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. And upon the
morrow following, being wednesday, and the first of October, the Procurators
abovenamed went unto the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and there certified <hi>Richard</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of King <hi>Henry:</hi> And the foresaid Justice, <hi>William Thyrning,</hi> in the name
of the other, and for all the States of the land, <hi>gave up unto</hi> Richard <hi>late King, all
homage and fealty unto him before him due,</hi> in like manner and forme as before I
have shewed to you in the deposition of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second. And thus
was this Prince deprived of all Kingly dignity and honour <hi>by reason of his evill

you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. And when all Israel saw, that
the King would not hearken unto them, the people answered the King <hi>(though some say he

of a <hi>Principality,</hi> intended only for their <hi>greater safety and immunity;</hi> to have erected
a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> to their <hi>perpetuall irremediable Oppression and slavery:</hi> A most brutish, sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,
inconsiderate rash action, not once to be imagined of any people; quite contrary
to the practice of the <hi>Lacedemonians, Romans, Germans, Aragonians,</hi> and most other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who still reserved the Soveraigne power to themselves, and never transferred it
to their kings or Emperours, who were ever subject to their jurisdictions, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
too, as I shall manifest at large in the <hi>Appendix:</hi> no absolute Monarchy being
ever set up in the world but by direct Tyranny and Conquest, as <hi>Cassanaeus</hi> in his
<hi>Catalogus Gloriae Mundi pars 5. Consid.</hi> 1. manifests at large, not by the peoples free
election and consents. And had our Ancestors or any other Nations, when they first
erected Kings, and instituted Kingly government, been demanded these few questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Whether they meant thereby to transferre all their Nationall authority, power,
and priviledges so farre over unto their Kings, their heires, and successors for ever, as
not still to reserve the supremest power and jurisdiction to themselves, to direct, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
restrain their Princes supremacy &amp; the exorbitant abuses of it, when they should
see just cause? or so as not to be able ever after to alter or diminish this form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon any occasion whatsoever? Or if their King should turne professed tyrants,
endeavouring to deprive them (against all right and justice) of their Lives, Goods, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
Religion, Lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or make open warres upon them to destroy them, or bring in
forraigne enemies upon them, to conquer or subject them to a forraigne power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their free consents, that yet they should patiently submit themselves to these their
unnaturall, tyrannicall, destructive proceedings without any the least resistance of
them by necessary defensive Armes, or calling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to account for these grosse irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities?
I make no question that they would have joyntly answered (as I doubt not but
our Parliaments, Kingdomes, and all other Nations, were they at this day to institute
their preerected Principalities and Kings, would answer to) that they had never any
imagination to erect such an absolute, eternall, unlimited, uncontrollable, irresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Monarchy, and plaine tyranny over them; and that they ever intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the absolute originall Soveraigne Jurisdiction in themselves, as their native he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
priviledge, which they never meant to divest themselves of: that so by means
thereof, if their Princes should degenerate into Tyrants, they might have a just
authority, power, and remedy residing in them, whereby to preserve themselves, the
Nation Kingdome, from utter desolation, ruine, and vassalage. An impregnable
evidence, that the whole Kingdom and Parliament representing it, are the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
power; and above the King himselfe, because having the supream Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29602:43"/>
in them at first, they never totally transferred it to our Kings, but reserved it in
themselves, which is likewise further confirmed by that notable passage of<note n="*" place="margin">In Melch. Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasti Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Tom. 1. p. 128.</note>

                     <hi>The Prelates, Dukes, Counts, and Barons, being in the
white Chamber, and the Commons in the Painted Chamber, it was shewed unto them by
the Chancellour, how they had understood the cause of the Summons of Parliament in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
but the will of the King was, that the causes should be shewed unto them in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
telling them how the King had understood that the Pope by vertue of a Deed, which
he said that King</hi> John <hi>had made to the Pope to do him homage for the Kingdom of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>and the land of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and that by reason of the said homage that he ought to pay
him every yeer perpetually one thousand Marks; and that he purposeth to make out
Processe against the King and his Realm, for the said Service and Rent, concerning which
the King prayed the advice and counsell of the Prelates, Dukes, Earles, and Barons:
and what he should do in case the Pope would proceed against him for this cause, or
against the said Realm: And the Prelates prayed the King that they might thereupon
advise alone by themselves, and return their answer the next morning: which Prelates
by themselves the next morning, and after the said Dukes, Earls, Barons, and great men,
answered and said; That the said King</hi> John, NOR NO OTHER, MIGHT
PUT HIMSELF, NOR HIS REALM, NOR HIS PEOPLE
IN SUCH SUBJECTION, WITHOUT THE ASSENT
AND ACCORD OF THEM: <hi>And the Commons being advised and
consulted with thereupon, answered in the same manner. Whereupon it was ordained and
assented</hi> BY COMMON CONSENT <hi>in manner following; In this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament held at</hi> Westminster, <hi>the Munday next after the Invention of holy
Crosse, in the yeer of the reign of King</hi> Edward, <hi>the 40. as well to maintain the estates
of holy Church, as the rights of his Realm and his Crown, it hath been shewed amongst
other things; how it hath been reported and said, that the Pope by vertue of a Deed
which he said that the said</hi> John, <hi>late King of</hi> England, <hi>had made to the Pope in

shewed to the Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and the Commons, to have their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and counsell thereupon, and to demand of them, what the King should do in case that
the Pope should proceed or attempt any thing against him or his Realm for this cause:
Which Prelates, Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Commons having taken full deliberation
thereupon, answered and said,</hi> OF ONE ACCORD; <hi>That the said King</hi>

                  <p>This point I have thus copiously debated, not out of any the least intention to
derogate from his Majesties just <hi>Supremacie</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives royall,</hi> which I have oft

but out of a serious desire to rectifie the generall mistakes of men, touching
a pretended Prerogative, which their fantasies onely (not the Law) have unduely
attributed unto Kings: and to vindicate the just <hi>Liberties, Priviledges,</hi> and <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi>
of Parliaments (so much decryed, declaimed against of late by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ignorant Papists, Malignants, Royalists, who know not what the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of Parliaments is) according to the <hi>Protestation,</hi> the clearing of which
points (in my weak apprehension) is the onely high and ready way to compose
our present differences, to settle all our distractions, which the ignorance, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
of the Kings and Parliaments just Prerogatives and Powers, (next to the
treacherous malice of Papists) have principally raised among us, almost to the
ruine of the Kingdom. For my part, I professe sincerely, I love and honour both
King and Parliament alike, and in the controversies now between them concerning
their Jurisdictions, stand as a man indifferent to do right to both, without prejudice
to either; and the King being the Principall Member of the Parliament, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
of its now disdained Power to its due altitude, can be no depression, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Kings Prerogative, which shines most perspicuously in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whiles King and Parliament are united, and is most eclipsed onely when
they are divided, as the precedents in all ages manifest. And this I dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
averre, That there are no such enemies to the Kings Prerogative, as those who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
it beyond due bounds, do necessarily draw it into dispute, in which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
comes off with losse and diminution in the end, as in the late cases of <hi>Loanes,

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Parliaments resisting of the Kings personall Commands
(especially such as are illegall and destructive to the Kingdom) or any private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
resisting them by vertue of a publike Ordinance or Countermand from the
Parliament, is no resisting of the higher Power, against <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.

submission and obedience to <hi>the highest Powers</hi> (the Parliament;) and those who
resist the Parliaments Ordinances and Commands (especially such as tend to the
preservation of Religion, Laws, Liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Priviledges of Parliament, and the
Kingdom, or bringing Delinquents to condign punishment) though they do it by
vertue of any extrajudiciall countermand from the King or His ill Counsellors, do
both in point of Law, Divinity, Conscience, <hi>resist the higher Powers,</hi> because they
resist the Parliament (which is in truth, the highest Power, as I have manifested,
not the King:) and so <hi>shall receive damnation to themselves</hi> for it, either here, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
if they repent not; which I seriously desire all those Delinquents, Papists,
Malignants, ill Counsellors, and Cavaliers, to consider, who contrary to severall
Orders, and Declarations of Parliament, yea contrary to the Law of God, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of the Realm, have like unnaturall Vipers, taken up offensive Arms against
the Parliament and Kingdom, to ruine them, Religion, Laws, and Liberties
at once.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hence it follows, That the <hi>Resolutions</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> of the Lords
and Commons in Parliament, the supremest Court, against the <hi>Commission of Array,
Arming of Papists, raising of Forces, imposing Taxes to maintain Warre against the
Parliament, Plundering,</hi> and the like, ought to be obeyed, and submitted to, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and binding, both by the King Himself, the Kingdom, and every private Subject
whatsoever; and that the Kings extrajudiciall and illegall Declarations out of
Parliament in direct opposition and contradiction to these Resolutions and Votes
of both Houses in Parliament, ought not to be obeyed, the King himself as our Law

device of controlling, affronting the Resolutions and Declarations of both Houses,
by opposite Proclamations, and Declarations published in his Majesties name; is
such a transcendent violation of, and contempt against the known priviledges, the
sacred venerable Authority, and power of Parliaments, as (I am confident) no age
can Paralell; and if not severely vindicated by exemplary punishments of the
highest nature, upon those ill Counsellors, and corrupt Lawyers, who contrive
and pen them, will bring this <hi>highest, greatest and most honourable Court (wherein

basest Court of Pipouders is. No King nor Subject ever yet attempted such affronts

and Ordinances of this highest Tribunall. If Kings or Counsellors of State,
will instruct or excite the Subjects, peremptorily to disobey and contemne the
Ordinances, the Judgements of the Parliament, let them never expect the least
obedience or submission to any of their own commands, which are of lesser credit
and Authority; which all former Ages have most reverenced and submitted to.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Parliament and whole Kingdom, being the highest Power,
or any Member of the Parliament, cannot by any publike Acts or Votes of theirs
consented to in Parliament, become <hi>Traytors,</hi> or guilty of <hi>high Treason,</hi> against
the King, either by the Common Law, or the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw. 3. chap,</hi> 2. of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>

<hi>with other like sticklers, trayterously perswaded them, was according to Law:</hi> Which
grosse slander of the <hi>Parliament House,</hi> would have been capitall at least in former
ages, and may now indanger the necks of those who speak or write the same of
the present Parliament. Never did any of our Kings, charge any Parliament with
high Treason hitherto; much lesse indict or wage warre against their Parliaments,
as Traytors, though they have questioned and deposed Kings for offences against, and
being Enemies or Traytors to the Kingdom: Let none then dare affirm, That the
Houses of Parliament are, or can be Traytors now, for providing for their own,
and the Kingdoms safety, by a necessary defensive Warre, which I shall in the third

Law, or Conscience, either in the Houses of Parliament, or any that bear Arms by

                  <p>This being the true State and progresse of the <hi>Militia,</hi> the sole question will be;
Whether all the former circumstances of danger, &amp; his Majesties refusall to settle the

                     <hi>Militia,</hi> Ports, &amp;c. by an act; in such trusty hands, as both King and Parliament
might confide in; the Parliament by an Ordinance of both Houses onely, without
the King, refusing to joyne with them, and wilfully absenting himselfe from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
might not in this case of necessity and extremity, (for their owne, and the
kingdomes safety) lawfully settle and seise the premises, for the present, as they have
done? and whether this be a just ground for the King to begin or continue a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
civill warre against his Subjects? For my part, I shall not undertake to justifie all
passages on either side, in the managing of this businesse; it may be there have beene
errors at least in both parties: which to reconcile, as neere as possible, I shall premise
such propositions on either hand, as Neither can in justice deny.</p>

                  <p>On the Parliaments part, it must necessarily be granted to them by the King:</p>

Notwithstanding these contests, the people still enjoyed the right of electin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes,
which is evident by the Statute of <hi>Articuli super Chartas,</hi> in the 28. yeare of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, <hi>c. 8. The King granteth to the people</hi> (not by way of grace but of
Right) <hi>that they shall have election of their Sheriffe</hi> IN EVERY SHIRE (<hi>where
the Shrevalty is not of Fee</hi>) IF THEY LIST, and chap. 13. <hi>For as much as the
King hath granted the election of the Sheriffes to the</hi> COMMONS <hi>of the Shire, the King
will, that</hi> THEY SHALL CHUSE <hi>such Sheriffes, that shall not charge them,
&amp;c.</hi> And Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> in his Commentary on <hi>Magna Charta, f.</hi> 174, 175. 558,
559. 566. proves at large, the right of electing Sheriffes, to be antiently, of late,
(and at this day in many places) in the Free-holders and people, as in <hi>London, York,
Bristoll, Glocester, Norwich,</hi> in all great Cities which are Counties, and in <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex.</hi>
Seeing then the Parliament and Free-holders, in antient times had a just right
to elect their Generals, Captaines, Sheriffes, (who had the sole power of the <hi>Militia,</hi>
and Counties in their hands next under the King himselfe) and there is no negative
Law in being (that I can find) to exclude them from this power; I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that their setling the <hi>Militia</hi> by an Ordinance of Both Houses, and electing
of Commanders, Lieutenants, Captaines in each County to execute it, and defend
the Counties from plundering, and destruction, without his Majesties consent
(especially after his refusall to settle it by an Act) can be no incroachment at all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Prerogative Royall, but only a reviving and exercising of the old undoubted
rightfull power enjoyed by their Predecessors, now necessary to be resumed by them
(in these times of feare and danger) for the kingdomes safety.</p>

dispensandam. Contradixerunt igitur Regi in faciem, nolentes amplius sic pecunia sua frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
spoliari.</hi> The King hereupon put them off till the next day <hi>(Romanorum usus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis
fallaciis)</hi> and then they should heare his minde concerning this and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The next day he cals them one by one into his privy Chamber, <hi>Now one, then
another, like a Priest calling penitents to confession;</hi> and thus those whom he could not
all together overcome, weakned by being every one apart, hee endeavoured more
cunningly to enervate with his words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and demanding a pecuniary ayde of them
he said; <hi>See what this Abbot hath granted me towards my aide; behold what another hath
subscribed, producing a fained Roll, that such and such an Abbot or Peere had subscribed such
a summe, when in truth not one of them had consented to it, neither came it into their thoughts.</hi>
The King therefore with such false copies, and ensnaring words. cunningly inveagled
many: <hi>Notwithstanding most stood out, and would by no meanes recede from the common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which they had sworne not to recede from under paine of an Anathema.</hi> To whom the
King answered in anger, <hi>Shall I be perjured? I have sworne with an inviolable oath, that
passing over sea, I will with a stretched out arme demand my rights of the King of</hi> France,
<hi>which I cannot doe without store of Treasure, which must proceed from your liberality, else I
can by no meanes doe it.</hi> Neither yet with these, or other words could hee entrap any,
albeit, he called every man single to conferre with. After this, he againe called others
which were more familiar with him, and so talking to them said, <hi>What a pernitious
example give you to others? you who are Earles, Barons, and valiant Souldiers, ought not to
tremble as others, to wit, Prelates of the Church doe. You ought to be more covetous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
the Kings rights, and valiantly to fight against those who wrong me, &amp;c. with what
face then can you relinquish me poore and desolate now, being your Lord, in such a weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
which concernes the Common-wealth, when I am bound by promises to passe the Seas,
which I ratified with an oath?</hi> Which when it came to the knowledge of all, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We admire beyond all that can be spoken, into what bottomlesse pit the innumerable summes
of money are sunke, which thou Lord King hast cunningly gained, by divers wardships of
great men, by various escheates, frequent extortions, as well from Churches voyd of a Pastour,
as from the lands of Noblemen, free granted Donatives, engendring amazement in the hearts of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29602:58"/>
the hearers, all which have never brought so much as the least increase to the kingdome. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
all the Nobles of England doe overmuch admire,</hi> QUOD SINE EORUM
CONSILIO ET CONSENSU, <hi>that without their counsell or consent you haue
undertaken so difficult and perilous a businesse, giving credit to those who want faith, and
contemning the favour of thy naturall Subjects, exposest thy selfe to cases of so doubtfull fortune:
thou dishonestly and impudently, not without just perill of thy Soule, and wounding of thy Fame
breakest the Articles of the truce betweene the King of</hi> France <hi>and thee, which thou hast sworn
upon thy Soule indissolubly and unviolably to keepe for three yeares space, &amp;c. The King hearing
these things, was exceeding angry, swearing by all the Saints, that he would be revoked by no
terrour, nor perswaded by any circumstances of words, to retard his begun purpose, and taking
ship on Quindena Paschae, would undauntedly try the fortune of Warre in Foraine parts.</hi>
And so the Parliament dissolving in discontent and secret heart-burning on both
sides, the Lords and Barons for a perpetuall memory of their Heroicke Answer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the King, set it downe in a notable <hi>Remonstrance</hi> (too large to transcribe)
which you may reade in<note n="*" place="margin">Pa. 562, 563.</note> 
                     <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> After this in the yeare 1248. this<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Paris, Anno 1248. p. 718, 719, 725, 726. &amp;c. Dani. p. 164.</note> King summoned a generall Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> wherein hee demaunded an ayde from
his Lords and Commons to recover his Right in <hi>France;</hi> who instead of granting it,
informed him very roundly and fully of his unkingly and base oppressions both of
his Subjects and strangers, to his owne and the kingdomes dishonour, and of his
tyranny and rapines: At which the King being confounded and ashamed in himselfe,
promised a serious and speedy Reformation; Which because they thought to be
but feigned, he answered they should shortly see it; Whereupon they replyed, they
would patiently expect it till fifteene dayes after St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, adjourning the
House till then. But the King seduced, hardned and much exasperated by his bad
Counsellers and Courtiers, giving then a very high displeasing answer to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
they all unanimously answered, that they <hi>would no more unprofitably impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish
themselves to enrich and strengthen the King and kingdomes Enemies; and that he had
precipitately and indiscreetly, and</hi> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT <hi>hastned
into Poictiers, and Gascoygne, and engaged himselfe in that warre; whence he returned inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with losse of his honour and treasure, to his great reproach.</hi> And so this Parliament
dissolving with discontent, the King grew very angry with <hi>his ill Counsellors, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him upon these courses, which lost the hearts of his Nobles and people:</hi> who to pacifie his
anger and supply his wants, advised him to sell all his Plate, Utensils, and Jewels
to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and then to resume and seise them againe, as belonging to the
Crowne.</p>

<hi>THAT THEY WOULD GIVE HIM SUCH COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELL
and AIDE AS SHOULD BE EXPEDIENT IN SO

good deliberation and advice, and openly seeing the subversion of the Land of <hi>England,</hi> and
Kings great businesse, which God defend, if hasty remedy be not provided, <hi>HAVE COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELLED
JOYNTLY and SEVERALLY,</hi> and prayed with great

the Sea, in assurance of the ayde of God and his good quarrell, effectually at this time, <hi>TO
MAKE AN END OF HIS WARRES BY WAY OF
PEACE OR ELSE BY FORCE.</hi> And that for Letters, words, nor
faire promises, he shall not let his passage, till he see the effect of his businesse. And for this
cause the said great men do grant, to passe and adventure them with him. And the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
doe grant to him for the same cause in a certaine forme, two Quinzimes of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
and two Dismes of the Cities and Burroughes, to be levyed in manner as the last Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zime
granted to him, and not in other manner, &amp;c. So that the money levyed of the same, be

pregnant Precedent of the Parliaments interest in concluding Warre and Peace, and
disposing of the ayde contributed towards warres, to such persons and uses as they
deeme meete to confide in. By these, with infinite other precedents, the Statute of</hi>
1 Iac. c. 2. <hi>and the</hi> Act of Pacification <hi>and</hi> oblivion <hi>betweene</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England,
<hi>made this very Parliament, enacting</hi> that no warre shall be levyed or made by any of either
Nation against the other without consent of Parliament, under paine of High Treason; <hi>It is
evident, that the principall right of concluding, denouncing Warre or peace, resides
in the Parliament: and that the King without its previous advice and consent, ought
not to proclaime any open warre, since the Subjects estates; and persons must support,
wage it, and receive most disadvantage by it; a truth not onely implyed but resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his Majesties owne royall assent this very Parliament in the</hi> Act of Pacification

which they have no such right or Titleash to that of <hi>England,</hi> without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice

point on his Majesties part: who seeing he cannot manage the <hi>Militia</hi>
in proper person in all Counties, but onely by Substitutes; hath farre more cause to
accept of such persons of Honour and quality as his Parliament shall nominate (in
whom himselfe and his whole Kingdome in these times of Warre and danger may
repose confidence) to execute this trust, then any whom his owne judgement alone,
or some private Lords or Courtiers shall recommend, in whom the Kingdome and
Parliament, in these jealous deceitfull times, dare not confide. The yeelding to
the Parliament in this just request, will remove all feares and jealousies, restore our
peace, re-gaine his Majesty the reall affections of his discontented Subjects; the
persisting in the contrary course will but adde fuell to our flames, feares, doubts, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and frustrate all hopes, all endevours of Peace.</p>

be in the time of his Progenitors, Kings of <hi>England</hi> for ever. By the Statute of 10 R.
2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. it is resolved, That the King could not alien the Land, Castles, Ships, Revenues,
Jewels, and Goods of the Crowne; and a Commission is thereby granted to inquire
of, and resume all such alienations as illegal. Hence the Commons in the Parliament
of 16 R. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> in their Petition to the King, and the whole Parliament
in and by that Law, declared; That the Crowne and kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> hath been
so free at all times, that it hath beene in subjection to no Realme, but immediately
subject to God, and to none other; which (by the prosecution of suites in the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> for Benefices, provided against by this Act) should in all things touching
the Regality thereof, be submitted to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Laws and Statutes
of the Realme be by him defeated and frustrated at his will, to the destruction of
the King, his Soveraignty, Crowne and Regality, and of all his Realme; in defence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29602:62"/>
whereof in all points, they would live and dye. Hence the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have
alwayes setled, entailed, and disposed of the succession and Revenues of the Crowne
by speciall Acts of Parliament, and consent of the whole Realme, because the whole
kingdome hath an interest therein, without whose concurring assent in Parliament,
they had no power to dispose thereof: as the Statutes of 21 R. 2. <hi>c. 9. 7 H. 4. c. 2. 25

done to Parliament and Subjects, had they first gotten them, who have already
wrought so much mischiefe without them, by the Kings owne encouragement and
command? Doubtlesse the Parliament being the supreame power, now specially
met together and intrusted by the Subjects, to provide for the kingdomes safety,
had forfeited not onely their discretion, but trust, and betrayed both themselves,
their priviledges, the Subjects Liberties, Religion, Countrey, Kingdome; and not
onely their friends, but enemies would have taxed them of infidelity, simplicity,
(that I say not desperate folly) had they not seised what they did, in the season
when they did it? which though some at first, imputed onely to their over-much
jealousie, yet time hath since sufficiently discovered, that it was onely upon substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
reasons of true Christian Policy. Had the Cavaliers and Papists (now in

had before put in, and put other Officers in their places; spoyling them of such
goods as they had. Who complaining thereof to the King, he put them off for

valiant and faithfull man, Constable of it; who searching all passengers that came
thither, very strictly, found great store of Treasure, which was to be secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed

they should doe it by the advise of their great Counsell, of which his privy

                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> first; that the Parliament was never within the meaning, nor letter of
that, or any other Act concerning Treasons, as I have formerly proved; the rather
because the King is a member of it, and so should commit Treason against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which were absurd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because both Houses are of greater authority then the King, (a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them as they make one Court) &amp; so cannot commit Treason against the lesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Parliament is a <hi>meere</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. f. 3. b.</note> 
                     <hi>Corporation and Court of justice,</hi> and so not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the guilt of Treason: A Judge, Maior, or particular persons of a Corporation
may be culpable of high Treason, as private men, but not a Court of justice, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.<note n="*" place="margin">See Littleton, Sect. 297. 314. 323. &amp; Cookes Instit. Ibidem.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by the very Statutes of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and of 11 <hi>R. 2. c. 3. 21 R. 2. c. 12. 1 H. 4. c.</hi> 10. 21. R. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. the Parliament is the sole Judge of all new Treasons, not within the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29602:68"/>
very letter of that act; <hi>and if any other case supposed Treason, not there specified, happens
before any Iustices, the Iustice shall tarry without any going to judgement of the Treason, till
the cause bee shewen and declared before the King and his Parliament, whether it ought to be
judged Treason.</hi> And if the Parliament be the sole Judge of all Treasons, it cannot
be guilty of Treason, for then it should be both Judge and Delinquent; and if so, no doubt it would ever acquit it selfe of such a crime as High Treason, and never give
judgement against it selfe. And no Judge or person else can arraigne or judge it, or
the members of it, because it is the highest soveraigne Court, over which no other
person or Court whatsoever hath any the least jurisdiction: So that if it were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the guilt of Treason, yet it could not be arraigned or judged for it, having
no superiour or adequate Tribunall to arraigne it.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, admit it might be guilty of High Treason in other cases, yet it cannot be
so in this. For having a joynt interest with the King in the premises in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
right, (the sole propriator of them) it cannot doubtles be guilty of treachery,
much lesse of High Treason for taking the custody and possession onely of that
which is their owne; especially when <hi>they both seise and detaine it for its owne proper use,
the Kingdomes security and defence; without any malicious or traytorous intention against
King or kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that the seising or detaining of these from the King are no
Treason, or <hi>levying of Warre</hi> within this Law, as is most evident by the Statutes of
6. <hi>Ed. 6. c.</hi> 11. which expresly distinguisheth, <hi>the seising and detaining of the Kings Forts,
Ammunition, Ships, from the levying warre against the King in his Realme,</hi> and by an
expresse new clause, enacts this <hi>seising and detayning</hi> to be High Treason from that
time, because it was no Treason within 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. before, which if it had beene in truth, this new clause had beene superfluous; which law of King <hi>Edward</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by <hi>primo Mariae, Rastal Treason,</hi> 20. this offence then ceased to be Treason:
whereupon by a speciall act of Parliament in 14 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. it was made <hi>High Treason
againe,</hi> (which had beene needlesse, if it had beene a <hi>levying of warre,</hi> or Treason
within 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. before.) And that with this proviso, <hi>this Act to endure during the
Queenes Majesties life that now is,</hi> ONLY; and so by this Parliaments resolution,
it is no Treason since her death, within 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 for then this proviso had beene idle
and repugnant too. And therefore being now no High Treason in any person, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without much calumny and injury be reputed Treason in both the Houses of Parliament, uncapable of High Treason, as the premises demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>In briefe, he that seised and detained the Forts and Ships of the kingdome, when
it was Treason, was not a bare <hi>Traytor</hi> against the Kings person or Crowne onely, but
against the <hi>King and his Realme too, like those Traytors, mentioned in the severall statutes of
11 R. 2. c. 4. and 21 R. 2. c. 2. 4. He shall be judged and have execution as a</hi> TRAITOR
and ENEMY OF THE KING and TO THE REALME: and in
28 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 7. HIGH TRAITORS TO THE REALME, As the
Gunpouder Traytors were to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Realme</hi> in them, being the
representative Body of the Realme: the Parliament then being the Realme represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
and authoritatively too, and so the party against whom this Treason
is principally to bee committed, cannot bee a Traytor to it selfe, by the words or
intendment of any expired Act which made such a <hi>seisure</hi> or <hi>detainer Treason.</hi> And
therefore those Lawyers, who pronounce this Parliaments seising and detaining of
the Ports, Forts, Navy, Armes, or Ammunition of the Realme to keepe them out of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29602:68"/>
worser hands, for the Kings and kingdomes right use and safetie, <hi>to be High Treason</hi>
declare themselves <hi>Greater Malignants</hi> then <hi>Artists in their owne profession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But some body (say Malignants and Royalists) must be trusted with the <hi>Militia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                     <hi>Ports, Navy, Armes, Ammunition;</hi> and who so fit to be confided in as the King himself,
and those whom he shall appoint? Especially since hee and his owne substitutes,
have formerly beene intrusted with them by the kingdome; and wee have now so
many deepe<note n="*" place="margin">See all his Majesties late Proclamations, Protestations, and printed Declarations of this nature.</note> 
                     <hi>Protestations, yea publike printed Asseverations and Promises from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
to maintaine the Protestant Religion, our Lawes, Liberties, Properties, Parliaments,
with their just Priviledges;</hi> and shall we not beleeve and trust his Majesty after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
royall assurances, seconded with many Acts of grace for the publike safetie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
passed by him in this Parliament? especially the Acts against <hi>Shipmoney,</hi> and
all other <hi>unlawfull Taxes;</hi> with the <hi>Bils for the continuance of this, and calling of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enniall
Parliament,</hi> when this shall be determined? Shall we yet be diffident of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
sinceritie after so many Protestations, Promises, Imprecations; so many Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his gracious affection to his people, and some publike acknowledgements of
his former misgovernment and invasions on his Subjects Liberties? If all these War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
will not content the Parliament, and perswade them to resigne up all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
they have seised into his Majesties hand, to purchase the kingdomes much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
necessary Peace, and put a period to our destructive warre (in which there is
nought but certaine ruine) what other security can his Majesty give or they
expect?</p>
                  <p>To answer<note place="margin">Answ.</note> this plausible allegation, I shall without prejudice to other mens
judgements, crave liberty to discharge my owne and others thoughts in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
in which if I chance to erre (out of overmuch zeale to my countries safety)
I shall upon the first discovery professe a recantation; though for the present,

I shall reduce the summe of the answer to these two heads;</p>
                  <p>First, that as the state of things now stands, it will be (as many wise men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
not onely inconvenient, but dangerous, to resigne up the Militia, Forts, Ports,
Navy, Ammunition of the kingdome into his Majesties sole disposing power, and
those hands which himselfe alone shall appoint and confide in, till things bee
throughly reformed and setled both here and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Popish prevailing
party in both kingdomes (now strongly up in armes) totally suppressed and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That till this be effected, it is more reasonable and safe, both for
King and kingdome, that these should remaine in the Parliaments hands, then in
the Kings alone.</p>
                  <p>For the first, there are these three general reasons, commonly alledged by many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
men, equally affected to either party, and by most who are cordially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the Parliament, why they deeme it not onely inconvenient, but peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
to intrust the premises wholly with the King, and those of his appointment,
as our condition now stands.</p>

                     <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of both Houses, though now with
his Majesty, in their Parliamentary Speeches, have openly professed; which they
thus demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>First, by his Majesties severall attempts against the <hi>Priviledges, Power, and very being
of Parliaments;</hi> manifested by the proceedings against Sir <hi>Iohn Eliot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollice,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> and others, after the Parliament in 3. <hi>Caroli;</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Say,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crew,</hi> with others after the last Parliament before this: By his Majesties
sad ominous breaking off in discontent, all Parliaments in his Reigne (unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld
in any age or kingdome) till this present; which though perpetuated by a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Act, as long as <hi>Both Houses please,</hi> hath yet long since been attempted to be dissolved
like the former, by his Majesties accusation, and personall comming into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
House with an extraordinary Guard of armed men attending him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
five principall members of it, to be delivered up to his hands as Traytors,
in an unpatterned manner. By his wilfull departure from, and refusall to returne
unto the Parliament, though oft petitioned and sollicited to returne; which is so
much the more observed and complained of, because his Majesty (if not his Royall
<hi>Consort</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> too) was constantly present in person every day this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(for sundry weekes together) at the arraignment of the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> for

honour, power, priviledges, if this should miscarry;) induce the most intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to opine, that his Majesty, long since weary of the yoke of all Parliaments,
(the only <hi>Remora</hi> to his absolute intended Monarchy) and repenting of the Act for
continuing this, since he hath gained his ends for which it was summoned, (more out
of absolute necessity then love to Parliaments) to wit, peace with the <hi>Scots,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
by an Accommodation, wrought by this Parliament, &amp; purchased with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
mony, when as he saw no hopes of repelling them hence by force; &amp; the paying
of his then raised Army against them by the Parliaments free supply: is now resolved
(in prosecution of his pristine Counsels) by force or policy to dissolve this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in discontent, as he hath done all former, and that with such advantages of
a generall ill opinion of Parliaments in the ignorant mis-informed vulgar on
the one hand, and of a prevailing conquering power on his part on the other hand,
as shall either utterly extinguish the hopes and Bill of summoning any future trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
Parliamentary Assemblies, or at least so emasculate the vigour, and eclipse the
power of them, if called; that they shall neither have courage, nor might, nor
meanes to resist his foresaid grand designe, if he can now either by force or policy
resume the <hi>Militia, Forts, Navy, Ammunition</hi> into his absolute dispose; the onely
present obstacle (now his forces are so great) to gaine a compleate long-expected
conquest over his peoples Liberties, Lawes, Estates, and all Parliaments Priviledges,
if not beings too. And if our Parliaments (the onely Bulwarkes to protect our
Lawes, Liberties, Estates, Lives, Religion, Peace, Kingdome, against the devastations
of oppressing, lawlesse Princes, and Officers) be once conquered, or weakned in the
least degree, we can expect no other issue, but that Tyranny, slavery, popery, shall
be ere long entailed upon us and our Heires Soules and bodies forever.</p>

Majesties two <hi>Answers,</hi> &amp; this Speech when he passed the <hi>Petition,</hi> at the end thereof

<hi>Tunnage and Poundage</hi> as a meere right, and his taking it as a just duty <hi>without

extraordinary strange commission granted under the great Seale to divers Lords and
others for the laying of an intolerable illegall excise, on all the Subjects through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

formerly and of late to raise and keepe an Army on foote among us to

the highest degree (so that none at this day can truely say that any thing hee

is evidenced, by infinite illegall commitments of men for not paying the <hi>Lone,
Knight-mony, Ship-mony,</hi> with sundry other unlawfull Taxes, without baile or

the Realme, if all the premises be put into his Majesties unlimited power. And
that which backes this more then conjecturall feare, is: First, the large visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse

but divers Malignant Members <hi>declanatory Orations,</hi> (now with the King)

freedome and impunity, the suspention of the Lawes against them and Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants;
the late persecutions and suppressions of all godly Preaching Ministers and most
zealous Protestants, with other particulars clearely demonstrate. Secondly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
generall Rebellion and bloody proceedings of the <hi>Papists in Ireland,</hi> to extirpate
the Protestant Religion there; and the many prevayling Plots of the Irish Rebels party
here, to delay, seize, or frustrate all ayde and opposition against them from hence: with
his Majesties late Commissions to Papists and Protestants, and some who have beene
in actuall Rebellion to treate and conclude a peace with these Rebells, contrary to the

If therefore the premises should now be wholy surrendred to his Majestie, it is much
to be feared, that the Popish party (now most powerfull) would in recompence of

gaine, the chiefe command of the Ports, Navie, Ammunition; the rather, because the

What, my Lady Countesse, have the Lords of England, because you have tongue at
will, made you a Charter, and hired you to be their Orator and Advocate? Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
she replyed: Not so my Lord, they have not made any Charter to me; but that
Charter which your Father made, and which your selfe have oft confirmed, swearing
to keepe the same inviolably and constantly, and often extorting money, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that the liberties therein conteined should be faithfully observed, you have not
kept, but without regard to honour or conscience broken; Therefore are you found
to be a manifest violater of your faith and Oath. Where are the liberties of England,
so often fairely ingrossed? so often granted? so often bought? I, though a woman,
and with me all the naturall and loyall people of the land, appeale you to the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of that high Iudge above, and heaven and earth shall be our witnesse, that you have
most unjustly dealt with us, and the Lord God of revenge, avenge and right us.
The King distrubed at these words asked her; If she expected not to obtaine her
suite upon favour, seeing she was his kinswoman? Whereunto she answered. How
shall I hope for grace, when you deny me right? Therefore I appeale before the face
of Christ against those Councellours also of yours, who gaping onely after their own
gaine, have bewitched and infatuated you. I wish none had cause at this very season
to make the like appeales. As boldly, though in fewer words, is he reproved by the

their riches made them proud, and their pride mad; and that those things which were
unadvisedly granted, were with much discretion to be revoked; alleaging, that the Pope

great danger to Parliament and Kingdome, to make an absolute present surrender of
the <hi>Militia,</hi> Forts, Navie, ammunition into such untrusty hands, as are likely to
turne them all against them, and to prooue mischeivous, if not pernicious, unto both,
for the premised reasons;<note n="*" place="margin">Seneca De Clementia l. 1.</note>

in Malignant hands. And here, to avoyd all misinterpretations of this impartiall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
I seriously protest; that as I heartily desire and constantly endeavour a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
safe, cordiall vnion between King, Parliament, People; so have I most unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
been necessitated to repeat the premised objections, much feared designes, and
experimentall contradictions betweene many late Protestations and actions, (frequent
in Parliamentary Declarations, new printed Pamphlets, and most mens mouthes;)
not out of any disloyall seditious intention (as some will maliciously mis-conster it)
to staine his Maiesties Reputation with his people, and make the breach betweene
them incurable, that they may never trust one another more; but onely faithfully to
demonstrate to his Highnesse and all about him, the great disservice and impoliticke
pernicious advise of those ill Counsellors, who have most unhappily engaged him
in such pernicious proiects and frequent repugnances of workes and words, as
have given both Parliament and people, a more then colourable, if not iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to distrust his Maiesties gracious words and promises for the present, till they
shall visibly discerne them, more punctually observed, and reallized for the future; and
made them so unhappy on the one hand, that now they dare not trust his Majesty
so farre forth as they desire, out of a provident care of their owne future security;
and His Highnesse so unfortunate on the other hand, as to grow jealous of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties,
because they will not conside in his Royall Faith and Protestations, so farre
as he expects, out of a care to preserue his owne Kingly Honour. In this unhappy diffidence (occasioned onely by His Majesties cvill Counsell) betweene King and
Kingdome, a reall future renouncing of all forenamed suspected designes, and
actuall performance of all Regall promises, will be the onely meanes to cure all Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
banish all feares, remove all diffidences; and beget an assured trust, firme
peace, and lasting unity between King and Subjects, to their mutuall unexpressible fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity;
which I shall dayly imprecate the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> speedily to accomplish. But
to returne to the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is conceived by many indifferent men, to be farre more reasonable
and safe both for King and Kingdome (as things now stand) that the <hi>Mili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ia,</hi> Ports,
&amp;c. till our feares and jealousies be quite removed, should remaine in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hands, then in the Kings alone: which they thus demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>First, Because all these<note n="*" place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of the Lord and Commons, <hi>May</hi> 26. 1642 and <hi>Novem.</hi> 2. 1642.</note> 
                     <hi>are the Kingdomes in right, property, use;</hi> not the Kings;
Who being but the Kingdomes Royall publicke Servant, may with Honour and better
reason deliver up the Custody of them to the representative Body of the Kingdome
for a reason, then detaine them from them, when they require it. Secondly, Because
the Parliament is the Superiour Soveraigne power, the King but the Ministeriall;
and it is more rationall and just, that the inferiour should condiscend to the greater
Power, the Ministeriall to those hee serves, then they to him. Thirdly, Many
men of Honour and fidelity are more to be trusted and credited, then any one man
whatsoever, because not so mutable, so sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Executors, and seldome doe cofide in one alone, The Parliament therfore being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and the King but one, are most to be confided in by the Kingdome. Fourthly,
Kings have frequently broke their Faith and Trust with their Parliaments and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
Parliaments seldome or never violated their trust to King or Kingdome;
therefore its more just, lesse dangerous for King and Kingdome to trust the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
then the King.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, The Parliament is elective, consisting for the most part of the principall men
in every County, City, Burrough, in whom the people who elected them, most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide;
The King successive, not Elective. Therefore not so much confided in by the
Kingdome, as the Parliament. Sixtly, The Parliament being the great Counsell both
of King and Kingdome, consisting of the ablest men of all Counties; is better able
to judge and make choyce of fit persons to manage and keep the premises for the
publike safety, then the King alone, without their advise. Seventhly, The Parliament
heretofore hath elected the greatest Officers of the Kingdome, (yea the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
when the Title to the Crowne hath been doubtfull, the inheritance and discent
whereof hath <hi>in all or most Princes raignes,</hi>

the Parliament,</hi> as I have formerly proved) because it most concernes the weal or
woe; the peace &amp; safety of the Realme to have trusty Officers; Therefore by the
selfe-same reason they should for the present appoint all Officers for the custody
and ordering of the Premises. Eightly, The Kings trusting the Parliament with these
things for a convenient time, wil be the only meanes to remove the peoples feares,
prevent their dangers, quiet their mindes, beget a perfect vnity and amity between
King, Parliament, Subject, and prevent all future differences: whereas the present
resigning of them to his Majesties trust and power, will but augment their jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
feares, dangers, discontents; and neither pacifie former differences, nor prevent
future, but rather perpetuate and beget them; especially if any notorious Papists,
Malignants (the likeliest men to be imployed vnder his Maiesty) be trusted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the premises, which will endanger both Liberties and Religion; of which
there will be no feare at all, if the Parliament and such as they shall nominate be
the onely Trustees. In fine, If neither King nor Parliament dare trust one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alone with the premises, and it is neither Royall, nor Honourable as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev
for the King to trust the Parliament now alone, with these, who in their<note n="*" place="margin">Novem. 2. 1642<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

(who now usually recommend men to these places more for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ends and interests, then the Kings or Kingdoms benefit;) therfore it is but just &amp;
equitable that they should have the principall nomination and recommendation of
them to the King, rather then any others whomsoever; &amp; that the King should rather
confide herein to their unbiased Iudgements, then to his most powerfull trustiest
Minions; who would out the Parliament of this just priviledge, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
engrosse it to themselves; and none might mount to any places of publike trust,
but by their deare-purchased private Recommendations; the cause of so many unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
untrusty, corrupt publike Officers and Judges of late times, who have (as<note n="p" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iohns</hi> speech concerning Ship-money, 1640.</note> much
as in them lay) endeavoured to enslave both us and our posterities by publike illegall
Resolutions against their Oathes and Consciences.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Though our Kings have usually enjoyed the choice of Judges and State
Officers, especially out of Parliament time; yet this hath been rather by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and peoples permissions, then concessions, and perchance by usurpation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by Sherifes and Lieutenants of Counties Elections, now claimed by the King,
though anciently the Subjects right, as I have proved. And if so, a Title gained only
by Connivance or Usurpation, can be no good plea in Barre against the Parliaments
Interest, when there is cause to claime it: however; the Kings best Title to elect
these publike Officers, is only by an ancient trust reposed in his Predecessors and him,
by the Parliament and Kingdom, with this <hi>tacit condition</hi> in Law (which<note n="*" place="margin">Chapter of Estates upon Condition, <hi>Sect.</hi> 378, 379. and <hi>Cookes</hi> Instit. <hi>f.</hi> 378, 379.</note>

to the Republicke and promote the subjects good and safety.</hi> If then the King at any
time shall breake or pervert this trust, by electing such great Counsellors, Officers, and
Judges as shall willingly betray his Subjects Liberties, Proprieties, subvert all Laws,
foment and prosecute many desperate oppressing Projects to ruine or inthrall the
Kingdom, undermine Religion, and the like (as many such have been advanced of late
yeares;) no doubt the Parliament in such cases as these, may justly regulate, or resume
that trust so far into their own hands, as to recommend able, faithfull persons to these
publike places for the future, without any injury to the Kings Authority. It was a
strange opinion of <hi>Hugh Spensers</hi> (great favourites to King <hi>Edward</hi> the second) which
they put into a Bill in writing,<note n="q" place="margin">

                        <hi>That homage and the Oath of Allegianc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is more by
reason of the Crowne, then by reason of the Person of the King, and is more bound to the
Crowne, then to the Person; which appeares, because that before the descent of the Crowne, no
Allegiance is due to the Person. Therefore put case the King, will not discharge his trust well,
according to reason in right of his Crowne, his Subjects are bound by the Oath made to the
Crowne, to reforme the King and State of the Crowne, because else they could not performe
their Oath. Now it may</hi> (say they) <hi>be demanded, how the King ought to be reformed? By
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> of Law, or by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>? By suite at Law, a man can have no redresse at all, for a man
can have no Iudge, but these who are of the Kings party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which case, if the will of the
King be not according to reason, he shall have nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rrour maintained and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>med.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29602:78"/>
Therefore it behoveth for saving the Oath, when the King will not redresse a thing, and
remove what is evill for the Common people, and prejudiciall to the Crowne, that the thing
ought to be reformed by force, because the King is bound by his Oath to governe his Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and people, and his Lieges are bound to governe in aide of him, and in default of
him.</hi> Whereupon, these <hi>Spensers, of their owne private Authority, tooke upon them by
Vsurpation the sole government both of King and Kingdome, suffering none of the Peeres
of the Realme, or the Kings good Counsellours, appointed by the State, to come neere him to
give him good counsell, not permitting the King so much as to speake to them but in their
presence.</hi> But let this their opinion and private unlawfull practise, be what it will;
yet no doubt it is lawfull for the whole State in Parliament, to take course, that this
part of the Kings Royall trust (the chusing of good publike Counsellours, Officers,
Judges, which much concernes the Republike) be faithfully discharged, by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
such persons of quality, integrity, and ability to all publike places of trust and
judicature, as both King and Kingdome may confide in; which will be so far from depressing, that it will infinitely advance both the Kings Honour, Justice, profit, and
the Kingdomes too.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, It is undeniable, that the Counsellours, Judges and Officers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
are as well the Kingdoms Councellours, Officers and Iudges, as the Kings, yea
more the Kingdoms than the Kings, because the King is but for the Kingdoms service
and benefit. This is evident by the Statute of 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 5. which enacts; <hi>that as well
the Chancellour, Treasurer, Keeper of the Privie Seale, the Iustices of the one Bench and
of the other, the Chancellour and Barons of the Exchequer, as Iustices assigned, and all
they that doe meddle in the said places under them, shall make an Oath, well and lawfully
to SERVE the King and HIS PEOPLE, in THEIR OFFICES:</hi> which Oath
was afterward enlarged by 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 3. 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Stat. 3. 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.
c. 2. swearing and injoyning them: <hi>To doe even Law, and execution of right</hi> to all the
Subjects <hi>rich and poore, without having respect to any person,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if any of
them doe, or come against any point of the great Charter, or other Statutes or the Lawes
of the Land by the Statute of</hi> 15 E. 3 c. 3. <hi>he shall</hi> answer to the Parliament, <hi>as well
at the Kings suite, as at the suite of the party.</hi> Seeing then they are as well the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
Councellours, Officers, Iudges, as the Kings, and accountable, responsible for
their misdemeanours in their places, as well to the Parliament and Kingdom as to the
King, great reason is there, that the Parliament, Kingdome (especially when they see
just cause) should have a voice in their elections, as well as the King. The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when our Kings have been negligent in punishing evill Councellours, Officers,
Iudges, our Parliaments out of their care of the publike good, have in most Kings
reignes, both justly questioned, arraigned, displaced, and sometimes adjudged to
death the Kings greatest Counsellours, Officers and Iudges for their misdemeanours:

met againe at the day prefixed, firmely beleeving that the King, according to

them this displeasing answer, by his ill Councellours: (from whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

<hi>very uncivilly bind your Lord the King, to your will, and impose on him an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servile
condition, whiles you would impudently deny to him, that which is lawfull to
every one of your selves. Verily it is lawfull to every one, to use whose and what
councell he listeth.</hi>

but as your servant, if he should be thus inclined to your will. Wherefore he will neither
remove Chancellour, nor Iustice, nor Treasurer, as you have propounded to him to doe;

the other Articles though wholesome enough to the King, and demanded an

                        <hi>Parliament, (commonly called</hi> the good
Parliament <hi>by our Historians) being assembled, the King required a Subsidie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his warres; to which</hi> the Commons <hi>answered;</hi> that they could no longer beare such
charges, considering the manifold most grievous burdens they had from time to time borne
before: and that they knew full well, that the King was rich enough to defend him and his
Land, if his Land and the Treasure were well guided and governed; but it had beene
long evill ruled by evill Officers, so that the Land could not be plenteous neither with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
chaffer, nor riches. By reason whereof, and of their importunate charges the
Commonalty was generally impoverished Moreover, the Commons complained upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Officers that were the causers of this mis-order, whereof the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> (then Lord
Chamberlaine) was principall, and Dame <hi>Alice Piers</hi> the Kings Concubine, (who would
usually in most impudent manner come in person into all Courts of Iustice, and sitting
by the Iudges and Doctors, perswade or disswade them to judge against the Law for her
owne advantage, on that side for which she was engaged; to the great scandall and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of the King, both in his owne and other Realmes:) and Sir <hi>Richard Scurry</hi>
Knight, by whose Councells and sinister meanes the King was mis-guided, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Land disordered. Wherefore they prayed by the mouth of their Speaker,
Sir <hi>Piers de la Mare,</hi> that the said persons with others, might be removed from the
King, and others to be set in authority about his person, as should serve for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and for the weale of his Realme. <hi>Which request of the Commons: by meanes of
the Noble Prince</hi> Edward <hi>was accepted; so that the said persons, with the Duke

PRAEDICTVM <hi>writes</hi> Walsingham, <hi>were put in their places, such as the

thence forth govern both the King and Kingdom (<hi>the King being then in his dotage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to governe himself or the Kingdome</hi>) because the king was growne old and wanted
such Governours. <hi>This passage is thus expressed in the Parliament Roll of</hi> 50. E. 3.
numb. 10. Also the Commons considering the mischiefes of the Land, shewed to the King and
Lords of the Parliament; that it shall be for the honour of the King and profit of all the
Realme, which is now grieved in divers manners by many adversities, as well by the wars of
<hi>France, Spaine, Ireland, Guyon and Bretaigne,</hi> and else-where, as likewise by the
Officers who have been accustomed to be about the King, who are not sufficient at all without
other assistance for so great a government; wherefore they pray that the Councell of our
Lord the King, be inforced (or made up) of the Lords of the Land, Prelates and others
to the number of 10. or 12. (which the King shall please) to remaine continually with the
King, in such manner that no great businesse shall passe or be there decreed without all their
assents and advice; and that other lesser businesses shall be ordered by the assent of 6, or 4. of
them at least, according as the case shall require; so that at least 6. or 4. of such Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

the said request to be honourable and very profitable to him, and to all his Realme,

would grow contemptible among his Subjects, and his command be of no value. The
King therefore who understood as a childe, more regarding the false machinations of
detractors, then the faithfull allegations of his Chauncellour, in a spirit of furie sends
some to demand his seale of him, and to bring it to himselfe. And when the king
had sent againe and againe by solemne messengers, that he should send the seale to him;
the Chauncellour answered thus; I am ready to resigne the Seale, not to you, but to
him who gave it me to keepe, neither shall there be a middle bearer betweene me and
him, but I will restore it to his hands, who committed it to mine owne hands not to
others. And so going to the king; Here delivered the seale, promising that he would
(as he had hitherto) be faithfull to the king; yet denyed that he would hereafter be an

is worthy to be writ in Letters of gold, and worthier to be put in due execution.
For the Universall wealth of all the Realme, it is enacted; that the Chauncellor, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
Keeper of the Privie Seale, Steward of the Kings house, the Kings Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
Clarke of the Rolls, the Iustices of the one Bench and other, Barons of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequor,
and all other that shall be called to ordaine, name, or make Iustices of peace
(which whether the Lord Keeper alone can make or unmake without consent of all
these, or put out of Commission without just cause and conviction, now commonly
practised; is a considerable Question upon this and other statutes:) Sheriffes, Eschea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Customers, Controllers, OR ANY OTHER OFFICER or Minister of the
King, shall be firmely sworne, that they shall not ordaine, name or make Iustices of
peace, Sheriffe, Escheator, Customer, Controller or other Officer or Minister of the
King, for any gift or brocage, favour or affection; nor that none which pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, or by other privily or apertly to be in any manner Office, shall be put in the same
Office, or in any other. But that they make ALL SVCH OFFICERS and Ministers
OF THE BEST &amp; MOST LAWFVLL MEN &amp; SVFFICIENT to their esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

still in force, were it duly executed, there would not be so many corrupt Officers of
all these sorts in the kingdome, as now swarme in every place. From which Act I
shall onely make these 2. Inferences. First, that if so great a care ought to be had
in the choyce of these under-Officers; then certainely farre more of the grand Officers
and Iudges of the kingdome. Secondly, that if it be no disparagement to the Kings
honour, or prerogative for these gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as oft times they doe; then by the same or greater reason, it can be no diminotion
of his honour or prerogative Royall, for the Parliament, (which is best able to judge
of mens abilities and honesties) to have power onely to nominate or recommend to
the King, such as they know to be the best, most lawfull and sufficient men, for the
highest state Offices and places of Iudicature, when they becomevoyd.</p>

the Infant Kings Name, to summon and hold this Parliament, <hi>(so that they authorize

the Dutchy of Normandy, severally shew, that upon King Henry the 5. his decease they
delivered up their severall Seales, after their homage and fealty first made, to King
Henry 6. in the presence of divers honourable persons, (whom they name particularly)
desiring the Lords to attest their surrender of the said Seales at the time and place spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
which they did; and thereupon they pray, that a speciall act and entry thereof
may be made in the Parliament Rolls for their indemnity; which is granted and entred

Commons; that in as much as the Inheritance of the Kingdomes and crownes of France,
England, and Ireland, were now lawfully descended to the King, which title was not
expressed in the Inscriptions of the Kings Seales, whereby great perill might accrue to
the King, if the said inscriptions were not reformed according to his Title of Inheritance,
that therfore in all the Kings Seales, as well in England as in Ireland, Guyen, and Wales,
this new stile should be engraven, <hi>Henricus Dei Gratia, Rex Franciae &amp; Angliae, &amp;
Dominus Hiberniae,</hi> according to the effect of his inheritances; blotting out of them

the said Commons, to their greater consolation, what persons it would please the King to

of his Privie Seale: Vpon which request so made, due consideration being had, and full

accustomed and used; shall not be restrained nor prejudiced, of that which appertaines to

confirmed and setled by this Parliament, after her husbands decease.</hi> And Numb. 41.
Pet. 2. <hi>The Commons petitioned, that it might then be enacted, that no man nor woman
should thenceforth be compelled, nor bound to answer before the Counsell or Chancery of the
King, nor elsewhere, at the suit or complaint of any person for any matter; for which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
by way of Action was provided by the Common law; and that no privie Seale, nor
subpoena should issue thence, before a Bill were first there exhibited, and also fully allowed
by two Iudges of the one Bench and other, that the complainant for matters and grievances
in the said Bill could have no action, nor remedy at all by the common law, &amp;c.</hi> A good
Law to prevent the Arbitrary proceedings of these Courts, which are now too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in subverting of the Common law. Lo here in this Parliament, we have a Lord
Protector, Chancellor, Treasurer, Keeper of the privie Seale, Chamberlaine, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
Counsellors, Constables of Castles, and most other Officers of the King elected
by Parliament; yea, a Commission for calling and holding this Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by this Parliament when met; the Kings owne publike feales altered and new
made; a new stile conferred on the King, a Kings last Will, and a Queenes Dower,
when fallen, confirmed by the Parliament, and the privie Councell, Court of Request,
and Chancery limited by it, without any dimininution of the Kings prerogative roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
what injury or disparagement then can it be to his Majesties royalties, to have

                     <p>For resolving which doubt, we must thus distinguish: That publike or private
Bills are of two sorts. First, Bills only of meere grace and favour; not of common
right: such are all generall pardons, Bills of naturalization, indenization, confirmation,
or concession of new Franchises, and Priviledges to Corporations, or private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the like; in all which the King, no doubt, hath an absolute negative voice to
passe or not to passe them; because they are <hi>acts of meere grace (which delights to be ever
free and arbitrary,) because the king by his oath and duty, is no way obliged to assent
thereto; neither can any subjects of justice or right require them at his hands, it
being in the Kingsfree power, to dispence his favours freely when and where he pleaseth,

king hath no absolute negative voyce at all, but is bound in point of office, duty, Oath,

houses, unlesse he can render such substantiall reasons against the passing of them, as

&amp;c, <hi>It is most apparent, that the Kings of England both by their oath, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

of mischiefs and redresse of greivances of all, or any of their subjects, without
any tergiversation, or unnecessary delayes, when they are passed and tendered to them
by both Houses, and that in such acts as these they have no absolute Negative voice
at all, but ought to give their speedy, free, and full consents thereto, unlesse they can
give satisfactory reasons to the contrary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, All our ancient Kings of England, (as the premises, with all publike use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

and full consents in Parliament to such publike acts as these, without deniall or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
<hi>conceiving they were bound by oath and duty so to doe;</hi> and if they ever deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their royall assents to any <hi>Petitions</hi> or <hi>Bills</hi> of the Lords and Commons of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                     <p>Seventhly, If the King in point of law, should have an absolute negative voice
in denying his assent to publike Bills of meere right, and justice; then he should have
power by law to deny justice and right, and to doe wrong and iniustice to his people;

                     <p>Tenthly, Our very lawes in many cases deny the King an absolute negative voice
or power, even in matters of Prerogative, because they are contrary to his oath, and
mischeivous to the Republike. This appeares most clearly in matters of Pardons, the
Statutes of 2 E. 3. c. 2. 14 E. 3. c. 15. 13 R. 2. c. 1. 16 R. 2. c. 6. enact. <hi>That

or in any one particular whatsoever which concernes the administration of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29602:98"/>
right or common Iustice. Therefore by the selfesame reason, the very law denies him
any such negative voice in refusing his royall assent to Bills of common right and Iustice;
And as both Houses doe alwayes over-rule the King, not He both Houses in the
one; so, by parity and congruity of reason, they ought to oversway him in the other,
there being the same reason in both cases, and the one no greater an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Twelfthly, publike Bills for the Subiects common good, are formed for the most
part, by the Lords and Commons themselves, who in truth (as I have elsewhere proved)
are the chiefe Law-makers, &amp; who (as<note n="c" place="margin">Polit. l. 3, c, 7.</note>

his Royall assent is a judiciall Act in open Parliament, which his oath and duty obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to give, and the Lawes are rather the Parliaments Act which was not forced,

ought to assent unto, and could not without apparent injustice deny to passe, when both

pillaging murthering Cavaleers, (whose grand designe is onely to set up <hi>Popery</hi> and an
absolute tyrannical Government over our consciences, bodies, estates) in defense of their
own persons, priviledges, the Subjects Laws, Liberties, Properties, and our Protestant
established Religion (devoted by Papists to eternall ruine, as we have cause to feare)
to be just, lawfull, and no treason nor rebellion at all against the King, neither in
point of Law nor conscience; And that the Parliaments assessing of men towards the
maintenance of this necessary defensive warre, by an Ordinance of both Houses onely
without the Kings assent, (now wilfully absent from, and in armes against his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and People) with their distraining and imprisoning of such as refuse to pay
it; and their confinement and securing of dangerous Malignants, to be justifiable by
Law and ancient presidents; with other particulars, not yet so fully discussed by
any, as is desired. But this part being already growne somewhat large, and
having lingred much longer at the Presse then I expected; I have thought it more
convenient, to reserve the remainder for a future Treatise by it selfe, then to hinder the

are now more necessitated and engaged to defend themselves then ever, seeing
they have by all possible meanes endeavored to prevent this warre at first, and since to
accommodate it, though in vaine, upon just, reasonable, and honorable safe termes for
King and Kingdome. The sole Question then in this case thus truely stated will be.</p>
                  <p>Whether his Majestie, having contrary to his Oath, Duty, the fundamentall Laws of
God and the Realme, raised an Armie of Malignants, Papists, Forraigners; against
his Parliament, Kingdome, People, to make an Offensive warre upon them, to
murther, rob, spoyle, deprive them of their peace, liberties, properties, estates; to
impose unlawfull taxes by force upon them; protect Delinquents and evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
against the Parliaments Iustice, and violently to undermine our established
Protestant Religion; the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> legally assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and all Subjects in such cases, by Command and direction from both Houses
of Parliament, may not lawfully and justly without any Treason or Rebellion, in point
of Law and Conscience, take up defensive Armes to preserve the Priviledges of
Parliament, their Lawes, lives, liberties, estates, properties, Religion, to bring Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
and ill Councellours to condigne punishment, and rescue his seduced Majestie
out of their hands and power, though he be personally present with them, to assist
and countenance them in this unnaturall destructive warre?</p>
                  <p>And under correction (notwithstanding any thing I ever yet heard or read to the
contrary) I conceive affirmatively, that they may justly do it, both in point of Law and
Conscience. I shall begin with Law, because in this unhappie controversie, it must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the conscience.</p>
                  <p>First, I have<note n="b" place="margin">

assembled in it, to be the Soveraigne power, and of greater authority then the
King, who is but their publike Minister in point of civill Iustice, and Generall in
matters of warre, as the Roman Kings and Emperours were, and other forraigne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29602:105"/>
Kings of old and at this day are. The Parliament then being the highest power, and
having principall right and authority to denounce, conclude and proclaime warre, (as
I have manifested in the debate of the <hi>Militia,</hi>) may not onely lawfully resist, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne,

                  <p>Secondly, the principall end of the Kingdomes, originall erecting Parliaments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting
them with supreame power at first, was, to defend not onely with good Lawes
and Councell, but when absolute necessitie requires (as now it doth,) with open

to fight with Counsell: For if this were not so, and the State and Subjects in such cases
might not lawfully take up armes, all things had long ere this been in the power of
Kings. Therefore, no doubt, our Parliament and State, as well as others, may by the

on them by God and their people, according to the Law of God, and their
Realmes, to the Protection, encouragement and praise of all their good Subjects, and
the deserved punishment onely of Malefactors; they must and ought to be cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obeyed, and quietly submitted to, as Gods owne Ministers, without the least resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
private or publike; neither ought any private men upon any private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
of their owne authority to raise up in Armes against them, seeing they are
publike Magistrates in whom all the Kingdome have an interest, without the generall
assent and authority of the whole State and Kingdome, or of both Houses of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which represents it. But if Kings degenerate into Tyrants, and turne professed
enemies to their Kingdomes, Parliaments, People, by making open Warre against
them; by spoyling, murthering, imprisoning, maiming, sacking, destroying, or
putting them out of their Protections, without any just or lawfull grounds, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by force of Armes to subvert their Lawes, Liberties, Religion, and expose
them as a prey to their mercilesse blood-thirsty Souldiers; or bring in Forraigne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to conquer them, (our present case;) I dare confidently averre, it was never the
thought nor intention of <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Holy Ghost, much lesse of our Nobles, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,
and Commons in Parliament, which enacted these Lawes (who so oft tooke
up Armes, aswell offensive, as defensive, against our Kings, in such like cases hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
to inhibit Subjects, Kingdomes, Parliaments (especially, by direct Votes
and Ordinances of both Houses) under paine of damnation, high Treason, or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
by defensive Armes to resist Kings themselves, or any of their Cavalliers: and
if this question had beene put to <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> or any of those Parliaments, which
enacted these objected Lawes; <hi>Whether they ever meant by these Precepts or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
totally to prohibite all Subjects, by generall assent in Parliament, to take up such
defensive Armes, or make any forceable resistance, against their Kings or their Armies,
in such cases of extremity and necessity as these, under the foresaid penalties?</hi> I make
little question, but they would have clearely resolved; that it was never so much as
within the compasse of their thoughts, much lesse their plaine intention, to prohibite
such a resistance, in this or such like cases, but onely according to the precedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of their words; and that they never imagined to establish in the world any
Vnresistable Lawlesse Tyranny, or any such spoile or butchery of Kingdomes, of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
execrable to God and man, in all persons, all ages, which have<note n="*" place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Beards</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater of Gods Iudgements, <hi>l. 2. c. 13. to</hi> 42.</note> resisted them even

Pillaging, and spoiling of his Majesties people and Subjects, and making

                  <p>Secondly, It is irrefragable, that the Subjects in defence of their own Persons,

the Kings own illegall Commission) may not onely lawfully arme themselves, and

which many of them now exceedingly vilifie, and trample under feete: and
therefore deserve a severer censure then this statute inflicts; even such as the Act of 21.
R. 2. c. 6. prescribed to those Nobles unjustly fore judged in that Parliament; <hi>That
their issues males now begotten shall not come to the Parliaments, nor to the Councells of
the King nor his heires; nor be of the Kings Counsell nor of his heires;</hi> Therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable,
that the Sherifes, Iustices of Peace, Majors, Constables, Leivtenantes, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,

Authority (much more by an Ordinance and Act of association of both houses) raise

Delinquents notwithstanding any royall Commission or personal commands they may

Sixthly, suppose the King should be captivated, or violently led away by any forraign
or domesticke enemies to him and the kingdome, and carried along with them in the
field, to countenance their warres and invasions upon his loyallest Subjects, by ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
warrants or Commissions fraudulently procured, or extorted from him. If the
Parliament and Kingdome in such a case, should raise an Army to rescue the King out
of their hands, and to that end encountring the enemies, should casually wound the
King whiles they out of loyalty sought onely to rescue him; I would demaund of
any Lawyer or Divine, whether this Act should be deemed Treason, Rebellion or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty
in the Parliament or army? Or which of the two Armies should in point of
Law or Conscience be reputed Rebells or Traytors in this case? those that come one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to rescue the King, and so fight really for him indeed, though against him in shew;
and wound him in the rescue? Or those who in shew onely fought for him, that they
might still detaine him captive to their wills? Doubtlesse there is no Lawyer, nor
Theologue but would presently resolve in such a case, that the Parliaments Army
which fought onely to rescue the King were the loyall Subjects; and the Malignants
army who held him captive with them, the onely Rebels and traytors; and that the
casuall wounding of him (proceeding not out of any malicious intention, but love and
loyalty to redeeme him from captivity,) were no trespasse nor offence at all, being quite

in a Parliament soone after sommoned at <hi>Winchester,</hi> Anno 1266. the Earle and his
Army were dis-inherited as Traytors and Rebels; but those who rescued them though
with danger to his person, rewarded as his loyall subjects. And is not this the present
case? A company of malignant ill Councellors, Delinquents, Prelates, Papists, have
withdrawne his Majestie from his Parliament, raised an Army of Papists, Forraigners,
Delinquents and Male-contents, to ruin the Parliament, Kingdome, Religion, Lawes,
Liberties; to countenance this their designe, they detaine his Majestie with them, and
engage him all they can on their side: the Parliament out of no disloyall intention,
but onely to rescue his Majesties person out of their hands, to apprehend delinquents,
preserve the Kingdome from spoyle, and defend their Priviledges, Persons, Liberties,
estates, religion, from unjust invasion, have raised a defensive Army, which encountred
these Forces at <hi>Edgehill,</hi> (where they say the King was present) slew the Lord Generall

this his magnanimous answer, released him from his bonds, (though he slew the rest)

kings, who have violently assaulted them, even to the casuall death of the assailants:
Why men by the selfesame Law, may not justly defend themselves against the unjust
assailing warres of their Princes, and Armies, without Treason or Rebellion, exceeds
my shallow understanding to apprehend: and I doubt those very persons who now
plead most against it, onely to accomplish their owne pernicious designes, would
make no scruple of such a necessary defensive wars and resistances lawfulnesse, were
the case but really their own; and those Papists and Cavalieers who now take up armes
against the Parliament, the supreamest lawfull power in the Realme, and their owne
native Country, without checke of Conscience, would doubtlesse make no bones at all
forcibly to resist or fight against the King himselfe, should he but really joyne with the
Parliaments Army, against them and their designes; there being never any Souldier or
Polititian, but those onely who were truely sanctified and religious, that made any
conscience of fighting against, yea murthering of his naturall king, not onely in a

them, destroy and wast them in an open Hostile manner, and handle them as cruelly

they have a particular interest and ingagement to defend their owne persons, estates,

besiegeth one of the Earles Castles; and not being able to winne it, and ashamed to
raise his Seige without gaining it, he sent certaine Bishops to the Earle, and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
him; that since he had besieged his Castle, and hee could not with Honour
depart without winning it, which he could not doe by force, that the Earle to save
his Honour would cause it to be surrended to him, upon this condition, <hi>That hee
would restore it certainely to him within 15. dayes, and that by advise of the Bishops

became his Pledges, and the King appointed a meeting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> on a set
day betweene Him and the Lords: whereupon the Earle surrendred the Castle to the
King, upon Oath made by the Bishops that it should be restored at the day. But the
King refusing to deliver the Earle the Castle, according to promise, and threatning to
subdue his other Castles; the Earle hereupon raiseth his Forces, winnes his Castle
againe, routs divers of the Kings Forraigne Forces, at <hi>Gorsemond, Monmouth,</hi> and
other places; and invaded the lands of his Enemies. <q>Vpon this occasion, Frier <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellus</hi>
(or <hi>Lambe</hi>) acquaints the Earle, what the King, together with his Counsell
and Court, thought of his proceedings; to wit, that the King said, he had proceeded
over traiterously, and unjustly against him, yet he was willing to receive him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
if he would wholly submit himselfe to his mercy; and that others held it not
just, safe, and profitable for him to doe it; because he had done wrong to the King,
in that before the King had invaded his Lands or Person, he invaded and destroyed
the Kings Lands, and flew his men; and if he should say, he did this in defence of
his body and inheritance; they answered, no, because there was never any plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
either of them; and that were it true, yet he ought not thus to breake forth
against the King his Lord, untill hee had certaine knowledge, that the King had
such intensions against him: <hi>ET EX TVNC LICERET TALIA
ATTEMPTARE;</hi> and from thenceforth he might lawfully attempt such things,
(by the Courtiers and Friers owne Confessions:) Vpon which the Marshiall said to
Frier <hi>Lambe:</hi> To the first they say, that I ought to submit my selfe, because I have
invaded the King: it is not true, because the King himselfe, (though I have beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ready to stand to the Law and judgement of my Peeres in his Court, and have
oft times requested it by many messengers betweene us, which he alwaies denied to
grant) violently entred my Land, and invaded it against all justice: whom hoping
in humility to please, I freely entred into a forme of peace with him, which was
very prejudiciall to me: wherein he granted, that if on his part all things were not
punctually performed toward me, I should be in my pristine state before that peace
concl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ded; namely, that I should be without this homage, and obsolved from my
allegiance to him, as I was at first by the Bishop of Saint <hi>Davids;</hi> Seeing then hee
hath violated all the Articles of the Peace, IT WAS LAWFVLL FOR
ME, According to my agreement, to recover what was mine owne; and to
debilitate his power by all meanes; especially seeing he end eavoured my destruction,
dis-inheritance, and seizing of my Body, of which I have certaine intelligence, and
am able to prove it if neede be. And which is more, after the 15. daies truce, before
I entred <hi>Wales,</hi> or made any defence, he deprived me of the Office of Marshall,
without judgement, which belongs to me, and I have enjoyed by Inheritance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would he by any meanes restore mee to it; though required. Whence I have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29602:118"/>
plainely learned, that he will keepe no peace with me, seeing since the Peace hee
handles me worse then before. <hi>Whereby I ceased to bee his Subject, and was absolved
from his homage by him. Wherefore it was, and is lawfull for me to defend my selfe,
and to withstand the malice of his Counsellors by all meanes.</hi> And whereas the
Kings Counsellors say, it is profitable for me to submit to the Kings mercy because he
is more rich and powerfull then I am. It is true, the King is richer and more potent
then I, but yet he is not more powerfull then God, who is Iustice it selfe, in whom
I trust, in the confirmation and prosecution of my right, and of the Kingdomes. And
whereas they say, the King can bring in Strangers of his kinred, who are neither
<hi>Scots,</hi> nor <hi>French,</hi> nor <hi>Welsh,</hi> who shall make all his foes his Foot-stoole, and come in
such multitudes, as they shall cover the face of the earth, and that he can raise seven
men to my one: I neither trust in Strangers, nor desire their confederacie,
nor will I invoke their aide, <hi>Vnlesse,</hi> which God forbid, <hi>inopinata &amp; immutabili
fuero compulsus necessitate;</hi> I shall be compelled by a sudden and immutable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
and I beleeve by his Counsells ill advise he will quickly bring in such mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Strangers, that he will not be able to free the Kingdome of them againe;
for I have learned from credible men, that the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> is bound to
the Emperour, that the will make the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> subject to him; which
God in his providence avert. And whereas they say, That I may confide in the King
and his Counsell, because the King is mercifull, credible, &amp;c. It may well be that the
King is mercifull; but he is seduced be the Counsell of those, by whom we feele our
selves much hurt; and he is Noble and credible (whom God long preserve so) as
much as in him lies; but as for his Counsell, I say, that no one promise made
to me, was ever yet kept, and they have violated many corporall Oathes made to
me, and the Oathes they tooke for observing <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

                     <q>Whereas the said Counsellors of the King say, that I invaded the Kings body at
<hi>Gorsmund</hi> Castle, before the King had entred my Land; and so I did injurie to
the King, for which I ought to implore his mercie, least others should take example
thence to raise up Armes against the King. I answer, that I was not there in person;
and if any of my Family were there by chance, they invaded onely the Family of
the King, not the person of the King: which yet if they had done, it were no
wonder, seeing the king came with his Army into my Land, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
me, and oppresse me by all the meanes he could, which may appeare to all
by the tenor of his Letters, by which hee made a generall assembly throughout
<hi>England</hi> against my Army. And since the premises objected against mee are false,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29602:119"/>
and it is true, that the King hath treated me worse since the time I expected his
mercy, then any time before, and doth yet use the same Counsell as then; and
since he endeavours precisely to follow their Counsels in all things, by whose
advise I suffer all the premised grievances; I ought not to prostitute my selfe to
his mercy. Neither would this be for the Kings honour, that I should consent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his will, which is not grounded upon reason. Yea, I should doe an injury to
him, and to Iustice, which he ought to use towards his Subjects, and to maintaine.
And I should give an ill example to all, by deserting Iustice, and the prosecution of
right, for an erronious will against all Iustice, and the injury of the Subjects: For by
this it would appeare, that we loved our worldly possessions, more then Iustice it
selfe. And whereas the Kings Counsellours object, that wee have combined with
the Kings capitall enemies, namely, the <hi>French, Scots, Welsh,</hi> out of hatred and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to king and kingdome: That of the <hi>French</hi> is altogether false, and that of the

who were not the kings enemies, but faithfull friends, untill by injuries offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them by the King and his Counsell, they were by coertion against their wills, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated
from their fidelitie, as I am. And for this cause I am confederated with them,
that we may the better being united, then separated, regaine and defend our rights, of
which we are unjustly deprived, and in a great part spoiled. Whereas the Kings
Counsell propose, that I ought not to confide in my Confederates, because the
King, without any great hurt to his Land, can easily separate them from my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
Of this I make no great doubt, but by this the iniquity of his Counsellors
doth most of all appeare: that in some sort they would cause the King to sustaine
losse, by those whom he specially calls, capitall enemies, to injure mee who have
alwaies beene his faithfull Subject, whiles I remained with him, and yet would
be so, if he would restore to me and my friends our right. Whereas the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
say, that the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doe specially love the King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and will Excommunicate all his adversaries, which thing is even at the
dores, because they have already sent for a Legate: It pleaseth mee well, said the
Marshall; because the more they love the King and kingdome, by so much the
more will they desire that the King should treat his Realme and Subjects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to justice: And I am well pleased they should excommunicate the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Kingdome, because they are those who give Counsell against Iustice,
whom workes will manifest; because Iustice and Peace have kissed each other; and
because of this, where Iustice is corrupted, Peace is likewise violated. Also I am
pleased that a Legate is comming, because the more discreet men shall heare our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
by so much the more vilely shall the adversaries of Iustice be confounded.</q> In
which notable discourse we see the lawfullnesse of a necessary defensive Warre
yeelded and justified both by the King, his Counsell, and the Earle Marshall, as well
against the King himselfe, if he invade his Subjects first, as any of his Forces who
assist him. After which the Marshall flew many of his Enemies by an Ambuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

taking up Armes then against this Traytor and enemie of the Realme, in pursuance of

no Treason, nor Rebellion at all in point of Law, but a just &amp; honorable action:
Wherefore their taking up Armes is not mentioned in this Act of oblivion, seeing they
all held it just, but their putting <hi>Piers</hi> to death, without legall triall; which in strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Law, could not be justified. Now whether this be not the Parliaments and
kingdomes present case in point of Law (who tooke up armes principally at first, for
defence of their owne Priviledges of Parliament, and apprehention of delinquents
who seducing the king withdrew him from the Parliament, and caused him to raise

Wills of the great men and of his people, to maintaine and defend his Lands, and to

                  <p>From which Act of Parliament I shall observe these three things. First, that this

against the King, though it were by way of offence, not of defence, and without any
authority of Parliament: for there is not one word of Treason or Rebellion in this
Act, or in the Charter of pardon pursuing it: and if it had beene high Treason, this
Act and Charters on it extending onely to <hi>Fellonie and Trespasses</hi> not to <hi>Treasons</hi> and

                        </gap>l crimes.</hi> Secondly, that
the unlawfull outrages, robberies, and murders committed by the souldiers on the kings
leige people, and not on the two <hi>Spensers</hi> the sole delinquents, were the occasion of
this Act of oblivion and pardon, not the Armed pursuing of them, when they had
gotten above the reach of Law. Thirdly, that though this were an offensive not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
warre, made without common assent of Parliament, and many murthers, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
and misdemeanors committed in the prosecution of it upon the kings leige peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who were no Delinquents; yet being for the common good to suppresse and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
these ill Councellors, enemies, Traytors to King and Kingdome, the King and
Parliament though it such a publicke service as merited a pardon of these misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
in the carriage of it, and acquitted all who were parties to it, from all suites and
punishments. All which considered, is a cleare demonstration, that they would have
resolved our present defensive warre, by Authoritie of both Houses, accompanied
with no such outrages as these; for the apprehension of such as have beene voted
Traytors and Delinquents by Parliament, and stand out in contempt against its ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
for the defence of the Priviledges and Members of Parliament, the Liberties and
properties of the subject, the fundamentall lawes of the Realme, the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
now indangered by Papists up in Armes in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to extirpate it,
and the removing ill Counsellors from his Majestie; to be no high Treason, Rebellion
or offence at all against the king, but a just and lawful Act, the very miscarriages wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the generall (except in such disorderly Souldiers for whom martiall Law hath
provided due punishments) deserve a publike pardon both from King and Kingdome.
And to put this out of Question; as no fancie of mine owne, we have an expresse Act
of Parliament, resolving the taking up of Armes by the Queene, Prince, (both but
subjects and capable of High Treason in such a case as well as others) the Nobles and
people of the Realme against these two <hi>Spensers</hi> and other ill Counsellors about this
king in the last yeare of his raigne, (though the King himself were in their Company,
and taken prisoner by the Forces raised against them,) for the necessary preservation,
reliefe, and safety of the Queene, Prince, Nobles, Kingdome, to be no high Treason
nor offence at all: namely, the statute of 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 1. 2. 3. which I shall recite at large.<q>Whereas <hi>Hugh Spenser</hi> the Father, and <hi>Hugh Spenser</hi> the Sonne, late at the suite of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>

casting out some reproachfull words against the Nobles and Kings councell who had
the rule of the kingdome and neglected its defence: Whereupon the Nobility, Earles

for this his Noble praise-worthy action, began not onely secretly to lay snares for him,

<q>If ever God gave victory to men fighting in a just quarrell; or if he ever aided
such as made warre for the wealth and tuition of their owne naturall and nutritive
Countrey: or if he ever succoured them which adventured their lives for the reliefe
of Innocents, suppression of malefactors, and apparent Offenders; No doubt, my
Fellowes and Friends, but he of his bountifull goodnesse will this day send us trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
victory, and a lucky revenge over our proud Enemies, and arrogant adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for if you remember and consider the very cause of our just quarrel, you shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
perceive the same to be true, godly, and vertuous. In the which I doubt not
but God will rather ayde us, (yea, and fight for us) then see us vanquished, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
by such as neither feare him, nor his Lawes, nor yet regard Iustice and honesty.
Our cause is so just, that no enterprise can be of more vertue, both by the Laws Divine
and Civill, &amp;c. If this cause be not just, and this quarrell godly, let God, the giver
of victory judge and determine, &amp;c. Let us therefore fight like invincible Gyants,
and set on our enemies like untimorous Tygers, and banish all feare like ramping Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
March forth like strong and robustious Champions, and begin the battaile like
hardy Conquerors; the Battell is at hand, and the Victory approacheth, and if wee
shamefully recule, or cowardly fly, we and all our sequele be destroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

already meditated of, already prepared; and also not thought upon, but very likely,
possible: yet neither this last simply; or would I call it just, to endeavour this war,
as soone as ever any should be made too potent; which I doe not affirme. For what
if any Princes power should be increased by successions, by elections; wilt thou
trouble him with warre, because his power may be dangerous to thee? Another

what they have thought of a just war, attend.</p>

that cure which is future. But even Warre might have beene undertaken without
that evill of an unfaithfull Peace. As there be many bonds of neerenesse between

or cleere mistakes through the mis-stating of the points in question, with which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
many have beene hitherto deluded by the Opposites, who cumbate onely with

consciences, more punctually state the Question, then formerly in the Legall Part; first,
<hi>Negatively,</hi> next, <hi>Positively;</hi> and then proceede to its debate. Take notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, that this is no part of the question in dispute.</hi> Whether the Parliament, or any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Subjects wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Kings, or any other lawfull Magistrates just commands, warranted either by Gods
Word, or the Lawes of <hi>England? it being out of controversie, readily subscribed by
all of both sides; that</hi> Such commands ought not so much as to be disobeyed, much lesse
forcibly resisted but cheerefully submitted to, and readily executed for Conscience sake,
Rom. 13. 1. to 6. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Tit. 3. 1. Hebr. 13. 17. Iosh. 1. 16, 17, 18. Ezra.
7. 26. Eccles. 8 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>the onely thing these objected Scriptures prove, which
come not neere the thing in question, though our Opposites most rely upon them.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly, Neither is this any branch of the dispute:</hi> Whether Subjects may lawfully
rise up, or rebell against their Prince, by way of Muteny, Faction, or Sedition, without
any just, or lawfull publicke ground; or for every trifling injury, or provocation offered
them by their Prince? Or whether private men, for personall wrongs (especially where
their lives, chastities, livelihoods are not immediatly endangered, by actuall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
unjust assaults) may in point of Conscience, lawfully resist, or rise up against
their Kings, or any other lawfull Magistrates? <hi>Since all disavow such tumultuous
Insurrections and Rebellions in such cases: yet this is all which the oft objected Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

of their Lives or Liberties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doe not actually nor personally assault their lives or chastities; or for any publike mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours,
without a precedent sentence of Imprisonment, or death against them given
judicially, by the whole States or Realmes, where they have such Authority to araigne
and judge them? <hi>For allunanimously disclaime, yea abominate such Traitorous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
and Iesuiticall Positions, as execrable and unchristian: yet this is all which
the example of</hi> Davids not offering violence to King Saul: <hi>the</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 3. <hi>to</hi> 22.
cap. 26. 2. to 25. 2 Sam. 1. 2. to 17. <hi>or that perverted Text of</hi> Psal. 105. 15. (<hi>the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Neither is this the thing in difference, as most mistake it.</hi> Whether the
Parliament may lawfully raise an Army to goe immediately and directly against the
very person of the King, to apprehend or offer violence to him, much lesse intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to destroy him, or to resist his owne personall attempts against them, even to the
hazard of his life? <hi>For the</hi> Parliament, <hi>and their</hi> Army <hi>too, have in sundry</hi>

they make the onely <hi>Questions;</hi> when not so much as one of them comes within the
Verge of that which is the reall Controversie; and never once naming that in all,
or any of their Writings, which is the point indeed? Secondly, Whether there bee
any one Text or Reason in all their Pamphlets, particularly applied to any thing
which concernes the present Warre, but onely to these foure particulars, which are
not in debate? And if so, (as no Conscience can gaine-say it) then there is nought in

<hi>That the Parliaments Defensive Armes and resistance are unlawfull in point

                     </note> My first Argument to justifie resistance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
from them shall be this. That violence against the Subjects persons, Consciences, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Estates, Properties, Priviledges, or Religion, which neither the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in proper person, nor any his Officers, nor Souldiers by command from him,
have any Autoritie by the Lawes of God or man, in Law or Conscience to inflict:
and which in Conscience ought not to be obeyed, but rejected as a meere nullity, even
by the instruments enjoyned for to execute it; may justly with a safe Conscience be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esisted by the Parliament and Subjects; there being not one syllable in Gods Word
to contradict it. But the violence now offered by the Kings Forces to the Parliament
and Snubjects every where, is such. Therefore it may justly with a safe Conscience be
resisted; especially in the Kings Commanders and Souldiers, who are neither the King
himself, nor the Higher Powers ordained by God; and no other then plain Theeves
and Murtherers in Law and Conscience, if they plunder, kill, spoile; their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being but Nullities in both; and they in this particular meere private men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Authority to iustifie their actions, as I have already proved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That resi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Scripture even by God himself, must questionlesse be lawfull in case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
But the resistance even of Kings, their highest Magistrates, officers in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of their unjust Commands is thus warranted. Therfore, doubtles, it must be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in point of Conscience. The <hi>Minor</hi> (only questionable) is thus confirmed. First, by

from heaven, doubled by God himselfe; That it is lawfull for Subjects in some
cases, to resist the unjust violence of the Souldiers and Captaines of their Kings
though armed with their Regall Commands. Secondly, by the History of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Elisha, 2 Kings</hi> 6. 31, 32, 33. Who when <hi>King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oram</hi> (his Soveraigne) had
sworne unjustly in his fury; <hi>God doe so to me and more also, if the heàd of Elisha
shall stand on him this day;</hi> and thereupon sent <hi>a Messenger before him to Elisha his
house to take away his head;</hi> the Prophet was so farre from submitting to this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his; that he <hi>Commanded the Elders sitting then with him in the house, to looke
when the Messenger came, and shut the doore, and <hi>Hold him fast at the Doore,</hi> though
the sound of his Masters feet</hi> (the King) <hi>were behind him;</hi> whom he stiles, <hi>the sonne
of a Murderer.</hi> Might these two eminentest Prophets thus openly resist the Captaines,
Souldiers, and unjust Executioners of their Princes, with a good Conscience; and
may not others lawfully doe the like? No doubt they may. Thirdly, (If I bee
not much mistaken) this kind of resistance is warranted even by Christ himselfe,
and his Apostles: For a little before his Apprehention, Christ uttered this speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Disciples, <hi>Luke 22. 36, 37, 38. But <hi>Now,</hi> he that hath no Sword, let him sell

that they are the Kings Souldiers, sodainely seise and gaine all the armes, treasure, forts,

destructive mischiefes to People, Kingdome, Kings themselves, God himselfe
hath left us no other certaine, proper, sufficient remedy but a forcible resistance, which
all Kingdomes, Nations throughout the world, haue constantly used in such cases, as
I shall manifest more largely in the <hi>Appendix.</hi> Therefore certainely it must needs bee
lawfull, being Gods and Natures speciall Ordinance to secure innocent persons, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Nations, Kingdomes, Lawes, Liberties, Lives, Estates, Religion, and mankinde
it selfe, against the hurtfull Lusts of unnaturall Tyrants, and their accursed instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29602:139"/>
against ambitious, treacherous, male-contented Spirits, maliciously bent against
the publicke weale, and peace. There are two things onely which usually restraine
inferiour persons from murthering, robbing, disseising, injuring one another; the one
is, feare of punishment by the Magistrate; the other, feare and danger of being resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
repulsed with shame and losse of limbe or life by those they violently assault,
injure; and were this once beleeved, received for Law or Divinity in the world, that
it were unlawful to resist, repulse a theefe, murtherer, riotor, or disseisor comming in the
Kings name, long enjoy his life, goods, liberty, lands, but some or other would
deprive him of them notwithstanding all restraints of Lawes, of penalties, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
suites against him with his owne estate violently seised on; the right of
lawfull defence, being every mans best security, to preserve his life, estate, in peace
against the violence of another, whence the wisdom of the Common Law, makes every
mans house his Castle, in the necessary defence wherof, and of his person, goods from
the violence, rape of others, it gives him libertie to beate, repulse, yea kill injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
assailants: which right of defence if once denyed, would open a wide gap to all
wickednesse, injustice, disorders whatsoever, and speedily bring in absolute confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
subversion of all property, Law, Order. As for Emperors, Kings, great
Officers, and other ungodly instruments, armed with Princes unjust commissions,
who deeme themselves above the reach of humane Lawes, censures, and accountable
for their unjust actions to none but God himselfe, there is no other knowne barre or
obstacle to hinder or restraine their armed violence, Tyrannie, oppressions, but onely
the feare of the oppressed assaulted subjects armed resistance; which if once denyed
to be lawfull, all Royalties would soone be transformed into professed Tyranni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Kings &amp; Magistrates into Tyrants, all Liberty into slavery, property into communitie,
and every one would thereby be exposed as a voluntary prey to the arbitrary cruelty
covetousnesse, avarice, lusts, of the greatest men. Therefore doubtlesse this armed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
cannot but be lawfull, necessary, just, in point of Law and Conscience, to
eschew these generall mischiefes.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, all will readily grant it lawfull in case of Conscience, for subjects to resist a
forraigne enemie which invades them with force of Armes, though animated by the
King himselfe to such invasion; and why so, but because they are their enemies, who
would wrongfully deprive them of their native inheritance, Liberties, estates, and
worke them harme; upon which ground, we read in the 2 <hi>Kings 3. 21. That when the
Moabites heard that the Kings of Israel, Iudah and Edom came up to fight against them
with a great Army, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward to
withstand them, and stood in the border;</hi> and when ever the <hi>Midianites, Phili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ines, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Babylonians, Aegyptians, Cananites</hi> or other enemies came to assault the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
they presently assembled together in Armes to encounter and repulse them, as
the Histories of <hi>Ioshua, Iudges, Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Kings, Chronicles,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
evidence, almost in every Chapter. If then Subjects may with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
resist forragin enemies on this ground alone; then likewise domestick foes and
their Kings own Forces, when they become open enemies, to rob, kill, plunder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them as inhumanely, as injuriously as the worst Forraigne foes, there being the
selfe same ground for the lawfulnesse of resistance of the one as the other, and if the
ballance encline to one side more than other, an intestine enemie being more unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
unjust, hurtfull, dangerous, and transgressing more Lawes of the Realme
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29602:140"/>
(which obliege not strangers) than a Forraigner, and a Civill warre being far worse,
and more destructive than a Forraigne; the resistance of an homebred enemy, must
be the more just and lawfull of the two, even in point of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The very Law of God both alloweth and commands all men, to resist
their spirituall enemies, with spirituall Armes: <hi>Iam 4. 7. Resist the Devill and he will

to withstand in the evill day, and having done all, to stand: Stand therefore having

Officer to Kings, yea God himselfe (whose prerogative only it is to have an<note n="*" place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 19. 20.</note> absolute

defensive resistance now used by the Parliament and Subjects, is such: For if they
may not resist any of the Kings Officers or Souldiers in their plunderings, rapines,
fierings, sackings of Townes, beating, wounding, murthering the Kings leige peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

than a Turkish slave, and exposed to as many uncontrolable Soveraignes, as there are
Souldiers in the Kings Army, be their conditions never so vile, their qualitie never so

to these new absolute Soveraignes lusts and wills.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Twelfthly, if all these will not yet satisfie Conscience in the Lawfulnesse, the
justnesse of the Parliaments and peoples present forcible resistance of the Kings
Captaines and Forces, though Armed withan illegall Commission (which makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all in the case, because voyd in Law) there is this one Argument yet remaining
which will satisfie the most scrupulous, malignant, opposite Conscience: That neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

Paramount the King himselfe, who is but the Parliaments and Kingdomes Publicke

                  <p>Thus much for the Lawfulnesse in Court of Conscience of resisting the Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly

                  <p>That the Kings Army of Papists and Malignants, invading the Parliaments or
Subjects persons, goods, Lawes, Liberties, Religion, may even in Conscience bee
justly resisted with force, though accompanied with his person, seemes most apparently
cleare to me, not only by the preceeding Reasons, but also by many expresse Authorities
recorded, and approved in Scripture, not commonly taken notice of: as,</p>
                  <p>First, By the ancientest precedent of a defensive warre that we read of in the world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and taking <hi>Lot,</hi> and his goods along with them as a prey: hereupon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

thereby justifying his and his peoples forcible defence, against their invading enemies,
in the behalfe of his captivated plundred Nephew and Neighbors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the Example of the Israelites, who were not onely King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

even to the red Sea, to reduce them; hereupon the <hi>Israelites</hi> being astonished and
murmuring against <hi>Moses,</hi> giving themselves all for dead men; <hi>Moses sayd unto the
people feare ye not, stand still, and see the Salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you
this day: for the Aegyptians whom you have seene to day, ye shall see them againe no more
for ever, the Lord shall fight for you, &amp;c. And hereupon God himselfe discomfited rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and drowned them all in the red Sea:</hi> I would demaund in this case, whether the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29602:142"/>
with his presence, had they had power and hearts to doe it, as well as God
himselfe, who fought against and destroyed them on their behalfe; If so, (as all men
I thinke must grant, unlesse they will censure God himselfe) then a defensive warre
in respect of life and liberty onely, is just and Lawfull even in conscience, by this
most memorable story.</p>

                  <p>Finally, by the History of the Maccabees and wholestate of the Iews defensive wars
under them, which though but Apochryphall in regard of the compiler, yet no doubt
they had a divine Spirit concurring with them in respect of the managing and Actors
in them. I shall give you the summe thereof, very succinctly. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>
conquering Ierusalem, spoyled it and the Temple, set up Heathenish customes and
Idolatry in it, subverted Gods worship, destroyed the Bookes of Gods Law, forced
the people to forsake God, to sacrifice to Idols, slew and persecuted all that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and exercised all manner of Tyranny against them. Hereupon <hi>Mattathias</hi> a
Priest and his Sonnes, moved with a godly zeale, refusing to obey the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in falling away from the Religion of his Fathers, slew a Iew that sacrificed to
an Idoll in his presence, together with the Kings Commissary, who compelled men
to Sacrifice, and pulled downe their Idolatrous Altar; which done they fled into the
mountaines, whither all the will-affected Iewes repaired to them. Whereupon the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29602:144"/>
Kings Forces hearing the premises pursued them, and warred against them on the
Sabbath day; whereupon they out of an over-nice superstition<note n="o" place="margin">1 Mac. 2. 32. to 42.</note> least they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
the Sabbath by fighting on it when assaulted, answered them not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cast a stone at them, nor stopped the places where they were hid, but said, let us
dye all in our innocencie; heaven and earth shall testifie for us, that you put us to death
wrongfully, whereupon they slew both them, their wives, and children, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
to the number of a thousand persons. Which <hi>Mattathias</hi> and the rest of their
friends hearing of, mourned for them right sore, and said one to another (marke their
speech) if we all doe as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives, and
Lawes against the Heathen, they will now quickly roote us out of the earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they decreed, saying; whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, we will fight against him, neither will we doe all as our brethren, that were
murthered in their secret places. Whereupon they presently gathered and united their
Forces, assaulted their enemies, recovered their Cities, Lawes, Liberties; defended
themselves manfully, and fought many battles with good successe against the severall
kings who invaded and layd claime to their Country, as you may reade at large in the
bookes of Maccabees. All these examples, (most of them mannaged by the most pious,
religious persons of those dayes, prescribed and assisted by God himselfe, whose
Spirit specially encouraged, strengthned the hands and Spirits of the undertakers of
them (as<note n="p" place="margin">Enchirid. Controvers. c. 9. De Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat Polit.</note> 
                     <hi>O fiander</hi> well observes,) and therefore cannot be condemned as unjust,
without blasphemy and impiety:) in my opinion are a most cleare demonstration of
the lawfulnesse of a defensive warre (in point of Divinity and Conscience) against
Kings and their Armies who wrongfully invade or assault their Subjects, though
themselves be personally present in their armies, to countenance their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
warres; and likewise evidence, that a Royall title gotten forcibly by conquest
onely, though continued sundry yeares, is not so valid in point of conscience, but that
it may be safely questioned, yea rejected; there being no true lawfull Title of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignety
over any people, but that which originally depends upon their owne free
election, and unconstrained subjection simply considered, or which is subsequently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
therewith after a possession got by force or conquest.</p>
                  <p>Now that the kings personall presence cannot justifie the unjust actions, or protect
the persons of those that assist him in any unlawfull action contrary to the Lawes of
God, or the Realme, is a truth so evident, that it needes no proofe, it being no part of
the kings Royall prerogative or Office, but diametrally repugnant to it, either to doe
injury himselfe, or to authorize, or protect others in committing it, as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
proved at large. Therefore it can administer no patronage nor defence at all to
those who accompany his person in the unjust invasions of his Subjects, nor dis-able
them to defend or repulse their unjust assaults and rapines. For suppose a King should
so farre degenerate and dishonour himselfe, as personally to accompany a packe of
theeves who should rob his subjects on the high way, break up their houses in the night,
or practise Piracie on the Sea, or commit Rapes or murthers on his people every
where; I thinke no man so voyd of Reason, Law, Conscience, but would readily grant,
that the Subjects in all these cases might lawfully defend themselves by force against
these Robbers, Theeves, Murtherers, notwithstanding the Kings presence or associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with them, whose personall Prerogatives, and immunity from assaults or violence
being incommunicable, underivable to any other, and peculiar to himself alone, he can
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29602:144"/>
transferre no such protection to others who accompany him in their injurious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises;
and that these Acts of theirs are direct fellonie and murther, for which they
might be justly apprehended, condemned, executed, though thus countenanced by the
Kings owne presence. And if this be truth (as our Law-bookes resolve, and the
Scripture to in places forecited) the kings presence can no more deprive the subjects
of their necessary just defence against his Popish Forces assaults, nor justifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
or the present unjust offensive warre, then in the former cases, there
being the selfe-same reason in both; warres being in truth, but greater and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable

violated his Father <hi>Sauls</hi> command, of which he was wholy ignorant in taking a
little honey one the end of his sticke in the pursuite; hereupon king <hi>Saul,</hi> most
rashly and unjustly vowed twice one after another, to put him to death: whereupon
the people much discontented with this injustice, were so farre from submitting to
the Kings pleasure in it, that they presently said to the king: <hi>shall Ionathan dye, who
hath wrought so great Salvation in Israel? God forbid: As the Lord liveth there shall
not one haire of his head fall to the ground, So the people RESCVED IONATHAN
that he dyed not;</hi> though he were not onely King <hi>Sauls</hi> Subject, but Sonne too. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
it appeares not in the Text, that <hi>Saul</hi> offered any violence to <hi>Ionathans</hi> person,
or the people to <hi>Sauls:</hi> and it may be the peoples peremptory vow and unanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to defend <hi>Ionathan,</hi> from this unjust sentence of death against him, made <hi>Saul</hi>
desist from his vowed bloody intendment: but the word <hi>rescued,</hi> with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the story, seeme to intimate, that <hi>Ionathan</hi> was in hold to be put to death,
and that the people forcibly rescued him, out of the executioners hands. However,
certainely their vow and speeches declare, that if <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe or any other by his
command had assaulted <hi>Ionathan</hi> to take away his life, they<note n="*" place="margin">

might lawfully doe it, else they would not have made this resolute vow; nor could
they have performed it, had <hi>Saul</hi> wilfully proceeded, but by a forcible rescue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of his personall violence. The other is that of king <hi>Vzziah, 2 Chron. 27. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

incense, and whiles he was wroth with the Priests, the Leprosie rose up in his forehead:
And Azariah, and all the Priests looked upon him, and behold he was Leprous in
his forehead: AND THEY THRVST HIM OVT FROM THENCE; yea
himselfe hasted also to goe out, because the Lord had smitten him.</hi> If then these Priests
thus actually resisted king <hi>Vzziah</hi> in this sinfull Act, thrusting him perforce out of the
Temple, when he would but offer incense; much more might they, would they have
done it, had he violently assaulted their persons. If any king shall unjustly assault the
persons of any private Subjects, men or women, to violate their lives or chastities
(over which they have no power) I make no doubt, that they may and ought to bee
resisted, repulsed, even in point of conscience, but not slaine; though many kings
have lost their lives, upon such occasions: as<note n="s" place="margin">

should betray their trust, and destroy the City, Fort, ship, and themselves too, which
they are bound by duty and compact to preserve. This case of Law and conscience is so
cleare, so common in daily experience that no man doubts it: The care and safety of our
Realme by the originall politicke constitution of it, alwayes hath beene and now is,
committed joyntly to the king, the Lords, and Commons in Parliament, by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous

to the trust and duty reposed in him, through the advise of evill Councellors
wilfully betrayes the trust and safety of this great City and ship of the Republicke;
invades the inferiour Commanders, Souldiours, Citizens, with an Army: assaults,

Marriners, Citizens, undermines the walls, fires the City, ship, delivers it up to

in this case by force of Armes resist him, and his unnaturall instruments, (there being
no other meanes else of safety left them) they should sinfully and wilfully betray
their trust, and be so farre from keeping a good Christian Conscience in not resisting
by force, that they should highly sinne against Conscience, against their trust and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
against their naturall Country, yea and their very Allegiance to the king himselfe,
by encouraging him in, and consenting unto these proceedings, which would make him
not to be a king, but Tyrant, and destroy him as a king, in the spoyle and ruine of his

it being onely through their owne default, such a casuall accident when it happens, or
the remote possibility of it in the combate before it begins, cannot make the resistance
either unjust or unlawfull in point of conscience; for then such a possibility of danger

had delegated to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> without any injury or injustice at all once

offered to them or any assault upon them. Ergo (marke the Non-sence of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation)
no Subjects may lawfully take up meere necessary defensive Armes in any
case to resist the bloody Tyrannie, Oppression, and outrages of wicked Princes, or
their Cavalleires, when they make warre upon them to destroy or enslave them.</p>
                  <p>An Argument much like this in substance.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> No man ought to rise up against an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Officer or Captaine in the due execution of his Office, when he offers him no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
at all. Therefore he ought not in conscience to resist him when he turnes a theefe
or murtherer, and felloniously assaults him, to rob him of his purse, or cut his
throate. Or, private men must not causelesly mutinie against a lawfull Magistrate
for doing justice and performing his duty: <hi>Ergo</hi> the whole Kingdome in Parliament
may not in Conscience resist the Kings Captaines and Cavalleeres, when they most
unnaturally and impiously assault them to take away their Lives, Liberties, Priviledges,
Estates, Religion, oppose and resist justice, and bring the whole Kingdome to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
desolation. The very recitall of this argument is an ample satisfactory refutation
of it, with this addition. These seditious Levites Rebelled against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
onely because God himselfe had restrained them from medling with the Priests Office
which they would contemptuously usurpe, and therefore were most severely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by God himself, against whose expresse Ordinance they Rebelled: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Kingdome may in no case whatsoever, though the King be bent to subvert
Gods Ordinances, Religion, Lawes, Liberties, make the least resistance against the
king or his invading forces, under paine of Rebellion, High Treason, and eternall
condemnation, This is Doctor <hi>Fernes</hi> and some others, Bedlam Logicke, &amp; Divinity.</p>

(which is well explained by <hi>Prov. 17. 26. It is not good to strike Princes for

                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> the first text pertaines properly to Judges and other sorts of Rulers, not
to Kings, not then in being among the Israelites: the second, to <hi>rich men as well as

nor rich men whatsoever, though never so unjust or wicked, may or ought in
conscience to be resisted in their unjust assaults, Riots, Robberies, no though they be
bent to subvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties: as that the King and his Souldiers joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or severally considered, may not be resisted: yea, these acute disputants may argue
further by this new kinde of Logicke: Christians are expresly prohibited to curse or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
any man whatsoever, under paine of damnation, <hi>Rom. 12. 14. Mat. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

resist no man whatsoever, (no not a theefe that would rob us, cut-throate Cavaleers
that would murther us, lechers that would ravish us) under paine of damnation.
What pious profitable Doctrine, thinke you, is this: All cursings and railings are
simply unlawfull in themselves: all resistance is not so, especially that necessary we
now discourse of, against unlawfull violence to ruine Church and State. To argue
therefore, all resistance is simply unlawfull, because cursing and reviling (of a different
nature) are so, is ill Logicke, and worse Divinity. If the objectors will limit their
resi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Kings and Rulers for executing justice impartially (for so is the chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of the place objected, delinquents being apt to clamour against those who
justly censure them) is unlawfull; <hi>Ergo</hi> the forcible resisting of them in the execution
of justice and their lawfull authority is unlawfull: the sequell I shall grant, but
the Argument will be wholy impertinent, which I leave to the Objectors to
refine.</p>
                  <p>

is there is power; and who may say unto him, what dost thou?</p>
                  <p>This Text administers the Opposites a double Argument, The first is this; All the
Kings Commands are to be kept of all his Subjects,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> by vertue of the Oathes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
alleigance, and the late protestation including them both: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by vertue of
these Oathes we must not resist his Cavalleeres, but yeeld our thoates to their swords,
our purses and estates to their rapines, our chastities to their Lecheries, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to their Tyrannies, our Lawes to their lusts, our Religion to their Popish Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and Blasphemies, without any opposition, because the king hath oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us not to resist them. But seeing the Oath and Law of God, and those oathes
of ours, obleige us onely, to obey the Kings just legall commands and no other, not
the Commands and lusts of evill Councellors and Souldiers, this first Argument must
be better pointed ere it will wound our cause.</p>

are He, or his Forces to be resisted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which I answer, that this verse relates onely
unto God, the next antecedent; <hi>who onely doth and may doe what he pleaseth, and that

                     <hi>Scripture:</hi> was all therefore just,
lawfull, unblameable, because they did herein whatsoever they pleased, not what was
pleasing to God? If not, as all must grant: then your foundation failes; that Kings
may lawfully doe whatsoever they will; and <hi>Solomons</hi> words must be taken all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not by fragments; and these latter words coupled with the next preceeding;
<hi>Stand not in an evill matter:</hi> and then <hi>Pauls</hi> words will well interpret his, <hi>Rom. 13. 4.
But if thou doe that which is evill be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vaine, for he is
the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon them that doe evill.</hi> So that the
genuine sence of the place is, and must be this. <hi>Stand not in an evill matter,</hi> for the
king hath an absolute power to doe whatsoever he pleaseth, in way of justice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
thee, if thou continue obstinate in thy evill courses; to pardon thee, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
submit, and crave pardon for them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the king and his Cavalleeres have an
absolute power to murther, plunder, destroy his Subjects, subvert Religion, and
he and his Forces must not herein be resisted, is an ill consequent from such good
premises.</p>
                  <p>The third is this: <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power,</hi>

they might rather conclude. Therefore neither Kingdome nor Parliament, nor any

hath raised Forces and Armed Papists against the Parliament, and Protestant Religion?

                  <p>Kings themselves must not touch Gods spiritually <hi>annointed</hi> Saints and servants to

onely to harm, but plunder, murther, destroy them utterly, extirpate that Religion they
professe and are bound to maintain, they are obliged in point of conscience, under
pain of damnation, not to resist; Whereas the conclusion should be directly contrary.

their Kings protect themselves in this sort against them, and that by authoritie of this

them from iust necessary resistance? If any, it must rest in the word <hi>annointed;</hi>
but this will afford kings no such corporall priviledges as many fancie, neither from
lawfull resistance, nor deposition, nor sentence of death it self, which I shall undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
evidence to refute a commonly received errour: For, first, it is apparent, that the
anointed here meant, are such onely who are spiritually annointed, either with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
profession and ceremonies of Gods true religion, or with the internall graces of
the Spirit; for neither <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> nor their families (nor any kings
or Priests in their dayes) for ought we finde, were corporally annointed. Besides,
the annointing here intended, is that which is <hi>common</hi> to<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 30. 30 c. 40 13, 15. Levit. 4. 3. 16. 1 King. 19. 16.</note>

<hi>Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm,</hi> infallibly proves) rather then
that which is peculiar to kings. Whence I thus argue, That annoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing which is
common to subiects as well as kings, and cannot secure any subiects, who in the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inesence
of the Text, are <hi>Gods annointed,</hi> from iust resistance, corporall violence, legall
censures, or death, cannot in or of it self alone secure kings from any of these, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then it secures subiects: for the annoiting being the same in both, must have the
self-same operation and immunities in both. But this anointing in subiects can neither
exempt their persons from necessary iust resistance, if they unlawfully assault or war
upon their Superiours, equalls, inferiours; nor free them from arrests, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
arraignments, deprivations, or capitall censures, if they offend and demerit
them, as we all know <hi>by</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Eccles. 92. 6. 8. 14. Ezech. 18. 24, 26. Ioh. 16. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> Therefore it can transfer no
such corporall immunities or exemptions from all or any of these, to kings; but onely,
exempt them from unlawfull violence and injuries, in point of right, so far forth, as it
doth other Subjects. In a word, this annointing being common to all Christians,
can give no speciall Prerogative to Kings, but onely such as are common to all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
as they are Christians. Secondly, admit it be mean of an actuall externall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynting,
yet that of it self affords Kings no greater priviledge then the inward uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of which it is a type, neither can it priviledge them from just resistance, or just
corporall censures of all sorts. First, it cannot priviledge them from the iust assaults,
invasions, resistance, corporall punishments of other forraign kings, Princes, States,
Subiects not subordinate to them, who upon any iust cause or quarrell may lawfully
resist, assault, wound, apprehend, imprison, slay, depose, iudge, censure forraigne
kings, even to death; as is apparent by<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 136. 19, 20. Num. 21. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lawfully have slain him, without check of conscience, and that the persons of kings
not at all annointed; and of hereditary kings before their Coronations, till they are

                     </gap>, then one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
may not repulse the unjust violence of another in an elective kingdome, if by pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
he may afterwards be chosen king, though for the present he be neither actually
king nor Magistrate, but a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> as <hi>David was, Psal.</hi> 78. 70, 71<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I presume
none will affirm, I am certain none can prove: If so then it was not <hi>Sauls</hi> annointing
but onely his Royall Authority, which made <hi>David</hi> thus to spare his life, his person.
So that our Opposites pressing this Argument only from his Annointing, is both false
and idle, as all the premises demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>But to set the Argument right; I answer thirdly, That all which these Texts and
<hi>Davids</hi> example prove, is but this. That Subjects ought not wilfully or purposely to
murder or offer violence to the persons of their kings; especially in cold blood when
they doe not actually assault them. Ergo they may not resist, repulse their personall
actuall assaults, nor oppose their cut-throat Cavaleers when they make an unjust
warre against them. Which Argument is a meer <hi>Non sequitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For 1. <hi>Davids example</hi> extends only to <hi>Sauls</hi> own person, not to his Souldiers, who
were neither kings, nor Gods Annointed; and whom <hi>David</hi> no doubt would have
resisted and slain too had they assaulted him, though he spared <hi>Saul:</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">Soct. 2. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> Dr. <hi>Fern</hi>
himselfe insinuates in these words; <hi>Davids Guard that he had about him, was onely to
secure his person against the cut-throats of Saul, if sent to take away his life, &amp;c. He was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29602:151"/>
annoynted and designed by the Lord to succeed</hi> Saul, <hi>and therefore he might use an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
way of safe-guarding his person:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Therefore he and his Guard would and
might doubtlesse have with a safe conscience resisted, repulsed <hi>Sauls</hi> cut-throat Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
had they assaulted <hi>David,</hi> to take away his life. And if so, then the Kings Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat
Cavalleers by his own confession, may lawfully be resisted, repulsed, slain in a
defensive way, by the Parliaments forces now.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the argument is absurd, because we may forcibly resist and repulse with
safe conscience, those whom we may not wilfully slay. If a man assaults me, to beat
or wound me, I may resist, repulse him with violence, but I may not kill him in mine
own defence, without murder or manslaughter, unlesse I could not otherwise preserve
my own life by flight or resistance.<note n="b" place="margin">Sect. 2. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Doctor Ferne</hi> grants, that <hi>a Subject may in his
own private defence, lawfully ward off the Kings own blows, and hold his hands, in case
of sudden and illegall assaults,</hi> much more then of malicious and premeditated: but
yet denies, <hi>he may either wound or kill him,</hi> and that truely. To argue therefore from
<hi>Davids</hi> example and words, The King may not with safe conscience be wittingly slain
by his subjects: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He and his Cavaleers may not be forcibly resisted, repulsed by
them for their own defence and preservation, is a grosse inconsequent by the <hi>Doctors</hi>

cut off the skirt of his Robe privily</hi>) nor any of his men with him. To argue therefore,
That <hi>David</hi> and his men might not with a safe conscience stretch forth their hands
and rise up against their Soveraingne king <hi>Saul,</hi> to kill him thus in cold blood, when
he assaulted them not, nor so much as thought of their being in the Cave, and went out
of it quietly, not discovering them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they might not, they would not in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
have resisted, repulsed him, or his Forces, had they assaulted, or given them bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in the Cave, is a <hi>Non-sence</hi> Conclusion; just in effect the same with this. I may not
resist or repulse one who assaults me not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I may not resist one that actually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
me to take away my life, or to beat, rob, wound me: What Logick, Reason,
Law or Divinitie is there in such an argument? So after this when<note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 7. to 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Abishai</hi> said to
<hi>David, God hath delivered</hi> Saul <hi>thine enemie into thy hand this day, now therefore let
me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, I will not smite him
the second time: And</hi> David <hi>said to</hi> Abishai, <hi>Destroy him not, for who can stretch forth
his hand against the Lords Anoynted</hi> (to wit, to slay him purposely, as <hi>Abishai</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<hi>and be guiltlesse?</hi> The Text is expresse, <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>and his men were then in their
own Trenches, fast a sleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Abishai</hi> were here the onely assailants, they came into <hi>Sauls</hi> Trenches, he and
his whole army were in so sound a sleep, that they came <hi>to Sauls own person, took away
with them his Spear, and the Cruse of water from his Bolster, and departed, not being
once discerned;</hi> No man resists, assaults, discovers them. To slay <hi>Saul</hi> thus in cold
blood, without any assault or present provocation, and especially upon a private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
had been Treachery and impiety in a Son-in-Law, a Servant, a Subject, a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29602:152"/>
and to do it with the hazard of their own lives, had any of <hi>Sauls</hi> Army been
awakened at the stroke <hi>Abishai</hi> would have given him. (as probably they might have
been) they being but two, and within their enemies Trenches, in the midst of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who might have easily and speedily slain them, had been rashnesse, indiscretion;
their departure with the Spear and Cruse was more Heroicall, Loyall, prudentiall. To
conclude therefore, as our Opposites do from this speech and example, That <hi>David</hi>
thought it unlawfull in point of Conscience for him or <hi>Abishai</hi> to murther his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord King <hi>Saul,</hi> when he and his men were thus fast asleep in the midst of their
Trenches, offering them no wrong, making no actuall assaults upon them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they
could not, would not iustly with safe consciences have forcibly defended themselves
against <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, had they been assaulted by them in their own Trenches; is
a trascendent absurdity, refuted by the very next words of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abishai</hi> at that
instant, 1 <hi>Sam. 26. 10. And</hi> David <hi>said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall
smite him, or his day shall come to die; or he shall DESCEND INTO BATTELL
AND PERISH;</hi> which intimates, that if <hi>Saul</hi> would force him to a battell, then
he might lawfully defend himself against his violence, though he might not murther
him now in his sleep, when he did him no harm; and if he casually perished in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
it was <hi>Sauls</hi> own wilfull default, not his, who could not disswade him by all this
his fair carriage and sparing of his life, (when he had those two advantages to slay
him) from his violent prosecution, nor yet succeed him in the Crown (as God had
appointed and foretold) should he suffer him to murther him and his men in battell
without resistance. Yea, <hi>Davids</hi> earnestnesse to go with <hi>Achish</hi> and the Philistines to
the battell against <hi>Saul,</hi> wherein he perished, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. (unlesse we will taxe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

Not that resistance of him in the open battell was unlawfull in point of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Other answers might be given to this Objection concerning <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi>
As 1. that this difference was but private and personall between <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
being then <hi>Sauls</hi> private subject, Servant, Son in Law, not publike between <hi>Saul</hi>
his whole Parliament or Kingdom; now many things are unlawfull to be done in
private quarrels, which are iust and honourable in publike differences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>David</hi> himself, though he thus forbore to murther <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he tels
him, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 10, 11, 12. This day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee to day into mine hand in the Cave, and some bad me kill thee, but mine eye</hi>

thee, yet thou huntest my soul to take it. The Lord judge between me &amp; thee, and the Lord
avenge me of thee, but mine hand shall not be upon thee and plead my cause and deliver
me out of thine hand.</hi> And after this upon the second advantage, he useth like words. <hi>The

                     <hi>but I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lords
annointed. And behold, as THY LIFE WAS MVCH SET BY THIS DAY
IN MY EYES, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him
deliver me out of all tribulation:</hi> Wherein <hi>David</hi> declared, that God had given up
<hi>Sauls</hi> life into his power, that it was his owne meer goodnesse that moved him to
spare <hi>Saul</hi> contrary to his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>Abishaies</hi> minds, who would have <hi>slain
him,</hi> without any scruple of conscience; that the reasons he spared him were: First,
because he was <hi>Gods Annointed,</hi> that is, specially designed and made King of <hi>Israel</hi> by
<hi>Gods</hi> own election, which no kings at this day are, &amp; so this reason extends not so fully
to them, as to <hi>Saul.</hi> Secondly, Because he was his Father and Lord too, and so it
would have been deemed somewhat an unnaturall act in him. Thirdly, because it had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avoured onely of private self-revenge and ambitious aspiring to the Crown before
due time, which became not <hi>David,</hi> the quarrell, being then not publike, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
betwixt him and <hi>David</hi> onely, who was next to succeed him after his death.
Fourthly, because by this his lenity he would convince &amp; reclaim <hi>Saul</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his bloody
pursuit, and cleare his innocency to the world. Fifthly, to evidence his dependence
upon God and his speciall promise; that <hi>he should enjoy the Crown after</hi> Saul <hi>by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
appointment;</hi> and therefore he would not seem to usurp it by taking <hi>Sauls</hi> life
violently away. Most of which considerations faile in cases of publike defence, and
the present controversie. Thirdly, that <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe, as well as <hi>Davids</hi> Souldiers,
conceived, that <hi>David</hi> might with safe conscience have slain as well as spared him;
witnesse his words, 1 Sam. 24. 17, 18, 19 <hi>Thou art more righteous then I, for thou hast
rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evill: And thou hast shewed me this
day how thou hast dealt well with me; for as much as when the Lord had delivered me
into thine hand THOV KILLEDST ME NOT. For if a man finde his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
WIL HE LET HIM GO WEL AWAY? Wherefore the Lord reward
thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day, &amp;c.</hi> And in 1. Sam. 26. 21. Then
<hi>said Saul, I have sinned; returne my sonne David, for I will no more do thee harm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my sovle was precious in thine eyes this day; behold I have played the fool excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
&amp;c.</hi> But the former answers are so satisfactory, that I shall not pray in

                     <hi>EXTRAORDINARY; for he was

which he did in Ierusalem. This <hi>Manasseh</hi> had committed many wickednesses by Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
and the shedding of innocent blood, as we may see in the one and twentieth Chapter
of the second of the Kings; for which evills the Lord grievously punished the people of
Israel: <hi>Manasseh</hi> shed over much innocent blood, untill he had filled Ierusalem even to

the Lord: Therefore because <hi>Manasseh</hi> King of Iudah did these most vile abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                     <hi>on which our Opposites principally
relie, is that noted Text in the new Testament,</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 2. Let every soul be subject
unto the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and
they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation. <hi>From whence Dr.</hi> Fern <hi>concludes,</hi>
1. That the King is the Supreme or Highest Power here intended. 2. That all persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Highest Power are expressely forbidden to resist. 3. That in those dayes there was
a standing and continuall great Senate, which not long before had the Supreme Power in
the Roman State, and might challenge more by the fundamentalls of that State, then our
Great Councell will or can. But now the Emperour being supreme, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> calls him,
or the Higher Power, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> here, there is no power of resistance left to any that are
under him, by the Apostle. 4 Was there ever more cause of resistance then in those dayes?
Were not the Kings then not onely conceived to be inclined so, and so, but even actually to
be enemies of Religion, had overthrown Laws and Liberties? And therefore if any should
from the Apostles reasons that he gives against resistance in the 3, 4, 5, Verses, (<hi>for Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>error to good works, but evill, and he is the Minster of God to thee for
good</hi>) replie, That Rulers so long as they are not a terror to the good, but ministers for our
good, are not to be resisted; the consideration of those times leaves no place for such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
because the Powers then (which the Apostle forbids to resist) were nothing so, but
subverters of that which was good and just. The Emperors did then indeed rule absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and arbitrarily, which should have according to the Principles of those dayes beene
a stronger motive to resist. But how did they make themselves of Subjects such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Monarchs? was it not by force and change of the Government? and was not
the right of the People and Senate (according to the Principles of these dayes)
good against them, with as much or more reason, then the right of the people
of this Land is against the Succession of this Crown, descending by three Conquests?
5. The prohibition doth not onely concern Christians, but all the people under those
Emperors, and not onely Religion was persecuted, but Liberties also lost, the people and
Senate were then enslaved by Edicts and Laws then inforced on them, by <hi>Nero</hi> and other
Roman Emperours, yet notwithstanding the Apostle prohibits them to resist. By all which

<hi>Whether there be anything in this Text, prohibiting subjects to resist with Force
the armed unjust violence of their Princes persons or instruments, especially when they are
bent to overthrow Religion, Laws, Liberties, the Republike, and turn professed Tyrants?</hi>
And under correction, I conceive there is not the least syllable or shadow in this Text
for any such inhibition, as is pretended. Not to insist upon the words, <hi>higher Powers
odained of God, &amp;c.</hi> which extend not unto Tyrannie and illegall exorbitant op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
of which hereafter; I shall deduce my first Demonstrations to prove this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Assertion, from the occasion inducing the Apostle to insert these objected Verses
into this Epistle:<note n="i" place="margin">Sixfold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on Rom. 13. Quest. 1. p. 578.</note> 
                     <hi>Dr Willet recites 7. Reasons of it,</hi> all fortifying my assertion; I shall
mention onely the three most probable, most received of them, and apply them as I go.</p>
                  <p>First, the Roman Magistrates being then infidels, the new converted Christians
among them, either did, or might take themselves to be wholly exempted from any
subjection or obedience to them, <hi>reputing it a great incongruity, that Christians should
owe any subjection to Pagans:</hi> To refute which error, the Apostle informs them, that
though the Magistrates themselves were Ethnicks, yet their <hi>Authority and Power was
from God himself;</hi> therefore their profession of Christianitie did rather oblige them
to, then exempt them from subjection. Thus <hi>Haymo Soto, Calvin, Guather, Marlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
Willet, Pareus,</hi> with others on this Text. Turn this Reason then into an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and it will be but this <hi>Non sequitur:</hi> Christianity exempts not subiects from due
obedience to iust Pagan Magistrates, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Tyrants may not be resisted, neither ought
the Parliament and their Forces to resist the Kings Cavalleers unjust assaults, as the
case is formerly stated. Pretty Logick, and Divinity.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Gaulonites,</hi> as<note n="k" place="margin">Antiqu. Iud. l. 18. c. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Iosephus</hi> records, with other Iews, being <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed,
held it unlawfull for them to yeeld any <hi>subjection or tribute to the Roman Emperors,
or other Heathen Princes,</hi> reigning over them; whereupon they demanded this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of Christ himself, <hi>Is it lawfull to pay tribute to Caesar? Matth.</hi> 12. which error
perehance spread it self into the Christian Church, by reason of <hi>Evangelicall Libertie,</hi>
grounded on <hi>Ioh. 8. If the Son shall make you free, then are ye free indeed; Mat. 17. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
are the Children free;</hi> and <hi>Ro. 6. We are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> To refell
this mistake, the Apostle inserted these passages into this Epistle; Thus <hi>Soto, Calvin,
Peter Martyr, Willet,</hi> and others. Whence nothing but this can be properly concluded,
Neither the Prerogative of the Iews, nor Liberty of Christians exempts them from due
subjection to lawfull heathen Magistrates, because they are Gods Ordinance, <hi>Ergo,</hi> No
Subjects can with safe conscience defend themselves in any case against the unjust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
of Tyrannicall Princes or their Armies. A palpable Inconsequent.</p>

                     <hi>Anabaptists</hi> have done)
that it was not lawfull for Christians to use the Magistrates defence against wrongs,
nor for the Magistrate himself to take vengeance of evill doers: To prevent this the
Apostle argues, That the Magistrates <hi>are Gods Ministers, appointed by him to punish
Malefactors, and take vengeance on them.</hi> So <hi>Gualther, Willet,</hi> and others. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from this ground: Oppressed Subjects may seek redresse of their grievances from
the Magistrates, who may lawfully punish Malefactors, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may not resist
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29602:156"/>
with force, Tyrannicall bloody Magistrates, or their wicked Instruments, when they
actually make war upon them, to ruine, spoyl, enslave them, is but a ridiculous <hi>Non
sequitur.</hi> There is nothing therefore in the occasions of the Apostles words which
gives the least colour, to disprove the lawfulnesse of such resistance, or of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
just defensive war.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, this is manifest by the</hi> whole Scope <hi>of this Text, which in summe is onely
this,</hi> That Christians ought in conscience to (l) be subject to all lawfull higher Powers, so
farre forth as they are Gods Ordinance, Gods Ministers, for their good, to the praise of
the good, and punishment of evill doers, and not to resist them in the execution of their just
Authority: Or Christianity exempts not Christians from obedience unto faithfull Civill
Magistrates: <hi>to inferre from thence. Ergo it is unlawfull for Christians in point of
conscience to resist their Magistrates when they warre upon them to subvert Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <p>Fourthly, the Apostle subjoynes this argument against resistance. <hi>Wilt thou not
then be afraid of the power? doe that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same,</hi>
Vers. 3. That power is not to bee resisted, which wee need not be afraid of, and of
whom we shall have prayse whiles we doe that which is good: But this onely can bee
intended of a lawfull power justly executed; not of Tyrants, or their ill Ministers
bent with force of armes to ruine Religion, Lawes, Liberties,; who onely terrifie,
disgrace, discountenance those that are good; applaud, advance none but those who
are evill, and as <hi>Micah</hi> writes, Chap. 3. 2. 3. <hi>Love the evill and hate the good, and pluck
off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore this inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of resistance extends onely to lawfull Magistrates, not to ungodly oppressing
Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, he is not to be resisted, but obeyed; <hi>because he is the Minister of God to thee
for good, Vers.</hi> 4. But is this true of Tyrants? of ungodly Magistrates bent to subvert
Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and destroy their people? True of<note n="u" place="margin">

who <hi>wished all the Romans had but one necke, that he might cut them all off at one stroke;</hi> and
purposely fired <hi>Rome to consume it, beholding the flames as a most delightfull spectacle?</hi>
Are such the Ministers of God for our good here intended? or not rather,<note n="x" place="margin">See <hi>Seneca de Clem. l.</hi> 1. Hosea 13. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>the very

<hi>Devils Ministers</hi> to us for evill, rather then Gods for good.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, He subjoynes this further reason of obedience and not resistance, <hi>Vers. 5.
But if thou dost that which is evill be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vaine; for hee
is the Minister of God, a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evill;</hi> which no

He beareth the sword not onely in vaine, in reference to any good end, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting

useth it directly against both; And is so farre from being <hi>a Minister of God, or reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

execution of justice upon wicked malefactors wherein they must not be resisted; Not
to bloody, gracelesse, lawlesse Tyrants and their instruments, who by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
may and ought to be resisted in their cruelties, oppressions, impieties.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the Apostle hereupon concludes, Vers. 5. <hi>Wherefore you must of necessity be
subject not onely for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</hi> This conclusion as the word, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
demonstrates, being inferred from the premised reasons, extending onely to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29602:157"/>
just and upright Magistrates, not to Tyrants, as they are such; must relate wholly
unto them; namely, that we must of necessity be subject unto just rules, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
powers, governing uprightly; <hi>Because they are Gods Ordinance; because those who
resist them shall receive damnation: Because they are not a Terror to good workes, but to evill:
because we shall have praise of them if we doe good; because they are the Ministers of God to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
for good; and because they are Gods Ministers and revengers, to execute wrath upon them onely
that doe evill:</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Socrates, Scholast, Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus, Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n</hi> in his life of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate and others.</note> Neither of which reasons extending to Tyrants, this conclusion can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reach to them; since no Law of God or man, <hi>necessitates</hi> any one to <hi>be subject, not
onely for wrath, but even for conscience sake,</hi> to the unjust commands and violence of
Tyrants, but the quite contrary: Should Tyrants enjoyne men, as some have done, to
<hi>offer sacrifice to Idols, to renounce Christianity, abjure Iesus Christ, and yeeld up their chastity
to their unruly lusts; Gods</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 3. 5. to 25. Acts 4. 20. c. 5. 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Law</hi> and conscience in such cases <hi>enjoynes them of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to disobey and resist those commands, even for conscience sake;</hi> as every man endued
with conscience must acknowledge; Therefore this Text extends not to resistance
of such exorbitant powers in such lawlesse cases.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, the Apostle thus proceeds, Vers. 6. <hi>For this cause also pay you tribute, for
they are Gods Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> What, doe men
pay any Tribute to Princes or Magistrates for this cause, that they may subvert Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Lawes, Liberties? that they may plunder, murther, warre upon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them to the rapine of their ungodly Malignant Cavaliers? Or are Magistrates,
Gods Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing, to ruine Parliaments,
Church, State, people? would any men, thinke you, give Tyrants wages for such
a service, to cut their throats, to devoure and undoe them in soule, body, estate? Or
do not they pay tribute to, and Magistrates attend continually upon quite contrary
imployments? If so, as none can contradict, then the resistance here is onely intended
of lawfull Magistrates, who continually attend upon their charge, to protect the
good, and punish Malefactors; not of Tyrants, who doe quite contrary; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are
to be resisted.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, he infers from the premises, Vers. 7. <hi>Render therefore to every man his due,
tribute to whom tribute, custome to whom custome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi>
By what Law of God are obedience, feare and honour due to Tyrants in their
ungodly, exorbitant, unjust commands, to subvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties?
Certainly the Apostle hath no where in this Text, nor God himselfe in any other
Scripture expressed such obedience, resistance, feare or honour to be due unto them:
and <hi>Elisha</hi> his speech to <hi>King Iehoram, 2 King</hi> 3. 13. 14 compared with <hi>Ezek. 21. 25.
Iob 12. 19. 21. Ch. 34. 19. Nehem. 4. 7. to 20. Ch. 13. 17. Isa. 1. 23. Ch. 41. 25. Lam. 1. 6. Ch.</hi> 5. 2
proves directly, that they are not their due. Therefore this Text extends not to
them, but onely to lawfull Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he concludes hence, Vers. 8. <hi>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for
be that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law.</hi> Now no such Love is owing to Tyrants
who subvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties; but we are to <hi>hate them with a perfect hatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as enemies both to God and man, borne for the publike prejudice, Psal. 139. 21. 22. Psal.</hi> 109. 1.
to 21. 28, 29. but onely just and upright Magistrates: Therefore this Text is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely of them.</p>
                  <p>By all these premises it is undeniable, that the resistance here prohibited is onely
of lawfull Magistrates in the due execution of their Offices, according to the Lawes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29602:157"/>
of God and the Realmes they live in; not of tyrannicall oppressing Princes, Rulers,
or their instruments forcibly indeavouring to ruine Religion, Lawes, Liberties, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Kingdomes; which fully refutes the Doctors fourth Observation; of
which more anon.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to some farther disquisitions for the finall clearing of this Text;
and herein I shall examine,</p>
                  <p>First, what is meant by higher powers: whether Kings or the Roman Emperor one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as our objectors pretend, or all civill Magistrates whatsoever as well as Kings?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether the Roman Emperour in <hi>Pauls</hi> time were the highest Soveraign
power in that State, or the Senate?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whether Tyrants and unjust oppressing Magistrates, as they are such, be
within the intendment of this Text, and not to be resisted in any case.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whether Kings and kingdomes be Gods Ordinance; or an institution
<hi>jure divino;</hi> or a humane ordinance <hi>jure humano;</hi> and how farre divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, what resistance of the higher powers is here prohibited?</p>
                  <p>For the first of these. By the higher Powers it is cleare, that Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

sundry others. This then being irrefragable, hereby it is most apparent; First, that
no resistance of the higher powers is here prohibited, but onely in the due and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
execution of their offices: For if any inferiour Officers illegally indeavour to
subvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and unrightly governe the people, they may
lawfully be resisted by them: For example, if a Maior, Justice of Peace, Constable
or other officer; extravagating from the common course of Law and Justice; shall
with force of armes in a riotous manner assault any private man, or the whole
Citie or Village where he lives, to beate, wound, kill, plunder, dispossesse the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of their houses, goods, franchises, or assult them on the highway side, to
take away their purses; in these and such like cases, both in point of Law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
he may not onely be forcibly resisted, but repulsed, apprehended, battered,
if not lawfully slaine by the people, and proceeded against as a delinquent: The reason
is, because these illegall unjust actions, are not onely besides, without their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
but directly contrary to their offices, and the Lawes, which never gave
them authority to act such injustice: yet they are <hi>higher Powers ordained of God,</hi> within
this Text, and no way to be resisted in the due execution of their Offices according
to Law. If then these inferiour Officers may be thus forcibly resisted, repulsed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this Text, in such cases as these; then by the selfe same reason Kings
and Emperours may bee thus resisted too; since the Text extends indifferently to
them both. Let then the objectors take their choyce; either affirme, that no inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
lawfull Officers whatsoever, may be forcibly resisted, by the people, or repulsed,
arraigned, censured for their misdemeanour, by vertue of this Text; which would
bring an absolute Tyranny, Anarchy and confusion presently into the world, and
make every Constable as great a Tyrant, Monarch as the grand Emperor of the <hi>Turks;</hi>
or else confesse, that this Text condemnes not such resistance, even of Kings and
Princes, when they forcibly war upon their Subjects to subvert Religion, Lawes,
Liberties, and ruine the republike; since it makes no distinction at all betweene
the onespower and the others; but equally enjoynes subjection, prohibits resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
unto both; and that onely in just administration of their severall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
not in the arbitrary unjust prosecutions of their wils and lusts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it followes, that the Kings Souldiers, Cavaliers and Forces now raised
against Law, and armed onely with illegall Commissions voyd in Law, as I have
proved; are none of the high powers ordained of God, nor lawfull Rulers or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates

and of the Kings illegall commands and designes executed by them, is no resistance of

                     <note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>or not?</hi> It is taken for granted by Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> and other<note n="a" place="margin">Doctor <hi>Ferne,</hi> Appeale to thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> 
                     <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites,</hi>
that he was, as a thing past doubt, the Senate and people (as they say) having
resigned up their power to the Emperour. But this no doubt is a grosse errour,
(which I have largely refuted in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> and therefore shall be the briefer here)
derived from some civill Lawyers; who out of <hi>Iustinian. Digest. lib. 2. Tet.</hi> 2. and
<hi>Instit. Tit.</hi> 2. falsly affirme, that <hi>Lege Regia; by the regall Law the Senate and people trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
all their Empire and power unto the Emperour.</hi> For first the Senate and people (as
<hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Albericus Gentilis, de Iu. Belli. l. 3. c. 13. p. 309.</note> well observes) <hi>did not by this Law give the Emperour all power and
command to dispose of them, or the lands and revenues of the Empire, as he pleased; but onely
to governe them according to their Lawes, as men; not to slay and alienate them as beasts.
Thus reason dictates, so the words of the Law sound.</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Alci. l. 3. de V. s. l. 35. &amp; de pact.</note> 
                     <hi>Divines are deceived, Lawyers
flatter, who perswade, that all things are lawfull to Princes, and that their power is highest
and free. It is ridiculous to affirme, that absolute power over the subjects belongs to Popes;
which belongs not to the Emperours themselves over the Italians, from whom they derive it.
Imagine therefore that the Emperour had a power never so free, yet it is not of dominion, but
of administration.</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">L. 7. de Don. l. 1. quae res, p. 1. da. ob. non. pos. l. 8. qui mo pi. so l. 17. pro. Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Gentilis.</hi> If then the Emperours had onely a free legall administration, not
an absolute dominion; granted them by the people, then this soveraigne power still
resided in the Senate and people, as <hi>Iustinian Digest. lib. 1. Tit. 2. De Origine Iuris,</hi>
will sufficiently manifest: Secondly,<note n="f" place="margin">Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, l. 2. c. 5. p. 221.</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn Bodin</hi> a learned Civilian clearely proves:
<hi>That the Roman Emperors were at the first; nothing else but Princes of the Commonweale,
The</hi> SOVERAIGNTY NEVERTHELESSE STILL REST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING

chosen to be the Lieutenant of God upon earth: I am the Arbitratour of life and
death; I am able of my pleasure to dispose of the state and quality of every man.
<hi>True it is, that he tooke upon him this Soveraigne authority,</hi> by force <hi>wrested from the people
and Senate of</hi> Rome, (<hi>therefore not freely given him by any Law</hi>) but IN RIGHT
HE HAD IT NOT, <hi>the State being but a very principalitie</hi> WHEREIN

                     </gap>e the contrary

and constituted onely by the Senat and people; and that the Creature should be
superiour to the Creator, the child to the parent, is absurd. Secondly, that the
Emperours were but the Senates and peoples publike servants; therefore they were
their Lords; and not inferiour, but superiour to their servants. Thirdly, that they
were subordinate and inferiour to the Lawes made by the Senate and people; and
bound by all their Lawes, but such as the Senate and people did by speciall Acts
exempt them from. Fourthly,<note n="h" place="margin">Marius Salamonius de Principatu, l. 6. p. 122. <hi>to</hi> 126.</note> that the people and Senate did by speciall Lawes cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,

Finally he proves it by the very <hi>Lex Regia</hi> it selfe; which because rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne

one single Law: There was not one Law for all Emperours, but it was revived for

                  <p>If then the Roman Emperors were not the highest. Soveraigne power in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
State when <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epistle, but the Roman Senate and State, as I have
cleared: and if the Parliament, not the King, be the supremest Soveraigne power in our
Realme, as I have abundantly manifested; then this objected Text (so much insisted
on by our opposites) could no wayes extend to the Roman Senate, State, or our
English Parliament, who are the very higher powers themselves, and proves most
fatall and destructive to their cause of any other, even by their owne Argument,
which I shall thus doubly discharge upon them.</p>
                  <p>First, that power which is the highest and most soveraigne Authority in any State
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29602:160"/>
or kingdome by the Apostles and our Antagonists owne doctrine, even in point of
conscience, neither may, nor ought in what case soever (say our opposites) to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
resisted, either in their persons, ordinances, commands, instruments, offices,
or Armed Souldiers, by any inferiour powers, persons or subjects whatsoever, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when their proceedings are just and legall, under paine of temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
condemnation. But the Senate among the Romans, not the Emperour; and
the Parliament in England, not the King, really were and are the higher Powers
and most soveraigne Authority. Therefore by the Apostles owne Doctrine even in
point of conscience, they neither may nor ought to be disobeyed or forcibly resisted
in any case whatsoever, either in their Persons, Ordinances, Commands, Instruments,
Officers, or Armed Souldiers, by the King himselfe, his Counsellors, Armies, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,
or by any inferiour powers, persons, or Subjects whatsoever, especially
when their proceedings are just and legall, (as hitherto they have beene) under paine
of temporall and eternall condemnation. I hope the Doctor and his Camerads will
now beshrew themselves that ever they medled with this Text, and made such a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to strangle their owne treacherous cause, and those who have taken up armes in
its defence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Power which is simply highest and supreame in any State, may
lawfully with good conscience take up Armes to resist or suppresse any other power,
that shall take up armes to subvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, the Republike, or the
ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Rights and Priviledges of the Subject, or of this higher power. This is our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites
owne argumentation. Therefore the Parliament being in verity the highest
supreame Power in our State, may lawfully with good conscience take up Armes to
resist or suppresse his Majesties Malignant, Popish Forces, or any other power which
already hath, or hereafter shall be raised to subvert Religion, Lawes, Liberties, the
Republike, just Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, or the Subjects; and every
man with safe conscience may chearefully serve in such a warre, upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
encouragement or command, without guilt of treason, or rebellion either
in Law or Conscience.</p>
                  <p>For the third Question;<note place="margin">Quest. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether Tyrants or unjust oppressing Magistrates, as they are
such, be within the intendment of this Text, and not to be resisted in any case?</hi> I have fully
cleared this before from the occasion, scope and arguments used in this Chapter;
that they are not within the compasse of this Text; as they are such, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in their Tyranny and oppressions notwiths<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anding this inhibition; I shall
not repeat, but onely fortifie this Position with some new reasons and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
                  <p>First then, that which is not the ordinance of God, but rather of the Devill, and
the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re sinne and enormity of the Governour himselfe, not of the Government,
is not within the intention of this Text, and may lawfully bee resisted without
any violation of it. But Tyrants and unjust oppressing Magistrates as they are such,
are<note n="n" place="margin">See Mich. 3. 1. to 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Isay 3. 4, 5. Ze ph. 3, 3. Ezech. 45. 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>not Gods ordinance, but rather the Devills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and their Tyranny and oppression
is <hi>onely the sinne and enormity of the Governours themselves, not of the government;</hi> A truth
granted by all men: Therefore they are not within the compasse of this Text, and
may lawfully be resisted without any violation of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which is no point of the Magistrates lawfull power ordained of
God, but diametrally repugnant to it, cannot be within the meaning of this Text,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29602:161"/>
and may lawfully be resisted; but the tyranny, oppression, rapine, and violence of
lawlesse Kings and Magistrates are such, as all must and doe acknowledge. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
they are not within the verge and compasse of this Text, and may lawfully bee
resisted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all powers intended in the Text, are not only ordained, but <hi>ordered</hi> of God,
that is, (as<note n="o" place="margin">In Rom. 13. <hi>Col. 1266. Willet</hi> on Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13 <hi>quest. 6. p.</hi> 583.</note> 
                     <hi>Paraeus</hi> with others observe) <hi>they are circumscribed &amp; bounded with certain
Rules or Lawes of justice and honesty, within which they must containe themselves, else they exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitate
from Gods ordinance when they passe beyond these limits, and become none of Gods;</hi> This
the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, (which <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> and others render, <hi>ordinatae,</hi>
and the Margin of our English Bibles, <hi>are ordered of God;)</hi> doth sufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
being coupled with the subsequent limitations; <hi>For rulers are not a terrour to good
workes, but to evill, &amp;c. they are Gods Ministers attending continually on this very thing.</hi> Now
the Tyranny and oppression of Kings and other Rulers, are meere exorbitances,
arbitrary illegall actions, exceeding the bounds of justice and honesty prescribed by
the Lawes of God and men. Therefore not within the limits of this Text, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, it is generally accorded by all Commentators, that though the lawfull
power of Princes or other Magistrates degenerating unto Tyrants, be of God, and

                  <p>To this question distinctly, answer<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and dissipate these grosse erroneous Paradoxes;
we must distinguish:</p>
                  <p>First, betweene, <hi>Government it selfe in generall,</hi> and kingly or other kindes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in speciall, (as our opposites distinguish betweene, a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
the first they say is morall and of divine institution, the later not.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, betweene the Regall power of Kings, the persons invested with this
power, the manner of obtaining, and the administration of their power.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of Gods manner of instituting and ordaining things; which is two fold,
immediately by himselfe, mediately by others. And these institutions of both kinds
are either universall, extending to all places, Nations; or particular, concerning
some Countries, and Nations onely, and not others; Perpetuall for ever, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
onely for some set time: Immutable, not capable of the least alteration; or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and that either at the pleasure of God onely; or at the will of men, when they
shall see just cause, either in part or in whole.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in what severall senses things may be said to be of God. First, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his owne immediate institution. Secondly, of his generall or speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Thirdly, of his generall or speciall disposing providence, without any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
institution or command. Fourthly, of his approbation of, assent unto, and
blessing on the meere institutions of men. Fiftly, of his permission onely.</p>

                     <hi>as that the wife should be subject to the husband, the children to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the servants to their masters;</hi> but in regard of Commonweales, or Nations, hee
hath left it arbitrary and indefinite, leaving every Nation and Country free liberty
to elect such a publike politike forme of government, as themselves should judge
most expedient for their publike good, and that mutable (since all humane things
are so) as they should see just occasion, not prescribing any sempiternall, immutable
forme of government to any particular Nations, Regions, much lesse to all the
world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, government in generall being thus of God, but the kindes of it thus
left arbitrary to mens institution and free election; the particular governments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by any Nation for the better regulating of their lives, the preservation of
humane society, and advancement of Gods glory, may be truely said in some sense
<hi>to be of God,</hi> though instituted, invented by men. Not because God himselfe did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ordain or prescribe them by speciall command to all, or any one people:
or because God himself did immediately ordaine or prescribe them by speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to this, all, or any one people: but because hee by his generall or speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
did direct this Nation to make choyse of such a government, or gave them
wisedome to invent and settle it, as most commodious for their republike, till they
should see cause to alter it: or because he blessed and approved it, when invented
and received by them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Kingly powers, Kingdomes, Kings (the things now in question) are, and
may be said to <hi>be of God, and ordained of God,</hi> in no other manner or sense, then all
other particular Governments or Magistrates are. For this Text of the Romans,
speaking onely of the <hi>higher powers, the powers that are,</hi> and <hi>of Rulers;</hi> as doth that
place of <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 1. And the Text of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16. (so much relied on by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors)
extending as well to all subordinate Rulers as Kings; witnesse the subsequent
words, <hi>By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree justice: by me Princes rule</hi> AND NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLES,
<hi>yea</hi> ALL THE JUDGES OF THE EARTH; (that is, all
Magistrates whatsoever) it cannot but be yeelded; that all and every lawfull kinde of
government, all lawfull Rulers and Magistrates of what sort soever are of Gods <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and his ordinance,</hi> as farre forth as Monarchies are; and what is truely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
of the one, is of the other too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These generalls thus premised as indubitable; I say first of all:</hi> That Monarchy or
regall power is not of God, nor yet Gods ordinance by way of immediate divine institution or

                  </p>

                     <hi>kingdomes were primitively erected, either among Pagan Nations
and States, who knew not God nor his Word, or among Christian States since speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Revelations from heaven ceased:</hi> which if our opposites deny; I shall desire
them to instance in any one Monarchy in the world, instituted immediately by God
himselfe, or by speciall command from his owne free motion: Till this be done, all
their asseverations will be accounted fabulous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if Regall power be Gods ordinance by way of divine immediate insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and command; then this institution of Regall Monarchy, with the severall
Prerogatives, and boundaries of it, would appeare in some Text of Scripture, and
this government would be specially and perpetually prescribed either to all, or some
particular Nations by God himselfe. But this institution, with the generall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
and bounds of Regall Authority, are no where extant in Scripture, neither
this forme of government therein prescribed, but left arbitrary to all or any
Nation in particular, for ought any man can demonstrate. Those Texts which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Kings of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in point of soveraignty, and Prerogative, being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
onely, and peculiar to that Nation, nor morall, or extending unto others.
Therefore it is not Gods ordinance by way of divine immediate institution, or
command.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if it were of divine ordination in this sense; then the Regall power and
authority of all Kings and Monarchs in the world should bee equall, yea the very
same; and there should be no different kinde of Kings; as the divine authority of
all Ministers (being of Gods owne institution by one and the same commission) is
one and the same: But the regall power and jurisdiction of all Kings and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
in the world is not equall nor the same; for some have farre greater authority
then others; there are many different sorts of Kings in the world, <hi>some onely annuall,

                  <p>Fiftly, If Kings were of divine ordination in this sense, then their kingdomes
and people upon their Elections, Institutions and Coronations could not justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
any conditions, oathes or covenants to them, upon promise of performance
whereof they onely accept of them to be their Kings, refusing else to admit them to
reigne over them; and such conditions, oathes, covenants, would be meere nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
since men have no power at all to detract from Gods owne divine institutions,
or to annex any conditions or restrictions to them. But our Antagonists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
dare not averre, that Kingdomes and Nations upon their Kings Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Institutions and elections may not lawfully prescribe conditions, oathes, and
limitations to them, upon promise of performance whereof they onely submitted

                     <hi>Lawyers</hi> and most <hi>Orthodox Divines determine, that Kings have no
other just or lawfull royall Authority,</hi> but that which the Lawes and customes of their
Kingdomes allot them, and <hi>that the Law onely makes them Kings, from which if they
exorbitate they become Tyrants and cease to be Kings.</hi> Their Royall authority therefore
is of humane institution properly, not Divine; from their people, who both elect,
constitute them Kings, and give them all their regall Authority by humane Lawes
enacted, not from God as the onely efficient cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, All Kingdomes, Monarchies, Policies, are mutable and variable in
themselves, while they continue such; yea, temporary and alterable into other formes
of Government by publicke consent, if there be just cause; without any immediate
command or alteration made by God himselfe, or his divine authority: There being
no positive Law of God confining any Nation, (whose humane earthly condition
is still variable) to a Monarchicall or any other constant forme of government on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
much lesse for perpetuity without variation. Therefore, they are not of divine
institution in this sense.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, St. <hi>Peter</hi> expressely defines Kings and Monarchies, in respect of their
institution, to be humane creatures, or institutions, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your selves
to every</hi> ORDINANCE OF MAN <hi>for the Lords sake; whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er it be to the
King, as supreame, &amp;c.</hi> And they are common to Pagans who know not God, as well
as to Christians. Therefore, they are not simply divine, but humane Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Ninethly, Our Antigonists will yeeld, that other formes of Government, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Aristocraticall, Oligarchicall, Democraticall,</hi> or mixt of all three, are not absolutely
and immediately of divine institution; nor yet <hi>Dukes, Principalities,</hi> with other inferior
<hi>Rulers,</hi> though the Apostle in this Text makes them all equally Gods Ordinance,
and Divine. Therefore Monarchy, Kings and Kingdomes are not so.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, The very Text it selfe seemes to intimate, that Royalties and higher
powers are not of God, by way of originall or immediate institution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
for the Apostle saith not; that all powers whatsoever were originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
and ordained by God himselfe; but, <hi>There is no power but of God; The powers
that be, are</hi> (not were at first) <hi>ordained</hi> (or rather, ordered) <hi>of God:</hi> that is; where
powers and Governments are once erected by men, through Gods generall or speciall
providence, there God approves and orders them for the good of men.</p>
                  <p>2. If Monarchies, and Kings themselves be not of divine institution, and Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
in the former sense, as is most apparent: &amp; <hi>Aristotle, Plato,</hi> all Politicians grant;
Then they are so onely in some other sense, in what I shall truely informe you.</p>
                  <p>First, They are of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Ordinance,</hi> by way of imitation, as derived from
Gods owne forme of Government, which is Monarchicall; Whence he is called,

how they should carry themselves towards their Kings;</hi> and all other Rulers and

<hi>ordered</hi> and <hi>ordained</hi> too, of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By way of speciall providence and incitation; God excites and moves
some people to make choyce of Kings, and Monarchicall formes of Government, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than others; and to elect one man or family to that dignity rather than others,
yea his <hi>providence mightily rules</hi> and swayes in the changes, the elections, actions,
counsels, affaires of Monarchies, Kingdomes, Kings, States, to order them for his own
glory, the Kings, the Subjects good or ill, in wayes of Justice or Mercy; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

                     </gap>ift of all these Texts.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Kings may be said to be of God and his Ordinance, because they, (and
so all other Rulers, Judges, Magistrates as well as they, in respect of their represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and the true end of Government) are said <hi>to be Gods; to be Gods Ministers and
Vicegerents; to sit upon Gods Throne, and ought to reigne, to judge for God, and to rule Gods
people according to Gods Word, with such justice, equity, integrity as God himselfe would Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
them. Exod. 22. 28. 2 Chron. 9. 8. Rom. 13. 4, 5. 2 Sam. 23. 3. Psal. 78. 72, 73, 74
2 Sam. 5. 2. Prov. 8. 15, 18. Psal. 82. 1. 1 Cor. 8. 5. Isa. 32. 1. c. 9. 7. c. 16. 5. Deut.</hi>
1. 17.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Ill Kings, and Tyrants, may be said to be of God, by way of permission,
and of Ordination too, in reference to the peoples punishment, <hi>Iob 34. 30. Hos. 13.
11. 1 Sam.</hi> 8. 18. In these regards (common to all other Governours and lawfull
Governments, as well as Kings and Monarchies) Kings and Kingly Authority,
are and may be said to <hi>be of God,</hi> and <hi>Gods Ordinance;</hi> yet not immediately, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in the first acception, here refuted, but so as that still they are really the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ordinances of men, of humane, not divine right, and authority.</p>
                  <p>As for the objected Scriptures to prove Kings <hi>jure Divino,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> as <hi>Prov. 8. 15. By me Kings
Reigne, &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> they are of immediate divine institution, and have all their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from God, not from the people, and may in no case be resisted, censured,
deposed, or put to death for any misdemeanours; the consequences, thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> First, That this Text speakes onely of the promotion or Reigne of
Kings;<note n="m" place="margin">2 Chro. 9. 8. Isa. 32. 2. c. 16. 5.</note> not of the erection and power of Monarchies; and so doe <hi>Daniel. 2. 21. c. 4.
17. 25. c.</hi> 5. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 28. with the other objected Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it be meant of the rule of Kings; then true it is, that good Kings
Reigne by Gods direction, according to his word, <hi>executing justice, and judgement,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he enjoynes them;</hi> But then it is not true of wicked Kings and Tyrants, who though
they Reigne by Gods Providence or permission, yet they rule not by his word and
will as he prescribesthem.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it be meant of the meanes and manner of Kings comming to their
Kingdomes, as I conceive it is, and the Texts of <hi>Daniel</hi> perswade:</p>
                  <p>True it is: first, That some Kings Reigned and came to the Crowne by Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29602:164"/>
nomination and designation, as <hi>Saul, David, Solomon, Ieroboam, Iehu,</hi> and
<hi>Hazael</hi> did: But that all, or most did heretofore, or now doe so, especially in Pagan
Kingdomes, is a notorious falshood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is true, That most lawfull Kings in hereditary or elective Kingdomes,
come to their Crownes, and Reigne; though not by Gods immediate nomination,
yet by his ordinary or speciall providence, (though it be untrue of <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> and
<hi>Tyrants</hi> who come to Reigne by Treason, Murther, or other unlawfull meanes; and
so by Gods<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>See Doctor Willet, Paraeus,</hi> and others on Rom. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>permission onely, rather than his providence:</hi> and then the sense of the
place is but this; That Kings receive their Crownes, and Reigne by Gods generall,
or more speciall providence: Which I thinke is the full and proper sense of the place.
In this sense <hi>C. Plinius Seeundus</hi> a heathen in his admirable <hi>Panegyric</hi> to the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

That Kings and Emperours are such onely by the selfe-same PROVIDENCE
OF GOD, by which they were men before they were Emperours; which gives
them no greater Prerogative in respect of irresistibility in unjust exorbitant actions,

willingly and cheerfully to submit to the higher Powers, not only with our bodies, but
soules and spirits too:</hi> I may hence cleerly inferre, that the resistance of the higher
Power here prohibited as contrary to this subjection, is not only that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and violent by force of armes, as the Objectors glosse it; but that likewise
which is verball, mentall, spirituall in the soule it selfe without the body, and no
more then a meer passive resistance, or not obeying: For not to doe what the higher
Powers enjoyn, is in verity actually to resist, to withstand them; as not to doe the
will, not to yeeld obedience to the motions, dictates of the Holy Ghost or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is really to <hi>resist</hi> them, even in Scripture phrase: Yea, corporall resistance or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
by way of force is only an higher degree of resistance, but not the onely or
proper resistance here prohibited, which relates principally to the Soule and Spirit.
For as corporall forced obedience against a mans will which still holds<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>out, is no

                     <hi>principally in the cheerfull submission or activity of the soule
or will:</hi> So a forced corporall resistance against the mind or conscience, <hi>is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
no resistance;</hi> and the very malignity, quintessence of all inward or outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
disobedience, rests only in the mind, soule, will; and is here principally
forbidden, as is evident by the 5. verse; <hi>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not onely
for wrath</hi> (which relates only to <hi>the body,</hi> which mens wrath can <hi>only harm</hi> in case of

                     <hi>Iohn Stratford</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the 14. year of
K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3, contesting with this King, and excommunicating divers of his followers, and
all the infringers of the Churches Liberties, presumed to write thus unto his Soveraign;
<hi>There are two things by which the world is principally governed, The sacred Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
authority, and the royall power, of which the Priesthood is by so much the more
weighty, ponderous, and sublima, by how much they are to give an account of kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the Divine audit: And therefore the kings Majesty ought to know, that you
ought to depend on their judgement, not they to be regulated according to your will. For
who doubteth that the priests of Christ are accounted the FATHERS AND MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERS
of Kings, Princes, and all faithfull Christians? Is it not known to be a part of
miserable madnesse, if the son should endeavour to subjugate the Father, the servant
the master to himself? The Canonicall authority of Scriptures testifieth, that divers
Pontiffs have excommunicated, some of them Kings, others Emperours: And if you
require somewhat in speciall of the persons of Princes; Saint</hi> Innocent <hi>smote the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
Archadius <hi>with the sword of excommunication, because he consented that Saint</hi>
John Chrysostom <hi>should be violently expelled from his See. Likewise</hi> Saint Ambrose
<hi>Archbishop of Millain, for a fault which seemednot so hainous to other priests, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
the Emperour</hi> Theodosius <hi>the great: From which sentence, having first
given condigne satisfation, he afterwards deserved to be absolved; and many such like
examples may be alleaged, both more certain for time, and nearer for place. Therefore
no Bishops whatsoever neither may nor ought to be punished by the secular Power, if they
chance to offend through humane frailtie: For it is the duty of a good and religious
Prince to honour the Priests of God, and defend them with greatest reverence, inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29602:167"/>
of the Pious Prince of most happy memory,</hi> Constantine, <hi>saying, when the cause
of Priests was brought before him,</hi> You cannot be iudged by any, <hi>to wit, of the secular
judges,</hi> who are reserved to the iudgement of God alone; <hi>according to the assertion of
the Apostle</hi> (very ill applied) <hi>saying, The spirituall man is iudged of no man, 1 Corinth.</hi>
2. 15. (Not mean of Bishops or Clergie-men, but Saints alone, endued with Gods
<hi>Spirit,</hi> not of <hi>judging</hi> in courts of iustice, but of <hi>discerning spirituall things,</hi> and their
own spirituall Estates, as the Context resolves.) Thus and much more this Prelate,
who notwithstanding this text of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> pleads an exemption of all Bishops
and Priests from the kings secular power, by Divine Authority, and arrogates to
Priest and Prelates, a iudiciary lawfull power over Kings themselves, to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and censure them for their offences. And to descend to later times, even since the

                  <p>Secondly, This Text enjoynes no more subjection to kings, then to any other
Magistrates; as the words: <hi>Submit your selves TO EVERY ORDINANCE
of Man; Or unto Governors, &amp;c.</hi> prove past all contradiction; And vers 6 which

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I haue proved, and our
Antagonists must grant; by the self-same reason kings may be resisted too, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any thing in this Text, which attributes no more irresistability or authority
to Kings, then unto other Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:29602:168"/>
Thirdly, Kings are here expresly called; AN ORDINANCE OF
MAN, not God; as I have formerly proved them to be. If so; I then appeal to
the consciences of our fiercest Antagonists, whether they do beleeve in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or dare take their Oathes upon it; That ever any people or Nation in the
world, or our Ancestors at first, did appoint any Kings or Governours over them, to
subvert Religion, Laws, Liberties; or intend to give them such an unlimited uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Soveraignty over them, as not to provide for their own safety, or not to
take up Arms against them, for the necessary defence of their Laws, Liberties, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Persons, States, under pain of high Treason, or eternall damnation, in case they
should degenerate into Tyrants, and undertake any such wicked destructive designe.
If not (as none can without madnesse and impudence averre the contrary, it being
against all common sence and reason, that any man or Nation should so absolutely,
irresistably inslave themselves and their Posterities to the very lusts and exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Tyrants, and such a thing as no man, no Nation in their right sences, were they
at this day to erect a most absolute Monarchie, would condescend to;) then clearly the
Apostle here confirming onely the <hi>Ordinances of men,</hi> and giving no Kings nor Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
any other or greater power then men had formerly granted them (for that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
been to alter, not approve their humane Ordinances) I shall infallibly thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre;
That whole States, and Subjects, may with safe conscience resist the unjust vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Kings in the foresaid cases, because they never gave them any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity irresistably to act them, nor yet devested themselves (much lesse their posterity
whom they could not eternally inslave) of the right, the power of resisting them in
such cases; whom they might justly resist before, whiles they were private men, and
as to which illegall proceedings they continue private persons still, since they have no
legall power given them by the people to authorize any such exorbitances.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The subjection here enjoyned, is not passive, but active, witnesse <hi>ver.</hi> 15.
<hi>For so is the will of God, that by</hi> WELL DOING (to wit, by your actuall cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>submission to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake, &amp;c.) you put to silence the
ignorance of foolish men: as free, and not using your liberty, &amp;c.</hi> If then this Text be
meant of active, not passive obedience; then it can be intended onely of lawfull
Kings, of Magistrates in their just commands, whom we must actually obey; not of
Tyrants and Oppressours in their unjust wicked proceedings, whom we are bound in
such cases actually to disobey, as our Antagonists grant, and I have largely evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced elsewhere: Wherefore, it directly commands resistance, not subjection in such
cases; since actuall disobedience to unjust commands, is actuall resisting of them.
And that these Texts prescribing resistance tacitely, should apparantly prohibit it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Treason, Rebellion, Damnation, is a Paradox to me.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This Text doth no way prove that false conceit of most, who hence
conclude: That all Kings are the Supream Powers, and above their Parliaments,
and whole Kingdoms, even by Divine institution: There is no such thing, nor sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of it in the Text.</p>
                  <p>For first, This Text calls Kings, not a Divine, but <hi>Humane Ordinance;</hi> If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
then Kings be the Supreamest Power, and above their Parliaments, Kingdoms,
it is not by any Divine Right, but by <hi>Humane Ordination</hi> onely, as the Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Text prescribes not any Divine Law to all or any particular States; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:29602:169"/>
nor gives any other Divine or Civill Authority to Kings and Magistrates in any
State then what they had before; for if it should give Kings greater Authority and
Prerogatives then their people at first allotted them, it should alter and invade the
settled Government of all States, contrary to the Apostles scope, which was to
leave them as they were, or should be settled by the peoples joynt consent: It doth
not say, <hi>That all Kings in all Kingdoms are, or ought to be Supreame; or let them
be so henceforth:</hi> no such inference appears therein. It speaks not what Kings
ought to be in point of Power; but onely takes them as they are, (according to
that of <hi>Rom. 13. 2. The Powers that ARE, &amp;c.</hi> to wit, that are, even now every
where in being, not which ought to be, or shall be) whence he saith; <hi>Submit
to the King as supreame:</hi> that is; where by the Ordinance of man the King is made
supreame; not, where Kings are not the supreamest Power; as they were not
among the<note n="a" place="margin">See Bodin <hi>Common-weal</hi> l. 1. c. 10. l. 2. c. 5. Hugo Grotius de jure Belli. l. 1. c. 3. sect. 8 to. 13. &amp; Annotata.</note> ancient <hi>Lacedemonians, Indians, Carthaginians, Gothes, Arago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and in most other Kingdoms, as I have<note n="b" place="margin">Part. 1. &amp; in the Appendix.</note> 
                     <hi>elsewhere</hi> proved: To ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
therefore, We must submit to Kings where the people have made them su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> All Kings every where are and ought to be supreame <hi>Iure divino;</hi>
(as our <hi>Antagonists</hi> hence inferre) is a grosse absurdity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, This Text doth not say, That the King is the supreame soveraigne
Power, as most mistake; but <hi>supreame Governour,</hi> as the next words; or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, &amp;c.</hi> expound it; and the very <hi>Oath of Supremacie, 1. Eliz. Cap.</hi> 1.
which gives our Kings this Title, <hi>Supreame Governour within these his Realms.</hi>
Now Kings may be properly called Supreame Magistrates or Governours in their
Realms, in respect of the actuall administration of government and justice, (all
Magistrates deriving their Commissions immediately from them, and doing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
for, and under them:) and yet not be the Soveraign Power, as the <hi>Romane
Emperours,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Bodin. <hi>Common-weal</hi> l. 2. c. 5 l. 1. c. 10.</note> the <hi>Kings of Sparta, Arragon,</hi> and others; the <hi>German Emperours,</hi>
the <hi>Dukes of Venice</hi> in that State, and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> in the <hi>Nether-lands,</hi>
were and are the <hi>Supreame Magistrates, Governours;</hi> but not the <hi>Supreame So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Powers;</hi> their whole <hi>States, Senates, Parliaments, being the Suprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
Powers, and above them;</hi> which being Courts of State, of Justice, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
body of many members, not alwayes constantly sitting, may properly be
stiled, The <hi>Supreame Courts and Powers;</hi> but not the <hi>Supreame Magistrate</hi> or
<hi>Governour:</hi> As the <hi>Pope</hi> holds himself, the <hi>Supreame Head and Governour of the
Militant Church;</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Bishop of Canterbury</hi> stiles himself, the <hi>Primate
and Metropolitane of all England;</hi> and so other Prelates in their Provinces; yet
they are not the <hi>Soveraigne Ecclesiasticall Power,</hi> for the King, at least <hi>Generall
Councells</hi> or <hi>Nationall Synods</hi> (which are not properly tearmed <hi>Governours,</hi> but
<hi>Powers</hi>) are <hi>Paramount</hi> them, <hi>and may lawfully censure or depose them,</hi> as I have<note n="d" place="margin">Part. 1. p. 88.</note> 
                     <hi>else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where</hi>)
manifested. To argue therefore, that Kings are the highest Soveraign Power,
because they are the highest particular Governours and Magistrates in their Realms,
as our Antagonists do; is a meer Fallacie, and Inconsequent, since I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to the Romane State and Empire,</hi> and one appointed by a Conquerour,
not freely chosen and assented to by the people. So as all the Argument which can
hence be extracted for the absolute Soveraigntie and irresistibility of Kings over
their whole Kingdomes and Parliaments, is but this. The King of the <hi>Iews</hi> was

Fifthly, This is but the common exploded Argument of the Popish Clergy,
<hi>To prove themselves superiour to Kings, and exempt from all secular Iurisdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are spirituall Fathers, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and censure them,</hi> as<note n="e" place="margin">Antiq Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Brit. p 245.</note> Archbish. <hi>Stratford,</hi> and others argue. But this plea is no ways
available to exempt Clergy men from secular Jurisdiction; from actuall resistance
of parties assaulted, nor yet from imprisonment, censures, and capitall executions
by Kings and Civill Magistrates, in case of capitall Crimes; Therefore by like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it can not exempt Kings from the resistance, censures of their Parliaments,
Kingdoms, in case of tyrannicall invasions. We deride this Argument in Papists
as absurd, as in sufficient to prove the exemption of Clergy men: I wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why it is now urged to as little purpose, against resistance of Tyrants, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing

                  <p>The second reason is this,<note n="f" place="margin">Appeal to thy conscience, and others.</note> The Invasions and oppressions of evill Kings and

                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Neither we, nor they ought in conscience to resist or take Arms against
them. Every sicknesse that threatens or invades our bodies, is commonly an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and punishment sent by God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> We must not endeavour to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> First, That this doctrine of not resisting Tyrants in any case, is farre
more pernicious, destructive to the Realm then the contrary; because it deprives
them of all humane means, and possibilities of preservation; and denies them that
speciall remedy which God and nature hath left them for their preservation: Laws,
denyall of Subsidies, and such like remedies prescribed by Doctor <hi>Ferne,</hi> being no
remoraes or restraints at all to armed Tyrants; Wherefore I must tell thee <hi>Doctor,

                  <p>Secondly, The knowledge of a lawfull power in Subjects to resist Tyrants, will
be a good means to keep Princes from Tyrannicall courses, for fear of strenuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance;
which if once taken away, there is no humane bridle left to stay the
Inundation of Tyranny in Princes or great Officers; and all Weapons, Bulwarks,
Walls, Lawes, Armes will be meerly uselesse to the Subjects, if resistance be
denyed them, when there is such cause.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Resistance only in cases of publike necessity, though accompanied with
civill warre; serves alwayes to prevent farre greater mischiefs then warre it self
can produce, it being the only Antidote to prevent publike ruine, the readiest means

the Bishop for preferring the secular warfare before the spirituall, in that he had taken a

<hi>Ergo,</hi> The Priests and Ministers in his Majesties Armies, who bear Offensive Arms,
must now in conscience lay them down, and use no other resistance, but prayers
and tears against the Parliaments forces: where as their former inference against
resistance: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is altogether unlawfull for the Parliament, or any Lay-Subjects
by their command, to defend Religion, Laws, Liberties, against his Majesties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
forces, who intend by force to subvert them; is but ridiculous nonsence,
which never once entred into this Fathers thoughts, and can never be extorted
from his words.</p>
                  <p>Ministers of the Gospel must not use any Arms, but prayers and tears to resist
a forraigne Enemy: <hi>Ergo,</hi> None else may lawfully use them to withstand an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading

now with shame enough, for ever bid this authority adieu; with which they have
hitherto gulled the ignorant World: And henceforth turn it against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

as well as other men,</hi> as the Presidents cited in <hi>Iudge Cooke</hi> his Argument against

                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:29602:172"/>
To which I answer.<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> First, that it is cleare by this, that Christians may use pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and teares against Tyrants and oppressors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that these are the most powerfull prevailing Armes both to resist and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
conquer them. This the opposites readily grant. Therefore by their own confession,
Christians both may and must resist tyrants by the most powerful &amp; effectual means
that are. Tyrants therefore are not the higher Powers, Kings, Rulers, which <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> in the fore-objected texts, enjoyne <hi>men under paine of damnation to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and obedient to for conscience sake, and no waies to resist;</hi> since they may resist them
with the powerfullest armes of all others, prayers and teares.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they may be lawfully resisted with these most prevailing armes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>Pauls &amp; Peters</hi> objected inhibitions, then <hi>à fortiori</hi> they may be with
corporall, which are lesse noxious and prevalent; he that may with most successeful
meanes resist, vanquish, and overcome his tyrannizing oppressing Soveraigne, may
likewise doe it by the lesse noxious Armes. If Christians may repulse and subdue
a Tyrant with their Prayers, Teares, then why not with their Swords? Doth God
or the Scripture make any such distinction, that we may and must resist them under
paine of damnation, with these kind of weapons; and shall it be no lesse then <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Rebellion, Damnation</hi> to resist them with the other? what difference is there in
point of <hi>Allegiance, Loyalty, Treason, Conscience,</hi> to resist an oppressing tyrannizing
Prince and his Forces with a <hi>Praier,</hi> or with a <hi>Sword?</hi> with a <hi>Teare,</hi> or with a <hi>Speare?</hi>
Are they not all one in substance? By the Statutes of 26 <hi>H. 8. c. 13. 1 E. 6. c. 14. 5 E.</hi> 6.
<hi>c. 11. 1 Eliz. c. 6. 13 Eliz. c.</hi> 1. words against the King delivered even in <hi>Preaching, are

which none make scruple, though our <hi>Statutes</hi> make it no lesse then <hi>high Treason</hi>
in some cases; then questionlesse they may by the selfe same reason and ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
them with open force, notwithstanding any inhibition in Scripture. We may
not, must not resist any lawful King or Magistrate in the just execution of his office,
so mush as with a repugnant wil, thought, prayer, teare: we may, yea must resist
an oppressing, persecuting Tyrant with all these; therefore with any other Armes.

                  <p>Fourthly, this Father saith not, that it was unlawful for the Christians to use any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

want of other Armes and helpe,<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Zozimen. l. 5. c. 2. Non Gentiles solum, &amp;c.</note> not the unlawfulnesse of using them, had they had

<hi>Ergo</hi> those who have other Armes besides prayers and teares, may not lawfully

this authority yeelds our opposites. In one word, this Father informes us,
that this Apostate Emperour<note n="x" place="margin">Oratio. 1. in Iulianum p. 760.</note> 
                     <hi>Iulian,</hi> would <hi>not make open warre at first upon the

oppressing Princes, endeavouring with force of Armes to subvert Liberties, Lawes,

Non erat iis pro salute pugnare, nisi salutem pro salute contemnere. <hi>The
summe of all these Fathers sayings (which I have largely cited, because I would
conceale nothing that might be materially objected) is this: That the Christians
in the primitive Church, though they were many in number, and sufficiently able
to defend themselves against their persecuters by force of Armes, did yet refuse to
doe it, yeelding themselves up to any tortures, punishments, deaths, without the
least resistance in word or deed;</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Parliament and Kingdome ought now to
make no resistance at all against the Kings popish Army and Cavaliers, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to their cruelties and rapines, without the least resistance in word
or deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because this objection stickes most with many Schollars, Statists, and tender
consciences, I shall endeavour to give a satisfactory answer<note place="margin">Answer.</note> to it, without any shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evasions, or questioning the truth of <hi>Tertullians,</hi> and <hi>Cyprians assertions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the multitude and strength of the Christians, and their ability to resist,</hi> which some
have taken<note n="e" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> his Anti-cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierisme, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Armes.</note> great paines to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, then I say, that neither of all these Fathers say, That the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
held it <hi>unlawfull,</hi> muchlesse <hi>damnable, in point of conscience for them to resist
their persecuting enemies,</hi> no such syllable in any of them. And <hi>Tertullians, Si non
apud istam disciplinam</hi> MAGIS OCCIDI LICET QUAM OCCIDERE,
by way of necessary defence, implies no such thing, but rather proves the contrary,
that resistance is lawfull, because it is lawfull to be slaine as a martyr; therefore in
this case to slay. So as there is nothing in these authorities in point of conscience
to condemne the Parliaments present resistance, and defensive warre, as unlawful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they all seeme to grant, that the Christians deemed resistance even by
force of Armes to be lawfull for them, though they used it not; no Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
prohibiting, but allowing it, and these Fathers producing no one text which
truly condemnes it; this being the very summe of their words. That though the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29602:174"/>
Christians were exceeding many in number, <hi>of strength and power abundantly suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to defend themselves in a warlike manner against their persecuters, and had full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and no restraint upon them in point of Conscience either to withstand their persecutors
with Armes, or to withdraw themselves from under the jurisdiction of their persecuters
into remote parts, to the great weakning and losse of the State: yet such was their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
innocency, and desire of Martyrdome, that they resisted not their Adversaries with
force, nor retired, nor fled away from under their obedience, but cheerfully without the
least resistance by word, deed, or thought, yeelded up their Bodies, Liberties, Lives, to
the cruelties of their Enemies, to obtaine that Crowne of Martyrdome which they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and to offer up themselves a voluntary freewill oblation to the Lord, who would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
avenge all their wrongs.</hi> This is the sum of all these Authorities, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
resistance lawfull in it selfe, and to these Christians too in their owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and resolutions, though the desire of Martyrdome made them freely to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
it. These Examples and Authorities therefore abundantly corroborate, and
no wayes impeach our cause.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their examples of not resisting Persecuters, being rather voluntary, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
enjoyned, out of a longing desire to be Martyrs, and an assurance of divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to be executed on their Persecuters, is no restraint nor ground at all for other
Christians, now not to use any forcible resistance, it being a grosse inconsequent to
argue: The Primitive Christians voluntarily refused to defend themselves with
force of Armes against their Persecuters, though they were not bound in point of
Conscience from such resistance, and had both liberty and power to resist. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
Christians in point of Conscience ought not to make any forcible resistance against
oppressing Lords and Persecuters now: For then this their voluntary choice and
election should deprive all following Christians of that ability of defence which
both themselves then had, and since enjoy by Gods and Natures Law. Yet this is all
the argument which can be ingeniously framed from these Authorities and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
the absurdity whereof I shall thus further illustrate from like Precedents: We
know, first, That<note n="f" place="margin">See <hi>Socrat. scholast. Theod. Niceph. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Hist. Fox</hi> Acts and Monuments. <hi>Tertul. Apolog. &amp; ad Martyres Cyprian ad. Martyrei.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>the primitive Christians, out of a desire of martyrdome, not only
refused to resist, but to flee away from their Persecuters, when they might safely doe it;
some of them holding it unlawfull and dishonourable to flee in such a case;</hi> by name
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his booke <hi>De fuga in persecutione.</hi> Will our Opposites from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> it is unlawfull for Christians not onely to resist, but even to flee from
their Persecuters, or his Majesties murdering, plundering Forces? Or for them
selves to flee, not onely from the Parliaments Forces, but Justice too, as many of
them have done, yea, made escapes against Law to flee therefrom. If the Christians
not fleeing, binde neither them, nor us, not to flee now, why should their not resisting
onely doe it? Secondly,<note n="g" place="margin">See <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, Vol. 1. <hi>passim.</hi>

to thee: If our hand hath any way offended, verily our minde followed it not
at all; we are circumvented by the Emperours fraud with whose gold we are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
We have put off impiety, we are purged by blood. After which, posting
speedily to the Emperour, and casting away their gold, with a generous and stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
minde they exclaimed against him in this manner. O Emperour, we have
not received gifts, but are damned with death. We are not called for our honour,
but branded with ignominie. Give this benefit to thy Souldiers, kill and behead
us unto Christ, to whose Empire onely we are subject. Recompence fire for fire;
for those ashes reduce us into ashes. Cut off the hands which we have wickedly
stretched out; the feet wherewith we have perniciously run together. Give gold
to others, who will not afterwards repent they have received it; Christ is enough,
and more then sufficient unto us, whom we account in stead of all. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
enraged with this speech, refused to slay them openly, lest they should bee
made Martyrs, who as much as in them lay were Martyrs; but onely banished
them, revenging this their contempt with that punishment.</hi> Will it then follow
from these memorable examples, That all true Christians now in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

If no such Doctrinall, or Practicall conclusions may be drawne from these their

                  <p>Fifthly, admit the Christians then deemed all forcible resistan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of persecuters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
simply unlawfull in point of Conscience, as being a thing quite contrary to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
profession and Religion; then as it necessarily proves on the one side, That
even Christian Kings, Princes, Magistrates, must in no wise forcibly resist the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Rebellions, Insurrections, and persecutions of their Subjects, because
they are Christians as well as Rulers, and in this regard equally obliged with
them not to resist with Armes; much lesse then their Parliaments Forces lawfully
raised for the publike defence. So on the contrary part it follows not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resistance is either unlawfull in it selfe, or that the Parliaments present resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is so. For first, such resistance being no where prohibited (as I have formerly
proved) their bare opinion, that it was unlawfull to them, cannot make it so to them,
or us in point of conscience, since God hath not made or declared it so. Secondly, the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29602:176"/>
primitive Christians held many things unlawfull in point of Conscience, which
we now hold not so.<note n="z" place="margin">De corona Militis.</note> 
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others informe us, <hi>That the Christians in

in it selfe for them to pray kneeling, and we all use the contrary custome now. The
Christians then held it unlawfull, to <hi>eat blood in puddings, or any other meats, as</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Apologet.</note> Tertullian,<note n="c" place="margin">Octavius.</note> Minucius Felix <hi>testifie, and many</hi>

                     <hi>Councels expressely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
it since, as unlawfull:</hi> Yet all Churches at this day deem it lawfull, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the contrary. The Christians in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes, and he himselfe in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Book, <hi>De fuga in persecutione,</hi> held it unlawfull to flee in <hi>times of persecution,
and therefore they voluntarily offered themselves to martyrdome without flight or resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
Yet we all now hold flying <hi>lawfull,</hi> and all sorts practise it <hi>as lawfull;</hi> yea
many more then they ought to doe. I might give sundry other instances of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The Christians opinion therefore of the unlawfulnesse of any armed resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Persecuters publike or private (held they any such) though seconded with
their practice, is no good argument of its unlawfulnesse, without better evidence,
either then, or at this present. Thirdly, the case of the Primitive Christians and
ours now is far different; The Emperours, Magistrates, and whole States under
which they then lived were all Pagan Idolaters, their Religion quite contrary to
the Laws and false Religions setled in those States: There were <hi>many</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Tertud. Apolog. Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Socrates, scolasticus, Hist. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Laws
and Edicts then in force against</hi> Christian Religion, unrepealed: most Professors of
Religion were of the lowest ranke,<note n="f" place="margin">Cot. 1. 26, Iohn 7. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>not many wise, Noble, mighty men, scarce
any great Officer, Magistrate, or Senator, was of that profession,</hi> but all fierce ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
against it: For Christians, being but private men, and no apparant body of a
State, to make any publike forcible resistance in defence of Religion against Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
Senators, Magistrates, Lawes, and the whole State wherein they lived, had
neither been prevalent nor expedient; a great hinderance and prejudice to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as some hold, unlawfull. But our present case is far otherwise; our King,
Parliament, State, Magistrates, People, are all Christians in externall profession,
our Protestant Religion established, Popery excluded, banished by sundry publike
Lawes; the Houses of Parliament, and others now resisting, are the whole body of
the Realme in representation, and have authority, even by Law, to defend
themselves and Religion against invading Popish Forces: In which regards our
present resistance is, and may cleerly bee affirmed lawfull, though the primitive
Christians, in respect of the former circumstances, might not be so. Secondly,
their resistance, (especially of the Magistrates not vulgar rabble) if made, had been
onely, singly for defence of their Religion then practised but in corners, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
condemned, no where tolerated: Our present war is not onely for defence
of our Religion established by Law, and to keep out Popery, but for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Laws, Liberties, the very essence of Parliaments, the safety of the Realme,
and that by authority of Parliament, the representative body of the Realme. The
Parliaments defensive warre, therefore, upon these politicke grounds is just and
lawfull, though the Primitive Christians, perchance in defence of Religion onely,
as its case then stood, would not have been so: even as the Roman Senators and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29602:176"/>
States resisting of <hi>Nero,</hi> or any other Tyrannicall Emperors violations of the Laws,
Liberties, Lives, Estates of the Senate, people, were then reputed just and lawfull,
though the Christians defence of Religion would not have been so esteemed in those
times. And thus I hope I have sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

As where for example? If a Prince should go about to subject his People
to a forreign Realm, or change the form of the Common-wealth from Impery to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
or neglect the Laws established by Common consent of Prince and people, to
execute his own pleasure. In these and other cases which might be named, <hi>IF

might preserve the foundation, freedom, and forme of the Common-wealth, which
they fore prised when they first consented to have a King: As I said then, so I say now,
The Law of God giveth no man leave; but I never said, that Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
might not proportion their States, as they thought best, by their publike
Laws, which afterward the Princes themselves may not violate. By superiour Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

Which though it be wicked, yet may it not be resisted of any subject, (when derived
from, and agreeing with the Laws) with armed violence. Marry, when Princes
offer their Subjects not Iustice but force, and despise all Laws to practise their lusts,
not every, nor any private man may take the sword to redresse the Prince; but if the
Laws of the Land appoint the Nobles as next to the King to assist him in doing rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

many common impostures and erroneous grosse mistakes in Law, Policy, Divinity, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
which have in later ages beene generally received as indubitable verities, by most men;
yea professedly defended by sundry <hi>injudicious Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>ignorant Divines</hi> (though
perchance reputed learned, solid in their own, and others opinions) who never tooke the paines
to dive into the true originall fundamentall creations, institutions, publicke Lawes, Reasons,
Policies, Iurisdictions, compositions, Rights, Customes, Histories of Kings, Kingdomes, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
States, Magistrates, People; the ignorance whereof, hath made them confidently vent
many grand absurdities, and untruthes, to the prejudice, imbroyling, and almost utter ruine of
divers Kings and States; which now, I hope, they will ingenuously acknowledge and recant with
reall griefe and shame, that they have so grossely cheated, seduced Kings, Kingdomes, People,
and oft times stirred up civill warres, to maintaine their idle lies, crazy fictions, as just Royall
Rights, and indubitable Prerogatives, when as they are nothing lesse.</p>

Iudgement &amp; conscience, upon serious consideration, shall convince him of it; and himselfe discerne

of most famous memory, knowing himselfe to be bound hereunto by compact, before he would
be involved in the Swedish Warre, communicating the whole businesse faithfully to his people,
as well to the Senators of the Realme, as to the Nobles of the Dukedomes, maturely advised
with them about the manner of waging it. Wherefore, lest the Warre which is undertaken
bee accused as unjust by the States, because it was undertaken without their advice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to custome and agreements, <hi>all ought to be assumed into the Counsell and care of
Warre.</hi> For thus it will come to passe, besides, that things very well thought on and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by many, have for the most part better successes, then those things which are rashly begun by
some one; that the Subjects, who not unwillingly bring their estates and lives into danger, will
lesse feare the losse of both, will fight more valiantly, and will put forth all their strength in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting

ratifie with some few new Precedents.</p>

should come armed with weapons to the Parliament, <hi>Num.</hi> 3. The causes of summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parliament were shewed to the Lords and Commons, to have their counsell
and advice therein, what was best to be done; and expressed to be three. First, that
every one, great and small, should consider, in what manner the peace might most
surely be preserved within the Realme. Secondly, how the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the Northerne parts might be best defended and kept against the enemies of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
Thirdly, how the Sea should be guarded against the enemies, that they should doe
no dammage, nor enter the Realme for to destroy it. <hi>After thus. Num.</hi> 4. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Letters from the King then in <hi>France,</hi> relate to the Houses the Estate of the
Kings Army, warres, and proceedings in <hi>France,</hi> and the great debts the King stood
ingaged in for the maintenance of his Army; for discharge whereof and the Kings
further reliefe in the easiest way, to support his warres the Lords condescended to
grant the ninth sheafe of all their corne, and the ninth fleece and Lambe of all their
flockes to the King, for the two next yeares, so as the custome of Mal-tolt, newly
imposed on Woolls, should be released, and this grant not drawne hereafter into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
as a precedent to their prejudice. Who acquainting the Commons therewith,
they after deliberation; <hi>As to the Kings supply; returned this Answer. Num. 8, 9. That</hi>
they thought it meet the King should be supplyed, and were ready to ayde him,
as they had alwayes formerly beene, but yet as the ayde was granted in this case,
they durst not assent to it, untill they had consulted and advised with the Commons
in the Country; for which end they craved time to goe into their Counties, and
that Writs might issue to summon another Parliament on the <hi>Octaves</hi> of Saint <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
of the richest Knights in every Shire at a short day to come, (which, was<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 22, 23 24, 25.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
to.) <hi>After which, Num. 9, 10, 11. they gave this answer in writing concerning
the three Articles propounded to them: First,</hi> As to the keeping of the peace of the Realme,
that the Justices of the Peace had sufficient power already to that purpose; onely
they adde, that disturbers of the peace should not be let out of Prison, but upon suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Bayle, and that no Charters of pardon should be granted to Felons, but by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29602:183"/>
common consent in Parliament, and all other pardons held as voyd. <hi>To the second
they answered,</hi> That the King before his going beyond the Seas had taken so good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and appointed such sufficient Guardians to defend the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
were best able to guard those parts, that the enforcement of them by the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
would be sufficient, without any charge to the Commons; Only, they ordered,
that every man who had Lands in the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of what condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were, should reside upon them to defend them (as it had beene formerly
ordained) without charge to the Commons. <hi>To the third,</hi> concerning the guard
of the Seas: The Commons prayed that they might not be charged to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
in things of which they had no conisance (or charge;) and that they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
that the Barons of the Ports which at all times have honours before all the
Commons of the Land, and are so enfranchized to<note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Britannia, p.</hi> 318. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</note> guard the Sea betweene us and
strangers, (if so be it fals out, that they will enter and assaile our Land) that they
contribute to no aydes nor charges on the said Land, but receive profits without
number arising by the Sea, for the Guard aforesaid. Wherefore the Commons are
advised, that they ought to maintaine a guard upon the Sea, as the<note n="e" place="margin">See 19 <hi>E. 3. pars 1. M 14 &amp; pars 2. m.</hi> 14 Judge <hi>Crookes</hi> Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>p.</hi> 69. to 74.</note> Commons do
upon the Land, without taking or demanding wages. Likewise, there are other
great Townes and Havens which have a Navy, that are in the same case, and are
bound to guard the Sea. And as for the safeguard of the Watch-houses upon the Sea
by Land; let the guard of them be made by the advice of the Knights of the Shire,
where the said Guardians are assigned, in the safest manner that may be, without
charge of the Commons: And that the people of the Land, of what condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
which have lands on the Coast, shall keepe residence upon those Lands, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to repulse the enemies from the Land, so that for their abiding there, they shall
be discharged to give any aide toward the same guard elsewhere. <hi>Num.</hi> 13. The
Commons frame and demand a generall pardon, upon grant whereof they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to aide the King with monies. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. They make an Ordinance for increase
of monies in the Realme. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. Because the ships of <hi>England</hi> went not out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Fleetes, to trade, but severally, out of desire of gaine and covetousnesse,
and so many of them were taken by the Enemies of the King, and the men slaine and
murthered, to the dishonour of the King and the whole Realme; it was agreed, and
assented in full Parliament, that all the Navy should stay and be arrested, till further
order were given to the contrary. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. It was accorded and assented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Bishops and Lords in the Parliament, should send Letters to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Clergy of his Province, under their Seales, to excite them
to grant a convenient ayd for the guard of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the defence of
the Church, the Realme, and themselves, as the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
had done. <hi>Num.</hi> 17. It is accorded, that Master <hi>Robert de Scardeburgh</hi> shall be
put into the Commission which shall be sent into the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to survey the
Array of the people, which shall be chosen for the defence of the Realme, in lieu of
Sir <hi>Thomas de Blaston.</hi> That Sir <hi>Richard Chastell</hi> shall be put in the Commission to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the Array in the Counties of <hi>Notingham</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Feriby</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Lancaster. Num.</hi> 18. It is assented that the people of <hi>Holdernes</hi> shall be Arrayed,
taxed, and make ayde for the guarding of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the King in those parts, notwithstanding the Commission made to them
to guard the Sea, <hi>Num.</hi> 21. The Lords who have Lands towards the Marches of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> are commanded and prayed by writs and Letters to repaire thither for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29602:184"/>
thereof, namely the Lords of <hi>Ros, Wake, Mowbray, Clifford,</hi> and Master <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

being hindered by other businesses to be present in this Parliament, by Letters Patents
under the Kings great Seale, appointed the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and others

thousand sackes of Wooll, and the Earles and Barons, the ninth sheafe, Fleece and

to survey the charges of the Mariners of the West; and of the Cinque-ports.
<hi>Num.</hi> 23. All the ships of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and the West, were to meet at <hi>Dartmouth</hi> at the

and the Earle of <hi>Huntindon,</hi> appointed their Admirall; and that all these ships should

15. Writs were directed to all Sheriffes of <hi>England</hi> to make Proclamation, that all
those who had Charters of pardon, should repaire towards the Sea, in the service of
the King, and at his wages by the middle of Lent, upon paine of losing their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

lost through default of good Officers, the Commons petition, that it would please the

requires it. And that all the chiefe guardians of the Ports and Castles upon the Sea, as

And that these Guardians of the Castles and keyes of the Realme may be sufficient
men, who may forfeit their inheritance if any mischiefe shall happen by reason of
them, which God forbid. And that in all other, sufficient persons of your Leiges
be placed who may forfeit in the same manner for the salvation of the Realme. <hi>To

rehearsed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had reported to them, That the
King would be counselled by the most sage Lords of the Realme, the which ought
to have the survey of all that which shall be done for the good government of this
Realme, which thing the King agreed to doe and rehearsed with his own mouth,
That it was his entire will. And thereupon a Bill made by the King himselfe, by
his own will was delivered, containing the names of the Lords which shall be of

noise and clamour was openly received thorowout all the Realme, upon the same persons

that this Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> did never extend unto the Parliament
to restraine its hands or power, but onely to the King, his Heirs, Officers, Courts of
Justice, and particular subjects. So that the Parliaments imprisoning of Malignants,
imposing Taxes for the necessary defence of the Realm, and seizing mens goods, or
imprisoning their persons for non-payment of it, is no wayes within the words
or intent of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as Royallists and Malignants ignorantly clamour; but

no man (for ought I finde) ever yet held, to be absolutely obliged by it, before the

charge, not set</hi> BY COMMON CONSENT IN PARLIAMENT. Now it
is as evident as the noonday sunshine, that these Acts onely extend to the King, his
Heirs, Councell, Officers, inferiour Courts, and private Subjects onely, and that the
Parliament is precisely excepted out of the very intent and letter of them all, having
free power to impose on the Subjects what Aids, Taxes, Tallages, Customes, and
Subsidies the shall deem meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the expresse provision of all these Laws, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the granting and imposing of Subsidies, Therefore by the direct resolution of
these Acts, the Kings, his Councellors present contributions, assessements, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms imposed on the Subjects are illegall, against the letter and provision of all these
Acts; but the Parliaments and Houses lawfull, approved and confirmed by them.</p>
                  <p>True, will Royallists and Malignants answer (who have no other evasion left but
this) If the King were present in Parliament,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and consenting to these contributions
and taxes of the twentieth part, there were no doubt of what you alleage; but because
the King is absent, and not only disassents to, but prohibits the payment of this or
any Parliamentary Assessements by his Proclamations, therefore they are illegall
and against these Laws.</p>
                  <p>1 To which I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> First, that the King by his Oath, duty, the ancient custom
and Law of the land ought of right to be alwayes present with his Parliament (as
he is now in point of Law) and not to depart from it but in cases of urgent necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the Houses free consents, and then must leave<note n="*" place="margin">See 8. <hi>H. 5. c.</hi> 1.</note> Commissoners, or a Deputy
to supply his absence. This is not onely confessed, but proved by a Booke lately
printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> 1642. (with the Kings approbation or permission) intituled, <hi>No
Parliament without a King, pag.</hi> 5. to 16. where by sundry presidents in all Kings
Reignes it is manifested, <hi>That Kings were, and ought to be present in their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which I have<note n="*" place="margin">Part 1. pag. 42, 43, 44.</note> formerly cleared. If then the King, contrary to these Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
his Oath, Duty, the Laws and Customs of the Realme, the practice of all his
Progenitors, the rules of nature (which prohibit the head to separate it selfe from
the body) and will (through the advice of malignant Councellours) withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from his Parliament; yea, from such a Parliament as himselfe by a <hi>spceiall Act
hath made in some sort perpetuall, at the Houses pleasure;</hi> and raise an Army of Papists,
Delinquents, Malignants, and such like against it, and that purposely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it, contrary to this very Law of his for its continuance: why this illegall
tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

invalid its Imposicions or Proceedings, for their own, the Kingdoms, Peoples, and
Religions preservation (all now indangered) transcends any reasonable mans
capacity to apprehend.</p>
                  <p>2 The right and power of granting, imposing, assenting unto Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, and such like publique charges in Parliament, for the publique safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
rests wholly in the Commons and Lords, not King; and is their owne free act
alone, depending no waies on the Kings assent, nor necessarily requiring his personall
presence in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This is evident: First by the expresse letter of the forecited Acts; <hi>No Subsidy, Tax,
Ayde, Talleage, or Custome shall be set, granted, taken or leavied, but by common consent
and grant of the Prelates, Earles, Barons, Knights, Burgesses, and other free men of
the Realme in Parliament; or without the assent of the Parliament: so that their</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See part. 1. p. 47, 48, 49, 50.</note> 
                     <hi>grant
and assent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Parliament, (not the Kings) is the onely thing that makes them legall and
binding to the subject.</hi> Now both Houses have granted, ordered, and assented to this
<hi>Assessement, exceeding not the twentieth part of mens estates;</hi> and given order for the
leavying of it, and that for the Parliaments, Kingdomes, religions, necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and preservation. Therefore it is obligatory and legall, though the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
consent not, or disassent thereto, (especially as the present condition of things
stands) even by the very letter of these acts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is apparent by the letter of all our publique Acts, for the granting
of Subsidies, Ayds, Tenths, Fifteenes, Taxes, Customes, Tonnage, Poundage, or any
such like impositions in and by Parliament, either by the Temporalty or Clergy:
which Acts runne usually in this manner.<note n="*" place="margin">12 E. 4. c. 3.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly, this is cleare by considering, that the Commons and Lords in Parliament

This is the Parliaments present case in effect: The King having raised an

and actually invading the Kingdom and Parliament with it; Hereupon the

quantitie of their Lands and Estates, or the number of Acres of Land they hold
(the Taxe there was four pence an Acre for Marsh-Land, and two pence for Earable)
for the necessary reparation of the Church; and that this shall binde all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
so as they may be Libelled against in the Spirituall Court for non-payment
thereof, and no prohibition lieth.</hi> The like hath been resolved in sundry other
Cases. And, <hi>by the Common-Law of England whereby the breach of</hi>

the Country is, or may be surrounded, every one who hath Lands within the
levell or danger, which may have benefit, or losse, by the inundation, may and shall
be enforced to contribute towards the repair, and making up of the Sea-walls, and a
reasonable Tax assessed by a Iury, or the Major-part shall binde all the rest, because
it is both for their own private, and the common good.</hi> If the Law be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably adjudged in all these Cases, without the Kings assent, then much
more must this Assessement imposed by both Houses be obligatory, in point of
Law and Justice, though the King consented not thereto, since the Houses, and
whole Kingdom consented to it, for their own defence and preservation.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This is a dutie inseparably incident by the Fundamentall Law, and
originall compact of every Kingdom, Citie, Corporation, Company or Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of men in the World; that every Member of them should contribute
proportionably upon all occasions (especially in Cases of imminent danger)
toward the necessary charges, defence, and preservation of that Kingdom,
Citie, Corporation, Company, or Fraternitie, of which he is a Member, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which contribution, they could be neither a Kingdom, Citie, Corporation,
Company, Fraternitie, or have any continuance, or subsistence at all; Which
Contributions are assessed by Parliaments in Kingdoms, by the Aldermen, or
Common-Councell in Cities, by the Master and Assistants in Fraternities, and
what the Major part concludes, still bindes the Residue, and the dissent of some
(though the Major, or Master of the Company be one) shall be no obstacle to the
rest. This all our Acts concerning Subsidies, Aydes, Tonnage and Poundage the
daily practice and constant experience of every Kingdom, Citie, Corporation,
Company, Fraternitie in the World, manifests past all contradictions; which
being an indubitable veritie, I think no reasonable man can produce the least
shadow of Law or Reason, why the Parliament representing the whole Body
of the Kingdom, and being the supream Power, Counsell, in the Realm; bound
both in Dutie and Conscience, to provide for its securitie, may not in this Case
of extremitie legally impose this necessary Tax, for their own, the Kingdoms,
Subjects, Laws, Religions preservations (of which they are the proper Judges,
Gardians) and should not rather be credited herein then a private Cabinet
Court-Counsell of persons disaffected to the Republike, who impose now

or refuse to set out a Navy, or raise any Forces to resist them, The Lords and

by Parliament, but without any Parliament at all (if it cannot be conveniently

Answer: First, That the Parliament being the Soveraign Power and Counsell in
the Realm, is not tyed to any Presidents, but hath power to make new Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
as well as new Laws, in new Cases and mischiefs; where there are no old
Presidents, or vary from them though there be ancient ones, if better and fitter
Presidents may be made; as every<note n="*" place="margin">

new Judgements, and make new Presidents in new Cases, and may sometimes
swerve from old Presidents, where there were no ancient Presidents to guide
them; even as Physitians invent new Medicines, Chyrurgions new Emplaisters
for new Diseases, Ulcers, or where old Medicines and Balsomes, are inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
or not so proper as new ones. And as men and women daily invent and use
new Fashions at their pleasure, &amp; Tradesmen new Manifactures without licence
of King or a Parliament, because they deem them better or more comely then the
old. Secondly, I might demand of them, by what old domestick lawfull Presidents,
His Majestis departure from the Parliament, His Levying Warre against it, His

an Ordinance of both Houses in Parliament without the King, for the defence
and perservation, both of the Parliament and Kingdom to, when hostily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by the King?</p>
                  <p>In few words, the King and his Councell, yea his very Commanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:29602:195"/>
(without his speciall Commission or advice) have in many Countries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
large monethly, weekly Contributions and Assessements on the People,
beyond their abilities and estates; yea, upon the very Speaker and Members of
the Commons, and Lords House, (notwithstanding their Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which they say they will maintain) to the utter impoverishing, and
ruining of the Country; yea, they have burned, sacked, plundered, many whole
Towns, Cities, Counties, and spoiled thousands of all they have, contrary to
their very Promises, Articles, Agreements, which they never faithfully observe
to any in the least degree; and all this to ruine the Kingdom, People, Parliament,
and Religion; yet they justifie these their actions, and the Parliament, People,
must not controule, nor deem them Traytors to their Country for it: And may
not the Parliament then more justly impose a moderate in-destructive necessary
taxe without the King, for the Kingdoms, Religions, and Peoples defence
and preservations, against their barbarous Taxes, Plunderings, and Devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then the King, or his Commanders, Souldiers play such <hi>Rex,</hi> and use
such barbarous oppressions without, yea against the Parliaments Votes and
consents? Let them therefore first cease their own most detestable unnaturall,
inhumane practises, and extortions of this nature, and condemn themselves,
or else for ever clear the Parliament, from this unjust Aspersion.</p>
                  <p>The last Objection<note place="margin">Object. 7.</note> against the Parliament is, That they have Illegally impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
restrained, plundered some Malignants, and removed them from their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
against <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Fundamentall Laws forenamed, and the
Liberty of the Subject, contrary to all Presidents in former Ages.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, First,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> That the Objectors and Kings party are farre
more guilty of this crime, then the Parliament, or their Partisans, and therefore
have no reason to object it, unlesse themselves were more innocent then
they are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the Parliaments imprisoning of men pretended to be against
<hi>Magna Charta:</hi> I answer first, That the Parliament is not with in that or any
other Law against imprisonments, as I have formerly cleered; Therefore is not
obliged by it, nor can offend against it: Secondly, That it hath <hi>power to imprison,
restrain the greatest Members of their own Houses</hi>

since <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Subjects may be lawfully imprisoned, both by Judges,
Justices, Majors, Constable, and Inferiour Courts or Officers; whereas they
could not be imprisoned by them, by the Common Law, before these Acts,
without breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and violating the Subjects Liberties, you may

Manifesting by sundry Histories and Authors, that in the ancient
Roman Kingdome and Empire; in the Greek and German Empires, derived

of France, Spaine, Italy, Hungary, Bohemia, Denmarke, Poland, Sweden, Scotland,
yea, of Iudah, Israel, and others mentioned in the Scripture; the Supreame Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
and Power, resided not in the Emperours and Kings themselves, but
in their Kingdomes, Senates, Parliaements, People, who had not

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving finished the preceding Treatise; which asserts, <hi>The Supreame
Authority and Soveraigne Power in the Realme of England, legally and
really to reside in the whole Kingdome, and Parliament, which represents it,
not in the Kings Person, who is inferiour to the Parliament:</hi> A Doctrine,
quite contrary to what Court Prelates and Chaplaines have for sundry
yeeres inculcated into our Kings and People (who preach little else
but <hi>Tyranny</hi> to the one, and <hi>Slavery</hi> to the other, to support their owne Lordly Prelacy,
and hinder an exact Church Reformation) and directly opposite to the resolutions of
many malignant Courtiers, Lawyers, and Counsellours about His Majesty; who have
either out of ignorance or malice, created him a new Utopian absolute Royall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
unknowne to our Ancestors, not bottomed on the Lawes of God or the Realm; for
maintenance of each <hi>Punctilio</hi> whereof, against the Parliaments pretended Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the whole Kingdome must be engaged in a destructive civill Warre, now like to
ruine it: I could not but conjecture, how in all probability these Clergy men, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
and Lawyers, out of their unskilfulnesse in true Divinity, History, Law, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
would upon the first tydings of this strange Doctrine, passe a sentence of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi>
and <hi>death</hi> against it, as guilty not onely of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but <hi>High Treason;</hi> and
judge it such a <hi>monstrous Antimonarchicall</hi> Paradox as was never heard of in, much
lesse claimed or practised by any Kingdome, Realm, or Monarchy whatsoever: To
anticipate which rash censures, and undeceive both Kings and Subjects whom these
grosse Parasites have over-long seduced in this point, to their prejudices, convince the
consciences of all gainsaying Malignants, irradiate this long obscured verity, whose sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
discovery, may through Gods blessing, conduce very much to period the present
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29602:201"/>
Differences between King and Parliament, touching matters of <hi>Prerogatives</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
claimed by either; I conceived it, not only expedient but necessary, to back the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited presidents of our own Kingdom with paralelled examples in most forraign Realmes
and Monarchies (in which it is not mannerly to be overbusie without just cause) which
I have faithfully (though suddenly) collected out of the best approved Authors and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians;
whereby I shall infallibly prove, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> State and Empire at the
first, in the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire since, in the <hi>German</hi> Empire heretofore and now; in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Kingdomes of <hi>Greece, Egypt, India,</hi> and elsewhere; in the Kingdomes of <hi>France,
Spaine, Hungary, Bohemia, Denmarke, Sweden, Poland, Scotland,</hi> and most other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
in the world, (yea in the Kingdomes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> and others mentioned in
Scripture) the Highest Soveraigne Authority, (both to elect, continue, limit, correct,
depose their Emperours and Kings, to bound their royall power and prerogatives, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Lawes, create new Offices and formes of Government) resided alwayes in these
whole Kingdomes, Senates, Dyets, Parliaments, People, not in the Emperors, Kings, or
Princes persons. I shall begin with the Roman State, as having much affinity with

King; for though they all agreed to have a King, yet who should chuse him, and

confusion, the Senators, being 150. divided the Regall power between them, so as every
one in his turne in Royall Robes should doe Sacrifice to the Gods, and execute Justice
six houres in the nighttime, and six houres in the day; which tended to preserve an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality

Hereupon the Senate, thinking it best to offer the people that, which they were like to
lose, to gaine their favour, <hi>Summa potestate populo permissa,</hi> permitted to the people the
chiefe power of Electing a King: but yet that they might not give away more right,
then they deteined: they decreed, <hi>That when the people had commanded and elected a
King, it should be ratified, if the Senators should approve it, or be reputed the authors of it:</hi>
Then the <hi>Interex</hi> assembling the people, spake thus unto them: <hi>O Romans</hi> REGEM

Kings lived not like other Monarchs, to rule all things according to their wills, Nullis
obnoxii censuris, as obnoxious to no censures; but all things, not only their publike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but even the regiment of their daily life, were conformed to the rule of the Lawes (<hi>as
hethere manifests in sundry particulars)</hi> botb in respect of their attendants, dispatches,
devotions, recreations, moderate spare dyet, and the like; neither was it lawfull for
them to judge, nor doe any thing, nor punish any man out of petulancy or anger, or any
other unjust cause, contrary to what the established Lawes required concerning every of
them. Whiles they observed these things customarily, it was so farre that they tooke it
ill, or were offended in minde, that on the contrary they thought they lived a most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed life. For other men rashly giuing indulgence to the affections of nature, acted many
things accompanied with losses and dangers; yea some men ofttimes although they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew
they should sinne, did notwithstanding perpetrate evill things, being led away with
love or hatred, or some other perturbation of minde; but they, imbracing the rule of life
approved by the most prudent men, resolved not to erre from their duty in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Whiles Kings used this Iustice towards their Subjects, they had their Subjects
bound unto them in greater benevolence and love then their very kindred; For not only
the Colledge of Priests, but the whole Nation of the Aegyptians, and likewise every one
of them were not so carefull of their wives and children and private goods, as of the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Kings: Wherefore they preserved the estate of the Republike intire for a
long time under the mentioned kings, spending their life in greatest felicity, as long as this
constitution of Lawes flourished. And when these kings dyed, all the Aegyptians ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally mourned for them in an extraordinary manner divers wayes, made solemne Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their praise, buried them with great pompe and solemnity, and erected Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to their eternall honour; all which funerall pompous solemnities many ill kings wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after their deaths, <hi>ob plebis refragationem,</hi> because the people gain-sayed it, (who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Priests and Senates, who were ever present with the kings to assist, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and direct them, were superiour to their kings, since they could thus decree or deny
them these funerall honours) which made many of their following kings to addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

was honest and just, and to suppresse the contrary; the very beginning of all true king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and the end for which kings were first instituted by the people. Whiles they thus
demeaned themselves, they were subject to no envy, because they differed not much from
others, neither in apparell, nor in meat and drinke, but observed a conversation of life
conformable to other men, and lived perpetually like to others. But afterwards, when
those who obtained the principality of succession, and the prerogative of their blood had
those things already provided, which made them able to secure themselves, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their state, following their lusts by reason of their abundance, they then thought, it
belonged to Princes to be better clad then subjects, to exceed them in costlinesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of meats, and to use venery with whom they pleased: Hence envy and offence was
begotten, and implacable hatred and anger kindled, and a kingdome by this meanes

changed into a Tyranny: Hence men most generous and magnanimous bold spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to beare such affronts and insolences of Princes, seditiously conspire against them;
and the people having got such Captaines to make resistance, joyne with them for the
foresaid causes, that the Princes may be repressed. And thus the forme of a Kingdome
and Monarchy is utterly taken away by the roots, and the beginning of an Aristocracy
again laid, the people refusing to set any more a King over them, yet not daring to commit

that the King of <hi>Naverne</hi> (then imprisoned by the King of <hi>France)</hi> should be set
free, and that <hi>Duke Charles himselfe would be contented to be advised and counselled
by such as they should appoint unto him; namely, by foure Prelates, twelve Knights,

ordaine all things necessary for the Realme, to set in and put out all Officers appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Vpon which requests the Duke gave answere, <hi>That he would counsult with
his Councell, and thereupon would shape unto them some reasonable answere.</hi> But first
he desired to know, what aide the three Estates would give unto him, for delivery
of his Father: Whereunto was answered, that the Clergie had given a <hi>disme</hi> and
a halfe to be paid in a yeare, with that, that they may have license of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the
Lords as much to be levied of their lands, and the Commons the tenth penny of their
moveable goods. The morrow following the <hi>Duke</hi> and his Councell met, and after
many Messages betweene them and the three Estates, offers to reforme some part
of the Articles. But the Estates firmely answered, <hi>That unlesse he would reforme all
the said faults, and confirme the said Articles to their minde, for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of all the Land, they should not aide him with their Goods, like as they shewed
him.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> hereupon <hi>secretly acquainted King</hi> John <hi>of these proceedings, who
wrote to him againe,</hi> that in no wise he should agree to the said requests, and to the
end that these matters should not be touched in open Parliament, he deferred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of them from day to day; and at last by advice of his Councell, dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>olved the
Parliament of the three Estates, and commanded every man to returne home without
any effect of their long counsell: <hi>Wherewith many of the said persons were grievously
miscontent, saying among themselves, that they perceived well this was done by the
Duke to the intent the requests by them devised, should not take place, but that the old
misgovernance might continue like as before times it had done:</hi> Wherfore divers of them
assembled againe at the <hi>Gray Fryers,</hi> and there made out divers Copies of the said
requests, to bear them into their Countries, and shew them unto the good Townes.
And albeit the <hi>Duke</hi> after this Councell thus disolved, <hi>asked ayde of the Citie of</hi> Paris,
<hi>and other good Townes to maintaine his wars; he was plainly answered,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Note this.</note> 
               <hi>That they
might not ayde him, unlesse the three Estates were againe reassembled, and that the grant
of the ayde might passe by their authority:</hi> Whereunto the Duke in no wise would
agree. In the mean time the 3 Estates of <hi>Languedock</hi> assembled in their Province by the
<hi>Earle of Armenake,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant, to <hi>make ayde for the Kings deliverance,</hi> agreed
to purvey at their proper costs 500 men at Armes, with a furniture to every speare, and

all which to be waged for a whole yeare; and farther ordained, that <hi>no man should
weare any furres of great price: that women should leave the rich attire off their heads,

manner of Minstrelsie should be put to silence, so long as the King remained prisoner.</hi>

(who was then absent at <hi>Meaux) requesting him to cease the use of that money; And
if not they would use such meanes, that it should not be suffered to be put forth nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

be stopped till the Dukes pleasure was knowne:</hi> Vpon whose returne, the Dukes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

throughout the said City; Which, the Provost with his company utterly denyed:</hi> and
after many great and bold words, departed from the Counsell in great ire, and after
their returne unto the City, incensed so the Commonalty, that they set apart all work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
and Occupation, shutting in their Shops, and drew unto their Armour and
Harnes. The Duke informed of this murmure of the Commonalty of the City, straitly
commanded the Provost, that the Kings peace were kept within the City; and that
he with certaine Citizens should appeare at the Palace before him and his Counsell
the next day, at an houre assigned: at which time the Provost with his company came
and were conveyed into the Parliament Chamber, where the Duke and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

houses of <hi>Simon de Burg,</hi> and others accused of misgoverning of the Realme, whose
houses the said Officers seized and made Inventories of their goods: That done, the
Duke sent out Commissions, and assembled the Three Estates againe at <hi>Paris,</hi> the 15.
day of <hi>February:</hi> Where, in the parliament chamber in the presence of the Duke,
Estates, and divers Nobles, <hi>Robert Coke</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laon</hi> by command of the Duke,
made a long Oration, <hi>of the misguiding the King and the Land by meanes of evill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
as well by changing of money, as other many unlawfull Excises and Taxes, to
the great impoverishment of the Commonalty of the Realme, and to the singular enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and advancement of the said Officers; Wherefore the Three Estates prayed, that all
such Officers may be removed from their Offices, and other that shall be thought more
beneficiall for the King and his Realme to be admitted: Of which Officers the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of</hi> Roan (then newly made Cardinall) <hi>was noted for one, and other to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 21. whereof some were right neere to the Duke.</hi> After which Oration, Sir <hi>Iohn
de Pigquine,</hi> in the name of the Three Estates offered, <hi>That the Three Estates should
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29602:213"/>
finde to the King 30000. men for an whole yeare, so as all things might after that day be
ordered as the Bishop had before devised: All which Articles were unto them by the
Duke granted, and incontinently all such Officers as they before had named were cleanly
avoided, and other such, as by the said 3. Estates were thought most necessary, were put
and chosen to their roomes, except that some of the old (as Masters of Accounts and
some of the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

unto the new, how they should order and guide their said Offices: And the 26 of March
was a new money proclaimed thorow Paris, such as the said 3. Estates had newly devised.</hi>
The King informed of this, sends the Archbishop of <hi>Sennes</hi> and two Earles from <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
where he was prisoner, with a Proclamation, which they caused to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in <hi>Paris</hi> the 6. of <hi>April, That the people should not pay such Subsidies, as the 3. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
had ordained for the waging of the 30000. men aforesaid, or for the Kings fine; and
also that the 3. Estates after that day should no more assemble for any causes or matter
before touched, till they had farther knowledge of the Kings pleasure:</hi> For which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> much blamed the said Bishop and Earles, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
it, who as soone as this Proclamation was made, for feare of the people, fled
from <hi>Paris. Vpon this Proclamation the Commons waxed so mad, that they left their
occupations, drew them to Conventicles and Companies, and used many unfitting words
of the King and his Counsell:</hi> Whereupon to avoid inconvenience, <hi>the Duke comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Watch to be kept in the City day and night, and certaine Gates of the City to bee
kept shut.</hi> Vpon the 9. day of <hi>April, another Proclamation was made all contrary to
that other.</hi> By vertue whereof, it was charged, <hi>that the fore-said Subsidies should bee
levyed, and also that the 3. Estates shouldre-assemble at Paris, the 5. day after Easter,
and there to proceed upon all such matters as were before by them bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

goe no further, for thou art betrayed, and into the hands of thine enemies thine owne

citizens of <hi>Paris;</hi> who, after many excuses, which might not be allowed, they last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denyed the kings pleasure. VVherewithall he being grievously discontented, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
divers from their offices, and put many of the richest and head men of the
citie to death, upon surmised causes, without proofs of justice: <hi>For which causes, and
many other oppressions, the Lords againe assembled their people, intending to subdue
the king, and to set his brother in his place, or to cause him otherwise to rule the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth:</hi>
To which end all the Lords met at a Towne called <hi>Stampes,</hi> where they
continued their Councell fifteene dayes, and then marched to <hi>Paris,</hi> sending four se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
letters unto the citie; one to the Bishops and spirituall men, the second to the
Consulls and headmen, the third to the Vniversitie, the fourth to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, signifying, <hi>That neither they nor any of their company were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as enemies to the Citie, or to warre against it, or the Commonwealth of
the Land; but for the increase and augmentation thereof to the uttermost of their
powers.</hi> VVhereupon these foure parties sent certaine Orators for them to the Lords,
who after long communication with them had, returned to the citie with this report;
First, <hi>the Lords would that the inhabitants of the City should consider the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the King, which yearly oppressed his Subjects with taxes and other grievous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>how he despised the noble bloud of his Realme, and drew to him vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines
and men of no reputation, by whose counsell onely all the Common-weale of the
Land was guided and ruled.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>how hee ruled his Subjects by force and will
without administration of justice, and himself in all Counsels and Parliaments is Iudge
of all causes, and calleth himselfe Counsels and Parliaments more for this singular weale
then for the Common-weale of his Realme.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>how he enhaunsed men of low
birth to great honours, and caused Noblemen to be obedient unto them, intending to
bring the said ignoble men to be equall with the Princes of the Land.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>how the
Lawes be delayed and bolstered by such as stand in his favour, wherethrough at this day
Law is will, and will is Law, and no man almost in any surety of life or goods; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that daily many have been banished and put to death for unlawfull causes, and
also to any Noble-man at this day no power or roome of honour belongeth; so that to
the wild Beasts in the Forrests appertaineth more Liberty and surety then to the more

party of the Kings subjects.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>The great taxes and summes of money which daily
be levied of the Commons be not spent in the Kings honourable needs, and for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale
of the Realme, but are spent vainly and riotously, and bribed out of the Kings
Coffers; for which enormities and misgovernance with many other, the said Lords were
come thither in defensible wayes for the safeguard of their owne persons, as to the head
and principall City of the Realme, for to have aide and Counsell, to reforme the foresaid
evills, not intending any harme to the Kings person, or yet to remove him from his regality
or Kingly Majestie; but to induce and advertize him to that which should be for his
honour and the weale of his Realme, and to live in wealth and honour, as his Noble
Progenitors lived before him; For which causes and considerations, the said Lords, as
the Kings true Subjects, and friends to the Commonwealth of the Land, and of that
City, desired to enter there to refresh them and their people, and to pay truly for all things
they should take, without doing harme or violence to any person.</hi> All which requests and
matters of the Lords shewed to the Inhabitants of the City, by fauour of some friends
they there had, <hi>it was with the more partie well accepted, and thought convenient they
should be received into the Citie;</hi> but by meanes of the Earle of <hi>Davoise</hi> it was respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

what great advantage the Lords had of him, both by strength and favour of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which daily drew unto them by sundry companies, in avoiding of more danger,
concluded a peace:</hi> which being proclaimed thorowout all <hi>France,</hi> the King and

brother <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy; wherein appeared great dissimulation, Lewes</hi>
being of such conditions, <hi>That what he might not overcome with strength, he would
win with dissimulation and treachery.</hi> Not long after the King warred upon <hi>Charles</hi>
his brother, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and a Treaty of peace being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

               <hi>Is there any King or Prince that hath power to leavie one penny upon his subjects,
besides his demains, without leave or consent of those that must pay it, unlesse it be by
tyrannie and violence? A man will say, that sometime a Prince cannot tarry to assemble
his Estates, because it would require too long time. Whereunto I answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, That if he
move a Warre offensive, there needeth no such haste, for he may have leisure enough at
his owne pleasure to make preparation; and further, he shall be much stronger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and much
more feared of his enemies, when he moveth warre with the consent of his subjects, then
otherwise. Now as touching a warre defensive, that Cloud is seene long before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
fall, especially when it is a forraine warre; and in this case good subjects ought not
to complaine, nor to refuse any thing that is laid upon them: Notwithstanding such
invasion cannot happen so suddenly, but the Prince may have leisure at the least to call
together certaine wise personages, to whom he may open the causes of the warre, using
no collusion therein, neither seeking to maintaine a trifling warre upon no necessitie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to have some colour to leavie money. Money is also necessary in time of peace, to
fortifie the Frontiers, for defence of those that dwell upon them, lest they be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided,
but this must be done measurably. In all these matters the wisdome of a sage
king sufficeth, for if he be a just Prince, he knoweth what he may do, and not do, both
by Gods Lawes and mans. To be short, in my opinion, of all the Seniories in the world
that I know, the Realme of</hi> England <hi>is the Countrey where the Commonwealth is best
governed, the people least oppressed, and the fewest buildings and houses destroyed in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
warre, and alwayes the lot of misfortune falleth upon them that be authors of this
warre:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note</note> 
               <hi>Our King is the Prince in the whole world that hath least cause to alledge that
he hath priviledges to leavie what the listeth upon his subjects, considering that neither
he nor any other Prince hath power so to doe; and those that say he hath, do him no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
neither make him to be esteemed any whit the mightier Prince thereby, but cause
him to be hated and feared of his neighbours, who for nothing would live under such a
government: But if our King, or those that seeke to magnifie and extoll him, should
say, I have so faithfull and obedient subjects that they deny me nothing I demand, and I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29602:216"/>
am more feared, better obeyed, and better served of my subjects, than any other Prince
living; they endure patiently whatsoever I lay upon them, and soonest forget all charges
past. This (me thinks, yea, I am sure) were greater honour to the King, then to say,
I leavie what I list, and have priviledge so to doe, which I will stoutly maintaine.
King</hi> Charles <hi>the fift used no such termes, neither did I ever heare such language pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from any king, but from divers of their servants, who thought they did their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
great service in uttering such speeches; but, in mine opinion they misbehaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
towards their Prince, and used such language, partly because they would seeme to
be good servants, and partly because they knew what they said. But for a manifest proofe
of the French mens loyaltie and obedience to their Prince, we need alledge none other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
then that we have seene our selves of late by experience, when the Three Estates

Regent during the Kings minority: In severall Parliaments contradictory Acts are
made, some restraining, others granting the free exercise of the Reformed Religion
thorowout the Realme. The <hi>Guisian</hi> Popish faction, being the strongest party,
most powerfull at Court, and intimatest with the King, notwithstanding all Acts
for the Protestants immunitie and libertie of conscience, impose divers illegall restraints
upon them, commit many outrages and massacres on them, for which they could
have no redresse; whereupon for their own defence and preservation, after many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Petitions, &amp; delusory promises, they take up Arms; whereupon many bloody civill
wars ensue. Many propositions and overtures of Peace were made by the <hi>Guisian royall
party,</hi> not one of them reall, but all to get advantages, and over-reach the Protestants,
against whom they had the most mischievous designes in agitation, when they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most earnestly to desire Peace. Four or five severall conclusions of Peace were
solemnly made and ratified betweene them, but no sooner made and proclaimed, but

again and again, to be exceeding sorry; that this act touched his honour, that he will
be revenged for it, so as the memory thereof should remaine for ever; writes to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Provinces, chiefe Townes, and Magistrates, That he would take such
order as the Authors of so wicked an act should be knowne and punished: And to his
Ambassdours to forraigne Princes, That they should make it knowne to all the world,
that this outrage did displease him. And for the Admirals safetie, he commands the
Captaines of his Guards, to give him as many of his Guard as he pleased, to suffer no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist

lodge about the Admirals lodging.</hi> But all this Court Holy-water was onely to keep
every Bird within his owne nest, and a Pitfall to entrap the chiefe of the Protestants:
For <hi>the same day after dinner, the King and Queene Mother, the Duke of Guise, and
others, take counsell to murther the Admirall, and all the chiefe Protestants, the night

them to the death, that should hinder the extirpation of Heresies, &amp;c.</hi> These Articles of

a nullitie of all that should be decreed to prejudice the former Edict of Pacification; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing,
that they were resolved to maintaine themselves in the Rights, Liberties, and
freedomes which the Edict had granted them. That the troublers of the publike quiet,
and sworne enemies of</hi> France <hi>should finde them in a just defence, and they should answer
before God and men for all the miseries that should ensue thereby:</hi> Yea the <hi>Prince of
Conde</hi> answered more sharply, <hi>That he did not acknowledge them assembled at Bloys
for the Estates of the Realme, but a Conventicle of persons corrupted by the sworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Crowne, who have solicited the abolition of the Edict, to the ruine and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version

he will never give his consent to the counsels of the Authors of so many confusions which

to maintaine the fundamentall lawes of families, and the Estates and libertie of the

from all dignities, from their pretentions to the Crowne of</hi> France, <hi>and to expose
their Countries and persons in prey to the first that should seize on them.</hi> The Court of
Parliament <hi>declares this Bull of the Pope to be void, rash, insolent, strange, farre from
the modestie of former Popes, pernicious to all Christendome, and derogating from the
Crowne of</hi> France: The Princes likewise <hi>protest against, and appeale from it, as abusive
and scandalous, to the next free and lawfull Councell.</hi> The Leaguers pursue their begun

the King desires peace, but the Leaguers will have none; and assembling at

bring in the in the Inquisition of</hi> Spaine, <hi>and publish the Councell of Trent, but with a
moderation of such things as derogate from the priviledges of the French Church; To
consent to the restauration of the goods sold by the Clergy for the charges of the warre,
To give them Townes to be named and fortified as the time and necessitie required, To
forfeit the Huguenots bodies and goods, and to entertaine an Army upon the frontiers of</hi>
Lorraine <hi>against the Germanes.</hi> After which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> approaching to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
enters it against the Kings command, who was jealous of him; mutinies the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
against the King, who thereby is forced to retire from thence for feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
surprized by the Duke, who plotted to seize his Person. After which the Duke
by the <hi>Queene Mothers</hi> mediation, is reconciled to the King; who for feare of his
power, by an Edict of re-union, <hi>admits no religion but the Popish, promiseth never to
make Peace nor Truce with the Heretikes nor any Edict in their favour; bindes his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to sweare, never to yeeld obedience after him, to any Prince that shall be an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,
or a favourer of Heresie; degrades from all publike charges, either in peace or war,
those of the Reformed Religion; promiseth all favour to the Catholikes, declares them
guilty of High Treason who shall refuse to signe to this new union, and shall afterwards
depart from it,</hi> But signing this forced Edict, <hi>he wept.</hi> To establish which Edict, and
work their further ends, the Leaguers cause the King to summon a Parliament of the
3. Estates at <hi>Bloyes,</hi> procuring those of their faction to be chosen of this Assembly:
where establishing the former extorted Edict, they <hi>thereby exclude the King of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,
(an Herelike as they deemed him) <hi>from the Crowne of</hi> France, <hi>to which he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29602:220"/>
was next Heire: An Heretike cannot reigne in</hi> France, <hi>it is an incompatible thing with
the Coronation and Oath which he ought to take; hurtfull to the honour of God, and
prejudiciall to the good of the Realme:</hi> Then <hi>they declare the King an enemy to, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor
of his people, a Tyrant over his Realme, that so the people should presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to confine him unto a Monastery, and install the Duke in his throne.</hi> And at last,
the King being certainly informed of the Dukes traiterous designes to surpize him,
and usurpe his Throne, caused the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Burbon</hi> (the chiefe Heads
of the League) to be suddenly slaine, and others of them to be imprisoned. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the <hi>Parisiens</hi> mutinie, and take up Armes afresh; <hi>The Colledge of Sorbone</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a publike Act of the seventh of <hi>Ianuary, 1589. That the people of</hi> France <hi>are
freed from the Oath of obedience and fealty which they owed to</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Valoys, <hi>and
that lawfully and with a good conscience they may arme against him, receive his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and imploy it to make warre against him.</hi> After which the Assembly of the
Estates dissolving, the <hi>Parisiens imprison the Court of Parliament at</hi> Paris, <hi>till they
condescended to their pleasures, and confirmed a generall Councell of the union, consisting
of fourty choice men of the three Estates, to dispose of the publike affaires, and conferre
with the Provinces and Townes of the League.</hi> To which many Assistants were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
added by the Nobles, and a Declaration (in manner of an oath) for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of the Vnion, made, sworne, and subscribed to by many; one of which
prickt his own Arme, to signe it with his owne blood, and became lame thereby. The
people condemne, imprison, spoile, ransom of their absolute power, and sell the goods
of any that bears not the mark of their inraged faction. Hereupon the King turning
his lenitie into fury, <hi>Proclaims them Rebels and Traitors, if they come not in and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
by a day; and reconciles himselfe to the King of</hi> Navarre: They go on with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Souldiers. The King at last besieged <hi>Paris,</hi> take some of the Outworks, and was
like to master the Citie; but in the middest of this attempt he was stabbed in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a Knife, by <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> a <hi>Iacobin</hi> Friar of two and twenty years old, (sent

by those who came in to assist the king, who within few houres after died of this
wound, which he received in the self-same chamber wherein the Counsell for the
Massacre of the Protestants was held on that fatall day of Saint <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> 1572.
A notable circumstance of Divine justice upon this Prince, who being ever a zealous
promoter of the Romish Religion, was murthered by a Zealot of it, and had his owne
blood shed by those who spurred him on to shed the blood of Protestants, in the very
Chamber where the most babarous Massacre of Protestants that ever the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,

of the Parliaments of <hi>France:</hi> 
               <q>In the Register of the Acts of Parliament, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
1368. there is one dated the twenty seventh of <hi>Iune</hi> 1369. for matter of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and assassinate committed on the person of Master <hi>Emery Doll,</hi> Councellor of
the said Parliament; whereby it was approved, <hi>That it was a crime of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to kill a Councellor of Parliament.</hi> And in <hi>Anno</hi> 1475. on the eleventh day of
<hi>November, Mounseir the Chancellor</hi> came to advertise the Court for going to
hear the confession of the Constable of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom for his rebellions and
disobediences king <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleventh directed his Processe. And the said Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
declared, <hi>That there was not a Lord in the Kingdome so great, except the
King and Mounsiour le Daulphine, but ought to come and appear at the said Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

by the Parquet <hi>des Huisiers</hi> thereof. So that by this illustrious and Soveraigne

the Oath which he took at his sacring, <hi>exhorting the said Parliament to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
good justice, according as the King had promised to doe by his said Oath, which
he purposed to keep;</hi> and the Oath is there Registred downe. The Parliaments of
<hi>France</hi> are Oaks with exalted Heads, under whose Branches the people are covered
from the very strongest violencies, which constraineth them to yeeld obedience to
their Prince: But when Princes (by bad councell) misprize the authoritie of them
whereof they ought to be zealous defenders, as being exalted to the Royall dignity,
to rule and governe their Subjects by justice, they cut off the right hand from the left:
If they refuse the holy Remonstrances of their Parliaments under color that they are

reporteth, that king <hi>Lewes the Debonnaire,</hi> holding his Parliament in <hi>May,</hi> there
came thither from strange Provinces, two Brethren, kings of <hi>Vvilses,</hi> who with

the Eldest did him homage, with Oath of allegiance, in the said Parliament.</hi>

made some exception concerning the forme and terms of the Oath; And not being

Augustus</hi> and of his Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> furnished with Peeres: So that by order
given at <hi>Melum</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1204. the form of the said Oath was prescribed, and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred

this Question,</hi> Whether the power of the Republike, or King be greater?) That the
whole Kingdom, State and People in every lawfull Kingdom, and in <hi>Spain</hi> it selfe, are of
greater power and authority then the King: <hi>His reasons (which I have for brevity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
into number in his own words) are these: First,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cause all Royall Power that is
lawfull, hath its originall from the People, by whose grant the first Kings in every Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
were placed in their Royall Authoritie; which they circumscribed with certain laws
and sanctions, lest it should too much exalt it selfe to the distruction of the Subjects, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into a Tyrannie. This appears in the <hi>Lace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aemonian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> long since, who committed
onely the care of Warre and procuration of holy things to the King, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> Writes.
Also by a later example of the <hi>Aragonians</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who being incited with an earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of defending their libert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and not ignorant how the Rights of Libertie are much
diminished from smail beginnings, created a middle Magistrate, like the Tribunall power
(commonly called at this time <hi>Aragoniae Iustitia,</hi> the Iustice of Aragon) who armed
with the lawes, authoritie and endeavours of the people, hath hitherto held the Royall
Power included within certain bounds; and it was specially given to the Nobles, that there
might be no collusion, if at any time having communicated their counsell among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they should keep assemblies without the Kings privity, to defend their Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
In these Nations, and those who are like them, no man will doubt, but that the
authoritie of the Republike is greater then the Kings. Secondly, because in other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the people have lesser and the Kings more power, and all grant the King to be
the Rector and supream Head of the Commonwealth, and to have supream authoritie in
managing things in times of warre or peace; yet there the whole Commonwealth and
those who represent it, being chosen out of all Estates, and meeting together in one place,
(<hi>or Parliament)</hi> are of greater power to command and deny, than the King, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by experience in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the King can impose no Taxes, nor enact no Laws if the
people dissent or approve them not: Yea, let the King use art, propound rewards to the
Citizens, sometimes speak by threats to draw others to consent to him, solicite with words,
hopes, and promises, (which whether it may be well done we dispute not:) yet if they shall
resist, their judgement shall be preferred and ratified before the Kings will. Thirdly,
because when the King dies without Issue or Heir, the Kingdom and people, not the Prince

deceased, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t were of greater Power then the King.
Fiftly, because it is not likely that the whole Kingdom and Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>weal would ever
strip themselves of all Power and Authority, and transfer it to another, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without counsell and reason, when they had no necessitie to do it, that so the Prince sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to corruption and wickednesse, might have greater Power then they all, and the Issu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be more excellent then the Father, the River than the Spring (<hi>the Creature than the
Creator of it:)</hi> And although perchance it be in the pleasure of the Commonweal to take
away the pleanary Power from it self and give it to the Prince, yet the Commonwealth
should do unwisely to give it, and the Prince ras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tie, should dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into a Tyrannie, which then onely is Regall, if it contain it self within the bounds
of modesty and mediocritie; which Power whiles some unvisely labour daily to augment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they diminish and utterly corrupt it, that Power being onely safe which puts a measure to
its strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a Prince ought to rule over those who are willing, to gain the love of his
subjects, and seek their welfare; which Power if it grows grievous, takes the King off his

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o weaknesse: <hi>Which he proves by the forecited Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of</hi> Theopompus: For Princes who impose a Bridle on this greatnesse, more easily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
themselves, it, and their subjects; whereas those who forget humanity and modes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r is their fall: This danger our Ancestours, wise men,
considering how they might keep their Kings within the limits of mediocrity and modesty,
so as not to lift up themselves with overmuch power, to the Publike prejudice, have enacted
many things wisely and excellently; among others this, That nothing of great moment
should be decreed without the consent of the Peers and people; and to that end they had a
custom to assemble Parliaments chosen out of all orders of men, as Prelates, Lords, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ities; which custom at this time is still retained in <hi>Aragon</hi> and other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and I wish our Princes would restore it:<note place="margin">Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> For why is it discontinued for the most part in
our Nation, but that the common consent being taken away, and Parliaments excluded,
wherein the publike safety is contained, both publike and private affairs may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Princes pleasure, and the lusts of a few corrupt, vicious, and voluptuous Courtiers
and Parasites may domineer and order all things. Sixtly, becauss many great and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men hold, that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is of greater Power then any King, is yet subject
to the whole Church and a Generall Councell; therefore the King must much more be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to his Kingdom. Seventhly, because the whole Commonwealth hath greater strength
and forces than the Prince, be he never so great in Power; and therefore if they disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
their Power will be greater: Yea, <hi>Aristotle</hi> wisely would have the Commonweal, not
onely to be of greater authority, but likewise to have stronger Forces then the King; <hi>which
he proves by</hi> Aristotles <hi>forecited words, by the practice of the</hi> Ancients, <hi>and those
of</hi> Syracuse, who did moderate their Tyrants and Kings Guard so, that they might be able
to over-power and master them upon any occasion. How great the authoritie of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike
and Nobilitie was in the times of our Ancestors, I will give you but one example,
and so conclude: <hi>Alfonso</hi> the eight King of <hi>Casteil</hi> besieged <hi>Concha,</hi> a City seated in
Roc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:29602:227"/>
and in a nationall assembly, he demands, that because the people were wearied with Taxe:
for supporting the Warre, the gentlemen would give five Muruedines a Poll to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury;
that this opportunitie of blotting out the name of the Mores was not to be omitted.

               </gap>g a band of Nobles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> departed from the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
readily to defend with Armes the Liberty gotten by their Ancestors with Armes
and valour; affirming, that he would neither suffer a beginning to be made of oppressing
and vexing the Nobilitie with new Subsidies, from this entrance or occasion; That to
suppresse the Mores was not of so great moment, that they should suffer the Commonwealth
to be involved in a greater servitude. The King moved with the danger, desisted from that
purpose. The Nobles taking advice, decreed to entertain <hi>Peter</hi> with a banquet every year,
as a reward to him and his Posteritie of this good service, amonument so posterity of a thing
well done, and a document that they should not suffer the right of libertie to be diminished
upon any occasion. Let it be a fixt resolution therefore to provide for the safetie of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
for the Authority of the Prince, yet so as to retain their royall principality in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with certain bounds and limits, and that those vain talking parasites and decevers may
not ruine both, who exalt the Princes Power without measure, of which we may see a
great number in Princes Courts, excelling in wealth, favour and power, which plague
shall alwayes be accused and complained of, but shall ever be and continue. <hi>Thus</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,

those that infringe them, and their examples are the best means to draw subjects to obey
them. <hi>Where he again affirms,</hi> That the whole Kingdom is above the King, and may
not onely binde him by Lawes, but question him for the breach of them. <hi>Before both these,
in his first Book</hi> De Rege &amp; Reguminstitutione, Chap. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>he affirms the like;
adding moreover,</hi> That in many other Realms more, where the Crown is hereditary, the
whole Commonwealth, not the King hath and ought to have the chief power to designe by
a Law (which the King himself may not alter, but by their consents) who shall be the
next Heir, to avoid questions and commotions about the Title to the Crown: That where
the Right of the Crown is in controversie the whole Kingdom and State ought to decide
the right, and settle it where they see best cause: That if the right Heir in Hereditary
Kingdoms, yea in <hi>Spain,</hi> be an Ideot, Infant, Woman, or a person unmeet or not so fit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as others of the blood, he may be lawfully put from the Crown, and another of their
Race lawfully substituted King in his place by the whole State, especially when the good or
safetie of the Commonwealth requires it; because the safety of the people is the supremest
Law, and what they by common consent have Enacted onely for the publike safetie, they
may without any obstacle alter, when things require it, by like common consent; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
because the hereditary Rights of reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing are for the most part made, rather by
the dissimulation of the People, not daring to resist the will of former Princes, then by
their certain will, and the free consent of all the Estates: That he which is thus settled by
consent of all the Estates hath a just Title against the next Heir of the Blood and his Issue,
who are put by the Crown; else divers Kings and Princes now reigning in Spain &amp; elswhere,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29602:227"/>
should be usurpers and want good Titles to their crownes, they or their Ancestors being
not the next right heires of the Royall Stock (<hi>for all which particulars he gives sundry
instances in the Kingdomes of</hi> Spaine) <hi>as in</hi> Berengaria, Blanch, <hi>the</hi> Mother of Lewes
of France, Ferdinand, Sancho the younger sonne of Alfonso, Henry the Bastard, Iohn
King of Portugall, Fardinand, and Iohn the 2. of Aragon, &amp;c. corluding, That if the
King degenerate into a Tirant, by subverting Religion, Lawes, Liberties, oppressing,
murthering, or deflowring his subjects; the whole Kingdome may not onely question,
admonish, and reprehend him, but in case he prove incorrigible after admonition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him, and substitute another in his place; which (saith he) hath been done more
then once in Spain: Thus King Peter was publikely rejected for his cruelty to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and Henry his Brother (though of an unclean Mother) obtained the Crowne: so
Henry his Nephewes Nephew for his slothfulnesse and evill manners was deposed by the
Nobles suffrages, and Alphanso his Brother, though but a yong child proclaimed King.

incorrigible after publike admonitions of the whole State, if there be no hopes of
amendnent, may not onely be deposed, but put to death and murthered by the whole
State, or any particular persons by their appointment; yea without it, (<hi>a note somewhat
above Ela)</hi> if he be declared a publike enemy by the whole state; and in case the whole
states cannot publikely assemble by reason of such a Princes knowne notorious tyranny,
he writes, That then in such a case it is lawfull for any private man to murther him, to
free the Countrey and Kingdome from destruction. <hi>Adding,</hi> that it is a wholsome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
for Princes to be perswaded, that if they oppresse the Common-wealth, if they
become intollerable thorow vices and filthinesse, that they live in such a condition, that

that it seemed most unjust, that the fruit of others valour should return to those who

it; a that it was better to die valiantly, than to lose the liberty gained by their Ancestors,

themselves; whose ears were proud, whose speeches contumelious, whose accesse difficult,
riotings new, cruelty inhumane; Shall we who have yet hardly escaped the servitude
of Moors, undergo anew bondage prepared, from the Christians? They will deride both
us and ours. Doth the whole world, as farre as Christianity extends it selfe, obey the
German Emperours? Shall all the grace, power, honour, riches, gained by ours, and our
Ancessors blood, give place to the Germans? Shall they leave dangers, repulses, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

our Ancestors have shaken off? Shall we be a vulgar people without grace, without Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
without authority, obnoxious to those, to whom if we had vigorous mindes, if we
were men, we might be a terrour? But it is difficult to resist the Emperous endeavours,
not to obey the Roman Pontifs commands: verily it a basnesse of spirits, for an uncertain
fear of war, to involve the Commonwealth in most certain dangers: many things are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by triall, which seemed difficult to slothfull men. I know not what stupidity hath
seized on many, whom neither glory moves, nor the infamey of the wretchednesse, thinking
it great liberty enough if they be freed from scourges. I suppose the Popes ears will not be
so averse to our affairs, that he will not be moved with our most just prayers, and the
equity of the cause; Let some now be sent, who may boldly defend the cause of our liberty
before him, and teach him, that the Germans demand unjust things. Mine opinion is, that
the liberty gained by our Ancestors, it to be defended with arms against the attempts of
all men, and with this my sword I will maintain, THAT THEY ARE MOST
WICKED TRAITORS TO THEIR COVNTREY, who out of a simulation
of a fond Religion, or shew of preposterous caution, shall give contrary advice, neither
shall resolve, that servitude is to be repudiated with greater care by us, then domination

his own blood, contrary to all Law and nature. Wherefore being ill intreated by him

fell into another worse then the first, his Nobles holding this for a Maxime, That a
Tyrant being offended will at some time revenge himself, and therefore they must
not trust him upon any reconciliation, who to pacifie the troubles which had grown
by his own errour, had made no difficulty to sacrifice (upon the peoples spleen) his

Secondly, for the Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and originall constitution of the Kingdom, I

illustratae, Sancho</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">the fourth King of <hi>Arragon</hi> dying without issue, the Estates and
people advising together what course they should take for their security and future
good administration of the Common-weale, about the year of our Lord, 842. elected
twelve principall men to whom they committed the care and government of the
Republike during the <hi>Inter-regnum.</hi> These because they were very ancient men,
were called Elders, from whence those who by birth are stiled Rici-men, drew their
originall; And this manner of governing the Common-wealth continued long;
But the great incursions of the <hi>Arabians</hi> pressing them, they imagined it would not
continue firme and stable: Yet notwithstanding, taken with the sweetnesse of Liberty,
they feared to subject themselves to the Empire of one man; because verily they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that servitude would proceed from thence. Therefore having considered and
rightly pondered all things, and reasons, they made this the result of all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;
that they should consult with Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the second, and the <hi>Lombards;</hi>
what course they should take by their advise, which should be most meet for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating
of the Empire: to whom, as reports goe, they returned this answer. That
preordaining certaine Rights and Lawes, retified with the previous religion of
a cautionary oath, they should set up one King over them; but yet should reject a
forraign Dominion; and that they should take heed, that he whom they adopted to
be King, should be neither of the superiours, nor inferiours; left, if superiour, he should
oppresse inferiours, or lest, if inferiour, hee should be derided by superiours; To
which counsell and sentence they submitting, founded that ancient Suprarbian
Court: For according to the answer given, all decreed, That they ought to elect one
man excelling in vertue for their King; But yet, lest the pleasures of Kings, like
as in other Princes, should likewise even among us become Lawes, they first of all
enacted some Lawes by which they might heale this inconvenience. These Lawes
they afterward called the Suprarbian Court, which we should largely prosecute, but
through the injury of time, the knowledge of them is buried, and some fragments of
them only are extant, observed by Prince <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe, and some other
Writers, which we shall verily remember; because they are as the first elements of
our Republike, and containe in them, the institution of the Magistrate of the <hi>Iustice of
Arragon,</hi> which is the chiefe thing of our institution; therefore in the beginning of
that Court it was provided, that the King which should be, since the Kingdom, lately
taken from the <hi>Moores,</hi> was freely and voluntarily conferred on him, should be
bound both by the Religion of an Oath, as likewise by the force and power of
Lawes, to observe the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdom; Now the Lawes were
these,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Governe thou the Kingdome in peace and righteousnesse, and give us better Courts of
justice.</p>
            <p>The things which shall bee gained from the <hi>Moores,</hi> let them be devided not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Rich-men, but likewise between the souldiers and infantry; but let a stranger
receive nothing from thence.</p>
            <p>Let it bee unlawfull (or a wicked act) for the King to enact Lawes, unlesse it be by
the advice of his Subjects first given.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:29602:238"/>
Let the King beware, that he begin no Warre, that he enter into no Peace, conclude no
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uce, or handle any other thing of great moment, without the concurring assent of the
Elders.</p>
            <p>Now lest that our Lawes or Liberties should suffer any detriment, Let there be a certain
middle Iudge at hand, to whom it may be lawfull to appeal from the King, if he shall wrong
any one, and who may repell injuries, if peradventure he shall offer any to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">With these Lawes therefore and sanctions, those our Ancestors confirmed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
of new moulding and reforming the Common-wealth: But verily this was
the chiefest garison for to retaine their liberty, whereby they ordained the President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of a middle Iudge; placing the power in such sort in the King, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
of it should be in the middle Iudge: out of which things, the moderate and
musicall state of the Common-weale which we enjoy, is moulded and made up. For
from the very beginning of things even to these later times, wee see by force of this intermediate Magistrate, and by the goodnesse and clemency of most peaceable
Kings, that both our pristine liberty, and ancient Priviledge hath been alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and due loyalty and reverence to the Kings Majesty, observed: Neither hath
the Kingdome onely emplored the help of this Magistrate against Kings, but the
Kings themselves oft-times against the Kingdome; by which meanes, many intestine
evils have been appeased without any tumult, which unlesse they had been civilly
suppressed, seemed verily to have been likely to have broken out to the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of all men; so as we may rightly affirm, that in this alone, the summe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
civill concord both to Kings and the Kingdome hath consisted. This Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
was at first called THE IUSTICE MAIOR; afterwards assuming
the name of the Kingdome it selfe, it was called THE IUSTICE OF
ARAGON: By these (formentioned) prescribed Lawes, the will of him who
desired to be King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> was wholy to bee directed and formed; and unlesse
he would first suffer his faith to bee obliged in most strick bonds for keeping of
them, any future soliciting was to be preposterous. Having therefore laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of their Countreys liberty, all of them began to dispute among themselves
about electing a King: to which end, they all assembled together at <hi>Arahvest</hi> to
chuse a King; where they were suddenly besieged by the <hi>Arabians:</hi> which <hi>Iunicus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rista</hi>
King of the <hi>Pompelonians</hi> hearing of, came with an Army and rescued them;
whereupon they elected him for their King with unanimous consent, and calling

and made King of <hi>Aragon</hi> about the year 868. Moreover, to establish all these
Lawes and Constitutions, our Ancestors themselves adjoyned the accession of a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29602:239"/>
publike Vnion; ordaining, that it should be lawfull and just for them, to meet all
together, ET REGI OBSISTERE ARMIS ET VI, and to resist the King
with armes and force, as oft as there should be need to propulse any assault of him
or his, made against the Lawes; which form of assembling together for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cause of liberty, they called a Vnion, (or Association:) Neither did they ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lesse think all their Liberties to be preserved by this Vnion, then humane bodies
themselvs are by nervs and bones. And although it were not prescribed in that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prarbian

and deeply fixed and impressed in the sense of all men, and to be established by our
common Law, as by another Law of Nature, and that its force was enough and
more then sufficiently known and discerned by use and reason. For they said, <hi>it
would be but a thing of little profit for them, to have good Lawes enacted, and the
very Iudiciary Presidentship of a middle Iudge, if when there should be need, AD EA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RVM

those ancient Rulers of which we treat, the Liberty of our Country was hedged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
by our Ancestors with three most strong fences; namely, with the Pretecture
of this middle Iudge, with the most ample power of the <hi>Rici-men</hi> (or <hi>Palatines</hi>) and
with this most fierce force of the Vnion; of which the first seemed to be Legal and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
the other domesticall and of greatest moment; the last warlike and popular.
Neither ought it then to be inclosed with a lesser hedge, that so we might rejoyce, that
it hath therby come safe &amp; sound to us now. But of these garrisons or fences the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inventers of them, and those who next succeeded them, conferred more assistance
and labour upon the two last, namely the domestick and popular, then on that Court
presidentship: For they would alwayes retain in themselves a power of moderating

elected out of the greatest men, by whose Counsels the Kings ought to be hedged in
on every side: the place of which Elders, the <hi>Rici-men</hi> afterwards possessed; who
were the chiefe of our Nobles; who in times past were second to the Kings in such
sort, that they might seem to be their Peers and Companions. These called that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

be the prime and principall conservators of it: for thus they called the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the Vnion. Finally, they sustained on their necks all the Offices and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of peace and warre, if not with the same power as the Kings, yet I may truly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29602:239"/>
say with very little lesse; for the <hi>Rici-men,</hi> as long as they flourished, relying on the
Forces of the Vnion, did alwayes hover over the Royall Empire, and by the intire
power of their offices, if the violence or assaults of Kings were unjust, did from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
reduce them into order, and as it were into a circle of Law and Iustice. In
which thing verily their grave censorious and domesticall authority had sufficient
right and moment with our ancient Kings, who were well mannered: but if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
they could not with their fitting counsels bridle the exulting royall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they did constantly repell them from their necks with the force of the raised V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

since it became a Realme, <hi rend="margQuotes">were alwaies, elected by the chiefest Nobles and
States, unanimous suffrages; That after the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> became Christians,
their power began to be more restrained then it was at first, the Clergy being
wholly exempt from their royall Iurisdiction: That the king cannot judge of
the life or fame of a knight (unlesse in some speciall cases) without it be in the
assembly of the Estates with the Senate, not yet publickly make <hi>Warre or Peace,</hi>
with any, nor impose Taxes or Tributes or new Customes, nor alienate any of the
goods of the Realme, nor yet doe or decree any greater thing pertaining to the
Common-wealth without the Senates or Parliaments assent. Neither can hee
make new Lawes, nor publickly command money in an extraordinary manner,
nor coine money, nor nominate a Successor not with the Senate, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Nobility, whether of Knights or Gentlemens Order; By, or out of
whom all publicke Magistrates and Senators almost are chosen: so as now the
summe or cheifest power of the Republicke is residing in them. So that the
Kingdome and Republicke of the <hi>Polonians</hi> doth not much differ in reason from,
that of the <hi>Lecedae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

exacted of the new King when he is crowned, to this effect. That he shall raigne
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29602:243"/>
according to the Lawes and institutes of his Predecessors; and will safely conserve
to every order and man his right, priviledge, and benefit, confirmed by former
Kings; nor will he diminish any of the borders or goods of the Realme, but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his power recover those that are lost from others: After all which the
Senate sweare fealty to him, &amp;c. The Revenues, Tributes, and Customes of the
king are all reduced to a certainty; the Nobles &amp; Clergie are exempted from Taxes.
The King by the Lawes of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> is prohibed to alien to any one the
Lands of the Crowne. No new Lawes can be made, nor old ones repealed but
by the king, Senate and Nobles assembled in Parliament. And because there is
wont to be in highest power, a slippery and ready degree to Tyrannie, certaine
Senators and Councellours are adjoyned to the King, who may direct his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
And Actions to the safety of the Common-wealth, and his judgements accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rule of justice and equitie, and with their wholsome monitions and

the Councell without an Oath: and this Office is perpetuall during life, having
certaine Honours and Magistracies thereto annexed, partly Ecclesiasticall, partly

Most of the great Officers and Magistrates are chosen in Parliament, and cannot be
displaced but in Parliament, and that for some great offence. Their Parliaments or
Generall Assemblies of the States are held (much like ours) once every yeare at
least, and some times every fift or sixth moneth, if there be occasion; and then they

handled by their subjects for their Tyranny and misgovernment. Not to mention the
murthers of <hi>Canutus</hi> in <hi>Iutland</hi> in the very Church, or of <hi>Magnus</hi> or <hi>Nicholas,</hi> slain
by their subjects; <hi>King Humblus</hi> was deprived of his Crown: and king <hi>Harold</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by his subjects for his insolency. <hi>Suano</hi> waxing proud, Tyrannous and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to his people, became so odious to them, that his Nobles adjoyned <hi>Canutus</hi> and
<hi>Waldemar</hi> to him in the royall government, and divided the kingdom between them;
who thereupon being much displeased, slew <hi>Canutus</hi> and wounded <hi>Waldemar,</hi> being
impatient of any Peers in government; for which being soon after vaquished by <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar,</hi>
hee was beheaded by the people. <hi>Able</hi> slaying and beheading his brother
king <hi>Ericus,</hi> and usurping his Crown, the people rose up in arms against him, took

<hi>Waldemar</hi> was expelled the Realme by his Subjects, and afterwards restored upon his

might be cut off, it was decreed, <hi>That Kings should command nothing of greater

Crowne, and in time inflict punishments on his enemies. Wherefore recalling his
wife from exile, he first of all endeavoured to reconcile him selfe to the Britains:
then calling the chiefest of his subjects to him, he ratified with a most solemne oath
the oblivion of his former courses; he committed every most wicked person to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as if he reserved them for punishment, and religiously promised, that <hi>he would
doe nothing hereafter, but by the advice of his Nobles.</hi> When by these things he had
given assurance of his sincere mind, he celebrated the agreement with pastimes, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,

up with joy, he called most of the Nobility to a supper; where, when he had shut
them up (improvident and unarmed) in one roome, sending in his assasinates, he
slew them every one. This calamity not so much terrifying as exasperating the
minds of the rest with new flames of anger, they gathered a great army together,
<hi>all men conspiring to take away this detested monster;</hi> whom they slew in battell,
together with his wicked confederates. After whose slaughter, the Nobles putting

being much discontented, and fearing worser things, privily raised an Army against

reines to all Vices: he was cruell and covetous towards his Nobles, kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with men of the basest Ranke; gave himselfe onely to the rapes of maides,
matrons, and immoderate feasts, having fidlers, Stage-players, and ministers of all
sorts of pleasures almost about him: with which vices the Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended, admonished him of his duty. But he proudly centemning them,
wished them to looke after other matters, saying, he had councell enough from
others, and that they should lay aside their false hope, that they could reclaime the
King by their Councell. On the contrary he was of so poore a dejected Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his enemies, that he not onely granted them peace, but remitted them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
and restored them Castles as soone as they demanded them. Which caused
the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> to consult together to depose him by force of Armes; from
which <hi>Douglasse</hi> disswaded them for the present, by reason of their forraigne wars

to turne the Kingdome into a tyrannie, nourished great divisions among the Nobles;

admonishing him of his duty; which he notwithstanding neglected, till the wars

the remainder of the Kingdome which was left, cast him into prison; where for
griefe of his inhibited pleasures, or feare of publike shame, he layd violent hands

                  <q>The Ancient custome of our Ancestors in punishing their Kings, suffers not our
forcing of the Queene to renounce her right unto the Crowne to her sonne, to
seeme a Novelty; and the moderation of the punishment, shewes it proceeded
not from envie: for so many Kings punished with death, bonds, banishment
by our Ancestors, voluntarily offer themselves in the ancient Monuments of
Histories, that we neede no forraigne examples to confirme our owne act:
For the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, seeing it was free from the beginning, created it selfe
Kings upon this very Law, that the Empire being conferred on them by the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of the people, if the matter required it, they might take it away againe
by the same suffrages; of which law many footsteps have remained even to
our age: for in the Islands which lye round about us, and in many places of
the Continent, wherein the Ancient language and constitutions have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
this very custome is yet observed in creating Governours: likewise the
Ceremonies which are used in the Kings inauguration have also an expresse
image of this Law; out of which it easily appeares, that a Kingdome is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but the mutuall stipulation betweene the people and their Kings: the
same likewise may be most apparently understood out of the inoffensive te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the ancient Law, preserved from the very beginning of raigning among
the <hi>Scots</hi> even unto our age; when as no man in the meane time hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
not onely not to abrogate this Law, but not so much as to shake it,
or in any part to diminish it: Yea, whereas our Ancestors have deprived so
many Kings as would bee tedious to name, of their Realme; condemned
them to banishment, restrained them in prisons, and finally punished them
with death, yet there was never any mention made of abating the rigor of
the Law; neither perchance undeservedly, since it is not of that kinde of
Lawes which are obno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ingraven in the mindes of men in the first originall of mankinde, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the mutuall consent well-nigh of all Nations, which continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken
and sempiternall together with the Nature of things, and being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the commands of no man; domineere and rule over all men. This
law (which in every action offers it selfe to our eyes and mindes, and dwels
in our brests will we, nill we) our Ancestors following, were alwayes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against violence, and suppressed the unrulinesse of Tyrants. Neither is this
Law proper onely to the <hi>Scots,</hi> but common to all well-ordered Nations and
People: as the <hi>Athenians, Lacaedemonians, Romanes, Venetians, Germanes,
Danes:</hi> which he there manifests by examples.</q> So that I may hence infallibly
determine, the Realme, Parliament, and Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> collectively
considered, to be the Soveraigne power in that Realme, superiour to the
Kings themselves: from whom I shall proceede to Scripture Presidents,
in the Kings and Kingdomes of the <hi>Gentiles, Israel,</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> recorded in
Scripture.</p>

Kingdoms, States, and Parliaments are above their kings, and of greater power then
they, I shall therefore (to close up this Posterne Gate of Evasion) conclude with
Scripture Presidents, ratifying this truth beyond all contradiction. To begin with
Heathen kings and States therein recorded. I read in the</hi> 1 Sam. 29. <hi>and</hi> 1 Chro. 12. 19.
That when <hi>David</hi> with his men offered to go with <hi>Achish</hi> and the Philistines against
King <hi>Saul</hi> (his Soveraign) and the Israelites to Battell, and passed on in the rereward
with <hi>Achish;</hi> the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Philistines seeing it, said, What do these Hebrews here?
To whom <hi>Achish</hi> answered, Is not this <hi>David</hi> the servant of <hi>Saul</hi> King of Israel, which
hath been with me these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this day? Hereupon the Princes of the Philistines were wroth with him, and taking
advice together, said to their King <hi>Achish,</hi> Make this fellow returne that he may goe
again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to
Battell, lest in the Battell he be an adversary to us; for wherewith should be reconcile
himself to his Master? should it not be with the Heads of these men? Is not this <hi>David,</hi>
of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, <hi>Saul</hi> slew his thousands, and <hi>David</hi>
his ten thousands? Then <hi>Achish</hi> called <hi>David,</hi> and said unto him, Surely as the Lord
liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and coming in with me in the Host is
right in my sight, for I have not found evill in thee since the day of thy coming; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
the Lords favour thee not; wherefore now return and go in peace, that thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
not the Lords of the Philistines. And when <hi>David</hi> replied, What have I done,
&amp;c. that I may not fight against the Enemies of my Lord the King? <hi>Achish</hi> answered
him, I know thou art good in my sight as an Angell of God, notwithstanding the Princes
of the Philistines have said, HE SHALL NOT GOE VP WITH VS TO
BATTELL; wherefore rise up early in the morning with thy Masters servants that
are come with thee, and assoon as ye have light, depart; whereupon they returned. <hi>Here
we see the Lords of the Philistines did peremptorily overrule their king against his
will, who durst not contradict them; therefore they had a Power superiour to his:

Bribes, and perverted judgement; <hi>thereupon ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL

and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy wayes, now MAKE
VS A KING TO IVDGE VS LIKE ALL THE NATIONS: But the
thing displeased, <hi>Samuel,</hi> when they said, Give us a King to judge us; and <hi>Samuel</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

served other gods, so do they also unto thee: Now therefore hearken to their voyce;
howbeit, yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the King that

I will be thy King, where is any other that may save thee in all thy Cities? and thy

<hi>THEY DESIRED A KING,</hi> and God gave them <hi>Saul</hi> the son of <hi>Cis,</hi> by
the space of forty years. <hi>All these concurring sacred Texts will infallibly demonstrate,
that this change of the Iudges into Kings, and the originall creation of their Kings
and kingdoms proceeded only from the importunity and authority of the people, who
would not be gainsaid herein, not from Gods institution, or</hi> Samuels <hi>approbation,
who censured and disavowed this their motion, though they at last condescended to
it; all which is elegantly related, confirmed by</hi> Iosephus, Antique. Iudaeorum, l. 6. c. 4,
5, 6, 7. <hi>By all this it is apparent, that the congregation and people of the Iews had the
Soveraign power in themselves, as well as other Nations, because the authoritie to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the whole frame of their former</hi> Aristocraticall Government <hi>into a Monarchy,
resided in them, though they were taxed forchanging it in</hi> Samuels <hi>dayes, who had so
justly, so uprightly judged them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly, it is apparent,</hi> that the Iudges and kings of the Israelites were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
hereditary, but oft elective by the people: and though God did sometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
nominate the persons of those that should reign over them, as is apparent by <hi>Saul,
David, Ieroboam, Iehu,</hi> others; yet the people did constantly confirm, make them kings,
and gave them their royall authority, none being made kings by Divine appointment,
but such as they willingly accepted, approved, confirmed for their kings; Gods previous
designation being but a preparative to their voluntary free (<hi>not restrained or limited</hi>)
election. <hi>The first king among the</hi> Israelites (<hi>though but over part of them) was</hi> Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech
<hi>the son of</hi> Ierubbaal, <hi>who was made king</hi> by the peoples election, Iudges, 9. 1,
<hi>to 7. who having perswaded those of</hi> Sechem <hi>to elect him for their king, thereupon
ALL THE MEN</hi> of Sechem gathered together, and <hi>ALL THE HOVSE</hi> of Millo
went and <hi>MADE ABIMELECH KING: whence</hi> Iotham <hi>thus upbraided them and him,
Verse 14. to</hi> 19: Then said all the trees unto the Bramble, come thou and reign over
us: And the Bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye annoint me king over you; thèn
come and put your trust in my shadow, &amp;c. Now therefore if ye have done truly and
sincerely in that <hi>YE HAVE MADE</hi> Abimelech <hi>KING,</hi> &amp;c And that ye have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
up against my fathers house this day, and have <hi>MADE</hi> Abimelech king, &amp;c. <hi>We read</hi>
Iudg. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21, 23. <hi>that after</hi> Gideon <hi>had slain</hi> Zebab <hi>and</hi> Zalmunna, <hi>with the</hi> Midianites,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29602:258"/>
The men of Israel said unto <hi>Gideon, <hi>Rule thou</hi>
                  </hi> over us, both thou and thy sons, and
thy sons son also, for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And <hi>Gideon</hi>
said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord shall
rule over you. <hi>Where we clearly see, the power and right to elect a Ruler, and to
limit the government to him and his Issue, for three Generations only, to reside</hi> in the
peoples <hi>free election. So</hi> Iudges 10. 17, 18. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 11. 1. <hi>to</hi> 12. When the Children
of <hi>Ammon</hi> were gathered together and encamped against <hi>Gilead,</hi> the people and Princes
of <hi>Gilead</hi> said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Ammon,</hi> he shall be Head over all the Inhabitants of <hi>Gilead.</hi> And the Elders
of <hi>Gilead</hi> went to fetch <hi>Iephthah</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Tob,</hi> and said unto him, Come and
be our Captain that we may fight with the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and be our Head over
all the inhabitants of <hi>Gilead:</hi> Vpon promise of which dignitie, he went with them to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead;
and THE PEOPLE MADE HIM HEAD AND CAPTAIN OVER THEM.
That the election and making of their Kings belonged of right to all the people, is past
dispute, being so resolved by God himself,</hi> Deuter. 17. 14, 15. When thou art come into
the land, &amp;c. and shalt say, I WILL SET A KING OVER ME, like as all
the Nations that are about me, THOV shalt in any wise SET HIM KING OVER
THEE whom the Lord thy God shall choose; one from among thy Brethren shalt
<hi>THOV SET OVER THEE, THOV MAIST NOT SET A STRANGER OVER THEE:
Where the power of creating and electing the King, is left wholly to the peoples free
choice, with these generall restrictions, that he should be one of their brethren, not a
stranger, and particularly qualified as is there expressed. And though God did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
design and nominate their Kings, yet he left the power of approbation and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of them free to the people, as is apparent by</hi> 1 Sa. 8. 18. And ye shall crie in that
day, because of the King <hi>WHICH YE SHALL HAVE CHOSEN</hi> you. Hence Saul <hi>their
first King, though nominated and designed by God and</hi> Samuel, <hi>was yet approved,
confirmed and made King by the People,</hi> Who shouted and said, God save the King,
<hi>when</hi> Samuel <hi>presented him to them;</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 24.<note n="d" place="margin">1 San. 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> But the children of Belial

wrought salvation in Israel. Then said <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people, Come let us go to <hi>Gilgal,</hi>
and renew the Kingdom there. And <hi>ALL THE PEOPLE</hi> went to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and there
<hi>THEY MADE SAVL KING</hi> before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal: Where</hi> Samuel <hi>useth this

               </p>
               <p>Saul <hi>being slain by his owne hands, the Crown descended not to his sonne by way
of descent, but</hi> David <hi>succeeded him by Gods designation, and the Peoples election

saying, Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh. Also in time past, when Saul was King
over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; And the Lord said to
thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a Captain over Israel. So
AL THE ELDERS of Israel came to the King at Hebron, and King David made
a League (<hi>or Covenant</hi>) with them before the Lord; and THEY ANNOINTED
DAVID KING OVER ISRAEL. <hi>And in the</hi> 1 Chron. 12. 23. to 40. <hi>Wee

unto them, depart yet for three dayes, then come again to me; and the people departed.
Hereupon Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before</hi> Solomon <hi>his Father,

                  </gap>ry; that although the kingdome of
Iudah were in some sort hereditary, yet it was confirmed by the Suffrages of the People
(which he proves by the example of Rehoboam and others) and that they obtained the
Royall dignity not onely by inheritance, but likewise by the Suffrages of the People, as
every one may clearly know, who shall but consider the Histories of their kings;
<hi>Which plainly refutes the wild, impudent, false assertion of the Author of</hi> An Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to thy Conscience, <hi>newly published, p. 13. where thus he writes:</hi> Observable
it is, that thorowout the whole Scriptures we read not of <hi>Any King (<hi>I doubt hee

                  </hi> THAT WAS

are partly Negative, partly positive,</hi> But he shall not multiplie Horses to himself, nor
cause the the people to return to Egypt, &amp;c. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself,
that his heart turn not away; neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
And it shall be when he sitteth on the throne of his Kingdome, that he shall write him a
Copie of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests the Levites; and it
shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to
fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and these Statutes to do them;
That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the
Commandment to the right hand or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his dayes
in his Kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel. <hi>Here all the kings of the
Israelites when their kingdoms should be erected, are strictly bound by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to negative and positive conditions, upon performance whereof, they and their
children should prolong their dayes in the kingdom, and perpetuate their thrones in
the midst of Israel, and upon breach whereof they and their posterity should lose both
their lives and kingdom to; as the last clause insinuates, and the subsequent Texts in

Kingdome of Rehoboam, was not of the Iewes (or tribe of Iudah) but of the twelve
Tribes, from whence it followes, that even the Scepter for all those times was of all the Israelites. Now of this Scepter, which was long common to all the twelve Tribes, the
divine Patriarke spake not in that most famous Oracle: for he looked at latter yeares,
and future ages, when as the Tribe of Iudah, the people being divided into contrary
parts, began to have its Republike apart from the Israelites, which God approved and
loved; and would have to be called Iewish, from the Tribe of Iudah alone, untill hee
(to wit Christ) should be given to the assemblies of men, to whom not onely the Empire
of the Iewes, but Gentiles also was destinated. And verily this Majesty of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from the time it once began to be of the Iewes, we say continued to be theirs, although
the state of the Commonweale was sometimes changed, and the soveraignty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire

Kings of the Iewes and others, when they dealt perfidiously, contrary to the Law of
God and the rule of Christ, might be lawfully deposed by the People. This the example
of <hi>Saul</hi> manifestly teacheth, whom God rejected, notwithstanding he had first elected him
King: Yea, whiles wicked Princes and Kings were not removed, all the people were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
of God; as is evident by <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 1. to 6. where they were punished with four judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and plagues for <hi>Manassehs</hi> sinnes. In summe, if the Iewes had not permitted their
King to be so wicked without punishment, they had not beene so grievously punished by
God. By what means he is to be removed from his Office, is easily to conjecture; thou maist
not slay him, nor raise any war or tumult to do it, but the thing is to be attempted by other
means, because God hath called us in peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. If the King be created by common
suffrages, he may again be deprived by common Votes, unlesse they will be punished with
him; but if he be chosen by the election and consent of a few Princes, the people may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to them the flagitious life of the King, and may tell them, that it is by no means to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
that so they may remove him, who have inaugurated him. Here now is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
for those that do this, the Tyrant will proceed against them according to his lust, and
slay whom he pleaseth; but it is a glorious thing to die for justice and the truth of God; and
it is better to die for the defence of justice, then afterwards to be slain with the wicked by
assenting to injustice, or by dissembling, Those who cannot endure this, let them indure a
lustfull and insolent Tyrant, expecting extream punishment together with him; yet the
hand of the Lord is stretched out still, and threatneth a stroke: But when with the consent

                  <hi>all Lawyers and Divines</hi> whatsoever, <hi>that the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutest
Emperors, Monarchs, Kings, that be, are subject to the Lawes of God, of Nature,
of Nations, and cannot justly doe any thing against them to the hurt of pietie, chastity,
fame, life, or what is contrary to good Manners.</hi> Secondly, No doubt every king
is bound in conscience by the Law of God and man, to give satisfaction and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

God threatens, that the sword should never depart from Davids house; that hee
would raise up evil against him out of his own house, that be would take his wives before
his eyes and give them unto his Neighbour, who should lye with them in the sight of the
Sunne, before all Israel,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 10, 11, 12. which was <hi>actually fulfilled in and by

was exempt from all Lawes being a King, and that he could not sinne against a Subject,</hi>
is point-blank against the History, and Text it selfe; and manifested to be apparantly
false by all the premised Scriptures and Authorities. Fourthly, the true reason of

in this regard, <hi>David</hi> now confessing his sinne to God himselfe, useth this expression

This will be the manner of the King that shall reign over you; He will take your sons and

Vineyards, and your Oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your Vineyards, and give to his servants:
And he will take your manservants, your maidservants, your goodliest young men and
your Asses, and put them to his service; he will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall

                  <hi>Secondly, it is Gods expresse Edict,</hi> Ezek. 46. 18. The Prince shall not take the
Peoples inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possessions, but he shall give his
Sons inheritance out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every one from
his possession. <hi>And</hi> Ezek 45. 8, 9. The Land shall be the Princes possession in Israel,
and my Princes shall no more oppresse my people, and the rest of the Land shall they give

               <p>First,<note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> it is undeniably evident from all the premises, <hi>That all Monarchies, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,

Kings elections, with their suffrages; which God would have to be thus, that
so whatsoever authority and power they should have, they should, next to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it to the people, and therefore should bestow all their care, thoughts, industrie
for the people profit; neither verily should they think themselves advanced above
other men for their excellency of nature, no otherwise then men are over Heards
and Flocks, but should remember, that being born in the same condition with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29602:271"/>
others, they were lifted up from the ground unto that condition by the suffrages, as it
were, by the Shoulders of the people, upon whose Shoulders the burthen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
should for a great part rest. After which he proves by <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and
divers forecited presidents in Scripture, that God gave the Election and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the kings of Israel to the people; and that notwithstanding the succession of the
kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> was by God entailed afterwards to the Linage of <hi>David,</hi> yet
the Kings thereof actually reigned not before they were ordained by the people.
Whence we may conclude, that the Kingdom of Israel, if we respect the stock, was
certainly hereditary, but if we regard the persons, <hi>altogether elective.</hi> But to what
end was this, if the Election appear, as it is confessed, but that the remembrance of
so great a dignitie conferred by the people, should make them alwayes mindefull of
their duty: So likewise among the Heathens we read, that Kings were constituted by
the people; for when they had wars abroad, or contention at home, some one man, of
whose fortitude and justice the multitude had a great opinion, was by cammon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
assumed for King. And among the<note n="c" place="margin">Herod. l. 1. Cicero, l. 1. Offic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Medes,</hi> saith <hi>Cicero, Deioces</hi> was of an
Arbitrator made a Iugde, of a Iudge created a King; and among the <hi>Romanes</hi> the first
Kings were elected. Therefore when <hi>Romulus</hi> being taken away, the <hi>Inter-regnum</hi>
of the hundred Senators was displeasing to the Romans, they accorded,<note n="d" place="margin">Livius, l. 1.</note> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Kings should be chosen by the Suffrages of the people, the Senate approving
it: And <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud was therefore reputed a Tyrant, for that being created
neither by the people nor Senate, he held the Empire onely by force and power:
Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> although he invaded the Empire by force, yet that he might cosen
the people at least with some p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etext of Law, would seem to have received the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
from the Senate and people: But <hi>Augustus</hi> although he was adopted by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
yet he never bare himselfe as heire of the Empire, by divise; but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it as from the Senate and people; as did also <hi>Caligula, Tiberius, Claudius;</hi>
whereas <hi>Nero,</hi> who first invaded the Empire by force and wickednesse without any
colour of Law, was condemned by the Senate. Since then no man could be born an
absolute King, no man can be a King by himselfe, no man can reigne without the
people: Whereas on the contrary, the people may both be, and are by themselvs, and
are in time before a King; it most certainly appears, that all Kings were first constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the people. Now albeit that from the time that Sons or Nephews imitated the
vertues of their parents, they seem to have made kingdomes as it were hereditary
to themselves in certain Countries, where the free power of Election may seem in
some sort to have ceased, yet that custome hath continued in all well constituted
kingdomes, that the children of the deceased kings should not succeed untill they

they had as it were received investiture of the Realme from those who represent the

this thing. For the kings of <hi>France, Spain,</hi>

thou say, that for an hundred Homunci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es more or lesse, (for the most part far worse

all inferiours whatsoever were created, rather then they for them.
Now reason requires, that he for whose sake another exists, is to be accounted lesser
then he. Thus the Governour of a Ship is instituted by the owner for the Shippes
sake, who sits at the Helme, lest the Ship should be broken on the Rocks, or ill hold
her course. And verily whiles he intends this businesse, the other Mariners serve
him, and the owner himselfe obeyes him; and yet he is a servant of the Ship, as well
as any mariner, neither differs he from a mariner in gender, but in kind: In the
Republike, which is usually compared to a Ship, the King is in place of a Master, the
people of an Owner: Threfore to him seeking the publike safety, the people obey
and submit; when notwithstanding he is, and ought no lesse to be accounted a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Republike, as well as any Judge or Captain, neither differs he from those
in any thing, but that he is bound to beare greater burthens, and undergoe more
dangers: Wherfore verily what things soever the King acquires in warre, or when
he gaineth adjoyning Coasts by right of warre or by sentence of Law, as those things
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29602:273"/>
which are brought into the Eschequer, he acquires to the Kingdom not to himselfe;
to the people, I say, which constitute the kingdome, no otherwise then as a servant
(purchaseth) to his Lord; neither can any obligation be contracted with him, but
by their authority. Furthermore, innumerable people live without a king, but thou
canst not conceive a King without a people, so much as in thy mind. Neither have
some attained a Royall Dignity because they differed in kind from other men, and
ought to rule over others by a certain excellency of nature, as shepheards doe over
their Flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks; but rather, the people created out of the same Masse, have advanced
them to that degree, that so if they enjoyed any authority, any power, they should
acknowledge it received from them, and possesse it as during their pleasure; which
the ancient custome of the French aptly sheweth, who<note n="*" place="margin">Hotomani Franco-Gallia, c. 6.</note> lifting their King up on a
Buckler, proclaimed him King. For why, I pray, are Kings said to have innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eyes, many eares, long hands, most swift feet? what, because they are like to
<hi>Argus, Gerion, Midas,</hi> or to those whom fables have feined? verily no, but indeed
because all the people whom it concerns, lend all their eies, their ears, their hands, feet,
and faculties to the king for the use of the Republike. Let the people recede from the
King, he who even now seemed eyed, eared, strong and flourishing; will suddenly
wax blind, deafe, and fall to nothing; he who erewhile did magnificently triumph,
will in one moment become vile to all: he who even now was adored almost with
divine honours, will be compelled to play the Schoolmaster at <hi>Corinth:</hi> Over-turn
only the basis of this Giant-like heape, and like the Rhodian Colossus, it will
of necessity fall, and be broken into pieces. Since therefore a King exists by and for
the people, and cannot consist without the people; to whom may it seem strange if
we conclude, <hi>That the People are greater then the King.</hi>

As for the Empires at this day (as the <hi>Turkish &amp; Muscovitish,</hi> and others of this kind,
which are rather great Robberies, then Empires) there is not one of them, which if
not at this time, was not at least in times past governed in this manner. But if it
be come to passe through the Magistrats fault and sloathfulnes, that in some places po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
have received a worser Common weal, notwithstanding those who at this day
possesse these Offices, are bound as much as in them is, to revoke all things to
their ancient state. In the <hi>German Empire</hi> which is conferred by election, there are
Princes, and Electors, as well Laicks as Ecclesiasticks, Earles, Barons, Cities, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
of Cities, who as they have the care of the Commonweale in their severall

no detriment by the private endeavours or hatreds of the Emperour. Therefore
there is one Chancellour of the Empire, another of the Emperour; other and different

thou objectest, that Kings were constituted by the people, who perchance lived above
five hundred yeer since, not by the people extant at this day; I answer, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
kings doe die, the people in the mean time (as neither any other Universitie)
never dyeth; for as flowing waters make a perpetuall river, so also the vicissitude of
birth and death an immortall people: Therefore as the <hi>Rheine, Seine, Tyber,</hi> is now
the same as it was above a thousand years agoe, so likewise the Germane, French,
Roman people are the same, (unlesse Colonies shall have casually intervened) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can their right be any wayes changed, either by the flux of water, or change of
individuals. Besides, if they attribute the Kingdom received, not to their people, but
to their Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; he to his Grandfather, and so upwards, could he transfer more right
to another then himself first had? But and if he could not, (as it is certain he could
not) is it not manifest, whatsoever he shall arrogate to himself besides, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
any more usurp it then any theef? But on the contrary the people have a right of
perpetuall eviction. Therefore that the Nobles have been for a long space oppressed
in any Kingdom, can no way prejudice the people; but rather, as the servant should not
be heard, who in that he hath a very long time detained his Lord captive, should
boast, that he was not onely a Free-man, but would likewise arrogate to himself a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29602:276"/>
power of life and death over his Lord: nor yet a Theefe, who because he hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
30. yeers, or is the sonne of a Theefe, should think himselfe to be without fault,
yea rather, by how much the longer he hath been such a one, the more severely should
he be punished: So likewise a Prince is not to be heard or endured, who because
he hath succeeded to a Tyrant, or hath for a long time used the people like a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave,
from whom he hath received his kingdome, or hath offered violence to the
Nobles, should think that what ever he lusted should be lawfull to him, and ought
to be granted of right. Neither doe yeers substract any thing from the peoples right,
but adde to the injury of the King. But what, if the Nobles themselves have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
with the King? what, if in betraying the cause, they have betrayed the people
as it were bound, into the hands of a Tyrant? shall the authority of the people by
this prevarication or treason seem to be plainly transferred upon the King? whether
I say, by this fact is any thing taken away from the liberty of the people, or adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the licentiousnesse of the Prince? You will say, they may impute it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who made choise of such men of perfidious faith. But yet these are as patrons
to patronize the publike profit, and the peoples safety and liberty: Therfore as when
an Advocate shall make a compact with the adversary of his Client, concerning the
value of the suit as they speake, if he had betrayed his cause, he should not hurt him
at all; so this conspiracie of the Nobles, as it were made to the dammage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the people, cannot verily detract any thing from their right; but even
they themselves shall fall into the penalty of the Law, which is promulged against
prevaricators, and the Law permits the people to chuse another patron, and to
prosecute their right againe: For if the Roman people condemned their Emperors
to punishment, who at the Caudine Gallowes had dishonourably contracted with
the enemies, although by compulsion, and reduced to greatest straits; and judged
that they were no wayes obliged by that paction; shall not the people be much
lesse bound to suffer that yoke, which not by force, but willingly; not for feare of
death, but out of desire of gain, hath been thus treacherously put upon them? Or

if the Emperour think any Law necessary, he first desires it in the generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
if it be approved, the Princes, Barons, and Deputies of Cities subsigne it, and
then it is wont to be a firme Law: Yea, he swears, <hi>that he will keep the Laws Enacted,
and that he will make no news Laws but by common consent.</hi> In the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi>
there is a Law, (renewed, <hi>An.</hi> 1454, and 1538.) That no new Laws or Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
shall be made, but onely by publike consent, or in any place but in Parliament.
In the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> where yet commonly the authority of Kings is thought most
ample, Laws were heretofore enacted in the Assembly of the three Estates, or in the
Kings ambulatory Councell; but since there hath been a standing Parliament, all the
Kings Edicts are void, unlesse the Senate approve them; when as yet the Arrests of that
Senate of Parliament, if the law be wanting, even obtain the force of a Law: So in
the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Spain, Hungarie,</hi> and the rest, there is, and of old hath been
the same Law: For if Kingdoms depend upon the conservation of their Laws, and the
Laws themselves should depend upon the lust of one Homuncio, would it not be
certain, that the Estate of no Kingdom should ever be stable? Would not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

               <q>
                  <p>This Head we must handle a little more accurately. This is first
to be observed, that the Patrimony of the Exchequer is one thing, of the Prince ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing; I say, the things of the Emperour, King, Prince are one thing, the things
of <hi>Antonine,</hi>

                     <hi>Henry, Philip</hi> another: The things of the King are those, which he as
king possesseth; the things of <hi>Antonine,</hi> those which he hath as <hi>Antonine,</hi> and those
verily he received from the people, the other from his Parents. This distinction is
frequent in the Civill Law, wherein the patrimonie of the Empire is said to be one
thing, of <hi>Caesar</hi> another, the Exchequer of <hi>Caesar</hi> one thing, the Treasury of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike
another, the Treasurer of <hi>Caesar</hi> one person, of the Emperiall Exchequer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Courts of sacred donations, others from those of private things; so that he
who as Emperour is preferred before a private man in a pledge, may sometimes be
placed after him as <hi>Antonine.</hi> Likewise in the <hi>German</hi> Empire, things of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian
of <hi>Austria</hi> are one kinde of things, of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour another;
the Treasurers of the Empire others, and of himself other from them; Likewise by
another Law, the hereditaty possession of Princes are different, from those which are
annexed to the dignities of the Electorship. Yea, even among the Turks the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
Grounds or Gardens of <hi>Selymus</hi> are one thing, the fiscall Ground another;
and those verily are spent on the Princes Table, these onely in sustentation of the
Empire. Yet there are Kingdoms, as the French, English, and the like, wherein Kings
have no private Patrimonie, but onely the Republike received from the people, in
which therefore this distinction is not used. Now as for the private goods of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if there be any, there is no doubt but they are the proprietors of them, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then private Citizens; and by the civill Law they may sell and divide them

For what? whether because one hath made thee a Shepheard for his Flocks sake,
hath he delivered it thee to fley, divide, doe with it, and strike it at thy pleasure?
whether because the people have constituted thee a Captain or Judge of some Citie
or County, have they given thee power of alienating, selling destroying that Citie or
County? And surely there is made an alienation of the people together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Countie, have they therefore given thee authority of severing, prostituting,
enslaving them to whom thou wilt? Furthermore, is the Royall dignitie a possession,
or rather a function? If a function, what community hath it with a propriety? If
a possession, whether not at least such an one, that the same people by whom it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
may perpetually retain the propriety to it self? Finally, if the patrimonie of
the Eschequer, or demaines of the Republike, be truely called a Dower, and truely
such a Dower, by whose alienation or delapidation both the Republike it self and
Kingdom, and king himself finally perisheth; by what law at last, shall it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to alienate this Dower? Therefore let <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> the Emperour be infatuated,
let <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth king of <hi>France</hi> be distracted, and give or sell the kingdom or a
part thereof to the English; let <hi>Malchom</hi> king of <hi>Scotland</hi> prodigally spend the
Crown land, and royall Treasure, what will follow? Those who have chosen a
king against the invasions of Forraigners, by the folly or madnesse of the king shall
be made the servants of Forraigners; those who by this means would severally desire
to secure their Estates, shall all of them together be exposed to a prey; those things
which every one shall take from himself or from his pupils, as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he
might endow the Commonwealth, some Bawd shall riotously consume. But if, as we
have already often said, kings be created for the peoples use, what use at all shall
there be, if not onely the use, but even the abuse be granted? To whose good are so
many evils? to whose benefit so many losses, so many perils? If, I say, whiles I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to look after my liberty or safetie, I make my selfe a slave, I expose my selfe to
the lust of one man, I put my self into Fetters and Stocks? Therefore we see this Law,
as it is infused by nature, so likewise it is approved by use almost among all Nations,
that it is not lawfull for the king to diminish the Commonwealth at his pleasure;
and he who doth contrary, is censured to play not the king, but Tyrant. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where kings were created, there was a necessity to give them some Revenues, by
which they might both support their Royall State, but most principally sustain the
Royall burthens, for so both honesty and profit seemed to require. It pertained to the
Royall Office to see Judges placed every where, who should not take gifts, and who
should not prostitute the Law to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ale; Moreover, to provide a force ready at hand
which should assist the Law when ever there should be need; to preserve the wayes
safe, Commerce safe, &amp;c. but if warre were feared; to fortifie Cities with a Garrison,
to inviron them with a Trench against enemies, to maintain an Army, to furnish
Armories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now this is a know proverb, that peace cannot consist without warre,
nor war without souldiers, nor souldiers without wages, nor wages without tribute:
Therefore to sustaine the burthens of Peace, the demesne was instituted, (which among the Lawyers is called Canon) to defray the charges of warre, tribute; yet so,
as if some more heavy charge should accrue, an extraordinary ayde given by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should supply; the end of all which verily, is the good of the Commonwealth,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29602:278"/>
so as he that converts it to his private use,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> is plainly unworthy the name of a king.
For a Prince, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> is the Minister of God for the peoples good, and Tributes
and Customes are paid to him, that he may continually attend thereto; And truely
heretofore almost all Customs of the <hi>Romanes</hi> seem to have had this Originall, that

                     <hi>Pedatica, Navigia, Portoria,</hi> and the

out of the Constitution of Lewes the godly; twelve over Seyne; that Ships
should be ready at hand to transport men over Rivers, &amp;c. There were no Tributes of
Saltpits, yea, most of them were in the Dominion of private men; because what
things nature did voluntarily give, they thought ought no more to be sold, then
Light, Ayre, water. And whereas a certain King named <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> had begun to
impose a Tax on Salt pits, as if nature would not suffer her liberality to be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are said to have been presently dried up; although at this day,

He who first instituted this custome at <hi>Rome,</hi> was <hi>Livius Censor,</hi> whence he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the surname of <hi>Salinator,</hi> which he did for the most present necessity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
For that very cause truly, King <hi>Philip</hi> obtained it onely for five

Finally, that tributes were instituted to pay Souldiers wages in warres, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
even from this, that to make a Province stipendary or tributary, is the selfe-same
thing indeed.<note place="margin">2 King. 9. &amp; 12. Postellus l, 3. de Rep. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a publike Armory, which because they were finished, the people under <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
desired to be eased thereof: Yea, the Turkes themselves call the Tribute of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>The sacred blood of the People,</hi> which profusely to spend, or to convert to any
other use, but to defend the people, is a cursed act. Therefore what things soever a
King acquires in warres in every Nation, because he gaines it by the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e acquires it to the people, not to himselfe, as a factor doth to his Master:
Moreover if perchance he gaine any thing by marriage (which I say, is pure and
simply his wives) he is thought to acquire it to the Kingdome, because he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to marry that wife, not as he is <hi>Philip</hi> or <hi>Charles,</hi> but as he is King. On the
contrary, as Queenes have part of those things which their husbands not yet co-opted
into the Kingdome have gained during the marriage; so plainly they have
no part of those things they get after they have obtained the Kingdome, because they
are reputed gained to the publike Treasures, not to the private meanes of the King,
which was judged in the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> between <hi>Philip Valoyes</hi> and <hi>Ioan</hi> of
<hi>Burgundy</hi> his wife. Now, lest the monies should be extorted to some other use, the
Emperour sweares, that he will impose no customes, nor enjoyne no taxes, but by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29602:279"/>
the Authority of a publike Assembly. The Kings of <hi>Poland, Hungary, Denmarke,
England</hi> doe the like out of the Lawes of <hi>Edward</hi> the first. The French <hi>Kings</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
demanded Tributes in the Assemblies of the three Estates; Hence also is that
Law of <hi>Philip Valoyes; That impositions should not be imposed but upon great and
urgent necessity, and that by the consent of the Three Estates:</hi> Moreover in times
past those taxes were laid up in Castles throughout every Diocesse, and delivered to
selected men (they even now call them Elected) to be kept, by whose hand the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
enrolled in every Town, should receive their wages, which was also usually
done in other Countries, as in the Belgick; At this day at least, whatsoever things
are commanded, are not confirmed, unlesse the Parliament consent. Now there are
some Provinces, which are not bound by covenant, but by the consent of the Estates,
as <hi>Languedoc, Britain, Province, Dolphenie,</hi> and some others; and in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
clearly all. Finally, lest the Eschequer, swelling like the spleen, whereby all
the other Members do pine away, should draw all things to it self, every where
a due proportion is allotted to the Eschequer. Since therefore at last it appeares,
that the tributes, customes, demesall, that which they call demesnes, (under which
names Portages, Imposts, Exposts, Royalties, wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are comprehended) which are ordinarily or extraordinarily given to Kings, were
conferred on them for the benefit of the people, and supportation of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and so verily; that if these nerves should be cut in sunder the people would fall
to decay, these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oundation being under-mined, the Kingdome must needs fall to the
ground; it truely followes, that he who to the prejudice of the people burthens the
people, who reaps a gain out of the publike losse, and so cuts their throat with their
own sword, is not a King, but a Tyrant: contrarily, that a true King, as he is a
survey or of the publike affaires, so likewise an Administrator of the publike riches,
but not a proprietary Lord, who can no more alienate or dissipate the Royall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesnes,
then the kingdome it selfe; but if he shall demene himselfe otherwise; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
as it is behoovefull to the Republike, that every one should use his own proper
goods well, much more is it beneficiall for the Commonweal, that every one should
use the publike estate well. And therefore if a Lord who prodigally spends his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
is by publike authority deduced to the Wardship of his kinsmen, and Family
and compelled to abstaine from his possessions; then truly much more justly, the
Gardian of the Republike, who converts the publike Administration of all wealth
into the publike destruction, or utterly subverts it, may justly be spoiled, by those
whom it concernes, and to whom it belongeth out of Office, unlesse he desists up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
admonition. Now that a King in all lawfull Empires is not a proprietary Lord
of the Royall patrimony, is easie to be manifested. That we may not have recourse
to those most ancient ages, whose Image we have in the person of <hi>Ephron</hi> king of the
Hittites,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> who durst not verily fell his field to <hi>Abraham,</hi> without the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
that very law is at this day used in all Empires. The Emperour of Germany
before he is Crowned,<note place="margin">Sleiden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l. 1. &amp; Bulla aurea.</note> sacredly swears, <hi>That he will alienate, distract, or morgage
nothing of those things which appert un to the Empire,</hi> and the patrimony of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
but if he recovers or acquires any thing by the publike Forces, that it shall
come to the Empire, not to himself. Therefore when <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, that <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslaus</hi>
his sonne might be designed Emperor, had promised an 100000 Crowns to
every one of the Electors, and because he had no ready monies, had obliged to them

the Auditors of the Accounts. Hence the ordinary Annotations of the Chamber
under prodigall kings; This Donation is too great, and therefore let it be revoked.
Now this Chamber solemnly swears, that whatsoever rescript they shall at any time
receive from the king, that they will admit nothing which may be hurtfull to the
kingdom and Commonweale. Finally, the Law cares not how a Fructuary useth and
enjoyeth his profits; contrarily, the Law prescribes the king in what manner, and
unto what use he ought to put them. Therefore the ancient kings of <hi>France</hi> were
bound to divide the Rents into four parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one part was spent in sustaining the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Church, and the poor, another upon the kings Table, the third on the
Wages of his houshold servants, the last in the repaire of royall Castles, Bridges,
Houses;<note place="margin">Monstretus in Carolo 6.</note> the residue, if there were any, was laid up in the Treasury. Verily what stirs
there were about the year 1412 in the Assembly of the three Estates at <hi>Paris,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29602:280"/>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt had converted all things into his and his Officers lusts, and
that the Domestick accounts, which before had not exceeded 94 thousand French
Crowns in such a miserable estate of the republike, had increased to the sum of five
hundred and forty thousand Crowns, is sufficiently evident out of Histories: Now as
the rents of the Crown were thus lessened, so also the oblations and subsidies were
spent upon the Warre, as the taxes and tallages were onely destinated to the sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
of Souldiers. In other Realms the King verily hath not any more Authority,
yea, in most he hath lesse, as in the Germane and Polish Empire: But we would
therefore prove this to be so in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> lest by how much any man dares
to doe more injury,<note place="margin">Ex Concil. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. in c. de his quae sinit. a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis absque cons<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>capit.</note> by so much also he might be thought to have more right. In
summe, what we have said before, the name of a King sounds not an inheritance, not
a propriety, not a perception of profits, but a function, a procuration. As a Bishop
is instituted for the cure and salvation of the soul, so the King of the body, in those
things which pertain to the publike goods; as he is the dispenser of sacred goods, so
the King of prophane, and what power he hath in his Episcopall, the same, and no
greater hath the King in his dominicall Lands; the alienation of the Episcopall
Lands without the consent of the Chapter, is of no validitie, so neither of the Crown
Land without a publike Parliament or Senate of the Estates; Of sacred revenews
one part is designed to aedifices, another to the poor, a third to Companions, a fourth
to the Bishop himself; the same verily almost we see the King ought to do in dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the revenewes of the Kingdom. It hinders not, that the contrary every where is
at this day usurped: For the duty of Bishops is not any way changed, because many
Bishops sell those things from the poor, which they spend upon Bawds, or wast all
their Mannors and Woods; nor yet that some Emperours have attributed all kinde
of power to themselves, for neither can any one be judge in his own Cause. But if any

that Kings are not subverters, but Moderators of the Republike, that they cannot
change the right of the Commonwealth by their pactions; that they are Lords
onely when they take care of their <hi>Pupils,</hi> that they are to be accounted no other
then Guardians; and that he is not to be esteemed a Lord, who spoils the City
with liberty, and selleth it like a slave. Not finally, that certain Kingdoms are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Kings themselves, for they acquired not Kingdoms by their owne, but by
publike hands, forces, treasures; now nothing is more consonant to reason, then that
those things which are gotten by the publike riches, and common dangers of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
should not be alienated without common consent, which holds place even
amongst Theeves themselves; he destroyeth humane society, who doth the contrary:
Therefore though the French have by force seized on the German Empire, and they
also on the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> yet the same law holds in both. In sum, at last we ought
to determine, that Kings are not Proprietors, nor Fructuaries, but onely Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratours;

propriety and profits of every mans private Estate, or of the publike wealth which

to 167. with whose words I shall fortifie and irradiate this position: <q>We have
said, that in constituting a King a double Covenant is entred into; the first between
God, the King and people, of which before; the second, between the king and the people, of which we are now to treat. <hi>Saul</hi> being ordained king, the royall law was
delivered to him, according to which he should rule.<note place="margin">Deut 17. l Sa. 10. 25. 2 Sam. 5. 3. 1 Chron. 11. 3. 2 King. 11. 17. &amp; 12.</note>

Israel, who represented all the people, and then at last he was annointed king. <hi>Ioas</hi>
also made a Covenant with all the people of the land in the house of the Lord, <hi>Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
the high Priest going before them in words: Yea, the testimony is said to be
imposed on him together with the Crown; which most interpret the Law of God,
which every where is called by that name. Likewise <hi>Iosiah</hi> promised, that he would
observe the Precepts, Testimonies and Statutes comprized in the book of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;

we may understand, which is likewise severally expressed, not onely the Princes of
the Tribes, but likewise all the Chiliarkes, Centurions, and inferior Magistrates were
present, in the Name of the Cities, which every one a part by themselves made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with the king. In that Covenant they consulted of creating the king, for the
people did make the king, not the king the people. Therefore there is no doubt, but
the people made the Covenant, and the King promised to perform it. Now the part
of him that makes the Covenant is reputed the better Law: The people demanded
of the King, whether he would not rule justly and according to the Lawes? Hee
promised that he would doe so: wherupon the people answered, That hee reigning
justly, they would faithfully obey him. Therefore the King promised obsolutely;
the people, but upon condition; which if it were not fulfilled, the people by the
Law it selfe should bee reputed absolved from all obligation. In the first covenant
or Pact, Pietie comes into the obligation, in the second, Iustice: In that, the king pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth,
that he will seriously obey God; in this, that he will justly rule the people:
in that, that he will take care of the glory of God; in this, of the benefit of the people;
in that there is this condition, <hi>If thou shalt observe my Law;</hi> in this, If thou shalt render
Iustice to every one: Of that, if it be not fulfilled, God properly is the avenger; of
this, lawfully all the people, or the Peers of the Realm, who have taken upon them
to defend all the people. Now in all just Empires, this hath been perpetually observed.

all kinds of power to themselves; yet the*<note place="margin">See Eccardus de Lege Regia &amp; Marius Salamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius de Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patu l. 6. <hi>where this Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</hi>
                     </note> fragments of that Law, which are extant
as well in Books as in Roman inscriptions, sufficiently reach; that a power was
granted them, of caring for and administring, not of subverting the Common-weal
and oppressing it by tyranny. Moreover, even good Emperours professed, that they
were bound by the Lawes, and acknowledged their Empire received from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and referred all the weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iest affaires to the Senate, and they judged it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to determine any thing of great publike concernment without their aduice.
But if wee behold the present Empires, there is not one of them which may be
thought worthy of that name, wherein there is not some such Covenant interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
between the Prince and Subiects. In the <hi>German</hi> Empire, not long since,
the King of Romanes being to be crowned Emperour, was wont <hi>To make Fealty
and Homage to the Empire, no otherwise then a vassall (or tenant) to his Lord,</hi>
when he received investiture of his Lands. And although the conceived words, to
which he sware, be a little changed by Popes, yet the same thing remains perpetually.
Therefore we know that <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. of <hi>Austria</hi> was created Emperour upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lawes and conditions,<note place="margin">Speculum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon, l. 1. art. 54. See Descript. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronations Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximiliani lmper An. 1486. in Rerum Germ. scrip. Tom. 3 p. 31.</note> as likewise others, who have succeeded him; of which
the summe was; <hi>That he would keep the Lawes enacted; That he would make no
new Lawes, without the Electors consents; that he would determine publike affaires
in a publike Counsell; that he would altenate or pervert none of these things which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the Empire;</hi> with other things which are severally recited by Historia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers:
And when as the Emperour is crowned at <hi>Achen,</hi> the Archbishop of
<hi>Colen</hi> first demands of him; <hi>Whether he will not defend the Church, administer ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
preserve the Empire, protect Widowes, Orphans, and all worthy of pitty?</hi> which
when he hath solemnly sworn to perform before the Altar, the Princes and those
who represent the Empire, are demanded, <hi>whether they will promise to fealty
him?</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet is he first annointed, or receives a sword, (of purpose to defend the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
or other Ensignes of the Empire, before that he shall have taken that Oath.
From whence verily it is manifest, that the Emperour is purely obliged, the Princes
of the Empire upon condition onely. No man will doubt but that the same is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

promised to perform. In the <hi>Hungarian, Bohemian,</hi> and other kingdomes, which

whether if not these Rights, not these Solemnities, not these Sacraments or Oathes
should intervene, doth not nature it selfe sufficiently teach, that Kings are constituted
by the people, upon this condition, that they should reign well? Iudges, that they
shall pronounce Law? Captaines of warre, that they should lead an Army against

thou shalt say, that some people subdued by force, the Prince hath compelled to swear
to his commands? What, say I, if a Thiefe, a Pyrate, a Tyrant, with whom no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Law or Right is thought to be, should with a drawn sword violently extort
a deed from any one? Is it not known, that fealty extorted by force bindeth not,
especially if any thing be promised against good manners, against the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Now what is more repugnant to nature, then that a people should lay chaines
and fetters upon themselves, then that they should lay their own throats to the
sword? then that they should lay violent hands upon themselves? (or which is verily
the same thing) promise it to the Prince? Therefore there is a mutuall obligation
between the King and people, which whether it be only civill or naturall, tacit, or
in expresse words, can be taken away by no agreements, violated by no Law, rescin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by no force: Whose force only is so great, that the Prince who shall contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29602:284"/>
break it, may be truly called a Tyrant, the people who shall willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe,
it seditious: So this grand accute Lawyer determines. I shall close up this with
the unanimous resolutions and notable decree of the United <hi>Netherland Provinces.
Anno Dom.</hi> 1581. declaring <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be fallen from the Seigniorie of
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> for his Tyranny and breach of Oath, which is thus recited by
<hi>Grimstone,</hi> and recorded in his generall History of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> page 658, to 667.</p>
                  <p>In the alterations which happen sometimes in an Estate betwixt the Soveraigne
Prince and a people that is free and priviledged, there are ordinarily two points,
which make them to ayme at two divers ends: The one is, when as the Prince seeks
to have a full subjection and obedience of the people, and the people contrariwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
that the Prince should maintaine them in their freedomes and liberties, which
he hath promised and sworne solemnly unto them, before his reception to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie.
Thereupon quarrels grow: the Prince will hold a hard hand, and will
seek by force to bee obeyed; and the subjects rising against the Prince, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with dangerous tumults, rejecting his authority, seek to embrace their full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>In these first motions there happen sometimes conferences, at the instance of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who may have interest therin, to quench this fire of division betwixt the Prince
and his subjects. And then if any one of the parties groweth obstinate, and will not
yeeld, although he seeme to be most in fault, it followeth of necessity, that they must
come to more violent remedies, that is to say to armes. The power of the Prince is
great, when hee is supported by other Princes, which joyn with him for the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the example, else it is but small: but that of the people (which is the body,
whereof the Prince is the head) stirred up by conscience (especially if the question
of Religion be touched) the members ordained for their function, doing joyntly their
duties, is farre greater. Thereupon they wound they kill, they burne, they ruine,
and grow desperately mad: but what is the event? God (who is an enemy to all
tyranny and disobedience) judgeth quarrels, weigheth them in his ballance of justice,
helping the rightfull cause, and either causeth the Prince for his rigour and tyranny
to be chased away, and deprived of his estate and principality; or the people for their
contempt and rebellion are punished and reduced unto reason; which causeth the
alterations to cease, and procureth apeace: whereof we could produce many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
both antient and moderne, if the relation of this history did not furnish us
sufficiently.</p>
                  <p>So the generall Estates of the united Provinces,<note place="margin">See Meteranus Belg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any sort (through his wilfulnesse) yeeld unto their humble suite and petitions; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the offers they could make to purchase a good, firme, and an assured,
peace, (notwithstanding all the intercessions both of the Emperour, the French King,
the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and other great Princes and Potentates of Christendom) yet
would he not give eare to any other reason, but what himselfe did propound: the
which the said Estates did not only find unjust and unreasonable, directly repugnant
to their liberties, constitutions, and freedomes of the Countrey; but also contrary to
their consciences, and as it were so many snares layed to catch them, which were in
no sort to be allowed of, nor received, considering the qualitie of their affair and his,
according to the time. In the end, rejecting all feare of his power and threats, seeing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29602:284"/>
they were forced to enter into all courses of extremity against a Prince, which held
himselfe so hainously offended, as no reconciliation could be expected, relying upon
the justice and equitie of their cause, and sinceritie of their consciences (which are two
brazen bulwarks) they were fully resolved (without dissembling) to take the matter
thus advanced in hand, and opposing force against force, meanes against meanes, and
practises against practises, to declare him quite fallen from the Seigniorie, prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,

right, freedomes, and immunities, so often and so solemnly sworne by him,
and dispensation of his Oaths, he had or was wont to have in the said Provinces res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively.
Whereof they made open declaration by a publick Edict, the tenour

but rather the Prince is ordained for his subjects (without the which he cannot be a
Prince) to governe them according unto equity and reason,<note place="margin">See <hi>Meteranus</hi> and others.</note> to take care for them,
and to love them even as a father doth his children, or a shepheard his sheep, who
putteth both his body and life in danger, to defend and preserve them. If the Prince
therefore faileth herein, and in stead of preserving his subjects, doth outrage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
them, depriveth them of their priviledges and ancient customes, commandeth
them, and will be served of them as of slaves, they are no longer bound to respect him as
their Soveragn Prince and Lord, but to esteem of him as a Tyrant; neither are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(according unto Law and Reason) bound to acknowledge him for their Prince;<note place="margin">Note.</note>
so as without any offence, being done with deliberation and the authority of the
Estates of the Countrey, they may freely abandon him, and in his place chuse another
for their Prince and Lord, to defend them: especially, when as the subjects by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
suit, intreatie, and admonitions, could never mollifie their Princes heart, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from his enterprises an tyrannous designes: so as they have no other meanes
left them to preserve their antient libertie, their wives, children and posterity, for the
which (according to the lawes of nature) they are bound to expose both life and
goods; as for the like occasions, we have seene it to fall out often in divers Countries,
whereof the examples are yet fresh in memory. The which ought especially to bee
of force in these Countries, the which have alwayes been and ought to be governed,
according, unto the oath taken by their Princes, when they receive them, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their priviledges and antient customes, having no power to infringe them:
besides that, most part of the said Provinces have alwayes received and admitted their
Princes and Lords upon certaine conditions, and by sworn contracts; the which if
the Prince shall violate, hee is by right fallen from the rule and superiority of the
Countrey. So it is, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (after the decease of the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, his father of famous memory, from whom all these Countries were
transported unto him) forgetting the services, which as well his father as himselfe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29602:285"/>
had received of these Countries, and the inhabitants thereof, by the which especially
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had obtained such glorious and memorable victories against his
enemies, as his name and power was renowned and feared throughout all the world;
forgetting also the admonitions which his said Imperiall Majesty had heretofore
given him: and contrariwise, hath given eare, beliefe, and credit unto them of the
Councell of Spain which were about him; the said Councell having conceived a
secret hatrrd against these Countries and their Liberties (for that it was not lawfull
for them to command there, and to govern them, or to merit among them the
chiefe places and offices, as they doe in the Realm of Naples, Sicilie, Millaine, at the
Indies, and in other Countries which are subject to the Kings command, being also
moved thereunto by the riches of the said Countries, well knowne to the most of
them:) the said councell, or some of the chiefe of them, have oftentimes given the
King to understand, That for his Maiesties reputation and greater authority, it were
better to conquer the Netherlands anew, and then to command absolutely at his
pleasure, than to govern them under such conditions, which he at his reception to the
Seigni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry of the said Countries had sworn to observe. The King of Spain follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this counsell, hath sought all meanes to reduce these countries (spoiling them of
their ancient Liberties) into servitude, under the government of Spaniards: having
under pretext of Religion sought first to thrust in new Bishops into the chiefe and
greatest Townes, indowing them with the richest Abbeyes, adding to every Bishop
nine Chanons to serve him as Councellors, wherof three should have a special charge
of the Inquisition. By which incorporation of the said Bishops, being his creatures,
and at his devotion (the which should happily have been chosen as well of strangers,
as of them which were born in the Country) they should have the first place and the
first voyce in the assemblies of the Estates of the Country. And by the adiunction of
the said Chanons, had brought in the Inquisition of Spain, the which had also bin so
abhorred, and so odious in these Countries, even as slavery it selfe, as all the world
doth well know: So as his Imperiall Maiesty having once propounded it unto these
Countries, upon due information given unto His Maiesty, ceased from any more
speech thereof, shewing therein the great affection which he bare unto His Subiects.
Yet notwithstanding divers Declarations which were made unto the King of Spain,
as well by the Provinces and Townes in particular, as by some other of the chiefe
Noblemen of the Country, namely, by the Baron of Montigny, and afterwards by
the Earle of Egmont, who by the consent of the Dutchesse of Parma (then Regent of
the said Countries) by the advice of the Councell of Estate, and of the Generalty,
had to that end been successively sent into Spain: And notwithstanding that the king
had by his own mouth given them hope, that (according to their petitions) hee
would provide for the contentment of the Country; yet that he had since by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
done the contrary, commanding expresly, and upon pain of his indignation, to
receive the new Bishops presently, and to put them in possession of their new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
and incorporated Abbeyes, to effect the Inquisition, where they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to practise it, and to observe the Decrees and Canons of the Councell of Trent,
the which in divers points doe contradict the priviledges of the Countrey. The
which being come to the knowledge of the Commons, hath given just occasion of
so great an alteration among them, and greatly diminished the love and affection,
the which (as good subjects) they had alwayes borne unto the King, and to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29602:285"/>
For they called chiefly into consideration, that the King not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to tyrannize over their persons and goods, but also upon their consciences,
whereon they held themselves not to be answerable, not bound to give account to
any one but to God only. For this cause and for the pitty they had of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the chiefe of the Nobility did in the yeare 1566. exhibit certain admonitions by
way of a Petition, beseeching him, that for the pacifying of the Commons, and
to avoid all tumults and seditions, it would please his Majesty, (shewing the love
and affection, which as a mild and mercifull Prince he bare unto his Subjects) to
moderate the said points, and especially those which concerned the rigorous Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and punishment for matters of Religion. And to informe the King more
particularly thereof, and with more authority, and to let him understand, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it was for the good and prosperity of the Countrey, and for the maintenance
of peace and tranquility, to abolish and disannull those innovations, and to moderate
the rigour of publike Edicts, for matter of Religion; the said Marquesse of Berges
and Baron of Montigny, at the request of the said Lady Regent, the Councell of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and the Generall Estates of all the Countries, went into Spain as Embassadors:
whereas the King, instead of giving them audience, and to prevent the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
delivered by them, (the which, for that they were not redressed in time, as
urgent necessity required, began in effect to discover themselves throughout the
whole Countrey) by the perswasion and advice of the Councell of Spain, hee hath
caused all them to be proclaimed Rebels, and guilty of high Treason, and to have
forfeited body and goods, that presented the said Petition. And moreover (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe to be fully assured of the Countrey, by the Forces of the Duke of Alva,
and to have reduced them under his full power and subiection) he had afterwards,
against the Lawes of Nations, (the which have been in all ages inviolably observed,
yea among the most barbarous and cruell Nations, and most tyrannous Princes)
imprisoned, and caused the said Noblemen Embassadors to be put to death, confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all their goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And although that all this alteration (which had hapned in the
yeare 1566. upon the foresaid occasion) was in a manner pacified by the Regent and
her councell, and that the greatest part of them which had presented themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her for the Liberty of the Countrey, were retired, or chased away, and the rest
brought under obedience: yet not to lose the opportunity which the Councell of
Spain had long expected (as it appeared plainly the same yeere 1566. by Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted,
which were written by the Embassador Alana to the Duchesse of Parma)
to have meanes under some pretext to overthrow all the priviledges of the Country,
and to govern them tyrannously by the Spaniards (as they did the Indies and other
Countries which had been newly conquered by them) he by the advice and councell
of the said Spaniards (shewing therein the small affection which he bare unto his
Subiects of these countries, contrary unto that whereunto he was bound, as their
Prince, protector and good Shepheard) sent into these countries the Duke of Alva,
very famous for his rigour and cruelty, and one of the chiefe enemies of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
with a councell of the same Humour and disposition. And although that the
said Duke of Alva entred with his Army into this countrey, without any let
or opposition, and was received of the poore Inhabitants with all reverence and
Honour, expecting all mildnesse and clemencie, according unto that which the King
had so often promised by His Letters fainedly written; yea, that He was resolved to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29602:286"/>
come himselfe in person into the Countrey, and to order all things to every mans
content; the said King having besides all this (at the very instant of the Duke of Alva
his departure) caused a fleet of ships to be armed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to bring him hither,
and another in Zeeland to goe and meet him (as the bruite was) to the great charge
of the Countrey, the better to abuse his poore subjects, and to draw them more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
into his snares: notwithstanding, the said Duke of Alva presently after his
arrivall (although he were a stranger, and not any way of the blood Royall) gave
it out, that hee had a Commission from the King, of Governour Generall of
the Countrey, the which was quite contrary to the priviledges and antient
Customes thereof: and discovering his designes plainly, he suddenly put garrisons
into the chiefe Townes and Forts of the Countrey, and then he built Citadels in the
richest and strongest Townes, to keep them in subjection. And by commandement
from the King (as they said) he friendly called unto him, as well by letters, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the chiefe Noblemen of the Countrey, pretending, that he had need of their
councell and assistance, for the service of the King, and the good of the Countrey:
who (having given credit to his letters) were come unto him, whom, contrary to the
priviledges, hee caused to bee carried prisoners out of Brabant, where they had been
apprehended, causing their processe to bee informed before him and his Councell
(although they were no competent Iudges;) and before any due proofes were made,
and the Noblemen that were accused, fully heard in their defences, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to have committed Rebellion, causing them to be publikely and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
put to death. Others, who for that they were better acquainted with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
dissembling, were retired and kept out of the Countrey, were declared Rebels,
and guilty of high treason, and to have forfeited bodies and goods: All which was
done, to the end the poor inhabitants should not aide themselves in the just defence of
their liberty, against the oppression of the Spaniards and their forces, by the help and
assistance of these Noblemen, &amp; Princes. Besides, an infinite number of Gentlemen &amp;
rich bourgers, whereof some he hath put to death, others he hath chased away &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
their goods, oppressing the rest of the good inhabitants, as well by the insolence
of the souldiers, as by other outrages in their wives, children, and goods; as also by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers exactions
and taxes, forcing them to contribute for the building of new Citadels
and fortifications of towns, which he made to oppresse them, &amp; also to pay the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
and the twintieth peny, for the payment of souldiers, wherof some were brought
by him, and others newly levied, to employ them against their Countreymen, and
themselves, who with the hazard of their lives sought to defend the liberties of their
Countrey: to the end that the subjects being thus impoverished, there should be no
meanes to frustrate his designes, for the better effecting of the instructions which had
been given him in <hi>Spain:</hi> which was, to use the Countrey as newly conquered. To
which end, in some places and chiefe Townes, he changed their forme of government,
and of justice, and erected new Consuls after the Spanish manner, directly contrary
to the priviledges of the Countrey. And in the end (thinking himselfe free from all
feare) he sought to bring in by force a certaine imposition of the tenth peny, upon all
marchandise and handi-works, to the absolute ruine of the Commons, whose
good and prosperity consists chiefly in traffique and handi-works; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
many admonitions and perswasions made to the contrary, as well by every
one of the Provinces in particular, as by all in generall. The which he had effected
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29602:286"/>
by force, if it had not beene that soon after by the means of the Prince of Orange,
(and a good number of Gentlemen, and others borne in these Countries) banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Duke of Alva, following the party of the said Prince, and being for the
most part in his service, and other inhabitants affected to the libertie of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
the Provinces of Holland and Zeeland had not revolted, and put themselves
under the Princes protection. Against which two Provinces the Duke hath since
during his Government, and after him the great Commander of Castile (sent in his
place by the King, not to moderate any thing of his Predecessors Tyrannie, but to
pursue it more covertly and cunningly than he had done) forced those said Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who by their Garrisons and Citadels, were made subject to the Spanish Yoke,
to imploy their persons and meanes to helpe to subdue them: yet no wayes easing
the said Provinces, but intreating them like enemies, suffering the Spanyards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of a mutinie, in view of the said Commander, to enter by force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town of Antuerpe, and there to continue six weeks, living at discretion at the
poore Bourgers charge; forcing them moreover (to be freed from their insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
to furnish foure hundred thousand florins, to pay the said Spanyards: which
done, the said Souldiers (growing more bold through the sufferance of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders)
presumed to take Armes against the Countrey, seeking first to surprize
Brussels, and in the place of the ancient and ordinary seate of Princes, to make
it a nest and den of theeves. The which not succeeding according to their designe,
they tooke Alost by force, and soone after forced the Towne of Maestricht. And
since being violently entred into Antuerpe, they spoyled it, sacked it, and wasted
it with fire and fword, in such sort, as the most barbarous and cruell enemies could
not have done more, to the unspeakable losse, not onely of the poore inhabitants,
but in a manner of all the Nations of the world, who had their Merchandise, debts,
and money there. And although the said Spanyards by a Decree of the Councell
of Estate (to whom the King by the death of the great Commander, had conferred
the generall Government of the Countrey) were in the presence of <hi>Ieronimo de
Rhoda,</hi> proclaimed enemies to the Countrey: yet the said <hi>Rhoda</hi> of his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
authority (or as it is to bee presumed, by vertue of some secret instruction
which he had from Spaine) took upon him to be the head of the said Spanyards, and
their adherents, so as without respect of the Councell of Estate, he usurped the kings
Name and Authority, counterfeited his Seale, and carried himself as a Governour,
and the Kings Lieutenant in these Countries. The which moved the Estates at the
same instant to agree with the Prince of Orange, and the Estates of Holland and Zee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
which accord was allowed by the Councell of State (as lawfull Governours)
that they might joyntly with their common forces, make warre against the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:
Omitting not as good subjects, by divers humble petitions, to beseech the
King to have regard unto the troubles, oppressions and insolencies which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and were like to follow: and that hee would bee pleased with all convenient
speed possible, to command the Spanyards to depart out of the Countrey, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those which had been the cause of the sack and ruine of the chiefe Towns of his
Countrey, and other innumerable insolences and violences which his poore subjects
had endured, to the comfort and ease of them which had endured them, and to the
example of all others: yet notwithstanding; the King (although that he made shew
by words, that what had hapned, displeased him, and was against his will, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:29602:287"/>
that he had an intent to punish the heads and authors, and to provide for the quiet
of the Countrey with all clemency, as it behoved a mercifull Prince) hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected to punish the said Heads and Authors: but contrariwise, (as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
all was with his consent and former resolution of the councell of Spain, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
letters of his, intercepted soon after, do plainly shew: by the which it was
written unto <hi>Rhoda,</hi> and to the other Captains, authors of all the mischiefe, That
the King did not blame that action, but did allow thereof, and commend it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to recompence them, especially the said <hi>Rhoda,</hi> as having done him a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
service: The which, at his return into Spaine, and to all other ministers of the
oppressions that were used in these Countries, he did shew by effect. At the same
time, the King thinking the better to blinde the eyes of his subjects, sent into these
Countries for Governour Generall, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of Austria, his base brother, as
being of his blood: who (making shew unto the Estates, that he did allow of the
Pacification of Gant, promised to send away the Spanyards, to punish the authors
of all insolencies and disorders which had hapned in the Countrey, and to take an
order for the generall peace, and the restoring of their ancient liberties) sought to
divide the Estates, and to subdue one Countrey after another. By the permission
and providence of God, who is an enemy to all oppression, he was discovered by
the intercepting of certain letters, where he was commanded by the King to govern
himself in these Countries, according to the Instructions that should be given him
by <hi>Rhoda:</hi> and to cover this practice, the King had forbidden <hi>Don Iohn</hi> to speake
with him, commanding him to carry himselfe unto the chiefe Noblemen with all
mildenesse and courtesie, to winne their loves, untill that by their assistance and
meanes, he might reduce Holland and Zeeland, and afterwards work his will of the
other Provinces. Whereupon <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> notwithstanding that he had solmnly sworn
in the presence of all the Estates of the Countrey, to observe the said Pacification of
Gant, yet contrary thereunto he sought by meanes of their Colonels (whom he had
already at his devotion) and great promises, to winne the Germane souldiers who
were then in Garrison, and had the guard of the chiefe Townes and Forts of the
Countrey, whereof by that meanes he made himselfe master, holding himselfe assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of those places they held, and so by that meanes to force them that would not
joyne with him, to make warre against the Prince of Orange, and them of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and Zeeland, and so to raise a more boody and intestine warre, then had been
before. But as all things that are treated cunningly and with dissimulation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be long kept secret, <hi>Don Iohns</hi> practises being discovered, before hee could effect
what he had designed, hee could not bring his conceptions and enterprises to the
end that he pretended: Yet he revived a new warre, the which continues unto this
day, in stead of rest and an assured peace, whereof hee did so much vaunt at his
coming. Which reasons have given us great occasion to forsake the King of Spain,
and to seeke some other mighty and mercifull Prince, to helpe to defend these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and to take them into his protection: and the rather for that these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have endured such oppressions, received such wrongs, and have been forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and abandoned by their Prince for the space of twenty years and more; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
the which the Inhabitants have beene intreated not as subjects, but as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
their naturall Prince and Lord seeking to ruine them by armes, Moreover,
after the death of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> having sent the Baron of Selles, who (und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r colour
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29602:287"/>
propounding some meanes of an accord) declared sufficiently, That the king
would not avow the Pacification made a Gant (which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
had sworne to maintaine) setting downe more hard conditions. Yet
for that we would discharge our selves of our duties, wee have not omitted to
make humble suite by writing, imploying moreover the favour of the greatest
Princes of Christendome, seeking by all meanes without intermission, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
our selves unto the King; having also of late kept our deputies long at
Cologne, hoping there (by the intercession of his imperiall Majestie, and some
Princes Electors) to have obtained an assured peace, with some moderate tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Religion (the which doth chiefly concerne God and mens consciences)
as the estate of the affairs of the Countrey did then require: But in the end we
found it by experience, that nothing was to be obtained from the King, by the
Conference at Cologne: and that it was practised and did onely serve to disunite
and divide the Provinces, that they might with the more facility vanquish and
subdue first one, and then another, and execute upon them their first designes. The
which hath since plainly appeared, by a certain proscription, which the King hath
caused to be published, whereby we and all the Inhabitants of the united Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Officers that hold their partie, are proclaimed Rebels, and to have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lives and goods: Promising moreover, a great summe of money to him that
should murther the said Prince, and all to make the poore Inhabitants odious, to
hinder their Navigation and Traffique, and to bring them into extreme despaire. So
as despairing of all meanes of reconciliation, and destitute of all other succours and
ayde we have according to the Law of nature (for the defence of us and other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
the Rights, priviledges, ancient customes, and libertie of the Countrey,
and the lives and honours of us, our wives, children, and posterity, to the end
they fall not into the slavery of the Spanyards, leaving upon just cause the King of
Spaine) beene forced to seeke out some other meanes, such as for the greater safety
and preservation of our Rights, Priviledges, and liberties, we have thought most fit
and convenient.</p>
                  <p>We therefore give all men to understand, That having duely considered all these
things, and being prest by extreme necessitie, We have by a generall resolution and
consent, declared, and doe declare by these presents, the King of Spaine, <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
jure,</hi> to be fallen from the Seigniory, Principalitie, jurisdiction, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of these Countries: And that we are resolved, never to acknowledge him
any more, in any matter concerning the Prince, jurisdictions or demeanes of
these Netherlands, nor to use hereafter, neither yet to suffer any other to use his
Name as Soveraigne Lord thereof. According to the which we declare all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
private Noblemen, Vassels, and other inhabitants of these Countries, of
what condition or qualitie soever, to be from henceforth discharged of the Oath
which they have made in any manner whatsoever, unto the King of Spaine, as Lord
of these countries, or of that wherby they may be bound unto him. And for the above
named reasons, the most part of the said united Provinces, by a common accord and
consent of their Members, have submitted themselves under the command &amp; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the high and mighty Prince, the Duke of Aniou and Alanson, &amp;c. upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conditions contracted and accorded with his Highnesse: and that the Archduke
of Austria, <hi>Mathias,</hi> hath resigned into our hands the goverment generall of these
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29602:288"/>
Countries, the which hath been accepted by us. We enjoyn and command ali Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Officers, and all others, to whom it shall appertain, That hereafter they forbeare
to use any more, the name, titles, great seal, or signet of the K. of <hi>Spain:</hi> and instead
therof, whilst that the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> for his urgent affaires, concerning the good
and welfare of the Country, shall be yet absent, for as much as shall concern the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
which have contracted with his Highnesse, and touching the rest by way of
provision, they shall use the title and name of the chiefe and Counsell of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And untill that the said heads and Counsellors, shall be named, called, and really
established in the exercise of their charges, and offices, they shall use our name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Holland and Zeeland, where they shall use as they have formerly done, the name
of the Prince of Orange, and of the Estates of the said Provinces, untill that the said
Councell shall be in force, and then they shall govern themselves as it is agreed, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the instructions given for the said Counsell, and the accords made with his
Highnesse. And instead of the Kings seales, they shall hereafter use our Great Seale,
counter Seale, and Signet, in matters concerning the government generall, for the
which the Councell of the Country, according to their instructions shall have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And in matters concerning the policie, administration of Iustice, and other
private acts of every Province, the Provinciall Concels and others, shall respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
use the name and Seale of the said Province, where the matter shall be in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no other, upon pain of nullity of the said Letters, or Dispatches which shall
be other wise made or sealed. And to the end these things may bee the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and effected, we have enjoyned and commanded, and do enjoyn and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
by these presents, That all the King of Spaines Seales, which are at this present
within these united Provinces, shall be dilivered into the States hands, or to him
that shall have commission and authority from them, upon pain of arbitrary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Moreover, We ordain and command, that from henceforth the name and
armes of the King of Spain, shall not be put not stampt in any coynes of these united
Provinces: but there shall be such a figure set upon them, as shall be appointed for
the coyning of new peeces of Gold and Silver. In the like sort we enjoyn and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the president and Lords of the privie Councel, and all other Chancellors, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, Provinciall Counsuls, and all Presidents and chiefe Masters of accounts, and
others of all chambers of accounts, being respectively in these countries, and also all
other Iudges, and Officers (as holding them discharged of the oath which they have
made unto the King of Spain, according to the tenor of their Commissions) that they
shall take a new oath in the hands of the Estates of the Province where they are, or to
their Deputies, by the which they shall swear to be faithfull to us against the King of
Spain, and his adherents, according to the form set down by us: and there shall be
given to the said Councellors, Masters of accounts, Iudges and Officers, remaining
in the Provinces which have contracted with the Duke of Anjou, in our name, an
act of continuance in their Offices, containing in stead of a new commissions, a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or disannulling of their former, and that by way of provision, untill his comming.
And to Councellors, Masters of accounts, Iudges, and Officers, being resident in

                  <hi>The
reason is,</hi> Because no Kingdome or Nation under Heaven, ever elected or voluntarily
submitted themselves unto any Emperour or King whatsoever (for ought can be proved or
imagined) but upon this tacit condition; that they should justly governe, defend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them for their good, not tyrranize over, pillage, murther, oppresse, or make warre
upon them at their pleasures, contrary to the Lawes of God, nature, nations; Nor yet actually
obliged themselves under paine of Treason, Rebellion, death, or damnation, not forcilly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obsist
or deprive their Princes in any wise, though they with open violence should set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to subvert their Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and Republike; to which unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
condition, no Natian certainty would have consented, had it been propounded to
them by their Kings at first, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well observes. <hi>This point of greatest difficulty
and concerment, I have largely debated and confirmed already, in the third part of this
Discourse, where all contrary Objections against it, are refuted; Yet because it still
seemes a feditious unchristian Paradox to many Malignants and Royallists, I shall
satifie it with such new Authorities, of all sorts, which may happily convince, if not
convert them from their inveterate wilfull error.</hi>

staine by a Christian Souldier of his own Army, for his Tyranny and impiety.</hi>

things thus in his minde: That not only the Heathens, but likewise ALL OTHERS
are wont to applaud those even unto our Age, who slew Tyrants heretofore, as those
who for the liberty of all, feared not to undergoe the danger of death, and likewise
for the safety of their Citizens, Kindred and friends, with willing minds. And verily hee
CANNOT WELL BE REPREHENDED BY ANY MAN, especially
since hee should shew himselfe so valiane and stenuous FOR GOD AND that
RELIGION which hee did approve, &amp;c. However it is certaine that he was taken away

Positions for Law, Num. 125. to 139. <q>That all the Inferiour Magistrates in the
Empire or other Kingdoms, collectively considered, are above the Emperour and
Kings themselves; that if they be unjustly assaulted with unjust violence by any
whomsoever, they may by a necessary and just warre, defend both themselves and
theirs, and repell and prosecute the unjust assailants. That if the Superiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
neglect to do his duty, (as if the <hi>Turke</hi> should invade any Countrey, and the
Supreme Magistrate would not resist him,) the inferiour Magistrate may call the
people to Arms, raise an Army, and exercise all forces policie and devices against the
common enemy of Christians: Or if the Supreme Magistrate should exercise manifest
Tyrannie, it is verily lawfull to the Inferiour to undertake the care of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
which he endeavours to oppresse with all his power: That those who represent
all the people, as the Electors, Palatines, Nobles, Parliament, may admonish the
Prince of his duty, and ought to seek by all means to divert him from his Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

perpetrate any thing with impunity, and impiously reign over mens consciences, then
verily he is accounted a Tyrant, that is, an enemy of God and man; whence, if he
hath proceeded to that hight of malice, that hee cannot bee expelled but by armed
force, <hi>It is Lawfull</hi> for the Electors, Palatines and others, to call the people to
Arms, and not onely to defend themselves and others against such a one, but plainly
to deject him from his Throne: For the intire Government of the Realm is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the people to the Prince alone, as neither the Bishopprick of the whole
Church to the Pope, but to every one of the Nobles or Magistrates according to his
power: For the Nobles, as they are called into part of the honour, so of the burthen
of the Commonwealth; which is committed to the Prince, as to the Supreme Tutor,
but to them as Fellow-tutors, he having the first, they the second place in governing
the Republike. The Prince swears that he will seek the good of the Realm, and all
the Nobles promise the same: therefore if he doth ill, they ought not to do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
if the Republike go to ruine, they shall not continue: For the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is no lesse committed to them, than to the King, so as they ought not onely
to do their duty, but also to contain the Prince within the limits of his duty: For if
the Prince doth ought against his Oath, they are not absolved from their Oaths,
but rather then especially ought to manifest their fidelity, when the Republike
requires it, because they were specially instituted for that end, as the Ephori, and
everything ought to be reputed just, when it attains its end. Hence <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For the care of the Republike is no lesse committed to him, than to the Prince and

If many have promised the same thing, the obligation of the one is not taken away
by the negligence or periury of the other. If there be many Trustees, Executors, or
Guardians, the negligence default or fraud of some of them, doth not discharge or
disingage the rest; yea, unlesse they to their power discharge their trust and Oath,
they become perfidious, yea guilty of the same crime, and are subiect unto actions
for their neglect as well as the others: Therfore those who are bound to the whole
Kingdom and Empire, as the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> the Electors, or to some certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey

who usurp a Dominion without any Title, whom every man may justly resist
and suppresse, and are bound in duty so to doe, as he there proves at large; I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transcribe what concernes them who have a lawfull Title. First (saith he) we ought
to consider, that all Princes are born men. <q>We cannot therefore expect to have only
perfect Princes, but rather we ought to thinke it well with us, if we have
gained but indifferent ones. Therefore the Prince shall not presently be a Tyrant,
if he keep not measure in some things, if now and then he obey not reason; if hee
more slowly seek the publike good; if he be lesse diligent in administring Iustice,
or lesse fierce in propulsing warre. For seeing a man is not set over men, as if he were
some God, as he is over beasts; but as he is a man, born in the same condition with
them; as that <hi>Prince</hi> shall be proud, who will abuse men like Beasts, so that people
shall be unjust, who shall seek a God in a Prince, and a Divinity in this frail Nature.
But truly if he shall willingly subvert the Republike; if he shall wilfully perve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the
Lawes, if he shall have no care of his faith, none of his promises, none of Iustice, none
of piety; if himselfe become an enemy of his people, or shall use all or the chiefest
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29602:291"/>
notes we have mentioned, then verily he may be iudged a Tyrant, that is, an enemy of
God and men. Therefore we treat not of a Prince, lesse good; but of the worst;
not of one lesse prudent, but of a malicious and subtile one; not of one unskilfull
in Law, but of a contemner of Law; not of an unwarlike one, but of an enemy of
the people and waster of the Realme. A Senate may assist him with prudence, a
Iudge with the knowledge of the Law, a Captain in the skilfulnesse of warre; but
this man wisheth the Nobles, Senators, Captains of Warre one neck, that he might
cut them off at one stroake, neither hates he any more then them. The first verily,
though he may lawfully be removed, yet however he may be tolerated; the latter
contrarily, by how much the longer he is tollerated, the more intollerable he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes.
Moreover, as euery thing is not lawfull to a Prince; so often times, that
which is lawfull to the people, is not expedient. For frequently it may fall out, that
the remedy which is used, may be worse than the disease. Therefore it becomes a
wise man to try all things, before he use the hot Iron; and use all remedies, before
he take up arme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. If therefore those who represent the people perceive any thing to
be done against the Republike by force or fraud, let them first admonish the Prince;
neither may they expect, till the mischiefe grow heavie, and acquire forces. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
is like an heptick Feaver, which at first is easie to be cured, difficult to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
afterward it becomes easie to be known, but very difficult to be cured.
Therfore they shall withstand the beginnings, neither should they pretermit any
thing, though the smallest. But if he shall proceed, and not repent though frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admonished, but tend onely to this, that he may commit any thing without
punishment; then verily he is really guilty of Tyranny, and they may act against
him, whatsoever they may use against a Tyrant, either by Law or just force. Tyran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
is not onely a crime, but the head, and as it were, the heap of all crimes. A
Tyrant subverts the Republike, makes a prey of all, lyeth in wait for the life of all,
violates faith to all, contemnes all the Religion of a sacred Oath. Therefore is he so
much more wicked then any Theefe, murtherer, sacrilegious person, by how much
it is the more grievous, to offend many and all, then particular persons. Now if all
these be reputed enemies, if they be capitally punished, if they suffer paines
of death, can any one invent a punishment worthy so horrid a crime?
Moreover, wee have proved,<note place="margin">Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the people are the true head.<note place="margin">In Tractat. de Tyranno, &amp; in Tract. de reg. Civit.</note> Therfore it follows, that a Tyrant who commits
felony against the people as the Lord of the fee, hurts the sacred Majesty of the Realm
and Empire, <hi>Becoms a Rebel,</hi> and therfore falls into the danger of the same Lawes,
and demerits more grievous punishments. Therfore, saith <hi>Bartolus,</hi> he may be deposed
by a Superiour; or be most justly punished by the Julian Law, for publike violence.
Now all the people, or those who represent them, as Electors, Palatines, Nobles
the Assembly of the Estates, &amp;c. are his Superiour. But and if he shall proceed so
farre, that he cannot be expelled but by armed violence, then verily it shall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for them, to call the people to Armes, to raise an Army, and to practise force,
policy, stratagems, as against an adjudged enemy of his Country and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.
Neither shall the Officers of the Realm in this case fall into the crime
<hi>OF SEDITION;</hi> For in a sedition there must needs be two points, which when
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29602:292"/>

which protects the common good, which shall preserve the Realme, especially by
this meanes; contrarily, that cause is uniust, which violates the Laws, defends the
breakers of the Lawes, protects the subverters of the Countrey.<note n="*" place="margin">Bartolus Tract. de Guelphis &amp; Gibell Ang. l. 3. §. cum igitur D. de vi &amp; viar. Thom. Aquinas in 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he who kils the Law as much as in him lyeth, cannot be called by that name;
therefore those who take up Arms against him shall not be guilty of that crime. It
is likewise committed against the Common-wealth, but because the Repub. is there

every one, but all the Subiects, but the Lords seem to require an account of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
from their agent: no more shall they be accounted perfidious for doing it;
there is every where between the Prince &amp; people a mutuall &amp; reciprocal Obligation;
he promiseth, that he will be a iust Prince: they, that they will obey him, if he shall
be such a one. Therefore the people are obliged to the Prince under a condition:
the Prince, purely to the people: Therefore if the condition be not fulfilled, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are unbound, the Contract void, the Obligation null in Law it selfe: Therefore,
the King is perfidious if he reign uniustly; the people perfidious, if they obey not
him who reignes iustly: But the people are free from all crime of perfidiousnesse,
if they publikely renounce him who reignes uniustly; or if they endeavour to evict
him with Armes who desires to retein the kingdome unlawfully.<note place="margin">L. 160. D. dereg. Iur.</note> Therefore it is

follow him: if he destroy the Republike, they may not connive; for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

themselves ought rightly to execute their office by themselves, but to containe the

will take care of the benefit of the Commonweale, so also doe they. Therefore
if he breakes his oath, they may not thinke, that they are absolved from theirs,

things, though they are sufficiently firme of themselves, yet they may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated

the Nobles, whom he destroyed without hearing their cause, was at his Queenes

<hi>Mary</hi> very lately in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were

him, or if they doe not their duty, the Patriarks, who are Primates next after
the Cardinals, may against his will, for certaine causes call a Councell, and in it
judge the Pope, if he shall scandalize the Church by his notorious offences; if he
be incorrigible, if reformation be necessary as well in the head as members; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Oath he will not assemble a Councell, and the like; and <hi>de facto,</hi> we
read that many Popes have beene deposed by authority of a Councell. But if (saith

                     <hi>Baldus</hi>) they be pertinaciously abused; at first they must use words, secondly,
herbes, that is, medicines; lastly, stones; and where the truth of vertue sufficeth
not, there the defence of weapons ought to prevaile. But and if by the suffrages
almost of all learned men, the Decrees of Councels, and the Acts themselves
done, it be proved, that a Councell, as they speak, may lawfully depose the Pope, who
yet boasts himselfe to be the King of Kings, and claimes as much to be above the
Emperour, as the Sunne is above the Moone; yea, also arrogates to himselfe
an authority of deposing Kings and Emperours at his pleasure; who at last can
doubt, but that by the publike Councell of every Realme, not onely a tyrant, but
a King, pernicious to his Kingdome for his madnesse or folly, may be deposed or
removed?</q>

                  <p>Goe to now, in this our politicke Ship, the Master gluts himselfe with wine;
most of his assistants either asleepe, or drunke with mutuall cups sportingly behold
an imminent Rocke. The Ship in the meane time, either holds not that course
which is expedient for the owner, or seemes speedily to be wracked; what thinkest
thou is here to be done under the Master, by one who is vigilant and sollicitous?
Shall he pull those by the eares who are asleepe, or onely jogge them by the sides?
but in the meane time, lest he should seeme to doe ought without their command,<note place="margin">Plato. l. 8. &amp; 9. de Repub.</note>
shall he not afford his helpe and assistance to the indangered Ship? Truly what
madnesse, or rather impiety will this be? Seeing then (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) tyranny is
a certaine phrensie and drunkennesse, the Prince may utterly subvert the Republike,
the most of the Nobles may collude, connive, or at least are fast asleepe: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are Lords of the Republike, by the fraud or negligence of these ministers,
which is their fault, are reduced into greatest straights: in the meane time there is
one of the Nobles which considers the incroaching tyranny, and detests it from
his soule, what thinkest thou is now to be done against him by this man? Shall he
onely admonish his Colleagues of their duty, who themselves doe as much hurt
as they may? But, besides, as it is perillous to admonish, and in that state of things it may be deemed a capitall crime, shall he do like those, who contemning other helps, casting away their armes, shall cite Lawes, and make an Oration concerning justice
among theeves, in the midst of a wood? but this truly, is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moly said, to

shall he be silent at the entrance of theeves? or shall he finally grow lasie, and put his
hands into his bosome? But if the Lawes appoint the punishment of a Traytor
against one wearing buskins on his legs, who counterfeits sicknesse for fear of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
with punishment at least shall we decree against him, who either through
malice, or sloathfulnesse, shall betray those whom he hath undertaken to protect?
But rather he shall command those things that are needfull to such as are wary by
a Mariners shout; he shall take care lest the Common-wealth receive any detriment,
and shall preserve the Kingdome even against the Kings will and resistance, by which
he himselfe becomes a King; and shall cure the King himselfe as a frantick man, by
binding his hands and feet, if he may not otherwise doe it.<note place="margin">C. nullus in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagin. Concil. Doctores Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificii.</note> For, as we have said, the
universall government of the Realme is not committed by the people to the King,
as neither the oversight of the whole Church to the Pope, but to every one of the
Nobles according to his power. But certainly, because concord proceeds from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that there should be no emulation among Peeres, a King was instituted, who
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29602:294"/>
should hold the supreme place in the administration of the Common-wealth. The
King swears that he will seeke the safety of the Realme; the Nobles swear every one the same by himselfe: whether therefore the King or most of the Nobles neglecting
their oath, shal either destroy the Commonweale, or desert it being in danger, ought
the rest therefore to desert the Republike, or at least be lesse bound to defend it, as
if they were absolved from their oath? But rather then especially they ought to
shew their fidelity, when as others neglect it, especially since they were principally
instituted for that end, like the Ephori; and every thing may then be reputed just,
when it attaines its end: whether truly if many have promised the same thing,
is the obligation of the one dissolved by the perjury of the other? whether if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be guilty of the same finne, are the rest freed by the fraud of one? Whether,
if many Co-gardians ill defend their Pupill, shall one good man be lesse bound
with the burthen of the wardship through their default? But rather, neither can
they avoyd the infamy of perjury, unlesse they endeavour to satisfie their trust as
much as in them lieth; neither can those exempt themselves from the danger and
judgement of a Gardianship ill administred,<note place="margin">L. 3. D. de ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minist. &amp; perie. tutor. &amp; cur. l. 3. D. desuspect. tut. &amp; curat.</note> unlesse they implead the other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
suspected; when as verily one Gardian may not only implead the rest suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and take care of those to be removed, but also remove them. Therefore those
who have promised their aide and assistance to all the Realme or Empire; such as
Earles of the stable, Marshals, Senators, and the rest; or those who have done it
specially to any County or City which may make a part of the Realme; as Dukes,
Marquesses, Earles, Majors, and the rest, are bound to aide the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale
oppressed with tyranny, or that part thereof, which the people have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them next after the King. And thesetruly ought to vindicate the whole
Commonweale from tyranny, if they be able; those as Gardians assigned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Counties, that part of the Realme whose defence they have undertaken: These
I say, are bound to restaine a tyrant, those to drive him out of their coasts.<note place="margin">Macca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Mattathias</hi> as one of the Nobles, the rest partly conniving, partly colluding;
when <hi>Antiochus</hi> tyrannically oppressed the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> speakes thus to the
people ready to take up armes: Let us restore the state of our people; let us fight for
our people, and our holy places: whence it plainely appeares, that we may not
onely lawfully fight for Religion, but for our Countrey; for an hearth I say,
no lest justly then for our Altars, and take up armes against such a tyrant as he
was: neither are they blamed by any, for recovering the Kingdome, but that they
claimed the royall dignity to themselves,<note place="margin">Iustin. l. I. Diodor. l. 2. c. 37.</note> which pertained to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
Many pertinent examples to this purpose occurre in Historians. <hi>Arbactus</hi> governor
of <hi>Media,</hi> slew <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> spinning among women, and spending the royall
treasure among whores. <hi>Vindex</hi> President of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Galba</hi> of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> revolted from Nero, together with all <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Senate conniving
at his tyranny. But especially that <hi>Laconick</hi> judgement is observable, which verily
proceeding from that Senate, ought to passe into a thing adjudged among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
When the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> possessed <hi>Byzantium,</hi> they made <hi>Clearches</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Army, Governour of the City, who taking corne from the Citizens,
distributed it to the forraine souldiers; but in the meane time the families of the
Citizens perished with famine. <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>xilaus</hi> therefore, one of the Magistrates of the
City, moved with that tyranny, agreed with <hi>Alcibiades</hi> about the yeelding up of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29602:294"/>
his Countrey to him, and he soone after is received into the City. <hi>Anexilaus</hi> being
accused at <hi>Sparta</hi> for yeelding up of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> pleaded his cause himselfe, the
<hi>Spartanes</hi> absolved the man; because they said, warres were to be waged with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not with the nature of things; now nothing is more repugnant to nature,
then, if those who are bound to defend a City, became more unjust then the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Thus the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> determined justly, to whom scarce any good Kings
will not assent; verily those who desire to rule well, care not at all what is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
concerning tyrants, or what the Nobles or people themselves may doe by
Law. But we must yet proceed further. Every one of the Mariners is bound, if the
Ship be endangered through the default or negligence of the Ship-master, to put to
his helping hand: every one of the Nobles is bound, if the Republike perish by the
wickednesse or carelesnesse of the Prince and his Colleagues, to helpe it, being
like to fall, and to vindicate the whole Kingdome, or at least that part thereof
which is committed to him, from tyranny. But then shall it be lawfull for every
ordinary slave to doe the like? or peradventure shall it be lawfull to <hi>Herdonius Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,
Euno Surianus, Spartacus</hi> the fencer, or, I say, to any private man to enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise
servants, to stirre up Subjects to armes, finally to combate with the Prince,
if tyranny urge them? No verily. The republike is not committed to single or
private men, yea they themselves are committed to the care of the Nobles and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
no otherwise then Pupils. Therefore they are not bound to defend the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike,
who cannot defend themselves.<note place="margin">L. 1. c. de Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosis.</note> The sword is not committed to every man
neither by God, nor by the people; therefore if they draw the sword without
command, they are seditious, although the cause may seeme to be just. Finally,
private men doe not make the Prince, but all. Therefore they ought to expect the
command of all, or of those, I say, who represent all in a Realme, Countrey or
City, which may make a part of the Realme, or at least of one of them, before
they attempt any thing against the Prince. For as a Pupill cannot bring an action
without authority of his Tutor, although the Pupill be truly a Lord,<note place="margin">L. l. l. 9. D. de autor. &amp; consil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tutor. &amp; curat.</note> and the
Tutor onely is reputed for the Lord, as farre forth as appertaines to his tutelary
providence: So neither may the people doe ought, but by the authority of those,
on whom they have transferred their authority and power; whether they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Magistrates, or extraordinarily, created in a publike Assembly; whom, I
say, they have guirded with the sword for this purpose, to whom they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
themselves up to be governed and cared for;<note place="margin">Seneca l. 8. de Benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> who finally like that Pretor
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who judged betweene servants and masters, are truly constituted in that
place, that if any contention arise betweene King and Subjects, they may shew
themselves Judges and Redressors, lest the Subjects themselves should pronounce
sentence in their owne cause. Therefore if unjust customes or grievous taxes be
imposed, if things be done against pacts or fraudulently, and yet not one of the
Nobles speakes against or resists it, let them thinke they must then sit still, and
thinke, that the best Physitians to prevent or take away a disease, doe oft-times
prescribe the opening of a veine; the evacuation of humours, yea and scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For such is the nature of things, that scarce any mischiefe can be cured
without another; scarce any good may be acquired without diligent labour. They
have the example of the people under <hi>Solomen,</hi> who refused not the grievous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes imposed on them for the building of the Temple, and fortifying the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:29602:295"/>
because they judged those things to be imposed by the publike Councell,
to the glory of God, the beauty and ornament of the Republike. They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the example of Christ our Saviour, who although he were the King of Kings,
yet because he then sustained a private person, he payed tribute willingly. If the
Nobles and Magistrates themselves favour apparent tyranny,<note place="margin">Iohn 34. v. 30.</note> or at least oppose it
not, they may remember, that for the sinnes of the people, God suffers Hypocrites
to reigne; whom, unlesse they turne themselves to God with all their heart, cannot
be overturned with any engines. Therefore there is no need of feet or hands,
but bended knees. Finally, they must suffer evill Princes, wish for better, and
thinke, they must beare that tyranny with a patient minde as they doe haile,
stormes, tempests, and other naturall calamities, or change their habitations. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
retired into the Mountaines, and spared <hi>Saul</hi> a tyrant, because he was none of
the Nobles of the people: Christ, because he was not of this world fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
to avoyd <hi>Herods</hi> tyranny. <hi>Paul,</hi> because he describes the office of private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
not of Magistrates, teacheth that they must obey <hi>Nero</hi> himselfe. But if all the
Nobles, or most of them, or at least one of them endeavour to restraine apparent
tyranny, or the Magistrate to drive it from that part of the Realme which is
committed to him, if he be such a one, as under pretext of expelling it, may not
introduce another tyranny; then verily assembling together, they may run who
shall goe fastest to this choyce man, they may earnestly assist with their feete and
hands, and as if God himselfe had given a signe from Heaven, of a fight against
tyrants, endeavour to free the Kingdome from tyranny. For as God punisheth
and chastiseth the people by tyrants, so likewise tyrants by the people:<note place="margin">Eccles. 10.</note> and that
is a perpetuall truth which <hi>Syrach</hi> saith; that Kingdomes are translated from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Nation, for the iniquities, injuries, and wickednesse of Princes; and that
every tyranny continues but a short space. Thus the Captaines and souldiers care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
executed all the commands of <hi>Iehojada</hi> the High Priest, in revenging the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Queene <hi>Athaliah:</hi> Thus all the godly men of <hi>Israel</hi> went to the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi>
partly that they might defend the true worship of God, partly that they
might free the Republike against the impious and unjust attempts of <hi>Antiochus;</hi>
yea God favoured their just endeavours, and gave them prosperous successe, What
then? May not God likewise out of private men themselves raise up some aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of tyranny? Cannot the very same who raiseth up tyrants out of the people,
backed with no title, no pretext, to punish the people, likewise raise up deliverers
also out of the lowest of the people? Cannot the same who enthralled the people
to <hi>Iabin</hi> and <hi>Eglon,</hi> deliver the same people by <hi>Ehud, Barac, Deborah,</hi> and as it
were manumit them when they were deserted by the Nobles? What therefore
should now hinder, thou wilt say, but that the same God who hath sent Tyrants
on us at this time, should likewise extraodinarily send revengers of tyrants?
Why, if <hi>Ahab</hi> rageth againt good men, if <hi>Iezabel</hi> suborne false witnesses against
<hi>Naboth,</hi> shall not there be also a <hi>Iehu,</hi> which may extirpate the family of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
who may avenge the bloud of <hi>Naboth,</hi> who may cast downe <hi>Iezabel</hi> to be torne
in peeces of Dogges? Verily, what I have answered before, as nothing hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the justice of God at any time, so not from his mercy. But yet
since those evident signes, by which God was wont to confirme these extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vocations of those Worthies, are for the most part wanting to us in this age,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29602:295"/>
let the people take heed, lest whiles they seeke to passe over Sea with a drie foote,
some Impostor being their Captaine, they fall not headlong into a gulfe, which
we read sometimes to have hapned to the Jewes: lest whiles they seeke a reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of tyranny, they perchance follow one, who, that tyrant being expelled,
will translate the tyranny it selfe unto himselfe: lest finally whiles they seeke to
deserve well of the Common-wealth, they militate to the private lust of any; so as

unto Subjects. Therefore though they prove never so flagitious or tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
they may in no wise be forcibly resisted, or questioned by their Nobles and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments for their crimes.</p>
               <p>I answer briefely (because I have<note n="b" place="margin">Part. 3. p. 115. to 123.</note> elswhere largely dissipated this objection) First,
that Kings are no more of divine institution, then any other inferiour Magistrates
Officers, or Princes what soever; as the<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6. Prov. 8. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Scriptures</hi> abundantly evidence. But all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

censurable, and deposible for their tyranny, wickednesse, and misgovernment
by the Parliaments censure, as I<note n="d" place="margin">Part. 2. p. 44. 45.</note> have proved, notwithstanding their divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
therefore such degenerating Kings too, as well as they in such cases.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>c.</hi> 4. 1. 2 Cor. 3. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 11. 23. 2 Tim. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ministers of the Gospel, are as much, (if not farre more) Iure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, and by Gods owne ordination,</hi> as Kings are; a truth undeniable confessed by all our

thnotith standing their divine right and institution; as the Canons of most Councels,
we practise of all ages, yea, the expresse letter of the 26. <hi>Article of the Church of England,</hi>

proves at large, to whom I shall referre you: But these both lawfully may be,
and alwayes have beene forcibly resisted, questioned, convented, deprived, censured
for their tyranny and misdemeanors, notwithstanding this their stile of <hi>Dei gratia,</hi>
or pretence of divine institution: yea, we know that Bishops have beene lately
thrust out of many Churches, notwithstanding their long pretended <hi>Ius Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
to support their Hierarchy; and <hi>Iohn Gerson</hi> a Papist, hath writ a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Treatise <hi>De Auferibilitate Papae,</hi> notwithstanding the Popes pretended Divine
Title to his Monarchy, which may be now, and one day shall be totally abolished.
Therefore tyrannicall degenerous Kings, may be justly resisted, censured, deprived,
as well as they, and royalties changed into other governments, by the peoples and
kingdomes common consents, if they see just cause.</p>
               <p>If any secondly object:<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> Part. 1. c. 8. sect. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That Kings are annoynted at their Coronation;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their persons are sacred, irresistible, unquestionable, unpunishable, for any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
or exorbitant actions whatsoever.</p>
               <p>I briefely answer: first, that every Christians Baptisme, (being a Sacrament of
Christs owne institution) at least his spirituall unction and sanctification, (as I
have<note n="i" place="margin">Part. 3. p. 89. to 94.</note> formerly proved) makes a person as sacred, yea more holy, then Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting
(being no Sacrament) can, or doth of it selfe make the person of any
King whatsoever. A truth which no Christian can without blasphemy deny. But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and the inward unction of the spirit of grace and sanctification, exempts no
Christians from resistance, censure, punishments of all sorts, in case they commit
any exorbitant or capitall crimes; as experience tels us: Therefore Kings Coronation
annoyntings cannot doe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note n="k" place="margin">Part. 3. p. 92. 93. Petrus Cunaeus de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publ. Hebrae. l. 1. c. 14. Pontif. &amp; Ceremoniale Romanum.</note> Priests <hi>anciently were and at this day too in the Roman Church, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted

                     </gap>ke persons (that I say not Altars,
Bels, &amp;c.) with Chrisme and extreame Vnction:</hi> But these Unctions conferre no such
immunity to Priests, children, sicke men, others, &amp;c. Therefore neither can this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting
doe it to Kings, especially now, being no divine institution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The annoynting of Kings, is not common to all Christian Kings (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them especially in former times, having beene crowned without any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting

                  <hi>sundry others affirme,</hi>
out of the old <hi>Roman Provinciall:</hi> though some other Kings have now and then
beene annoynted when they were crowned, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> Proves. Since therefore
all Kings persons are reputed sacred, as well as these foure who are annoynted; and
these Kings as soone as the Crowne descended to them, even before their Unctions
and Coronations were deemed as sacred and inviolable as before; it is certaine, that
their very enoyling of it selfe makes no addition to their personall immunities
from just resistance, publike censures, or deprivations for grosse unsufferable pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like crimes.</p>

<hi>being not at his Coronation, as many fondly mistake,</hi> but <hi>onely at his baptisme,</hi> as Mr.

institution, of such puny date in most Realmes, and no wayes necessary nor
essentiall to the constitution or Inauguration of any Christian King; can adde no

from all forcible resistance, just censures, or deprivation it selfe, if there be just and
reall cause to proceed criminally against them in case of incorrigibility, as I have
elsewhere more fully demonstrated, and therefore shall no further expatiate in this

of <hi>Mentz,</hi> Arch-chancellor of the sacred <hi>Roman Empire</hi> throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> make
knowne to all men present and to come. What various, manifold, and grievous, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
as discords, have for many yeares since beene brought into the holy Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing even to this present, and daily sprouting up more abundantly to the most grievous
convulsion, imminution, and dissipation of the sacred <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> (which ought to be a
Garrison to the Church of God and the Christian world) as they cannot be all written, so the
mischiefes daily increasing do manifestly enough teach and confirme. And for this cause the
Lords Electors of the sacred Roman Empire, the ardent petitions of the holy Church,
Princes, Nobles, Cities, Provinces, and Subjects of the sacred Empire, intreating, desiring
a prudent Moderator, have long agone very often and seriously, together with us admonished
the most illustrious Prince Lord <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> both by their owne and
their friends labour, and finally by letters; and have diligently set before his eyes, privately
and publikely, his unbeseeming and detestable manners and actions in governing, as also
the defects, incommodities and discords of the said Church and Christian world, likewise the
most grievous avulsions and diminutions of the members of the sacred Empire, hurtfully
done, and permitted to be done, against the dignity of his name: to wit, that he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
peace in the Church, although the great necessity of the Christian world, as likewise his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29602:298"/>
office of Advocate and Defendor of the Church, earnestly required it, and he hath also beene
frequently desired, required, and admonished to doe it: he notwithstanding perniciously mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated
the Empire, and permitted it to be maimed in some members. In the number
whereof are <hi>Millain,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which were of the right of the same
Roman Empire, most ample emoluments returning thence to the Empire: in which Dominion
the <hi>Millainer,</hi> like a Minister, enjoyed it as a part of the Roman Empire; when as He, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that which became his sublimity and dignity, receiving money, created a Duke of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and an Earle of <hi>Papia.</hi> Moreover, he hath alienated divers Cities and Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Empire, as well in <hi>Germany</hi> as in <hi>Italy,</hi> some whereof had returned to the
same, having little consideration, that he ought to retaine them with the sacred Empire.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he hath sold for money to his friends, very many naked and unwritten Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ratified notwithstanding with the Seale of his Majesty; wherein it was lawfull
both for them and others into whose hands these Parchments came, to write what things they
pleased under the royall Seale. Out of which thing, for the hurtfull diminution and dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rights and emoluments of the sacred Roman Empire, great complaints are risen
up. Moreover he never had any care of the controversies and warres, which (alas for griefe!)
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iserably afflicted and ruined <hi>Germany,</hi> and other lands of the sacred Empire.
Hence spoylings, burnings, and robberies have sprung up, with such lamentable encreases
even at this day, that none, neither Clarks nor Laicks, neither husbandmen nor Merchants,
neither men nor women, whether by land or sea, may converse in safety. Temples, Monasteries,
and religious houses, which the sacred Empire ought with its hand to assist and defend, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to rapines, and burnings, and reduced to destruction. Things are gone to this passe, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one might have handled, and may even now handle another at his pleasure, against the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of right and equity, without any feare of the sacred, and long despised Imperiall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, so as even the place of conventing any one, where the defence and patronage of
right may be undertaken in the name of the Empire, is altogether unknowne. Finally,
which is horrible and dreadfull to be spoken, both with his owne hand, and the hand of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked instruments he hath with him, he hath put to death, drowned in the waters,
burned in the fire, miserably and cruelly destroyed, the reverend Bishops of holy things,
Priests, and spirituall Pastors, likewise many other men of honest note, against the rule of
right, otherwise then became the King of Romans. Which mentioned things verily, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other grievous wickednesses and dammages are so divulged and openly knowne, that
they can be no wayes excused or concealed. Therefore we, as we have fore-written, have
frequently very earnestly beseeched, admonished, and required him, that renouncing this
unbeseeming kind of life, he would take the study and labour to himselfe, whereby he
might recover to the holy Church, oft-times imploring his aide, as King of <hi>Romans,</hi> and
her Advocate, peace and tranquillity, and to the sacred Empire, its prestine honours, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and finally its emoluments; to the assistance and consolation of the Christian
world, grievously debilitated and oppressed in this regard.</p>
            <p>Now albeit we have most clearely explicated to the foresaid Lord <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to him in writing, these and other more grievous defects, concerning him as King
of Romans, and the Empire; yet having heard his answers, and having reiterated our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
exhortations, moreover having communicated the businesse to the sacred Roman Sea,
we have never as yet found him, to have amended his manners as became a King of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
namely to recover peace to the Church, principally n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cessary to the Christian world;
also to the sacred Empire, its dignities, lands, and Dominions: a thing which is most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29602:299"/>
knowne throughout all the Provinces of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Therefore because we could no longer neither conceale, nor endure the remembred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other defects, touching the sacred Church and Empire, with grievous losse and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
by reason of the instant petitions of the persons aforesaid, but especially by reason of
the Oath wherewith we are obliged to the same, as the next superiour members of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Empire; therefore as of bounden duty, we were to advise and endeavour how the
sacred Empire might be more rightly and wholesomly provided for, (by whose madde and
negligent administration those inconveniences have crept in) to the safegard and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Christian world. And verily as He in obeying us, had performed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable thing, so we have sufficiently and seriously called and cited him, so as wee have
signified to him; that unlesse he should be present at the place and day appointed, it would
come to passe, that both in respect of the petitions exhibited to us, as likewise in respect of
our Oath, we should be compelled to take and enter into such counsels, whereby the sacred
Empire might be better setled: most clearely attesting it in our letters. For this purpose
we appeared at the place and time prescribed, together with our Coelectors sufficiently
summoned, also with the other Princes and of the sacred Empire, expecting from day to
day, whether the foresaid Lord <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> would appeare, to apply a remedy to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
diseases, and from thenceforth more rightly to consult about the affaires of the sacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
But he neither vouchsafed to appeare, nor yet to send any one to us in the name of a
Proctor. Wherefore when as by reason of so many pregnant and pernicious defects, we
had admonished and reproved him very often in private and in friendly manner, but
after that, when we could doe no good, before the Princes and Nobles, and Cities of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
in divers Assemblies, not without great and grievous expences, yet without any fruit;
therefore we referred all the fore-mentioned things to the sacred Roman Sea. But when
as neither then, he no whit regarded all those things, we could conjecture nothing else from
thence, but that he had laid downe the care both of the Church and Christian world,
but especially of the sacred Empire. Therefore resolving, that this mischiefe, destructive
to the whole Christian Republike, was by no meanes to be any longer borne and tolerated,
with a minde well confirmed, after many and various debates and consultations, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
our selves, as also with other Princes and Nobles of the sacred Empire, seriously
had, for the safety of the Church, the consolation of the Christian world, the honour and
profit of the sacred Empire, we have thought meet, that the foresaid Lord <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi>
should at this time be wholly removed from the Roman sacred Empire and all its dignity,
as one that is negligent and a destroyer of the Empire, and unworthy of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore we <hi>John,</hi> Archbish. in the name of the foresaid Lords Coelectors of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Empire, and our owne, moved both with the commemorated, as also with many other
notable defects and causes, by this our sentence, which we give and pronounce by this our
present writing, <hi>DEPRIVE</hi> and <hi>REMOVE</hi> the foresaid Lord <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> as
an unprofitable, negligent waster, and unworthy Defender of the sacred Empire, from the
foresaid Roman Empire, and from all his degree, dignity, and Dominions appertaining
to the same: denouncing to all the Princes, Nobles, Knights, Gentlemen, Cities, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

and Oath made to the person of <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> in the name of the Empire: requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and admonishing them under the faith of the Oath, wherewith they are obliged to the
sacred Empire, that they doe not henceforth, obey, and submit to the said Lord <hi>Wence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaus,</hi>
as the King of <hi>Romans,</hi> nor exhibit or suffer to be exhibited to him any right, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

               <hi>In defining this question</hi> (saith he) there is more need of conscience, then science,
which would be altogether idle, if charity obtained its place in this world. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as the manners of the times are now, there is nothing more deare or rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, then charity it selfe, we thinke meete briefely to discusse it. <q>The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
as well of soules as bodies; as well of the Church as Common-wealth or
Realme, may be restrained, expelled, and punished by the people. Both these we
have already proved by reasons. But, because such is the fraud of Tyrants, or such
the simplicity of subjects for the most part; that they are scarce known before that
they have spoyled; or these scarce thinke of their safety, till they have almost pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
and are reduced into those straits, out of which they cannot get out with
their owne forces, so as they are compelled to implore the aide of other; it is
questioned, <hi>Whether they defending the cause of Religion or of the Common-wealth, of the
Kingdome of Christ, or of their owne Kingdome, other Christian Princes may lawfully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
them?</hi> And truly many, whiles they have hoped to increase their wealth by ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the afflicted, have presently judged it to be lawfull. For thus the <hi>Romans, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the great, and many others, under pretext of suppressing Tyrants, have
frequently enlarged their Dominions: and not long since we have seene <hi>Henry</hi> the
second, King of <hi>France,</hi> to have made warre with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth:
and that under pretext of succouring and defending the Princes of the Empire, and
of the Protestants too; as also <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> was ready to
aide the Protestants in <hi>Germany,</hi> to make worke for <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: But if any
danger may be feared from thence, or little gaine may be expected, then verily they
must heare most Princes disputing, whether it be lawfull or no? And as those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29602:300"/>
a pretext of piety, did cover either ambition or gaine; so these pretend justice
for their sloathfulnesse; when as verily neither did piety exhort them, which
seekes onely the good of others, nor yet justice ought to dehort these, which looks
wholly abroad, and is as it were, cast out of its owne doores. Therefore, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
both these, let us see first in the cause of Religion, what true piety, and what
true justice may perswade. First, let it be agreed, that there is but one Church,
whose head is Christ, and whose members so cohere and agree among themselves,
that none of them; even the smallest can suffer violence or hurt, but the rest are
hurt and suffer griefe, as the whole Scripture teacheth. Therefore the Church is
compared to a body. Now the body is oft-times affected not onely with
the hurt of the arme, or legge, but even of the very least finger, or perisheth
with its wound. Therefore in vaine may any one boast, that he is cordially affected
with the safety of the body, who when he may defend the whole, yet suffers it to
be torne and mangled limb after limb. It is compared to a buildings Now, where
mines are made against any part of the building, the whole building oft-times fals
downe to the ground; and the flame which invades any part thereof en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>gers gers
the whole. Therefore he should be ridiculous, who because he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the calla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
perchance, should delay to drive the flame from the top of the house. He should
be scarce in his wits, who would not prevent mines with countermines, because
they are made against this wall, not against that. It is also compared to a Ship:
Now the whole Ship is endangered together, the whole perisheth together: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those are equally safe who are in the fore part, as those who are in the puppe;
those who are in keel, as safe as those in the shro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, if the storme rage: whence ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
even in the common proverb, those who are conversant in the same danger, are
said to be in the same Ship: These things laid downe, verily he who is not moved
with its griefe, burning, to ssing, is not of that body, is not accounted of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Christ, hath no place in the Arke. Yet he who is but a little moved,
ought no more to doubt, whether he ought to aide the afflicted members of the
Church, then whether he may helpe himselfe, since in the Church all are one; but
rather every one is bound in his place to afford his helpe and assistance to them; and
so much the more helpe, by how much the more riches he hath received from
God, not so much to be possessed, as expended.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>This Church as it is but one, so likewise it is universally and intirely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
commended to all Christian Princes severally: For because it had beene dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to commit the whole Church to any one; and to commit the severall parts
thereof to particular persons, had beene clearely contrary to its unity; God hath
committed all of it to every of them, and its particular parts to any of them: Nor
yet so, as that they should onely defend it; but also, that they should have a care
to propagate it, as much as they are able. Therefore if the Prince of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
takes care of one part thereof, perchance the German or Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh; but yet
deserts and neglects the other oppressed part, if he be able to relieve it; he is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have deserted the Church, since the spouse of Christ verily is but one, which
he ought to defend and protect with all his might, lest it should be violated or
corrupted any where. The instauration of this universall Church as private men
are bound to promote with bended knees, so Magistrates, I say, are obliged to doe
it with their feet, hands, and all their strength. Neither is the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29602:301"/>
one, the <hi>Colossian</hi> auother, and the rest; but all these particular Churches are parts
of the universall; now the universall is the Kingdome of Christ, which all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men ought to desire; but Kings, Princes, Magistrates, are bound to amplifie,
dilate, defend, and propagate every where, and against all whomsoever. Therefore
among the Jewes there was one onely Temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which represented
the unity of the Church. Now he should be a ridiculous Churchwarden, and to
be punished, who should take care onely to preserve one part safe and sound, but
suffer the rest to fall to decay; likewise all Christian Kings when they are inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
receive a sword, of purpose to defend the Catholike or universall Church;
which taking into their hand, they point out all the quarters of the world, and
brandish it towards the East, West, South and North, lest any part thereof should
be thought excepted. Since then they receive the protection of the Church in
this manner, without doubt they understand the true, not false Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought to doe their endeavour to defend,<note place="margin">2 Chron. c. 31.</note> and to restore intirely, that
Church, which they professe to be true and pure. Now that thus it was observed
by pious Princes, examples may teach us. In the time of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> was long before enthralled to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> to
wit, from the time of King <hi>Hoshea:</hi> therefore if that Church of God onely which
is in the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and not also the universall, had beene committed to
<hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and if the bounds of the Realmes had been to be kept in defending the
Church, in the same manner as they are in imposing tribute; without doubt <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
especially at that season wherein the Assyrians enjoyed the Empire of the
world, would have contained himselfe: But we see that he invited by posts all <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
the subjects, I say, of the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> to celebrate the passeover in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
and moreover that the godly in <hi>Israel</hi> helped them in pulling downe the high
places, even in the territories of <hi>Ephraim, Manasses,</hi> and the rest. So likewise we
read that King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> a most godly Prince, purged not onely his owne Kingdome,
but the <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> likewise, then wholly subject to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> from
the worship of Idols.<note place="margin">2 King 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 2. Chron. 3. 4. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. &amp; 35.</note> Verily where the glory of God, where the Kingdome of
Christ are in question, no limits, no bounds, no railes ought to exclude or keepe off
the zeale of pious Princes. But if peradventure some greater feare hangs over their
heads, they may remember by the example of these, that those who truly feare
the Lord, can feare no man. These examples of pious Princes, since the time that
the Church, which was first circumscribed in <hi>Palestina,</hi> hath beene spread over all
the world, many Christian Princes have followed: <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> were
both Emperours, he of the East, this of the West: they were likewise colleagues
endued with equall power: Now it is known, what is commonly spoken; That
one equall hath no Empire over another equall: Yet notwithstanding <hi>Constantine</hi>
made warre with <hi>Licinius:</hi> who being vexed, slew the Christians, and among them
many of the Nobles, either for the cause, or for the pretext of Religion; by force
obtaines free profession of Religion for the Christians; and finally breaking his
faith, and reverting to his pristine cruelty, he commanded him to be put to death
at <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> This I say did <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, whose piety is so much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by the Divines of that age, that some of them will have that spoken of
him, written in the Prophet <hi>Esay; That Kings should become nursing fathers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the Church.</hi> He being dead, the Roman Empire was divided between both his
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29602:301"/>
sonnes by equall right, no prerogative being annexed to either of them. Of them,
<hi>Constans</hi> fostered the Orthodox, <hi>Constantius</hi> the elder, the Arrians; and he verily
expelled <hi>Athanasius</hi> the enemy of the Arrians, out of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Truly, if any
rules of bounds ought to have beene kept, it ought to have beene betweene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
Yet in the meane time <hi>Constans</hi> threatned his brother, if he restored not
<hi>Athanasius;</hi> being ready to doe it by force, unlesse <hi>Constantius</hi> had speedily resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him intirely; Now if so be he doubted not to doe this, onely for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of one Bishop, might he not much more justly doe it, where some part of the
people is oppressed, when they implore assistance, when they desire to defend their
Religion by the Nobles approbation? So likewise <hi>Theodosius,</hi> by the perswasion
of Bishop <hi>Atticus</hi> undertook a warre against <hi>Chosroes</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sozom. l. 7. e. 18</note> that he might
releeve the Christians persecuted for Religion sake, although they were truly privat
men, which surely those most just Princes, who enacted so many Lawes, and who
had so great a care of Law, had never done, if they had imagined, that by this their
Act others territories and the Lawes of Nations had beene violated. Yea, to what
end were so many expeditions of Christian Princes into <hi>Syria</hi> against the <hi>Saracens;</hi>
to what end were those Saladinian Dismes so oft imposed; to what end so many
sociall warres against the Turkes, so many Crossadoes indicted against them, if it
be not lawfull for any Christian Princes, even the most remote, to free the Church
from Tyranny, and Christian captives from the yoke of bondage? Now with
what arguments were they impelled to the warre, with what reasons were they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
unlesse these, that the Church was one? that Christ called all whatsoever from
all quarters to this service? that common dangers were to be repulsed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
armes? all which likewise doe plainely suite with this our cause. Now and
if this were lawfull for them against <hi>Mahomet;</hi> yea, not onely lawfull, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as a reward was appointed to the industrious, so a punishment both to the
sloathfull, and delayers; why not also against the enemy of Christ? If I say, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Graecians be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ieging our Troy; why not also against <hi>Sinon</hi> the incendiary?
Finally, if it be a pious act to free Christians from bodily servitude, (for the
Turkes compell no man to it) is it not much more so, to manumit the soules of
miserable men, and to restore them to liberty? And verily these so many examples
of pious Princes may be insteed of a Law. But now heare what God himselfe by
the mouth of his Prophets doth every where threaten against those, who promote
not the instauration of the Church, or neglect its affliction. The Gadites, Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites,
and halfe Tribe of Manasses, desire of <hi>Moses</hi> that their portion might be
given to them and their families on this side <hi>Iordan:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 32. Josh. 4. 7 12. Deut. 3. 20.</note> and <hi>Moses</hi> truly gave it them;
but with this Law and condition; that they should not onely helpe their brethren,
the other <hi>Israelites,</hi> in conquering the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but, because they had first
obtained their portion, that they should goe before them, and be placed in the
forefront of them: Which if they should not doe, he accurseth them, smites them
with anathema, and compares them to those who had beene judged Rebels at
<hi>Cadesbernea:</hi> For what? saith he, shall your brethren goe to warre, and you in
the meane time sit still here? But rather you shall passe over <hi>Iordan,</hi> neither shall
you returne againe hither to your houses before that God hath expelled his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
from before his face, and given rest to your brethren, as he hath given unto
you: Then verily you shall be innocent before the Lord of <hi>Israel;</hi> verily those on
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29602:302"/>
whom the great and good God hath bestowed so great a benefit, unlesse they assisted
their Brethren, unlesse they were companions of their labours, unlesse they went
before them, should without doubt receive most grievous punishments.</p>
               <p>Likewise, when under the conduct of <hi>Deborah,</hi> those of <hi>Nephthali</hi> and <hi>Zebulon</hi> had
taken up armes against the Tyrant <hi>Iabin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 5.</note> and in the meane time the Tribe of <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi>
which ought to be first in Armes, delighted themselves with the Pipes among
the Pastures of the flockes, <hi>Dan</hi> boasted of the Empire of the Sea, <hi>Asher</hi> finally tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in the asperity of Mountaines, all of them are most expresly condemned by the
Spirit of God, speaking by the Prophetesse; Curse ye <hi>Meroz,</hi> saith the Angel of
the Lord, curse ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the
helpe of the Lord against the mighty.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 11.</note> But blessed above women shall <hi>Iael</hi> the Wife

yet notwithstanding shee slew <hi>Sisera,</hi> the Captaine of the enemies Hoast.
Therefore piously spake <hi>Vriah,</hi> The Arke, and <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> abide in tents, and
oft times passe the night without sleepe in the open fields; shall I then feast with my
Wife, eate, drinke, and follow my pleasures? As the Lord liveth, I will never doe
this.<note place="margin">Amos 8.</note> Contrarily the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> did impiously, who trusting in the difficulty
of the mountaines of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and in the munition of <hi>Sion,</hi> flowed with luxury,
feasted, dranke, slept on beds of Ivory, anoynted their heads; but in the meane time
wonderfully despised contrite, cruciated, afflicted <hi>Ioseph,</hi> neither were any way mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hate his palaces; I have sworne by my soule that I will deliver
up the City; and all that is therein, yea, these who so greatly rioted shall soone
goe with the first into captivity. Impiously also did the <hi>Ephramites,</hi> who did not
onely not gratulate <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Iephtha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 8. &amp; 12.</note> attaining the victory and triumphing, but
likewise envyed them, though yet they deserted them when they were in danger.
Likewise the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who when <hi>David</hi> reigned, cryed out; saying:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 5.</note> Behold we
are thy flesh and thy bones; when he was reduced into straites, said: We have no
part in <hi>David,</hi> nor in the Sonne of <hi>Iesse.</hi> Impiously doe all those Christians one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in name, who will communicate in the sacred feasts of the Church, and yet will
not so much as taste the cup of bitternesse with their Brethren, who seeke salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Church, and yet take no care for the salvation and safety of the Church
and of its Members. Finally, they acknowledge one Father, God; one Family,
the Church; professe themselves to be one body in Christ; yet neither yeeld any
aide to Christ afflicted in his Members, or bestow their wealth on him being poore.
What thinke we shall be the future punishment of their impiety?<note place="margin">Numb. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> compares

cloathed him not when he was naked, who relieved him not when he was poore,
who freed him not when he was captive.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> Therefore they ought to know, that

and therefore verily it shall be easier for certaine insidels, than for them;

seeme to persecute noxious, impious men deserving punishment, not properly to

suffer him whom they professe their Messiah, Redeemer, God, to be tortured and
crucified in his Members, when they might hinder it. In summe; he who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

when as, I say, we doe not here discourse of the Church, which is but
one of all men; which being one and universall, is committed to every one; But
of the Republicke, which may be different from that of others; and being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
is committed severally to others? A Neighbour, saith Christ, is not a Jew
to a Jew onely, but to a Samaritan, and to any man. Now we ought to love our
Neighbours as our selves. Therefore a Jew, if he would discharge his duty, is bound
to deliver from a theefe, if he be able, not a Jew onely, but likewise every stranger,
yea likewise one unknowne. Neither will any one dispute, whether it be just to
defend himselfe; seeing verily it is more just to defend another than himselfe in this
respect, wherein things are more just, which meere charity doth, than those which
either anger, or revenge, or other perturbation of the minde doe: and no man
holds a meane in revenging his owne injuries; but in other mens, although more

all men require of us in this thing. For <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, there is one nature of all men;
that even nature it selfe prescribes this, that a man ought to take care of a man,
who ever he be, even for this very cause, that he is a man. If otherwise, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
consociation must necessarily be dissolved. Therefore, as there are two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of justice: first, that no hurt be done to any; next, that the profit of
all, if it may be done, be advanced: So also there are two kinds of injustice; one
of those who offer injury; the other of those who propulse not wrong from
those to whom it is offered, if they be able. For he who doth unjustly against any
one, incited either by anger, or other perturbation, he seemes as it were to offer
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29602:303"/>
violent hands to his companion; but he who doth not defend, or resist an injury
if he can, is as much in fault, as if he deserted either his Parents, or Friends, or
Country. So that what the one doth, anger is judged to doe, which is reputed
a short fury; what the other, an evill minde truely, which is a perpetuall tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
And however his fury may be excused, the others destinated counsell can by
no meanes be excused. Thou wilt say, I feare that while I repulse an injury from
him, I should doe an injury to the other. Yea verily, thou wilt cover thine injustice
with a pretext of Justice; Whereas if thou consultest with thy selfe, not justice
moves thee to desert thy duty, but rather some other cause. For, as he saith in
another place, either thou wilt not undertake enmities, or labour, or cost; or else
thou art so hindered with negligence, sloathfulnesse, idlenesse, or with thy studies,
or certaine imployments, that thou sufferest those to be deserted, whom thou
oughtest to protect. But while thou sayest, thou dost thine owne businesse, lest
thou mightest seeme to doe wrong to any, thou runnest into another kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.
For thou desertest the society of life, because thou bestowest on it nothing
of thy study, nothing of thy paines, nothing of thy goods. These things Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes,
Philosophers, and Politicians hold, truely more piously than many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

rescued him, if he could, was guilty of death: if not, hee was bound to accuse
the Theeves before the Magistrate: Which if he had neglected, he was beaten with
a certaine number of stripes, and punished with a three dayes fast. Now if this
verily be lawfull in one neighbour towards another, yea, lyeth upon him out of

be called the defenders of Greece and the Common Country, but yet helpe not their oppressed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi>
and rightly; for a Tyrant is in a sort compelled to retaine violently the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
which he hath violently invaded; because, as <hi>Tyberius</hi> said, he seemeth
to hold a Wolfe by the eares, which he cannot retaine without force, nor yet let
goe without danger. Therefore that he may extinguish one crime with another,
hee commits many wickednesses, and is compelled to injure others, lest he should
be injurious to himselfe. But that Prince who idlely beholds the wickednesses of
a tyrant, and the ruine of the blood of innocents which he may hinder, because
he doth as it were take pleasure in the gladiatory sport, is by so much more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
than the Tyrant, as he who sets sword-players to fight, is guiltier than the
man-slaying Gladiator; as much as hee who slayes a man for pleasure sake, is
more criminous than he who doth it by constraint, or out of feare or necessity.<note place="margin">Object.</note> If

their impiety) object; that there are distinct limits, distinct jurisdictions;<note place="margin">Pompon de reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lur. leg. 36.</note> now
it is not lawfull to thrust a sickle into anothers Corne: Neither truely do I advise,
that by this pretence thou shouldest invade anothers territories, usurpe anothers
jurisdiction to thy selfe, draw thy neighbours corne into thine owne floore, which
most doe under this pretext. I doe not say, that by the example of that arbitrator,
of whom <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. 2. Offic.</note> thou thy selfe shouldest judge the thing controverted to thy
selfe; but rather that thou shouldest restraine a Prince invading the Kingdome of
Christ, containe a tyrant within his limits, stretch out an helping hand to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
people, and a prostrated Commonweale; But thou must do it in such sort,
that thou mayest not looke after thine owne profit, but the good of humane society
altogether. For since Justice wholly lookes abroad, injustice onely regards it selfe,
thou shalt at last doe this justly, if thou shalt have no regard of thine owne profits.
Briefely, if a Prince violently passeth over the fixed limits of piety and justice, a
neighbour may piously and justly leape over his limits, not that he should invade
anothers, but that he should bid him be content with his owne: yea, he shall be
impious and unjust, if he neglect it. If a Prince exercise tyranny over the people, he
may no lesse, or lesse slackly assist them, than him, if the people should move sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
yea, he ought to doe it the more readily, by how much it is more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that many suffer, than one. If <hi>Porsena</hi> reduce <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud to <hi>Rome,</hi>
much more justly may <hi>Constantine,</hi> sent for by the people and Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyrant out of the City. Finally, if a man may become a Wolfe
to a man, nothing truely forbids, but that a man may be a God to a man, as it is
in the Proverbe. Therefore antiquity hath enrolled <hi>Hercules</hi> among the number of
the gods, because he punished and tamed <hi>Procrustes, Busyris,</hi> and other Tyrants,
(the pests of mankinde, and monsters of the world) in every place.<note place="margin">Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. lib. 2. Offic.</note> So also the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as long as it stood free, was often called, <hi>The Patrocinie against the
Robberies of Tyrants,</hi> because the Senate was the haven and refuge of Kings, People,
Nations. So <hi>Constantine</hi> sent for by the <hi>Romans</hi> against <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyrant, had
God the Captaine of his Army, whose expedition the Universall Church exalted
with powerfull prayses; when yet <hi>Maxentius</hi> had the same authority in the West,
as <hi>Constantine</hi> in the East. Likewise <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, undertooke a Warre against
the <hi>Lombardes,</hi> being called by the Nobles of <hi>Italy</hi> to their aide, when as yet the
Kingdome of the <hi>Lombards</hi> was long before established, and he could claime no
right to himselfe over them. Likewise, when <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald King of <hi>France,</hi> had
by Tyranny taken away the President of that Country,<note place="margin">Ioan. Avent. in Anal. Boyor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Seine</hi> and <hi>Liger,</hi> Duke <hi>Lambert,</hi> and <hi>Iamesius,</hi> and the other Nobles of <hi>France</hi> had
fled to <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Germany, Charles</hi> his Brother by another mother, to crave
aide against <hi>Charles</hi> and his mother <hi>Iudith,</hi> a most wicked Woman: He in a most
ample Assembly of the <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, heard these suppliants, by whose unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Counsell, a warre was publickely decreed against <hi>Charles,</hi> for to restore the
exiles. Finally, as there have beene some Tyrants in every place, so likewise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Historians there are every where examples extant, of tyranny revenged,
and people defended by neighbour Princes; which the Princes now at this day
ought to imitate, in curbing the tyrants both of bodies and Soules of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
and of the Church of Christ, unlesse they themselves will be named Tyrants,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29602:304"/>
by a most deserved right. And (that we may at last conclude this Treatise in one
word) piety commands the Law of God to be observed, and the Church to be
defended justice, that Tyrants and the subverters of Law and the Republike should
be curbed; charity, that the oppressed should be releeved, and have a helping
hand extended. But those who take away these things, take away piety, justice,
charity from among men, and desire them to be altogether extinguished.

they continue languishing under all these miseries here, and the sharpest torments,
