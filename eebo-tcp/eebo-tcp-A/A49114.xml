            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:63641:3"/>
these endeavours, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper them by thy Almightie Spirit, to the reviving of thine own despised Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thou hast the hearts of all men in thy hand; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, I pray thee, all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and prejudice, all pride and partiality, all carnall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and inordinate pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from their hearts, into whose hands these unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy labours shall come; and cause them, and the dayly prayers of thy Servant, to become effectuall through thy blessing, for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that good end to
<pb facs="tcp:63641:3"/>
which it is intended: And let the Power and the Praise be onely thine, who bringest greatest things to pass by the weakest means, <hi>and out of the mouths of babes and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> dost ordinarily perfect thy praise. Suffer not (blessed Lord) the spirit of errour and division to prevail against those whom thou hast pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with thy blood; but let that blood be effectually applied unto them, to cleanse them from their sins, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in thy truth, and to cement them inseparably in brotherly love and unity:
<pb facs="tcp:63641:4"/>
That as we have <hi>One Lord, one Faith, and one Baptisme,</hi> so we may be all of one heart and of one mind in all things that concern the purity of thy worship, the peace and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of thy Church, and may have all our requests, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Incense of thy Almighty Intercession, dayly presented unto our heavenly Father, in that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Censer which thou (in great mercy to our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) hast consecrated for the offering up of the prayers of thy Servants; commanding us when we pray, to say, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </hi> Have made my Dedication, laying down my self, and all my poor endeavours, at the feet of Jesus Christ, my great Master: And having payed my vowes, I come now to pay my debts, or rather (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are greater then I can satisfie) to make my acknowledgement, presenting this Pepper-corn to your hand. All the hope that I have of your acceptance, is, because I have intitled you to a righteous cause, and such as can plead for it self. No eminency of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or authority can give any opponent so great advantage against him that pleadeth the cause of Christ, is the truth and goodness of that cause can administer to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it against all opposers, be they never so numerous, or clamorous: And yet (Worthy
<pb facs="tcp:63641:5"/>
Sir) lest the weakness of the Advocate should seem to prejudice the cause, I have chosen to plead it mostly in the Language, and Arguments of men, as famous for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learning and exemplary Pietie, as any this Age can boast of; And I am sure too, that there are many Persons alive of that Character, who will readily appear and plead for it still: but if all should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, if all should oppose it, Our great Master can plead his own Cause, and I doubt nor Sir, but you will be of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; and then though the Solicitor be an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> yet there is no fear of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</p>
            <p>And thus having done my devoir, and told the world that no man on Earth hath better Title to my Labours then your self, I beseech the God of Heaven to make you as eminent in Spiritual, as you are in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall blessings, that the inner man may pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as the outward doth. <hi>So prayeth</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile our generation hath been so busie in casting out the rubbish of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it should have been the special care and inspection of the publick Servants of God attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy things, that none of the sacred vessels and utensils of that house, which <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> had <hi>Holiness to the Lord</hi> written on them, were thrown out: But the enemy have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevailed with too many to lay aside some as vessels, and to trample on others as outworn beggarly implements, hath also raised so much dust, as hath buried many, and sullied the glory of all the rest; yea, and (as if the Christian Church had its cloud too) the understandings of the beholders are so darkned, that it is become as difficult to discern, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between the precious and the vile, as it is easie &amp; familiar to call evil good, and good evil. In this great confusion, wherein <hi>Jerusalem</hi> hath been made an
<pb facs="tcp:63641:6"/>
heap, that Golden Censer wherein the Prayers of the Saints were wont to be offered up to the God of Heaven, and that which hath been used in all ages as the <note n="*" place="margin">Sal om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinorum officiorum.</note> Salt to season all Christian services, hath it self been hudled up as useless, or cast out as unsavoury. And no wonder; for when the enemy opposeth no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance more then Prayer, and of all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers this of our Lord is incomparably the most excellent, of which we may justly say (as the People did of <hi>David) Thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 31.</note> 
               <hi>art worth ten thousand of others;</hi> we may not think it strange, if (as the King of <hi>Syria</hi> did) he so order it, that his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fight not against small or great, but onely this King of Prayers. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed fought they have against it many a time, since <hi>Pelagius</hi> first blew the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and marshalled his forces against this and other important truths of Christ; but never were they so unhappily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful as in our generation. That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should cry, <hi>raze her, raze her, even to the ground,</hi> is a <note place="margin">Psalm 137. 7.</note> voice that the Church hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with in all ages; that they should assault her foundations, and trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the holy Ordinances, disannul the
<pb facs="tcp:63641:6"/>
Office, and despise the persons of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, call their Prayers charmes, and their Preaching foolishness, is so far from wonder, that it would be a great wonder if they should not; but that they who are named by the name of Christ should doe these iniquities, that his veterane Souldiers, and houshold-servants, who yet remain in his Tents, should conspire with his enemies to betray his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, cast away their armes, and desert <note place="margin">Preces &amp; lachrymae arma Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia.</note> his cause, is of very sad consideration: Such practices as these have weakned the cause of Christ, and given great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the adversary; yea, and a just ground of scandall is hereby offered to all sober Christians, both at home and abroad, against the Persons and Prayers of the Ministery of <hi>England,</hi> that we have been so negligent in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frequent use of <hi>Our Lords Prayer,</hi> (of which the most are guilty,) or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their former practice (which it is hoped they performed in Faith) have wholly abandoned the use of it (as too many;) and what is worst of all, that any Disciple, after Confession of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and crying <hi>Hosanna</hi> to it, should almost in the same breath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb facs="tcp:63641:7"/>
a <hi>crucifigite,</hi> that with its bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Maker it might be betrayed with a kiss.</p>
            <p>When an Enemy, when the Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeth our Land, and threatneth destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we all joyn as one man to make up the breaches; but when our Religion, our Zion, is assaulted by more Enemies then ever, when her Turrets and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements are broken down, no man lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to heart: <hi>This is Zion whom no man seeketh after,</hi> was her Motto of old, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 17. How secure and negligent have we been for the most part, disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and injurious to the Cause of Christ and his Church, against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian reasonings, and unreasonable practices of such men, who would drive us from our last and best refuge, <hi>(Quid enim nisi vota?</hi> for what can Christians better confide in then in their Prayers; and what Prayer is like to be more safe and effectual then this?) I shall expose my self, not animated with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of success and victory, (being on the defensive part) but to discharge my duty, to shew my readiness in the cause of Christ, <hi>and to strengthen the feeble knees, and lift up the hands that hang</hi>

               <hi>down, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way:</hi> And yet seeing that <hi>Magna est veritas, &amp; praevalebit,</hi> truth is great and will prevail, (though the Advocate that pleadeth for it be never so weak;) and seeing that no truth hath more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press foundation in Scripture, or for that cause hath had more universal practice in the Church, I despair not but the eyes of those that are not wilfully blind may be opened, at least the mouths of such as are not desperately wicked may be stopped from reproching the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Gods anointing, in decrying rhe pious use of this most excellent Prayer, by that which (through the blessing of God) shall be said on its behalfe in this ensuing Exercitation. Which that it may not swell with a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or digre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion, I shal insert a few things by way of Introduction against the opinion of such as oppose this Prayer under the notion of being a form; as 1. that though som forms may justly be dislik'd, yet the ground of disliking them because they are forms, is very unjust; forasmuch as God himself prescribed divers forms, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly practised by the Jewish Church under the Law: and our Saviour,

and the Christian Church after his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample have in all ages done the like under the Gospel; Most unhappy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they who heap such disrespect on that most Heavenly Prayer, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and inculcated by our Saviour once and again to his Disciples, meerely on the account of its being a form; in as much as they seem to fight against God, and proclaim that to be common and unclean which God and our Saviour have Sanctified by their reiterated injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice.</p>
            <p>And with what greater pompe the Friends of the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy could have solemnized its funerals, then the enemies of it have done, in causing this sacred form to accompany it to its grave, no Master of Ceremonies could well have contrived. In condemning this they have (as much as in them lay) justified that, and given its friends some hope (there being so much Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in the Grave with it) that one day it may have a refined resurrection.</p>
            <p>But at such a Funerall as this the Church cannot but mourn in the words of old <hi>Jacob; Ioseph is not, and Simeon</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And whereas Master <hi>Thorndike</hi> hath observed their Prayers were read by one whom they called the <hi>Apparator of the Synagogue,</hi> who was of inferiour rank to the Scribes and great Doctors, and of a like degree and qualitie as Deacons in the Christian Church; this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they were not intrusted to direct the Devotion of their betters by any <hi>ex tempore</hi> effusions, but to pronounce such Prayers as had been composed by their Superiors.</p>
            <p>And thus we have brought down the continued use of set and prescribed forms of Prayer to our Saviours dayes; wherein I have greatly exercised the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of my Reader: but I could not avoid it, this being a part of my ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, on which I intend, after a little more labour, to build this assertion, That Saint <hi>John Baptist</hi> (a most eminent Prophet) being to gather a new Church, and to make a reformation of Religion, and (by instructing his Disciples in the Doctrine of Repentance) to prepare them for the receiving of the Messeas, did, (after the manner of other Doctors
<pb facs="tcp:63641:14"/>
and teachers among the <hi>Iewes)</hi> collect out of the Prayers and Hymnes of <hi>Moses, David,</hi> the Prophets, and other devout men, such heads of Prayer as concerned the dayes of the Messiah, his Offices and Doctrine; and of these did compose a form of Prayer, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to his Disciples, to be publickly used by them on all solemn occasions, and to serve as a Cognizance of their professing and owning the Doctrine taught by him; which the Disciples of our Saviour observing, on this occasion, and for the same end, they aske, and our Saviour prescribeth, this form of Prayer, and injoyns the use of it; <hi>when ye pray, say, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>First, that nothing is to be admitted into Christian practice, as far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the publick worship of God, for which there is not an express or sufficient warrant in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That to use Prayer as a form, there is no such warrant, either in that of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. 9. or Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 12.</p>
            <p>The first plea divers learned men have <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> Preface to last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> answered; I shall onely offer against it that which Doctor <hi>Sanderson</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to this effect; What scandall and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage hath been given to Anabaptists and Quakers, by, What command have you in Scripture? It is like the opening the <hi>Trojan</hi> horse, or <hi>Pandora's</hi> box, as if all had been let loose: <hi>Unà Eurusque Notusque ruunt,</hi> and swarms of Sectaries have overspread the land, and the young striplings soon outstrip their leaders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own ground; as they said, what command or example for kneeling at the Communion, for Surplices, Lord
<pb facs="tcp:63641:15"/>
Bishops, a penned Liturgy, and Holy dayes? and there stopt: These adde further, Where are your Lay-Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, your Classes, your Steeple-houses, and national Churches, your Tithes and Mortuaries, your Infant-sprinklings, and meeter-Psalmes, your two Sacraments, and weekly Sabbaths? so far they are gone already; <hi>Et erranti nullus terminus,</hi> there is no bound to an erroneous spirit: Nor indeed can they that set them a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now stop or relaim them, <hi>Fugiunt trepidi vera &amp; manifesta loquentem Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae;</hi> for they proceed upon their own principles: and if they say, <hi>Haec ego nunquam Mandavi (dices) olim, nec talia suasi,</hi> We never intended, nor counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced these things: the reply is ready, <hi>Mentis causa malae tamen est &amp; origo pencs te,</hi> The fountain of all these bitter and turbulent waters is with you. They that made a stand sooner are displeased with such as rusht on further, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against them; but no great reason, when they lent them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, to fall out with the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>The master in the Fable did not well to beat his maid for serving him with
<pb facs="tcp:63641:15"/>
thinne milk, when his own Cow gave it; Why should he that giveth another scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, be angry with him for taking it? or he that setteth a stone tumbling down the hill, blame it for not stopping where he would have it? So mischievous a thing it is not to lay the foundation on a firm bottom. It were well if this were helpt ere it went too far. So far that Reverend Dr.</p>
            <p>As to the second ground, that there is no warrant in Scripture for the use of this Prayer as a form, <hi>sub judice lis est.</hi> All that I shall say here, is, That it is a sad thing, when men are so blinded by the opinions and prejudices which they have espoused, as that they can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they have a mind to see; or being defective in their own sight, will needs perswade others (as she in the Comedy) that there is no light in the room: And in our dayes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is verified, even of <hi>Aarons</hi> bells,</p>

               <hi>be opened.</hi> To all my Readers I commend this rule, Not easily to believe every Doctrine, and take up their Religion upon trust, but to search the Scriptures (as those more noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did) whether things be so or no; And <hi>having tried all things, to hold fast that which is good.</hi>

Disciples, desire that our Saviour would teach them as <hi>John</hi> also had taught his Disciples. In which request we may plainly observe</p>

            <p>In our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours answer are also two parts,</p>

            <p>For beyond all question, our Saviour in this, as in all other good things, did satisfie the desires of his Disciples as well in the manner as the matter of their request, direction for both these being desired; if therefore it shall be proved that <hi>John Baptist</hi> taught his Disciples a form of Prayer which they used publickly, and by which they were distinguished from the Disciples of other <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors, and known to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of S. <hi>John,</hi> it may be irrefragably inferred that our Saviour taught his Disciples this Prayer to be also used as a publick form, and to serve as a cognizance, whereby they might be known to be his followers.</p>

And <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> a man that knew the customes and practices of that people as well as any in his time, gives this brief Comment on the occasion of prescribing this Prayer; <hi>Aliquâ orationis formuld, certi argumenti, nos imbue, ut</hi> caeteri Magistri suos Discipulos, <hi>utque</hi> Johannes, <hi>qui ex doctrinae suae de poenitentia, praeceptis, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationes opportunas composuit, (. i.)</hi> Give us a form of Prayer of an invariable matter or Argument, as <hi>other Masters gave their Disciples,</hi> and as <hi>John</hi> who out of the Precepts of his doctrine of Repentance, did compose certain seasonable Prayers.

Great corruption was then among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> their whole religion was so decayed, that it is no wonder that the manner of praying was rightly observed by very few; and because the promised redemption drew nigh, it was necessary to excite the mindes of the faithful by prayer, to hope and desire the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment thereof; <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore out of divers places of Scripture, could, <hi>(. i.)</hi> (as I understand him, <hi>de jure,</hi> rightly and with good authority, for he had spoken <hi>de facto</hi> before) compose some certain form of prayer which was agreeable to the present time, and most suitable to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom of Christ, which then began to be manifested.

            <p>But I fear all that may be said will not satisfie some men; yet because this argument will be as a chief stone, on which (as to the context) we may lay some stress, I shall take a little more pains to settle it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iohn</hi> did, after the manner of <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors, teach his Disciples a brief form of prayer to be frequently used by them, which accordingly they did often, and publickly use, whereby they were known to be his Disciples.</p>

However their authority that argue meerly negatively (that there was no such form because it is not recorded in Scripture) will signifie but little, when in the first place, it shall be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how many things are mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as done, the particulars whereof <hi>(in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gestâ)</hi>

And from the first title of the <hi>Misna</hi> we have enough to evince this whole point, for there we have divers cases concerning the formal words of divers of those prayers which still they use, resolved by Doctors that lived not long after our Saviours time, and therefore the terms and cases of more ancient Doctors disputed at that time by these, must needs be of greater antiquity. <hi>Scaligers</hi>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. 1. That S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples did use such a distinct form of prayer, as that they were thereby known by all that heard them to belong unto him, is cleerly intimated in the Disciples questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was occasioned by this observation of theirs; <hi>Master, teach us to pray, as Iohn also taught his Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This prayer, so commonly used by them, must be either of their own composure, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to certain heads prescribed by their Master; or else a set form.</p>
            <p>That it should be of their own composure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their divers abilities, is unlikely;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63641:22"/>
1. Because the Disciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but of a mean condition, and to think that they had any extraordinary gifts bestowed upon them so early, (our Saviours own Disciples, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been a long time with him, being but meanly qualified, before the coming of the Holy Ghost) is somewhat dissonant from the truth of the holy Scriptures, and the wisdom of our Saviour, that did not (on this supposition) chuse Disciples for himself as well qualified as S. <hi>Iohns</hi> were; but in all probability they were both of them ignorant, not onely of the matter, what to ask, but (which seemeth most difficult) of the manner also how to ask aright.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because, as hath been proved, other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors among the <hi>Iewes</hi> did usually prescribe the very form of prayer that was used by their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the composure of publick prayer was not the work of ordinary Disciples, but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of one, or more, eminent men in all ages of that Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because if S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had onely given his Disciples heads of prayer, and not a set form, this would not have conduced to the production of that effect which the Scripture intimates to have followed, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to make them known to all that heard them whose Disciples they were; for though their prayers for the matter of them might be agreeable, yet differing wholly in form, and variety of expressions, they could not be well understood by people of mean capacities, to have followed the same rule; this I guesse from the little uniformity observed in the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as follow the heads of prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63641:22"/>
by the Directory. For though there be a good method and excellent matter proposed, yet men being left to their own composures, they either slight the method, or so invert, confound, perplex and obscure the matter thereof in their own expressions, as that it can justly be said but of a few, these do observe the Directory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Questionless the matter of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> prayer had a great harmony with the chief heads which were ordinarily used by the Disciples of other <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors, and therefore it must be the form that made the distinction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And lasty, If we may judge of a deed by its counterpart, our Saviour delivering in his answer a form of prayer, (as is granted by all) doth more then intimate that the prayer taught by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that which was desired by his own Disciples, (unlesse we should think that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour answered impertinently) was a form. So that if we should paraphrase the words thus, <hi>Lord teach us a prayer whereby we may be known to be thy Disciples, as Iohn also taught his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a prayer, whereby we and all that hear them, may know whose Disciples they are:</hi> Our Saviours answer, delivering a composed form, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this interpretation, <hi>When ye pray, say this form, Our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. And upon these premises I may build this conclusion, that the prayer delivered by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on the request of his Disciples, according to the instance of S. <hi>John,</hi> was not intended only as a Directory for matter and method of prayer, but as a set form to be used by them, and to serve as a peculiar mark, and character that they were his Disciples.</p>

But before we consider the words of the injunction and command, this one thing may be opportunely, and materially inserted, that (as it hath been already proved) forms of prayer were used in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church until our Saviourstime; so our Saviour himself did not dislike, or abhor from, either forms of prayer in general, or those forms which were then in use among the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular; for the Scripture assures us that in a great extremity, when as we may all think our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would pray most fervently, he used the same words three times, <hi>(viz.) Father; if it be possible; let this cup pass from me:</hi> And it is the opinion of many learned men, that our Saviour on the Cross did repeat, not onely the first verse of <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. but the whole Psalm throughout, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is a form. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaking of <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 46. <hi>Hier. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Pelagium.</hi> p. 248. <hi>mihi.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. Moreover it is proved by learned men, beyond all contradiction, that our Saviour in the dispensation of the New Testament, did retain and practise several formes, which were used by the <hi>Iewes</hi> under the Old: Particularly, in the Institution and administration of his last Supper, our Saviour varied very little from the forms and customes used by them at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Passeover; of the truth whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other reasons, this in the opinion of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men is a sufficient confirmation: That as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63641:23"/>
the <hi>Iewes</hi> were wont to shut up the solemnity of the Passeover by singing some of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms; so our Saviour, after the celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his body and bloud, went out with his Disciples to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, having sung the Hymn, which Hymn (say the best Expositors) was the same that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did ordinarily sing after the Passeover, and is called by them the great <hi>Hallel,</hi> which, as <hi>Pau'us Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis</hi> sayes, consisted of six Psalmes, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 113. to <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. and he addes <hi>(verisimile est</hi>

And he concludes thus; They that object that Christ did not submit to the <hi>Iewish</hi> customes, may be confuted by six hundred argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if it were of moment; and I believe that <hi>Drusius, Capellus,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> and others have made up the full number.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63641:24"/>
had (as the Rabbines witnesse) added both signes and words, eating sowre herbs and drinking wine, with these words, <hi>Take, eat these in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Drink this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, &amp;c.</hi> upon which Addition, and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs, our Saviour instituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his last Supper, celebrating it with the same words and after the same manner, thereby approving that fact of theirs in particular. <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> tells us, there was Bread also as well as <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scaliger de Emend. Temp. p.</hi> 536.</note> Wine exhibited at the Passeover, with these words, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>This is the bread of affliction, which your fathers did eat in the land of Egypt; let every one that hungreth come and eat, let every one that hath need come and keep the Passeover; ye were sometime servants there, but now ye are in the land of Israel; ye were sometime servants there, but now ye are free in the land of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if our Saviour did accommodate the <hi>Iewish</hi> formes, (some of which were meerly of humane invention) to the solemn administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that most blessed Sacrament, which is to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> continue in his Church until his coming again; we may not think it strange that he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a form of prayer of his own composure, and enjoyn his Disciples the frequent use of it in their solemn devotions.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> descends to particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as that our Saviour after the cup of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <note place="margin">Temple Service p. 161.</note> took some of the unleavened bread and blessed and brake it, and gave it to be eaten for his body from thenceforth in that sense, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63641:24"/>
the flesh of the Paschal Lamb had been his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unto that time; and that which was called the Cup of <hi>Hallel,</hi> he taketh and ordaineth for the Cup of the New Testament in his bloud, and after sung the <hi>Hallel</hi> throughout, and so went out to the Mount of Olives. And <hi>Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Montanus de hymno.</note> notes, that the use of this Hymn was an action and rite common and most familiar to all.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Trap</hi> gives also another instance of our <note place="margin">On Mat. 6. 9. Luk. 24. 30.</note> Saviours using a form of thanksgiving, by which, as it is intimated in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> his Disciples knew him. I shall not insist on this, but certainly the <hi>Iews</hi> had forms of blessing their meat and drink; as these usual forms do evince: The blessing of the bread was this, <hi>(Benedictus tu Domine Deus noster Rex Seculi, qui educis panem è terra.)</hi> And <hi>(Benedictus, &amp;c. qui creas fructum vitis.) (. i.) Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King, who dost bring forth bread out of the earth, and blessed, &amp;c. who createst the fruit of the vine.</hi> But enough of this; he that would see more of the former particulars, let him view <hi>Cassander, Morney</hi> of the Mass, <hi>Beza,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> of Liturgies. All my observations do concentre with that of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divine in his book of singing Psalmes, that this opinion is the constant vote of all the learned. And here by the way, that assertion of <hi>Grotius</hi> is sufficiently confuted, <hi>Neque enim eo</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grotius in</hi> Luk. 11. 1.</note>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63641:25"/>
people were not in those dayes confined to words and syllables.</p>
            <p>By what hath been said, it appears that our Saviour was no such enemy to forms, either of prayer or thanksgiving, as those who now profess themselves to be his choice Disciples, are known to be, even to his own form of prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. But I shall make an essay beyond this, to prove that our Saviour in the composure of his prayer had respect unto the devotion &amp; prayers of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> then in use, &amp; was pleased to compose his for marter and method like unto theirs. And that I may allay the prejudice, which this conjecture is like to create, I offer these grounds for it; 1. That our Saviour being to reconcile <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> into one, could not use a better <hi>medium</hi> to winne upon them both, then by injoyning such an uniformity in the chief part of Gods worship, as was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the common good and desires of all mankind in general, and agreeable to the <hi>Iewes</hi> own forms of devotion, (they having been for a long time Gods peculiar people) in special. Nor, 2. is it any disparagement to our Saviour, the eternal Wisdom of the Father, that he did create a prayer as beautiful as the heavens, out of such a Chaos, and gather up those Jewels out of that dunghil wherein they had obscured them, and set them in such a heavenly frame, as nothing out of heaven or the Scriptures (whereof this is <note place="margin">Arias Mont. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula ex Sacris Script. Petita.</note> the summe, as many Divines affirm) is half so perfect: For certainly, they had these petitions out of the Scripture from the Prophets and holy men of God. And Mr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> applies that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63641:25"/>
to the <hi>Talmud</hi> (wherein many of these are) which was said of the works of <hi>Origen, Ubi bene nemo meliùs,</hi> That which is good is very good, and that which is bad is very bad.</p>
            <p>And now remembring you that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did in other parts of Gods worship comply with the accustomed forms of the Jewish Church, it will appear very probable that he did the same in respect of Prayer, both as to the method, and form of it.</p>
            <p>The likeness of Method hath been observed from Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who sayes, that of the eighteen Prayers or Benedictions (called in the <hi>Gemara, composed,</hi> or <hi>appointed Prayers,</hi> and which were for a long time the chief body of their devotion) the three first, and the three last, respected the glory of God, the other twelve those things that were necessary either for the whole people of God, or for every particular man. And whether our Saviour did not design his Prayer, (though not according to the number of their Petitions, yet) to the general method and matter of them, <hi>(vi.)</hi> the three first branches of it, and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (which may serve for three more,) referring to the glory of God, the other intermediate to the publick and private necessities of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is of easie observation.</p>
            <p>Then for the particular Heads and Petitions, they are more obvious; we shall give an instance of each: First, for the Preface, it is commonly known that the <hi>Jewes</hi> did prefix to their Prayers these two letters <gap reason="foreign">

And thus having found both the method and the matter of our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> it onely remaineth, that we answer one Objection or two against our asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That our Saviour in the framing of this most heavenly form, had respect unto the forms of Prayer, then in use among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the grounds of which we have laid already.</p>
            <p>The first Objection is, that these books from which it is supposed, that our Saviour borrowed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> the heads of his Prayer, are of a far later date, then our Saviours time, and therefore, they may more probably be thought to have transcribed something out of the Gospels, then that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the very wisedome of God, should borrow any thing from their devotions.</p>
            <p>To this Objection a satisfactory answer hath <note place="margin">Answ.</note> been given already by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and Master <hi>Thorndike;</hi> to which <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> it may be added, That it is true, the Books themselves are not (some of them) above a thousand, or eleven hundred years old, but yet they do record mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: of a far greater Antiquity; as books printed in this very age may record such rites and forms
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63641:27"/>
as were in use among primitive Christians for more then a thousand years since; so (for instance) in the late Liturgy were the best parts and offices of devotion preserved that had been used by any Church since the Apostle; dayes: And as for the <hi>Mischna,</hi> wherein most of these petitions are extant, it is known to be one part of that <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> which was compiled by <hi>R. Hakkadosh,</hi> who lived in the year of Christ 150. that is 1508. years since; and the Title, and Contents of it is this, <hi>Liber traditionum, qui Patrum traditiones continet, quae inde à</hi> Mose <hi>observatae, &amp; successivè</hi>

               <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Israelitarum, &amp; ex Mischnaioth.</hi> Now if these books prove the antiquity of that form used by our Saviour, they must relate it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63641:28"/>
of fact beyond the time of our Saviour, in the judgement of that learned man. And certainly, the forms and heads of Devotion, used and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by these later <hi>Jewes</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> were the product of more ancienttimes, and were then collected and composed by them, that they might not be lost and forgotten in the dispersion, as they had lost many Customes and Manners, and their very Language, in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. In one of the Petitions above named, they say so much expresly <hi>(dicebant pii priores)</hi> Our pious forefathers were wont to say, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And considering how superstitiously tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous they have ever been of the customes and traditions of their forefathers, retaining and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising in their Synagogues, to this very day, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which their Ancestors practised long before our Saviours time, it cannot reasonably be thought that they did coin any new devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or at least that they did insert any such there; but least of all, would they have stampt upon them the likeness of our Lords Prayer in every Character, as we shall now shew in answer to the second Objection, which is—</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> That possibly the Rabbines, since <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 13.</note> the dayes of our Saviour, may have borrowed some parts and expressions of their Devotion, from our Lords Prayer, and from other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical passages; but that our Saviour, the very wisedome of his Father, should be beholden to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Liturgies, and Forms for his Devotion, is not with any reason to be imagined.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Answer.</hi> This Objection is made some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unadvisedly; for if it were true that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63641:28"/>
               <hi>Jewes</hi> did insert these Petitions into their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from our Saviours Prayer, it would be a sad consideration that the <hi>Jewes</hi> should shew more respect and observance to the prescriptions of our Saviour, then such as would be accounted the most excellent Christians.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It hath been already proved beyond all contradiction, that our Saviour was pleased to practise and retain divers <hi>Jewish</hi> forms, and adapted them to the Ministerie of the Gospel, and commended them to his Disciples in the principal service of God; and therefore there is sufficient ground to assert, that he did the same in this business of devotion. But on the contrary there will be but rare instances given, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> did make use of any new Rite, Institution, Doctrine or History which is proper to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, in those ancient Records of theirs, so as to use or approve the same, and therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that they had any respect to this Prayer in their Devotions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is yet more incredible that the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who abhor the very name of Christ, and make many solemn, publick imprecations against him and all his followers, should transcribe any thing of his, into their Devotion, much less that every Petition of our Saviours Prayer should find <note place="margin">Part 4. Chap. 9. See <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfs Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blioth. Rab.</hi>
               </note> place in theirs; for in the very <hi>Talmud,</hi> one Chapter is intitled <hi>De Idololatriâ, ac vitanda omni conversatione &amp; societate cum Christianis.</hi> Of Idolatrie, and of avoyding all manner of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie and conversation with the Christians: And <hi>Buxtorf</hi> saith of them, <hi>In secretissimis corum</hi>

               <hi>libris scribunt &amp; docent quòd anima Esaui corpus</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63641:29"/>
               <hi>Christi subingressa est;</hi> They call Christians <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> and <hi>Esauites:</hi> and <hi>in exemplaribus vetustis,</hi> saith he, they have sundry forms of imprecation against Christians, of which take this one: Let them be destroyed and have no more hope, and let all the Infidels (they mean Christians especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) perish in the twinkling of an eye, and all thy enemies which have hated thee, O Lord our God, be suddenly rooted out, and that proud and presumptuous Kingdome be quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and at last come to a totall ruine; and make them without delay subservient to us in these our dayes. That the Turks should record some of our Saviours sentences is not strange, seeing they account him to have been a Prophet, and I have read, that among their devotions they have a Prayer which they call the Prayer of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> which differs little from ours, onely it ends thus; <hi>And let not him have rule over me that will have no mercy upon me, O thou most High.</hi> But that the <hi>Jewes</hi> who hate and nauseate every thing that hath the least sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Christianitie, <hi>eo nomine</hi> as it is Christian, should insert this most Christian Prayer, in its full latitude, into their prayers, is certainly a vain imagination.</p>
            <p>Yet, as you see, both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, (though not as Christian) both the form and matter of this Prayer; where then are the enemies of it, if they be friends? Alas! in Christs own house, among them for whose sake chiefly it was written, and unto whom it was not onely commended as a priviledge, but commanded as a duty, among Christs own
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63641:29"/>

            <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> deals more roundly with him, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adv.

Thus did Christ teach his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that they should constantly at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Body say <hi>Our Father;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they desire that the name of God, which is most holy in it self, may be sanctified in them: but thou sayest, Lord, thou knowest how holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and pure my hands are: They say, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> antedating the hope of Christs Kingdome that was to come; that he reigning, sin might not reign in their mortal bodies: They say, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> that humane weakness might imitate the Angels. Thou saist a man may, if he will be free from all sin. They say, <hi>Give us, &amp;c.</hi> praying for that supersubstantial bread, that they might be fit to receive the body of Christ: And ye by supererrogatory holiness, and a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent righteousness, boldly challenge heavenly gifts. They (as it follows) <hi>For give us,</hi> &amp;c. coming from the Font of Baptisme, and being regenerate through the Lord our Saviour, presently at the first communion of Christs body: They say, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us,</hi> &amp;c. not in a feigned pretence of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but in consciousness of their humane weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:

They say, <hi>Lead us not,</hi> &amp;c. Thou saist (with <hi>Jovinian)</hi> that they who have by Faith received Baptisme, cannot be tempted, or sin any more: Lastly, They say, <hi>Deliver us,</hi> &amp;c. Why do they pray for that which they have in the power of their own freewill? This is the Leader, and these the grounds of his defiance against the <hi>Lords Prayer, (viz.)</hi> that he might raise his errors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruine of it. And whether heretiques in our dayes have not served themselves, and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their errors both in Doctrine and Practise, by the disuse of it, ought by all sober Christians to be considered and laid to heart.</p>
            <p>The Papists are marshalled in the next rank as enemies to this Prayer; and that first for locking up the whole Prayer from the people, under an unknown language, and giving them onely the shell to chew upon; their affections and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings being unmoved and silent, while their lips and tongues are busie.</p>

And when our Saviour tells us, that <hi>He that is not with him is against him,</hi> there are many more that are not so fast <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 30.</note> friends unto this Prayer as they ought to be; for it is not enough to call him Lord and Master, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we also do the things that he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us: we profess to worship him in Prayers and Supplications of our own devising; and these things indeed we ought to doe, but then we should be sure not to leave the other undone, that is, to worship and invocate him in the same manner and form as he hath prescribed in his Word. It may suffice to have offered these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, from the occasion and context, of which this is a Sylloge:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Forms of Prayer were in use among the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Doctors did ordinarily compose prayers to be used by their Disciples.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> at first a <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctor, upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63641:31"/>
new emergencies taught his Disciples a new form.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Disciples so used that form, as that they were thereby observed and known to be <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon this consideration the Disciples of our Saviour desired from him such a forme of Prayer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Saviour, who was no enemy to forms in general, nor to the forms of Prayer then used by the <hi>Iews</hi> in particular, did, agreeably to them, compose for his Disciples a certain form to be used by them, delivering it to them at two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and on divers occasions; but on both these with a plain injunction, <hi>Thus pray ye,</hi> and, <hi>when we pay,</hi> say, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It comes now to be considered, whether the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 15.</note> terms under which our Saviour injoyns it do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount to the nature of a Precept, so as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Christians to the use of this Prayer in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words, and as a form; and this, supposing it had not been twice delivered, nor on such an occasion as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates: And in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we have the import of two words in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> to be considered, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And here I must remember you, that our Saviour having reproved the tedious repetitions of heathnish forms, passeth on to a most excellent form of his own, and injoyns it with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Thus pray ye:</hi> Which word is in all languages used to signifie an identity and individuality with the thing to which it hath reference; as when I endite to any, and bid him write thus or thus, I intend he should write the same words; and so
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63641:32"/>
doubtless, when Christ commanded his Disciples to pray, <hi>Thus:</hi> he meant in the same words. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when we deal in similitudes, and make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by this word <hi>Thus,</hi> or <hi>So,</hi> there is onely a likeness to be understood: but in all Problemes, and School-Disputes, in all quotations and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, it is used to signifie the same thing in terms to which it is annexed. Thus when in the Philosopher we reade <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and when we repeat Syllogismes, with a <hi>sic disputas,</hi> we do or ought to respect the very terms: and thus a good Grammarian tells <note place="margin">

Thus when <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons were commanded, <hi>On this wise ye shall bless the people,</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">

If you or I should command a servant to deliver a message to a superior, and put words in his mouth, in oyning him to say thus, or if you will, after this manner; I trow we think so well of our own expressions, and know our own case, and the qualitie of the person to whom we send so well, that we should censure that servant as guilty of high presumption, who should purt osely lay aside all our expressions, which he might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well have remembred, and deliver our mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in words of his own framing; nor are such servants like to mend the matter: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is every where obvious in Scripture, that the messengers of great and holy men, Kings and Prophets, have delivered their Embassie in the same words they received it; and it would have been an act of disobedience, and an argument of pride, to have altered matter, method and form; and yet this is done to our Saviours injunction, by all those who neither say this, nor thus. When God sent <hi>Moses</hi> to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> he commanded him, <hi>Thus shalt thou say unto the</hi>

               <hi>children of Israel;</hi> and the Text sayes, Moses <hi>told</hi> Aaron <hi>all the words, and</hi> Aaron <hi>spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto</hi> Moses. So in the New Testament, when our Saviour sent two of his Disciples to bring him a Colt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Disciples, in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> to <hi>teach them to pray</hi> as <hi>John</hi> taught his Disciples, respecting <hi>the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and form</hi> as well <hi>as the matter;</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in compliance with their desires; gives them <hi>a complete form,</hi> and plainly injoyns them without a <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>after this manner,</hi> although that be plain enough too, to say, (1.) <hi>totident ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> in express words, <hi>Our Father:</hi> I must needs say, saith judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> that the Opinion of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hookers</hi> Polity.</note> some, who affirm that our Saviour did set his Disciples a bare example to contrive and devise <hi>Prayers</hi> of their own, and no way bind them to use his, is undoubtedly an error. And Master <hi>Perkins</hi> is not far from his opinion; Whereas, faith <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Lords Prayer.</note> he, sundry men in our Church, hold it unlawful to use <hi>this very form of words,</hi> as they are set down by our Saviour Christ <hi>for a Prayer;</hi> they are far deceived: and in answer to a third Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is, <hi>That the pattern to make all Prayers by, should not be used as a Prayer:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, sayes Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> that therefore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be used as <hi>a Prayer;</hi> and sure it is, that ancient and worthy Divines have reverenced it <hi>as a Prayer,</hi> choosing rather to use these words then any other; as <hi>Cyprian, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> wherefore, saith he, that opinion is full of ignorance and error: And I may adde, if the opinion be full the practice cannot be empty.</p>
            <p>And indeed, as Master <hi>Mede</hi> and Master <hi>Hodges</hi> say, what more significant expression, supposing it had been our Saviours mind to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn it as a <hi>form,</hi> could be fitted or contrived to intimate it to his Disciples then this, <hi>when ye pray, say, &amp;c.</hi> Or had our Saviour foreseen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63641:34"/>
that would arise in these last dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the use of it (and doubtless he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see them all) how could he more positively have decided them then by this plain expression, <hi>when ye pray, say?</hi> Suppose this had been the sense of the Disciples in this place asking a <hi>Prayer,</hi> as some learned men conceive it was, <hi>Lord, thou gavest us a Prayer in the Mount,</hi> but whether that was intended for publick use or no, we are not fully satisfied; wherefore now we beseech thee teach us such a one as <hi>John</hi> also taught his Disciples; what more punctual answer could be devised then this, <hi>when ye pray, say, &amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as dissent from this opinion and practice, finding themselves overborn by the weight of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 19.</note> this expression in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> are wont to retreat to that of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> by whom they plead Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ought to be expounded; to which if we should give way, as it would not much help them, (that fortress having declared already for the contrary opinion;) so I doubt not but we may easily block up all avenues to that refuge, and evince by sufficient Arguments, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> should rather expound Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> then be expounded by him.</p>
            <p>For seeing it is true, as many learned men do <note place="margin">Chemnitius Luc. Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;c. Mede.</note> affirm, that our Saviour did twice deliver this <hi>form,</hi> and the Disciples not fully apprehending it at first to be intended for publick use, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats the same <hi>form</hi> a second time under a more plain injunction; this signifieth he intended it so in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and his second injunction is but a more solemn sanction of it as a <hi>form</hi> for publick use; and that it was twice delivered ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63641:35"/>
partly from what Master <hi>Mede</hi> saith; that it is impossible to make these two relations of the Evangelists to be coincident for time; and the different occasion heightens the impossibility: <hi>Marlorate</hi> makes this of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> to agree with another passage of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chapter 14. 23. where our Saviour is said <hi>to go into a Mountain apart to pray;</hi> and so here in Saint <hi>Luke, He prayed,</hi> and that alone or apart; so that the coincidency of these two places is far more probable then the other: For this <hi>Prayer</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> was delivered in the first year, saith <hi>Chemnitius;</hi> in the second year of our Saviours Ministery, saith Master <hi>Mede,</hi> this of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the third year; in all probabilitie there was more then the distance of a compleat year; whereas by the general consent of Harmonists that of the 14. of <hi>Mat.</hi> is much more coincident in time, and the occasion seems one and the same; onely Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> having recorded <hi>this Prayer</hi> before, passeth it by here; and Saint <hi>Luke</hi> omitting it in the Sermon on the mount, where Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> had recorded it, repeats it here, where Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> had omitted it: for all know that is the usual manner of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists, as to repeat that more briefly which the former had enlarged, so to inlarge that more fully which the other did but touch, or preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; which double Sanction as it is a good Argument to prove that Christ intended it for a <hi>form,</hi> so it doth also strongly infer that which I intend, that the injunction in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> is the most express and plain; unless we should affirm that our Saviour did make things more perplext
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63641:35"/>
and obscure by his often repetition of them: and being most express and plain, it ought certainly to expound that which is more dark and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unless, contrary to the Rules of all good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, we will teach <hi>ignotum per ignotius,</hi> which is as to make the blind lead the lame. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Expositors do grant, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> is most exact in the orderly disposing of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their time, and relating their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will still follow (although we should grant the places of both Evangelists to be for time coincident) that Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth the occasion more fully, and the injunction more plainly, ought to expound Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and not to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; and so we see Saint <hi>Matthewes sic</hi> hath its <hi>sicut</hi> in Saint <hi>Luke, After this manner pray ye,</hi> is of the same force, as, <hi>when ye pray say, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtless our Saviour could express his mind <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 20.</note> so appositely, and foresee all inconveniences so clearly, that had it been his mind that his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples should not have used this <hi>Prayer as a form,</hi> or that their successors should offend in so doing, he would have propounded it with some caution or limitation; either he would not have made it <hi>a form,</hi> or being such, he would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it unto them under such an apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, as <hi>when ye pray, say, &amp;c.</hi> (which sounds quite contrary to such an intent) for in this sense it hath been understood, and accordingly practised by the Church in all Ages; and any vulgar eye that vieweth the whole structure may observe that it was fitted by our Saviour for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63641:36"/>
Devotion, to be used by his Disciples in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, and to serve as a note of distinction to such as heard them whose Disciples they were. And Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> Paraphrase most genuinely agrees with the Text: One of his Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him to give them <hi>a form of Prayer</hi> which they might constantly use, as <hi>John Baptist</hi> had given to his Disciples; and upon that demand of his, being at another time, and upon another occasion from that in the Sermon on the Mount, Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever ye pray solemnly omit not to use this form</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> 
               <hi>of words.</hi> For if Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Disciples did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly <hi>use the form of Prayer</hi> given them by their Master; and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be as much as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>si quando,</hi> if at any time <hi>ye will pray,</hi> so as to be known that ye are my Disciples; what can this signifie less then, when ye pray solemly omit not to use this form of words?</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Hodges</hi> his Argument hath also its <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 21.</note> weight, and may be improved thus; Suppose the Disciples had asked, Master, teach us to sing as <hi>David</hi> taught the people of God; or, which is the same, teach us to <hi>pray,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> taught the People of God, (for he taught them <hi>Psalmes of Prayer</hi> as well as <hi>Praise,</hi> and hereupon our Saviour had composed some <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> I demand, whether we should not have been obliged to use those <hi>Hymnes</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> although there had been no injunction annexed to them: And doubtless, as the people of God under the Old Testament, and we under the New, ought to use <hi>Davids Hymnes</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> as an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63641:36"/>
Ordinance of God in his publick Worship; so ought we more especially, and at least as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to use this most solemn and Divine <hi>form of Prayer.</hi> And thus of the Arguments from the words of injunction, whereof this is a Sylloge:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The injunction of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear to all unprejudiced persons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> delivered a second time, and on a different occasion, hath yet (as the dissenters grant) a more clear command; by which</p>
            <p n="3">3. That of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> (if there had been any difficulty in it) ought to be interpreted.</p>

            <p>And fifthly, had our Saviour intended it onely as a Pattern or heads for <hi>Prayer,</hi> or foreseen any inconvenience in the use of it as a <hi>form,</hi> he would never have commended it under such words, as in the judgement of the Church, and eminent servants of God in all ages, hath the full import of a positive injunction, <hi>When ye pray, say.</hi>

And although it be no where in Scripture set down positively, that the Apostles did use this form of words, as neither that they did use the same method or matter; yet this being but a negative argument, concludes no more that they did not use this <hi>form of Prayer,</hi> then, because we read not that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63641:37"/>
they baptized any <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> therefore they did not so baptize any; which form was yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by our Saviour, as a prime Office of their Ministery, and beyond all peradventure they did strictly observe as oft as they baptized any. And when the Scripture assures us, that it was their practice to use <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual songs,</hi> praysing God, and praying unto him in the words of <hi>David,</hi> when they did keep to the same prescibed words in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Sacraments, when they observed <hi>forms</hi> in the benediction of the people, in the close of their Epistles, and in other solemn Acts of Gods worship; (all of which <hi>forms</hi> were not so authentick as to be of our Saviours own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure and prescription) what should hinder but that they might and did use this most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>form of Prayer</hi> in their devotion? Most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that they who retain a form of Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the people when they dismiss them, and of administration of both Sacraments, have no more to say in their defence, then they who retain and use this <hi>form of Prayer;</hi> for Christ who gave commission to his Disciples to go and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline all Nations, <hi>baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. He that said, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body,</hi> &amp;c. the same commanded also as positively, <hi>when ye pray, say,</hi> &amp;c. And when we all account it our duty to praise God in singing <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> some of which, as we use them, are of a mean composure, and carry expressions beneath the Majesty of Scripture; others, such as concerned the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church onely; why ought not the Apostles, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63641:37"/>
we as necessarily, to use <hi>this form of Prayer,</hi> san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by our Saviours own lips? Can we chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably think they asked a <hi>Prayer,</hi> in sense of their own insufficiency for that duty, and such a one as by the use thereof they might be known to be his Disciples, and when they obtained one so heavenly, so succinct, and yet so significant, and injoyned under such plain terms, yet did refuse or neglect to use it? doubtless, they did bestow some time to commit it to memory, they did often con it and meditate upon it; and when they repeated it, I suppose it was not without some affection, devotion, and lifting up their souls to God; and if so, they did use it as a <hi>form of Prayer.</hi>

Again, we know that when we recite the Lords Prayer we injoy a great priviledge, seeing that he who taught us sits in heaven the Master of our requests; who also presents our prayers, and intercedes for us: <hi>Cum primis verò illud notatu dignum est</hi> (as he saith) This especially ought to be observed, That when Christ in the first year of his Ministery had taught his Disciples how to pray; and here again, being desired to teach them to pray, taught no new form, but repeated the old; it shewes, we should not be troubled every day about new forms, nor that our prayers are therefore unacceptable, (other requisites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing observed) because we repeat the same form; for (as he quoteth from St. <hi>Augustine) All the prayers of the Saints are nothing else but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>inlarged, and in it is comprised the marrow of all the prayers of the old Testament; and hence</hi> (saith he) <hi>the word (Collect) is used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a prayer, this prayer being a collection of all good prayers that ever were made in the world.</hi>

                  <hi>Pareus</hi> on Matth. 6.</note> defended it: <hi>Seeing</hi> (saith he) <hi>this prayer is read in two different places, it is made a question whether it was twice delivered; and I see nothing to the contrary but it was prescribed twice, once in the mount to the Disciples and people, another time to the Disciples alone: to which opinion the different occasions in</hi> Matthew <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me; for it seems the Disciple who in</hi> Luke <hi>demanded a prayer, was not present at the Sermon on the Mount, or the form first given was forgotten; for the Disciples were ignorant,</hi> sua ruditate, <hi>for their dulness, of some things which were twice or thrice delivered to them. Then it may be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (saith he,) <hi>whether our Saviour did so strictly oblige us to this form and words, as that we may not use any other:</hi> thish e deservedly denieth, (using St. <hi>Augustines</hi> distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> we may pray <hi>aliter,</hi> or <hi>aliis verbis,</hi> in other forms, and words, but we cannot pray for <hi>aliud,</hi> any other thing then what is included in these words) but yet he saith, <hi>both to publick and private prayers we doe rightly adde this form, as a seal of them.</hi> For which he gives these reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we may obey the command of the Sonne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> his Reasons for using our Lords Prayer in publick &amp; private.</note> 
               <hi>Because it may not be doubted, but these words of prayer are most acceptable to our heavenly Father; for the Father ever heareth the Sonne, therefore he will hear the Sons words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Because it most succinctly contains a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sum of all things desireable, so that in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever particular our own prayers have been defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, this form will make a supply.</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:63641:42"/>
4. <hi>This prayer is granted as an incouragement to those who are yet more slow and ignorant, that the Sonne of God hath instructed them how to the prayers of the Church they should joyn their own, in this short form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pareus;</hi> and our Assembly in their works have done worthily on this behalf: In their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme they have this question, <hi>How is the Lords prayer to be used?</hi> The answer is, <hi>The Lords prayer is not onely for direction, as a pattern according to which we are to make our prayers, but may also be used as a prayer, so that it be done with understanding, reverence, faith, and other gifts necessary to the right performance of the duty of prayer.</hi> More fully yet in their Directory; <hi>The prayer which Christ taught his Disciples, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a pattern of prayer, but it self a most compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive prayer: Therefore we recommend it to be used in the prayers of the Church.</hi> And above and beyond this is that which is delivered by them in the large Annotations: <hi>This is a true summe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">On Matt. 6 9.</note> 
               <hi>and forme of all Christian prayer, set down both in precept and practice.</hi> And on Luke 11. 2. <hi>When ye pray; Compare</hi> (say they) Matthew 6. 9. <hi>and the circumstances shew, that Christ did twice at least teach them the very form of prayer; and hence it appeareth, that as this is the most absolute and compleat pattern of prayer, comprehending all that we must aske; so is it the most exact and sacred form of prayer,</hi> indited and taught his Disciples (who were to teach the whole world the rules and practice of true Religion) by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who is best able to teach his Disciples to pray.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63641:43"/>
Again, on the word <hi>(Say) Christ prescribed this form of prayer to his Disciples to be used by them, not rejecting others which his spirit taught, or teacheth;</hi> (That is, as I suppose, other formes, which the Spirit did, or might teach) <hi>but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge all necessary petitions into this one summe.</hi> Thus that grave Assembly. And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> 
               <note place="margin">View of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, p. 28.</note> tells us, he heard one of the gravest members of it, being asked concerning the use of the Lords Prayer, to answer thus; <hi>God forbid I should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be upon my knees in prayer, and rise up without adding Christs form to my imperfect petitions.</hi> So that even they who reject other forms of prayer, think it fit to retain this. And what pity is it when the General Assembly teach it so well to others, any particular members should make it a castaway in their own practice?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotations say thus: <hi>Order all</hi>

            <p>Here are Champions sufficient; and yet to these we might call in, if need were, (and those no forreign forces neither) the votes of all those National Churches, and famous Persons, which have both practised and pleaded for, not this form onely, but the use of other forms of far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour rank; and I have not yet heard or seen their Arguments or practice disproved by any. The <hi>Albingenses, Waldenses, Lutherans</hi> generally, the Protestants of <hi>France, Denmarke, Swethland, Helvetia,</hi> both <hi>Germanies, Geneva</hi> and <hi>Francke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; Wickliff, Hus, Luther, Melanchton, Calvine, Bucer, Phagius, Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Hooper, Taylor,</hi> (almost an army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;) <hi>Fox,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Reynolds, Burges, Greenham, Baines, Hildersham, Perkins, Preston, Ball, Sibi, Dod,</hi> with many others: all which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly the Luminaries of their several Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have given light to the lawfulness, and consent &amp; liking to the use of forms in general, and much more of this in particular. For if forms of prayer have been approved by all these, then questionless this which is the rule and standard of all, (and is disliked chiefly, if not only, for its being a form) was approved above all.</p>
            <p>And if its being a form, or our using it as such, be a fault, both these may be charged on our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <note place="margin">

professed enemies to what our Saviour declared himself so much a friend, (especially if we consider how much the formes used by him were beneath that which he commanded us) I fear a satisfactory reason can be scarcely given. Nay, when we doe the same thing in other parts of Gods Worship, why should we disallow our selves in this? The Scriptures which we read are formes; There are formes of Doctrine, and formes of wholesome words, formes of praysing God, and praying unto him in the words of <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Deborah, David, Solomon, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. and when we may and ought to bless and praise God in some of these forms, why ought we not also to pray unto God in this? It seems forms are lawful in our praises, in the administration of both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in our benedictions, yea and our excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications too, onely in our prayers they are not so. And is not this greatly to be wondred at, that in our Generation men should so much dote upon, and contend for petty forms of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which till of late dayes were never fancied to be either in the Scriptures of God, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of his Church; for which notwithstanding the veil of the Temple, yea the very bowels of the Church, are rent, and Christ himself seems to be crucified afresh; when this form, so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively prescribed in Scripture, so universally practised by the Church in all ages, is most unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly and unworthily exploded?</p>
            <p>Our Saviours own practice was a sufficient warrant for the Primitive Church to compose and make use of forms of Prayer in the publick

worship of God; and that promise of his (which also implies a precept) was a firm ground of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their faith and hope of obtaining a blessing on them: <hi>I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall</hi>

               <hi>con,</hi> for Prayer by form, and without form, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That generally it is both lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to prepare our selves, as for the gift in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, so for every particular Act of it, by preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, if we have leisure for it, both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, order, and words; for though it be a gift of the Spirit, yet it is not to be expected that it should suddenly be infused into us without any premeditation of our own, no more then the gift of preaching, for which the ablest Ministers are bound to prepare themselves with diligence and study; there being not any ground for a man to expect more immediate supplies from above in the duty of Prayer, then in that of preaching. And page 15. Because there will be sometime a necessity that our affections should follow, and be stirred up by our expressions, (which is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be aimed at when we pray in publick, in reference to those that joyn with us, and will very often fall out likewise in our secret devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) therefore it is requisite that a man should be alwayes furnished with such premeditated forms as may be most effectual to this end, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to excite the affections; and to this purpose, if those heads which will be alwaies pertinent, and of continual necessity, were comprehended in some set forms, studied with care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they might perhaps be more serviceable for the stirring up our faith and affections, then they could otherwise be, if they did proceed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from our own sudden conceptions: and page 17. Such crude notions, and confused matter, as some by their neglect in this kind will vent, doth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63641:47"/>
rather nauseate, and flat the devotion, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it: page 18. There is nothing more unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the solemnity of this duty, to that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which we owe to the Divine Majesty, then to be speak him in a loose, careless, empty manner.</p>

            </p>
            <p>He answers; When men may use the common means, it is a great presumption to depend upon extraordinary helps, such as were there promised to assist them in special services.

The matter o fact, and the constant use of them in the Church hath been sufficiently testified already from those ancient Liturgies before named; many of which, though (as all Protestants grant) have been lamentably adulterated by the additions and alterations of late Sophisters, doe yet retain manifest impressions of antiquity; so that though it may be disputed concerning them, as about <hi>Theseus</hi> his ship at <hi>Athens,</hi> whether it were the same ship or not, every part almost being changed, yet it was granted, that such a ship there had once been; Even so certain it is, there were Liturgies in those Primitive times, though

we cannot affirm of any one Liturgy now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us under those Apostolical names, that it is compleatly the same as it was of old. <hi>Rivet</hi> indeed reckoneth those Liturgies among <hi>zizania,</hi> or <hi>tares which were sowne by the enemy while the husbandmen slept:</hi> but certainly the husbandman had sown good seed in those fields, though the enemy tooke the advantage of sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suddenly after them; the foundation was good, though ungodly men <hi>built hay and stubble on it.</hi>

            <p>The chief Objection against the use of forms of Prayer is for ever silenced by Doctor <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection is this; That in stinted Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. <hi>Object.</hi> Saints dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, p. 81.</note> the Spirit is straitned; when a man is tied to a form, then he shall have his Spirit as it were bounded and limited, that he cannot go beyond that which is prescribed; and therefore (say they) it is reason a man should be left to more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, (as he is in conceived Prayer) and not tied to a strict form.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, (saith he) that even those <note place="margin">Answ.</note> men that are against this, and that use this reason,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63641:48"/>
they do the same thing dayly in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for when another prayes that is a set form to him that hears it; I say it is a set form; for put the case that he which is the hearer, and doth attend another praying, suppose that his spirit be more inlarged, it is a straitning of him, he hath no more liberty to go out, he is bound to keep his mind intent upon that which the other prayeth; and therefore if that were a sufficient reason that a man might not use a set form, because the spirit is straitned, a man should not hear another pray, (though it be a conceived Prayer) because in that case his spirit is limited; it may be that the hearer hath a larger heart a great deal then he that speaks and prayes, so that there is a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, straitning and limiting of the Spirit to him; and therefore that reason cannot be good. So far that pious Doctor.</p>
            <p>And if his reason be good, it will follow, That the Church doth no more quench or limit the Spirit, in prescribing a form to the Ministers, then they doe quench or limit the Spirit in the people, whom they from time to time doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine unto those forms which they do presently conceive and utter among them. And as the spirit of the people is in this respect subject to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 32.</note> the Prophets, so the spirit of the Prophets <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim,</hi> severally, is subject to the Prophets <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,</hi> joyntly.</p>
            <p>That which is objected by some against the use of forms, from 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 14. 15. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> is not at all understood by the Objectors: <hi>Calvine</hi> sayes, <note place="margin">

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:63641:49"/>
By the word <hi>Spirit</hi> that extraordinary gift of tongues is to be understood. And <hi>Beza,</hi> on <hi>Orabo spiritu, (i.)</hi> saith he, <hi>linguâ perogrinâ quam mihi dictat Spiritus:</hi> I will pray in the spirit is no more then this, I will pray in a strange tongue, as the Spirit shall dictate to me; and so on verse 16. <hi>When thou shalt bless with the spirit</hi> (i.) <hi>in a strange tongue, how shall he,</hi> &amp;c. Or if this place could possibly be understood of extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary effusions in Prayer, they were extraordinary ones, wherein the Spirit dictated words as well as matter; and such as cannot now be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
            <p>But lastly, if by that Scripture praying in the spirit excludes forms of Prayer, then by Verse 15. singing in the spirit excludes forms of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and so we should bring in extemporarie Psalmes too, and then I fear we should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress that of our Apostle, verse 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> According to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment (<gap reason="foreign">

And I make no question but Ministers may and ought on new occasions to adde and alter many Petitions, and after long experience and practice in private, may exercise those gifts of Prayer which God hath given them, in publick; but yet if the occasion may be fore-known, if it do not surprize him too suddenly, no question but by study and deliberation he may better comply with it, and excite the peoples affections more then he can in an extemporarie manner: And when in the main, both the matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Prayer (as Invocation, Confession, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, Intercession and Thanksgiving) are still the same, there can be, as no sure sign of grace in varying the words, so) no just cause of rash cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in retaining and using the same; for since we pray to the same God, in the Name of the same Mediator, profess our belief in the same truths, feel the same wants, and fear the same evils, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, (and all these are in a great measure common to all) we may as well medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and prepare in what words, a in what sense, and in what manner we ought to come before the Majesty of God, as for what end; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wholesome words deliberately fitted, (by one or more judicious and experienced Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) to the capacities and understanding of the hearers, are soonest received into their hearts, and have a greater influence upon the affections, to raise them, and lift them up to God in Prayer, then any other.</p>
            <p>But enough of these premisses; The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is this: If both publick and private forms be lawful and expedient, as both the practice of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63641:50"/>
Church, and the judgement of men famous for Learning and Piety do assert, surely then there cannot be any fault (on the account of its being a form) justly imputed to our Lords Prayer, or which may justifie the disuse of it.</p>
            <p>For, let all the Arguments that are brought in defence of other forms (as for singing Psalmes, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 31.</note> administration of the Sacraments, blessing the people) be all summed up, and each of them may be easily and highly improved for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full use of this form: I shall give you (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) a view of these Arguments that are urged by a Reverend and judicious Divine for singing Psalmes; and every one may perceive how fitly they may be accommodated to the use of our <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If singing of Psalmes in <hi>Davids</hi> forms (in which are many <hi>Prayers)</hi> be a Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, so is praying unto God in our Saviour form.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there be no reason why our conceived Psalmes should thrust out <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any reason why our conceived <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> should thrust out our Saviours <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If upon concession that we must sing Psalmes, <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes will carrie it (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no art or spirit of man that can come near that of <hi>David:)</hi> Then also upon concession that we must <hi>pray, Christs Prayer</hi> will carrie it; there being no art or spirit of man that can come near that of Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If none dare deny but that the Levites had the assistance of the Spirit, when they praised God in the words of <hi>David;</hi> then neither can any denie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63641:50"/>

            <p n="5">5. Are <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes to be sung, because they suit with all occasions of the people of God, as well, or better then any songs composed by an ordinarie gift? for the same reason ought our Saviours <hi>Prayer</hi> to be used, it being fitted to the necessities of the people of God in all ages, in all conditions, and for all just desires.

            <p>When thou comest to God to present thy <hi>prayers</hi> in the Congregation, the Minister ufeth his own words, to express his own conceptions, and confines himself sometime to one or two particular heads of <hi>Prayer,</hi> so as thou maist not meet with any expressions that may signifie thy desires, which therefore may languish, and never ascend up to the Throne of Grace; but <hi>our Lords Prayer</hi> hath this certain advantage above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it is accommodated to all persons, things, times and places, and to all sorts and conditions of people; <hi>Capi potest</hi> (as <hi>Alsteed,)</hi>

Church, and to have the united aid of the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of all Gods people: and what a comfort is it, what an incouragement to pray in faith, when we know all the people of God agree with us, (and there is a promise to two or three) to aske <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 19.</note> the same things, in one and the same effectual <hi>Prayer;</hi> compassing the Throne of Grace with many hands and eies, but with one heart and lip, as if they would <hi>offer violence to the Kingdome of</hi>

            <p>Let us view this Canaan in a Map, and we shall find it to be full of all perfections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Preface; what term of invocation gives better incouragement then <hi>(Father?)</hi> what works greater reverence then <hi>(Heaven?)</hi> what can raise the soul to a higher plerophorie of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63641:52"/>
of faith, then when Christ that made the God of Heaven to become <hi>our Father,</hi> bids us also call him <hi>ours?</hi> Then for the matter and method of all the Petitions, which accord like Beautie and Bands, they are equally admirable: In them we <note place="margin">Zach. 11. 7.</note> ask, first, that which is the principal end of our being, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods glorie in the first Petition; then the subordinate, our own salvation in the second Petition: and thirdly, the things conducing to both ends, either principal, as Sanctification, in the third; or secondary, as sustentation of life in the fourth Petition: and lastly, the removing of impediments, all our former sins in the fifth: and all occasions of offending for the present, or the time to come, in the last Petition: and so we conclude all in a <hi>Hymne of praise,</hi> which doth no less incourage us to expect, then it doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods Power to grant, the things <hi>prayed for;</hi> to all which things there is no Christian but will say, <hi>Amen, so be it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus there is nothing intrinsecal, as to the matter or method, that may make us offended at it; it must be in the form therefore, or not at all.</p>
            <p>But first, S. <hi>Paul</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends a form of wholesome words, and approves the observation of it: And <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1 13.</note> when our Saviour did not onely make it a forme in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> but use it as such, in St. <hi>Luke;</hi> and having fitted it for publick Devotion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it to his Disciples, it is an invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the use of a form, <hi>quà talis,</hi> is not offensive to God or man; we may safely follow that Lambe whereever he leads us.</p>
            <p>In the next place therefore they must be some
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63641:53"/>
extrinsecal arguments that have perswaded to this omission; But if it appear (as I hope it doth) to be a Precept of Christ, when we pray, <hi>to say, Our Father,</hi> let the motive that prevailed with us be what it will be, it can never excuse us; for as we may doe no evil that any good may come of it, so neither may we constantly omit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good dutie that is prescribed, on pretence that it may occasion evil. <hi>Si de veritate scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum sumatur, melius est ut scandalum oriutur quàm ut verìtas relinquatur,</hi> saith <hi>Gregory.</hi> If <note place="margin">

Sin gets strength, and takes advantage by the Commandements of the Law, and sometimes the corruption of mans heart is inraged and heightned by the preaching of the Gospel; yet notwithstanding these and many more offences taken by wicked men, we must preach both the Law and the Gospel too; though it prove a stone of stumbling, and a savour of death to some, yet it is the savour of life and salvation unto others. Suppose then this form be abused to ill purposes by some, and (as is said) occasioneth formalitie in others; yet they that know it to be their dutie, and have grace to use it better, may not neglect it upon that pretence: certain it is, our good use of it will more benefit them, then their abuse of it can prejudice us; and we know, as the Civilians teach, <hi>nulla est obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio ad illicita,</hi> there can be no obligation laid on us to doe what is forbidden, or to leave undone what is required by Law, both these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>illicita,</hi> unlawful.</p>

            <p>And should we give it but <hi>Lidford</hi> Law, and sit in judgement after Execution, to hear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment and evidences produced against it; and after the general neglect of it, I should aske the same question as the Governour did in behalf of its Maker, <hi>what evil hath it done?</hi> and upon <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 23.</note> hearing, no evil, but a great good hath appeared in the use of it; and contrary, no good, but a great deal of evil, by the omission; and after this the multitude should continue and heighten their clamours against it, and those who have been chiefly faulty herein should instead of washing their hands, or acknowledging that they have sinned in denying this most excellent use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Prayer,</hi> say still, <hi>the guilt be upon us and upon our children;</hi> there is just ground of suspition given that they have not that Christian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and pious affection to the things of Christ, as they ought to have that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves his Disciples.</p>
            <p>And now if (as I have heard since I first <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 35.</note> thought on this subject) any mans blood and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63641:54"/>
passion, shall be troubled by the view of these considerations (as natural concupiscence is often excited by the Law, which seeks to restrain it) so as that they do sound a trumpet, and bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, and make parties against such as in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to an apparent command of Christ shall continue or reassume this practice, let them know that they do not deal with others (whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences may be as tender as their own,) as they themselves would be dealt with; and it will but little extenuate their sin that do oppose the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any Ordinance of Jesus Christ, though they should be perswaded that therein they doe God good service; and as surely as it was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and in obedience to our Saviours in jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction practised by the people of God in former ages, so it cannot be omitted, much less opposed, by any among us, without great suspition of pride and disobedience: But this by way of caution; I go on to argue the case in hand.</p>
            <p>And in the next place, It is a thing impossible <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 36.</note> for any rational man to conceive, that when our Saviour bid his Disciples, when they pray, <hi>to say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. that it should be his sense and intent, that we ought not to say so, or that we should doe amiss in so doing. Had there been any danger in using of it, our Saviour, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw all possible inconveniences and offences, and bid us especially to <hi>pray</hi> that we might not be led into temptation, would not have brought us to a precipice, or, as Satan carried him upon a Pinacle of the Temple, from whence we might the more easily and irrecoverably fall, having a <hi>Scriptum est</hi> to cast us head-long into that (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63641:54"/>
offence of saying as he taught us; for most certain it is that upon these very words of our Saviour, <hi>Thus pray ye,</hi> and <hi>when ye pray, say,</hi> the Church of Christ in all ages hath been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to use the very words of this <hi>prayer</hi> in all their solemn Devotions; &amp; if they have offended in so doing, or if the inconveniences which have followed the practice be chargeable upon it as proper effects of it, let those that so judge consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether they do not make our Saviour an accessarie, if not a principal, in all those offences; and it is more safe to be reputed an offender with him, then innocent in any society that separates from him.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, <hi>That our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 37. Object.</note> 
               <hi>this Prayer, as a plat-form, to frame our Prayers like unto it in matter and method one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not at all in the use of the same words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That our Saviour should make it a form, and so <note place="margin">Answ.</note> use it more then once, and yet intend it only for a plat-form, is wondrously strange; and why we who use to hear the <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>praises</hi> of holy men in their several forms and expressions as well as matter, may not as innocently and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly use this of our Saviour, is a very rare and abstruse speculation. The Creed, the Rule of Faith, must not be varied in words by any private person, nor the Decalogue the rule of works; yet this, which is not onely a Rule, but a most <hi>perfect Form of Prayer,</hi> must not be used in the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed words.</p>
            <p>Suppose a Minister should frame his whole publick <hi>prayer</hi> of Scripture-forms and expressions, (such as we have fitted to all occasions) no doubt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63641:55"/>
but such a <hi>Prayer,</hi> though it consisted of forms, would be of excellent use and efficacy; and why the summing up of that <hi>Prayer</hi> or rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating of it in our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> should be accounted less useful and effectual, no impartial eye can discern; seeing, as the matter of this would be more comprehensive, so the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and composure of it is far beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of any humane inventions; and if our care to study the Scriptures, and out of them to chuse acceptable words and phrases for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of our <hi>Prayers,</hi> then surely our fixing upon this most wholesome form of words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves yet a greater commendation, and <hi>(necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate medii</hi> as well as <hi>praecepti)</hi> becomes necessary, as being most fit to affect the understanding, and thereby to stir up the affections, by the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, plainness, significancie and fulness of it. Suppose our Saviour instead of this form had set down only the heads of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as thus; <hi>when ye pray,</hi> observe these Rules; First, invocate God as your <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> and pray that he would dispose of you, and all things, to the glory of his Name and Holy Attributes: then for the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consummation of his Kingdome, grace and glory, &amp;c. And having so done, a Christian Disciple should have done by our Saviours Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectorie as some have done by the Assemblie's, turn the heads and matter of <hi>Prayer</hi> with little alteration into a form, which form would have been like this of our <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> doubtless that <hi>prayer</hi> would have been very pious and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; and seeing it was our Saviours good pleasure to save us that labour, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63641:55"/>
those heads more summarily and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly then we can do, I wonder why the same words ought not to be used by us. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that in all our <hi>prayers</hi> we should have this pattern for matter in our minds, why should we not sometimes have the same form of words in our mouths? It is hard measure <hi>to make a man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 29. 21.</note> 
               <hi>an offender for</hi> such <hi>words</hi> as these; Our <hi>prayers</hi> which are then onely acceptable when presented in our Saviours Name, do not <hi>ipso facto</hi> become void when presented in his words: That rule which gives rectitude to another is it self most right and perfect to all uses and purposes: If on sudden emergencies we may use some briefer forms of <hi>prayer</hi> without a precept, why on more solemn occasions may we not use this most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite form, which is so positively injoyned? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>prayer,</hi> by whomsoever indited, is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, when presented in faith, though read out of a book, or repeated by memory, (other essential properties of <hi>prayer</hi> being joyned) why not this then, which is put into our mouths by him who gave us a right to ask, as well as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions how to ask aright? That holy Spirit which helpeth our infirmities, and assists our weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, even in sighs and grones, did and will doubtless abound in every Petition of this <hi>prayer,</hi> when offered from a penitent heart; That Dove loves such Olive-branches. I have heard and read, that wicked spirits have been conjured and dispossessed by an impious perverting and abuse of this <hi>prayer;</hi> but that the good Spirit of God, who indited it for use, should abandon it when used by humble and faithful Christians, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63641:56"/>
of blasphemy to think. And upon what account we Protestants shall be able to justifie our quarrel against the Papists for leaving out the Doxology, when at once we casheer the whole <hi>Prayer,</hi> will be hard to find. <hi>Beza</hi> saith, it is <hi>Vera omnium Christianarum precum summa ac formula.

            <p>Let us therefore (dear Brethren) whom God <note place="margin">

            <p>I can only pray and hope, that every publick Minister will bring the spices and flames of his Devotion, that he may help to raise this Phoenix out of her ashes; or at least that everie one whose judgement and conscience is convinced that 'tis his dutie to use it, will not be withheld from the exercise of it by any shame or fear whatever: it is no shame to rectifie an error, but to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in it; and fear and shame where there is no <note place="margin">Errare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus esse nol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

We have not been afraid or ashamed to plead for and

practice some forms of which there is not so <note place="margin">Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

            <p>Besides, it may be considered, whether this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 39.</note> 
               <hi>prayer</hi> may not as well be left out in our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes for the instruction of youth, (and if this, then the Creed, and the Commandements too, and so we should reduce our selves to that which some would have <hi>(i.)</hi> no Catechisme at all, for fear of forms) as well as from our <hi>prayers</hi> in the Congregation; for even among the elder people are some children in knowledge, who need to be taught again the first Principles of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and who indeed are uncapable of higher attainments, unless such a soundation be laid; and if these things should be disused, experience may assure us that some would slight them, and others forget them, and a great part of our people be willingly ignorant of the true sense and meaning, as well as of the letter of them; and (which is also a sad truth) cast off the very form of godliness, as well as the form of <hi>prayer:</hi> all which mischiefs, seeing the frequent use and occasional interpretation of these fundamentals of our Religion may in all probability, through
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63641:57"/>
the blessing of God, prevent for the future, we are in duty obliged to the use of them.</p>
            <p>And if those masters of Families which wholly neglect the duty of <hi>prayer,</hi> and so have not the appearance of Christianity among them, (the Heathen and the families that call not on Gods Name being both alike) would begin that duty with this form, and some other joyned to it, and having learned themselves the true meaning of each Petition, (the prime and literal sense whereof would be easily found) would teach it to their families, I doubt not, but as hereby they would give an evidence of their being Christians, so they might certainly obtain the blessing of God for themselves and families; and who knows whether the wisedom of God did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviate the Doctrine and form of <hi>prayer,</hi> and make it so plain and easie, for this end among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to render them inexcusable who should omit this duty when it would cost them so little labour, study or time, the words being so few and plain, <hi>so nigh them, even in their mouths?

               <hi>hath willed us to aske of him.</hi> It is doubtless a commendable Office to instruct both our Churches and Families, as Christ did instruct his, yea, and to inculcate the same lesson again and again, as Christ did, untill they be perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. Not that I would have any the most private Christian to set up his rest here, or in any other forms; but my desire is, that such as have not yet gone so far, would begin with this, as a step and help, yea as a pillar and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their devotions; and whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress they make, they will see so much imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this, (if they be humble Christians) that (as they say of <hi>Apelles,</hi> when with great care and skill he drew the picture of <hi>Campaspe,</hi> he fell in love with the Original) they will imbrace and reverence this <hi>Prayer</hi> the more as long as they live.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore that Christ hath injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the use of this <hi>prayer;</hi> whose injunction, as it makes it our duty, so it will be our discharge; and the practice of learned and pious Christians will be our incouragement: And if any contentious spirit shall withdraw his neck from this gentle and easie yoke that is imposed by the precept of Christ, and so kick against both, I will onely say as the Apostle doth, <hi>we have no such custome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 40.</note> sadly to reflect on the manifold inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and mischiefs that have followed upon the neglect of observing the matter and form of this <hi>prayer;</hi> for of both these omissions our age is generally guiltie, and it is a rare thing to finde
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63641:58"/>
any that neglects the form to comply duly with the matter and method of it; and then they doe undoubtedly offend, when they neither say, <hi>this,</hi> nor <hi>thus,</hi> as Christ did command them. Do not some men forget the Publicans confession, and onely satisfie themselves with the Pharisees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation? are not those faults grown rise and common, against which our Saviour prescribed <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 7. <hi>Juvenal. Satyr</hi> 3.</note> this <hi>prayer</hi> as a remedy? Is it not true which the Poet observed of old, <hi>nocitura petuntur,</hi> some things have been desired that have been for the matter unlawful, and for the manner of asking sinful? One thinks this <hi>prayer</hi> a mean contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing, unfit to be taught their children; another speaks it out, That there is more devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a verse or two of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, then in all our <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> It is agreeable to the nature of publick <hi>prayer,</hi> that whatsoever news or occurrences, opinion or interest, passion or prejudice, whatever design or debate, publick or private, men do espouse, should be made the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of publick <hi>prayer;</hi> and so the people have many times stones given them instead of bread. And whereas it is said, that the use of this and other forms hath a direct tendency to spiritual laziness and formalitie in <hi>prayer;</hi> I can onely wish that the <hi>prayers</hi> of those that despise this were secured from the temptations of speaking rashly and unadvisedly with their lips, of priding themselves in the ostentation of parts and gifts, to the raising of invincible prejudice in the hearts of the people against such as have not the like faculties, and causing them to have some mens persons in admiration, as if invention, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63641:58"/>
the apt cadencie of words, and confident elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were the principal parts of Christian ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; whereas it is undeniable, that men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified spirits may in these exercises exceed the soundest Christians; as the Rabbines say <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> did, who had three new <hi>prayers</hi> for every day; and our late writers affirm of <hi>Hacket,</hi> who in <note place="margin">

            <p>Alas! how many disorderly and impertinent <hi>prayers</hi> have been publickly delivered! what a monstrous excess in some, and a like defect of the essential parts of <hi>prayer</hi> in others! no marks of our Saviours rule, either in matter, method or form, as if we had found out some new North-west passage to the throne of Grace, which the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our great Pilot did not discover: Against such <hi>prayers</hi> as these good Christians may safely oppose that form of <hi>Plato, Deus Rex optime, bona quaeque nobis voventibus &amp; non vo ventibus tribue; mala autem etiam poscentibus abesse jube.</hi> O God our great King, grant us all good things, whether we aske them or not, and command evil things to be kept from us, though we desire them never so earnestly.</p>
            <p>These things remember me of <hi>Esops</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; of a River that railed against the Fountain, as being sluggish and immoveable, and had not a Fish in it, whereas her streams did abound with variety of fish, and did incessantly pass by the fruitful vallies, making musick as they went: whereat the Fountain was displeased, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained his waters, and so the streams dried up,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63641:59"/>
the fishe; perished, and all the pleasant murmurs ceased.</p>
            <p>I speak not this any wayes to reproch the holy <hi>prayers</hi> of those ancient and experienced Saints of God, who by his blessing upon their daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, and constant exercises of devotion, have attained a more excellent way: for which gifts and graces as I do from my soul bless God, and account them the horsemen and Chariots of our <note place="margin">1 Kings 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Israel;</hi> so it is also the desire of my heart to be remembred of them in all their addresses to the throne of Grace: But onely to express the just regret of my soul for the many miscarriages of rash and inconsiderate persons, discovered in publick devotions, which, through the defect of necessary matter, and the redundancy of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, and for the great disorder and want of method, having no imaginable resemblance with our Saviours form, we may name <hi>Ichabod, where</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 21.</note> 
               <hi>is the glory?</hi> Against all these real, or but possible evils, did we lay the line and rule of our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> to our devotions, and apply it to each part, <hi>Componens manibusque manus atque oribus ora,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Elisha put his mouth upon the dead childs mouth, his eyes upon the childs eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 34.</note> we might perceive new life and spirit to inspire them, to the comfort of all that hear them. To such therefore especially as are conscious to themselves that they have been often surprized to speak rashly and impertinently in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; to such as in Mr. <hi>Calvines</hi> phrase are guilty of desultorie levity, and are tempted to ostentation and vain glory, I earnestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this remedy, that they would better observe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63641:59"/>
the matter and method of Christs <hi>Prayer,</hi> and study more to conform their own thereunto; and for fear of failing in this, would they devoutly use the very form too, as Christ hath injoyned them, it would prove an excellent remedy against the above named evils; and surely, when neither in matter nor form we express any care to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this Architype, we do as much as in us lieth make void this injunction of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>Again, this mischief hath been the product of disusing this <hi>Prayer,</hi> that some (whom we should judge more sober and knowing Christians by their profession) if they hear a Minister summe up his devotions in it, (though he be a person of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts and pietie) they presently conceive a prejudice against him, as being a man of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, formal temper, and of a different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion from themselves; and so deprive themselves of that Spiritual comfort and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification which otherwise they might receive by his Ministery: yea, it hath been known, that on the very repetition of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> some have immediately withdrawn themselves from the Ordinances of God, and so forsaken their own mercies; for whom my hearts desire is, that they may have time and hearts in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and faith to say this <hi>Prayer,</hi> once at least, before they die; and God forbid that I should ceas to pray for them in another form of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <note place="margin">Luke 23. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If for thirtie or fortie years since, or any age of the Church beyond that home to our Saviours time, it should have been adjudged scandalous to use <hi>the Lords Prayer, the Creed, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:63641:60"/>
or any should have made it the mark of a faithful Disciple to omit these things, the present Church would doubtles have branded the authors of that Opinion for Arch-hereticks; and yet not this opinion onely, but the practice too, hath like a gangrene so spread it self over the face of the land, and the hearts of the people, that those Ministers are generally excluded from the number of Christs faithful and able Disciples who devoutly repeat these things: And if this maladie only were cured, I shall account this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour happily bestowed. But beside this, some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men, whose judgements and practices have been for the use of this <hi>prayer</hi> as a form, being called to pray in Congregations of a contrarie perswasion, to avoid the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of giving a groundless offence, have run on the <hi>Scylla</hi> of disobeying Christ, and swerving from their own principles, as if they were <hi>ashamed of Christ and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 8. 38.</note> 
               <hi>of his words in an adulterous generation:</hi> And who knowes whether for our wilful neglect of this one, many among us have not been justly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of other of Gods Ordinances, and given up to contempt of them? But there are yet sadder effects then these; The disuse of it by some hath been improved to a contempt of it in others, in so much that they whose dutie it was to have blessed God for it, (as for a <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder to lift them nearer Heaven) have degenerated so far from Christianitie, as to thank God they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it, and to abhor the teaching of it to their children, as if it were some unluckie spell or charm; yea, (and what is enough to make us all tremble) have quaked at the repetition of it.

These are sad considerations, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be for the most part the proper effects of omitting this <hi>prayer;</hi> and, as ever we hope to have them cease, we should joyn with one consent to remove the cause, and renew our first love to this Ordinance, bring back again with joy and gladness this Ark to the House of God, and prove if he will not open the windows of heaven, and pour down his blessings upon us.</p>

It is more then probable that our Saviour did <note place="margin">

            <p>But I foresee that this objection may be much improved, by what hath been said by some men of great reputation and learning concerning the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Grotius.</hi>
               </note> vast difference of these forms in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> not in words onely, but in sense, and some essential parts of it; for in the vulgate Latine these things are omitted, <hi>Noster qui es in coelis,</hi> the whole third Petition, <hi>Thy will be done, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>deliver us from evil;</hi> all this in Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> relation is wanting: and they with some others doe think, that the whole Doxologie in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63641:62"/>
Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was surreptitious, and not of the Text: But of this anon. Of the particulars left out by St. <hi>Luke Beza</hi> saith this; <hi>Haec non legic vetus interpres,</hi> &amp;c. These things an ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter doth not read, (he means the Vulgate;) and it appears out of <hi>Augustine</hi> to <hi>Laurentius,</hi> that the Latine exemplars had onely five Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this <hi>Prayer,</hi> the third being omitted, and the latter part of the sixth, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward supplied out of <hi>Matthew;</hi> which that it was done <hi>olim,</hi> long agoe, appears not onely by the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, but also by the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation. So <hi>Beza;</hi> and after him <hi>Grotius</hi> to the like purpose: <hi>Omnino oredibile est,</hi> &amp;c. It is very credible that the particulars omitted in <hi>Lukes</hi> copie were added out of the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Matthew;</hi> his reason also the same, <hi>Cùm non extet in Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis antiquis illud,</hi> Because it is not in the ancient Latines: Now this is the force of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If our Saviour had intended these words for a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obje. 2.</note> 
               <hi>form of Prayer, he would not have made so great a difference, not in terms onely, but in some of its chief and essential parts; which difference doth evince, that it was not our Saviours will to tie us precisely to the words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, first, that on this supposition <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of defectiveness, as it is not a form, so neither may it be admitted as a perfect rule or platform, seeing some necessarie things are left out; and so we should make void the injunction of Christ to both purposes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The difference of these forms is in our Translations (which agree with the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63641:63"/>
and best <hi>Greek</hi> copies) inconsiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you have heard in the answer to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Objection, in shew only, not at all in sense; and I remember that I am to deal now with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who do own the Translation now in use, and by consequence the copies from which it was translated as most authentique. And I beseech them to consider what an unhansome reflection is hereby made, not on our Translators only, but on all the Reformers, as if they wanted judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and discretion to choose, or integritie to make use of the best copies; <hi>In imitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do non optimum proponere,</hi> is no wise mans part.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, I doubt not but that it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the most and best <hi>Greek</hi> copies have these particulars Originally, and consequently our Translations are good and authentique. And first, all that <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, is, <hi>Graeci quidam codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces omittunt:</hi> Some <hi>Greek</hi> copies (but not many) do omit the third Petition. Two things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will inquire;</p>
            <p>First, the number of those <hi>Greek</hi> copies that retain these particulars:</p>
            <p>Secondly, their qualitie and authoritie, which in all probability are most authentique, either the Copies which omit, or those which retain them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the number, it will be easily granted that there are more with us then against us; for (in my observation) these parts are omitted only in these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That of <hi>Bezn,</hi> given to the Universitie of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chemnitius Harm. p.</hi> 1977.</note> 
               <hi>Greek copies</hi> (saith he) <hi>in which there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as to the sense in either form, onely two words are changed, but of a like signification:</hi> and therefore he expounds the forms jointly, p. 785. and there adds, <hi>The Greek copies doe relate the whole Prayer in</hi> Luke, <hi>after the same manner as in</hi> Matthew, <hi>except onely the Doxology.</hi> Then for the Latine Translations, (though the Vulgate <note place="margin">

               <hi>Chemnitius, it may be gathered that the Latine copies did differ in</hi> Augustines <hi>time, some reading this Prayer in</hi> St. Luke, <hi>as the Greek copies doe whole and intire.</hi> Besides, <hi>Lucas Brug.</hi> numbers eight Latine Manuscripts wherein the third Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is retained in St. <hi>Luke;</hi> where he adds,

               <hi>that it agrees to the Greek Text of the Kings Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to the Syriack Translation of the same;</hi> and of the other particulars, <hi>Qui es in Coelis,</hi> and <hi>libera nos à malo,</hi> he saith some Latine exemplars have them.</p>
            <p>Now here that I may give more full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and because the consequence of what I shall say may resolve another scruple concerning the Doxologie, I shall briefly discuss these four things:</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>must have recourse to the Greek and Hebrew Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; Vega, Ribera, Vives, Costa,</hi> and others, do acknowledge the same; and whereas some of them have sifted the <hi>Greek</hi> books, to discover corruptions in them, <hi>Chamier, Glassius</hi> and others, have sufficiently vindicated them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the constant interpretations of the Text by the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers (with whom many of the Latine do agree) according as it is in the <hi>Greek</hi> copies, is an argument that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served pure, and entire; for seeing these sacred books were written originally in <hi>Greek,</hi> it was more facile for the Fathers of that Church to find (which doubtless they did seek) the best copies, then for any others.</p>
            <p>And secondly, supposing they had greater helps to find, and obtain, we cannot in Charitie deny them care and integritie to preserve them intire from all corruption, addition, or detraction; for they were not ignorant of that curse, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 18. neither (as in fact it appeareth) were they wanting in this dutie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Greek</hi> Churches which then own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these copies were of a far greater number and extent then the Latine were; The Church of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Palestine,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> with whom the <hi>Syrians</hi> also joyned. To which add</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:63641:66"/>
Fourthly, The providence of God, who would not permit the fountain of Holiness and Truth to be depraved; which providence, as it did appear in preserving those Oracles of God that were committed to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> so doubtless it hath, and will appear in the preservation of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of our salvation in the New Testament to the end of the world; for I know not any promise, or priviledge that the <hi>Jewes</hi> had in this respect above Christians: and seeing God doth require on our parts that we should captivate our reason and understandings to the Doctrines and Truths therein revealed, it is but reasonable to think, that God will certainly preserve them in their integritie and puritie. And if the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who have been professed enemies to Christ and Christian Religion ever since they had a being, have been so wonderfully withheld from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Scriptures of the Old Testament, in those things that concern our Saviour, his Nature, Person, and Offices, which they have alway had more then a good will, but never power to do, how can it be supposed that the <hi>Greek</hi> books of the New Testament, which have alway bin in the custodie, and under the care of most of the Churches of God, who in all ages have had men of great abilitie, sidelitie, and vigilancie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, should be corrupted?</p>
            <p>And thus we pass on in the second place, to enquire, that seeing there are many <hi>Greek</hi> copies some of which do hugely differ from others, yet all of them pretend to Antiquity, and Purity, which of these are the most authentique; and in this also we shall be directed by those that are

Now that all these should be so deluded, as not to know the corrupt copies from the true, and by their inanimadvertency purchase a curse to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and intail it on their posteritie, no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man can think, if he consider how near they were to the Apostles dayes, what abilities they had, and what courage for the cause of Christ (besides the tradition of the Church, which is an Argument against the Papists) and the actings of divine Providence to the contrary.

If any controversie doe arise among the Latines concerning the New Testament, and there be variety in the Latine copies, we presently flie to the <hi>Greek</hi> fountains; and although some <hi>Greek</hi> copies did anciently differ, as possibly they might within a few Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of years, yet the difference being but in words and letters rather then sense, and the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63641:67"/>
Church still retaining those which did agree, with one consent and common practice, there cannot be a more probable Argument of their authority and perfection. Besides, seeing those ancient <hi>Greek</hi> copies, which by the Primitive Church have been delivered to us, do keep the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy of faith and truth among themselves, it is an argument they were not corrupted by those Hereticks whose malice aimed at the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truths. But when any particular <hi>Greek</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py goes against the generally approved ones, and is faulty in any of the more important truths, that copy may be suspected as spurious or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: thus the corruption of the <hi>Arian</hi> copies discovered it self in corrupting those places that did <hi>in Christo hominem à Deo separare,</hi> separate the Divinity from the Humanity of Christ, as <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 30. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>Our third inquiry is concerning the authoritie of those <hi>Greek</hi> copies, especially that of <hi>Beza,</hi> which differ from the rest: <hi>Brugensis</hi> saith of his second copy, which hath some difference from others, <hi>Latinae editioni contra alia omnia consonat,</hi> &amp;c. that it agrees with the Latine Edition against all others, and sometime with its Grand errors, <note place="margin">Erroribus ejus inoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> and was almost wholly conformed to the Latine. So <hi>Erasmus</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> copy in the Vatican; <hi>Exemplum illud ante paucos annos confectum esse tempore Concilii Florentini, cùm facta est concordia Latinae Ecclesiae cum Graecâ;</hi> This copy was made not many years since, in the time of the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Councel, when there was a peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Latine and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:63641:67"/>
Then for <hi>Beza's</hi> copy; Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gre.</hi> Notes <hi>ch. penult.</hi>
               </note> that it was the Opinion of those two learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> that it had been corrupted by the Hereticks; and that which he intimates concerning its faultiness in the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, is an argument of it. But it may suffice to give you his own judgement concerning that copy, as he delivers it in his Epistle to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to whom he presented it:</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:63641:68"/>
               <hi>sic à recepta Scriptura discrepantia, ut ramen cum veterum quorundam, &amp; Graecorum &amp; Latinorum Patrum scriptis consentiant; non pauca denique, quibus vetusta Latina editio corroboratur: quae om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, pro ingenii mei modulo, inter se comparata, &amp; cum syrâ &amp; Arabicâ editione collata, in majores meas Annotationes à me nuper emendatas, &amp; brevi (Deo favente) prodituras, congessi,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This copy was found at <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> during the civil wars there, in the year 1562. of whole Antiquity the chief mark that <hi>Beza</hi> gives, is, <hi>that it hath barbarous notes affixed to it;</hi> whereas the <hi>Grecians</hi> have been more barbarous in these later centuries then in the former: nor doth he say much for the authority of it.</p>
            <p>For first, he saith it differs from other ancient copies, especially in Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel, so much, as that for fear of giving offence he thought it fitter to conceale then publish it:</p>
            <p>And secondly, that some things in it differed from the received Scripture, but so as it agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Writings of <hi>Greeke</hi> and Latine Fathers:</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that it did in many things confirm the old Latine Edition.</p>
            <p>And this last, I take it, is no great argument of its authority or purity. <hi>Solomon Glassius</hi> suspects that it was corrected by the Latine; for, as <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis</hi> had said of his second copy, that it was so conformed; <hi>Quidni de antiquis</hi> Beza <hi>codicibus, si qui fuerant, asseri possit?</hi> the same (saith <hi>Glassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi> may be affirmed of <hi>Beza's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63641:68"/>
And surely were not our Scriptures a more sure word then either the writings of <hi>Greeke</hi> and Latine Fathers (I speak without any dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of them;) or if we had not a more pure and perfect copy of the Scriptures then the vulgate Latine, we should not build on so sure a foundation, as now by the mercy of God we do. Besides, <hi>Beza's</hi> copy differs from all others, as in many things throughout, and especially in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> so even in this <hi>Prayer,</hi> retaining the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>trespasses;</hi> which no other <hi>Greek</hi> copie doth.</p>
            <p>But I shall use another medium, because it is pertinent to the business in hand, to prove the imperfection both of <hi>Beza's Greek,</hi> and the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Latine copies, which is this; If the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie in our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and those copies that retain it, be authentique, then such as leave it out are not so: But the Doxologie, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi> The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the copies retaining it we have proved alreadie, and the verity of the Doxologie follows upon that: but yet, because the truth is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed by the Papists, and too much slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some Protestants, I shall do my endeavour to assert it; And I will not dissemble who they are, and what they say, that speak against it: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus</hi> saith, <hi>Taxanda est illorum tomeritas, qui non voriti sunt tam divinae precationi suas nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas assuers;</hi> Their rashness is much to be blamed, that were not afraid to annex their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles to this Divine <hi>Prayer: Kirstenius</hi> saith, <hi>A pio quodam fidei imbecillis tanquam nova precatio additafuit;</hi> (more modestly) that it was added as another <hi>Prayer</hi> by some pious man, but of a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63641:69"/>
weak faith. <hi>Brugensis</hi> saith, that it crept into the <hi>Greek</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> from the Liturgies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. <hi>Grotius</hi> saith the same; and <hi>Beza</hi> calls it <hi>Magnificam &amp; longè sanctissimam—Sed irrepsisse in contextum, &amp; quae in vetustissimis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot codicibus Graecis desit:</hi> Here is much said by great men, but <hi>Magna est veritas,</hi> truth is great, and will prevail.</p>
            <p>To these things therefore thus I answer; that <hi>Erasmus</hi> is not much to be confided in in this business; for he gives an easie consent to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging that of 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. which so plainly proveth the Doctrine of the Trinitie, and that upon a weak ground, because some <hi>Greek,</hi> and some Latine bookes have it not; the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of which place hath beene irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably asserted by <hi>Gerhard</hi> in his dispute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>But I shall prove this particular also <hi>ex conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> from premises granted by the Papists themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> the authoritie of the <hi>Greeke</hi> books.</p>
            <p>And first, take the testimony of <hi>Brugensis,</hi> (though our enemy in this particular) who speaking of the Doxologie, saith thus; <hi>Coroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem istam quae subsequitur in Graecis plerisque &amp; Syriacis libris,</hi> &amp;c. That clause which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in most of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> books we omit, and <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grant, that it is generally in the <hi>Greek</hi> books; to whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie you have heard their assent: <hi>Solo. Glassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> tells us particularly, that it is in the ancient and correct copies of <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Aldus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Brugensis</hi> saith of one of the <hi>Greek</hi> copies at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> which omits the Doxologie, that it was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Latine, <hi>because;</hi> saith he, <hi>in this place, and in divers other, all the Greek books adde what the Latine omit;</hi> and so doth the <hi>Syriack</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, as he there observes. <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> saith, <hi>Nihil hic erat Graecis additum, sed à Latinis detractum;</hi> (i.) Nothing was here added to the <hi>Greek,</hi> but omitted in the Latine books. And so <hi>Solomon Glassius; Quis</hi>

               <hi>verò nos, quove argumento certos reddat,</hi> &amp;c. But who can assure us, or by what argument, that it was rather added to the <hi>Greek,</hi> then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the Latine? seeing (as he quoteth from <hi>Helvicus)</hi> that the <hi>Greek</hi> is the fountain, the Latine are the streams, this the daughter, and that the mother, by which therefore it ought to be corrected; and he thinks the Vulgate Latine inexcusable for maiming our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> as it doth in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which he thinks a sufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to justifie the <hi>Greek</hi> copies against it in other particulars: So that if I may speak inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously what I think, although <hi>Beza</hi> made very good use of his copie in his Annotations, yet he seems a little too zealous in building the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it on the disparagement of the many anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> copies that retain it; which, because they differ from his, he saith they had those particulars supplied <hi>(Olim)</hi> long since, (which was indeed <hi>ab initio</hi> from the beginning, as hath been proved:) but the Papists gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily swallow this concession, and vomit it forth

            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Prayer</hi> it self would be less perfect without it, and therefore it was not originally wanting: the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> saith; <hi>Orationis</hi>

            <p>Having thus confirmed the Protestant Tenet, we shall also confute the Papists Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects, that the Latine Fathers do not expound it when they open all other parts of the <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is briefly answered, that this will conclude nothing against its authoritie, seeing the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, who in the Primitive times were more, and had more advantages to know the truth, did retain it in their Expositions: for as <hi>Chamier</hi> saith, <hi>Non à Latinis ad Graecos, sed à Graecis ad Latinos scripturae pervenere;</hi> The Scriptures were not delivered from the Latine to the <hi>Greeke,</hi> but from the <hi>Greeke</hi> to the Latine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

2. He saith, <hi>Graeci in sua liturgiâ recitant qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bellar.</note> 
               <hi>haec verba,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Greek</hi> Liturgies do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite these words after the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> but doe not continue them with the <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Chamier</hi> Answers; That they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <note place="margin">L. 12. c. 13 S. 31.</note> it with the <hi>Prayer</hi> (as in St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> appears;) and it was, the order of the Church then that the Priest onely should pronounce it; which also is an argument of its authoritie, the most solemn offices being alway performed by them. So <hi>Montanus; Sacerdoti</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Montan. in locum.</note> 
               <hi>duntaxat licere verba ista proferre;</hi> It was lawfull for the Priest onely to pronounce these words: and so Master <hi>Gregory,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is alway the Priests; and it would be a strange inference, to conclude, that therefore it was less authentique, or that it was not originally in the <hi>Greek</hi> books. Yet again <hi>Huntly</hi> saith, <hi>Istis Verbis respondebat Populus Sacerdoti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But whether both of these be true or false, they will conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against the authoritie of this clause, as will appear in answer to the next Objection.</p>
            <p>Some Protestants do joyn with the Papists, obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that this clause was inserted into the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obje. 3.</note> copies from their Liturgies: So <hi>Brugens. Verisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile fit;</hi> &amp;c. It is probable that this clause was added by the <hi>Grecians</hi> out of their Liturgy, or some other solemn form, into the Gospel of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi> as also out of some such form, these words are added to the Angelical Salutation, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Because thou hast born the Saviour of our souls.</hi> But by the way, be it known,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63641:72"/>
that we Protestants disown any such surreptitious addition to that place of St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the copies which we follow; and therefore the Objection concludes not against them or us upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But to goe on with the Objection, in which <hi>Grotius</hi> agrees with <hi>Brugensis,</hi> thus; <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 13.</note> 
               <hi>this clause is not extant in some ancient Greek exemplars, but is in the Syriack, and Latine, and Arabick, it is an argument, that not onely the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick and Latine, but the Syriack translation also were made after that the Liturgies of the Church had received a certain form; for this Doxologie, (rather then a part of Prayer) was annexed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a custome of Greece altogether unknown to the Latines.</hi> And what <hi>Beza</hi> saith you have heard already, that it did creep into the context, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he and <hi>Grotius</hi> will not grant the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to be Canonical, but that both it and the Doxology came in as a thing in use among those Primitive Christians. Thus I have made the most of the Objection, and shall now do my best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to answer it.</p>
            <p>And first, whereas the Objectors suppose that the Doxology crept in from the <hi>Greek</hi> Liturgies <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> into those many and ancient copies; it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably follow from this supposition, that the use of the Liturgies and publick form of <hi>Prayer</hi> was of Apostolical authority and antiquity; for so are many of the <hi>Greek, Syriaeck, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> copies that do retain this Doxology; to say nothing of the Latine, which <hi>Grotius</hi> also mentioneth.</p>
            <p>And whoever he be that agrees with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors in this supposition, cannot possibly be at
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63641:72"/>
any great distance with me in my main proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if publick <hi>Prayers</hi> were by Apostolical practice used in the service of God in other forms, then this form was used by them much more, there being not any of those supposed, or reall Liturgies, which did not use our <hi>Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> as a chief office of devotion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an uncharitable and high presumption for any to think that those Apostolical men that penned those holy books, should be such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, daring persons, as to harbour any thought, much less actually to attempt, the mending of our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> when not onely their care and diligence to prevent the like practice from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but their fidelity to the Gospel and truths of Christ, which they maintained with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their blood and lives, is so apparent to all; certainly if they had Liturgies so anciently <note place="margin">The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines are guilty of this, as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes on Matth. 6. 13. <hi>In La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin is codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus ex rituali La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino multa adhaese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
               </note> (which I think my present adversaries will not grant, or if they do, we shall be adversaries no longer) they would rather have reformed their Liturgies by the Gospel, out of which indeed the materials of them were taken, and not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel by their Liturgies: And though they used many forms in their devotions as frequently as this Doxology, which they did also immediately annex and insert to portions of Scripture used in their Liturgy; yet we never find them guilty of annexing or inserting them to the holy Writ, as the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to the Angelical Salutation; Surely whatever succeeding ages were, they were not so unfaithful to the great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> of the Gospel, as to consent unto, much
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63641:73"/>
less to be contrivers of, and actors in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it, by any additions, or otherwise. It may with much more charity and probability be thought, that this clause was in progress of time omitted by the Latine Translators as a thing of form, and dayly use, which none could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, or forget; as when we transcribe any thing of accustomed forms we write a part, and supply the rest of it with <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was not onely used to the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> but from thence added to other parts of devotion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and so became most familiar; this I say may be more charitably thought, then that those most ancient, unquestionable Writers, should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely without any reason or design, with high presumption, and a heavie curse (which was but even then pronounced, being almost the last words of the Scriptures,) adde it unto the holy Gospel: besides, these did onely transcribe it <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18.</note> from <hi>Greeke</hi> to <hi>Greeke;</hi> and every one knowes there is less danger of error in transcribing then in translating; there will likely be somewhat lost in tossing liquors from vessel to vessel, by the most steddy hand.</p>
            <p>And that all that guilt which I wipe off from the <hi>Greeke</hi> transcribers may not stick on the Latine translators (whoever they were,) I shall offer (with submission to better judgements) this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, as the ground why they did omit the Doxology, which at best was but <hi>(pia fraus)</hi> a pious fraud.</p>
            <p>I read in St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> after he had expounded <note place="margin">P. 178. to. 40.</note> the rest of our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> thus; <hi>Quid se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur?</hi> (saith he) <hi>Audi quid dicit Sacerdes, Per</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:63641:73"/>
               <hi>Dominum nostra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Jesum Christu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in quo tibi est, cum quo tibi est, honor, laus, gloria, magnificentia, pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas, cum Spiritu Sancto à seculis, &amp; nunc &amp; semper in omnia secula seculorum. Amen.</hi> (i.) What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes? hear what the Priest saith, <hi>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom, and with whom, be unto thee, together with the holy Spirit, honour, praise, glory, magnificence, and power from all ages, both now and alwayes, for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> Now plain it is that the Latine Church did use this clause with the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Priest; as also that it was fitted by that Church to maintain the Doctrine of the Trinitie, which was by many contradicted. So that my opinion is, that having first left out the genuine and proper clause of our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in their Liturgies, and established this in the place of it, as most conducing to the ends they aimed at; and being so setled, in progress of time they did omit the true Doxology, to gain the more credit to this new one; and when (as all learned Protestants know) there were many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and additions, and omissions too, in the Vulgate Latine, even in those dayes, which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> himself did note, but not amend, <hi>Ne</hi>

Then for the word <hi>Amen,</hi> which is not in <hi>Beza's</hi> copy, and is disliked by <hi>Grotius,</hi> who saith it was not added by Christ, but came in from a custome of the Church, which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their <hi>prayers</hi> by that word; this that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man onely saith, for what he alledgeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will prove the contray, that the word is used in the Old and new Testament; Now this <note place="margin">Deut. 27. 15. 1.

See this great Scholar urgeth the same Argument for it which <hi>Grotius</hi> urged against it.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63641:74"/>
especially in omitting those severall parts of our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> which those more ancient copies retain. And here I may also conclude with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend M. <hi>Crook, That the Doxology is causelesly and without warrant omitted by the Church of Rome</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we come in the last place to inquire <note place="margin">Guide to Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> after the rise and authority of the vulgate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, upon whose credit both <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> do dissent from the most and best copies, and from the judgement of almost all Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: concerning the intireness of our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in Saint <hi>Luke, Beza</hi> saith, <hi>Haec non legit vetus interpres, ut apparet ex Augustino;</hi> The ancient Interpreter <hi>(viz.</hi> the vulgate Latine) doth not regard these things, as appears out of <hi>Augustine:</hi> and so <hi>Grotius, Cùm non extet in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinis antiquis illud;</hi> Because it is not in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Latine, therefore he suspects it was not in the <hi>Greek.</hi> But the reading of the Latines will not at all prejudice the more constant and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous readings of the <hi>Greek,</hi> if we consider the rise and authority of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There were in the Latine Church, in the time of St. <hi>August.</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> divers Latine Editions, besides that which is now called the vulgate, some of which did agree much better with the <hi>Greek;</hi> but this was most approved by that Church: This especially was so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly corrupted, that Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> sent to Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> to amend it by the <hi>Greeke:</hi> and accordingly he sets about the work, not to <note place="margin">

That which had once possessed the ears of men, and had built up the faith of the growing Church was justly approved by our silence; and upon this account he past over many things which he knew did greatly need amendment. So that the ground-work of this edition is an old vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, used by Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> amended in some few things by St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> but to this day differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Greek</hi> copies, which translation was not received into the Church untill <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time, <hi>(i.)</hi> about two hundred years after Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith; this is the rise of it: now concerning its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, hear what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>Mirificè,</hi> &amp;c. All the Hereticks <hi>(i.</hi> Protestants) do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully agree against the Romish Church; and the Lutherans and Zuinglians, (so he names the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,) urge this against its authority, <hi>Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles in ea deprehenduntur errores,</hi> That innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable errours are found in it; and this, as it hath already, and may more largely be proved by the Papists, and especially by comparing the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63641:75"/>
Latine with that of <hi>Montanus</hi> his interli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neary version of the New Testament, so more especially from the observation of Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; for although <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> boasted much of his Edition, how many things he had reform'd, yet Dr. <hi>James</hi> reckoneth 2000 faults mended <note place="margin">Bellum Papale.</note> in that Edition by Pope <hi>(lement</hi> the Eighth, and yet this Pope saith modestly, divers things were still to be amended; and the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> did take some care for the effecting of it, but still <hi>Brugensis</hi> observes six hundred faults more; and when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saw <hi>Brugensis</hi> his emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he sends him this with his thanks: <hi>You may know that the vulgate Bibles are not accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mended by us, for many things are purposely past by which seemed to need amendment, which for just cause we did not amend; this cause is so secret, that we cannot judge how just it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I remember <hi>Bellarmine</hi> falls foul with <hi>Calvine</hi> for saying of the vulgate Edition, <hi>Adeo nullam esse in vulgatâ editione integram paginam, nt vix tres sunt continui versus non insigni aliquo errore faedati,</hi> That the vulgate Edition is so far from having any entire page, that it hath scarce any three continued verses free from some gross errour: This holds true of the New Testament as well as of the Old.</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>Bellarmine, Huntly,</hi> and other Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites have said in defence of it, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by <hi>Chamier, Chemnitius, Glassius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: One argument of <hi>Bellarm.</hi> for the defence of it I cannot but take notice of; <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>it hath been used by the Latine Fathers for a thousand years:</hi> this makes little for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63641:77"/>
to be authentique, and the forms in both Evangelists to be entirely the same, though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at several times, onely in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the Doxology is not added; whence will arise ano-Objection:</p>
            <p>The form in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> which is most strictly <note place="margin">Obje. 4.</note> injoyned, is less perfect; and the quere will be which form ought to be used.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that it is usual with the later Evangelists to deliver those particulars more briefly which had been insisted on more at large by the former; thus in an important cmmand, v. 33. of this Chap. <hi>Seek the Kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, &amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> reads onely this, <hi>seek the Kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added:</hi> and this is also the method ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33. Luke 12. 31.</note> by the Evangelists, as to repeat some things already delivered more briefly, so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press other things omitted more plainly; and it seems it was the aim of St. <hi>Luke</hi> to express the word of precept and injunction for the using of this form, so as that it should admit no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But I remember that this <hi>Prayer</hi> was twice delivered, and so our Saviour himself might here in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> repeat it more contractedly to his Disciples alone, who, we may suppose had all recorded and learned it throughout; or at least, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> might abbreviate it, as a thing suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known from St. <hi>Matthews</hi> relation. But however it be, when two forms are prescribed, we need not dispute which we should use, much less may we deny to use either: but as it is our duty to use one, so it will be our sin to omit both: and our own prudence, and the practice of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63641:77"/>
Church in all ages may direct us to use that which is most perfect. And our Assembly gives the same advice in a like matter; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apostle differs from the Evangelist in the form of words used at the Institution of the Lords Supper, which in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 26. is, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body;</hi> and at the cup, <hi>Drink ye all of it, for this is my blood of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is shed for many for the remission of sins:</hi> But in St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus; <hi>Take, eat, this is my body</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> 
               <hi>which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me:</hi> and at the cup, <hi>This cup is the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my blood, this do you as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</hi> The first are Christs own words according to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith also, <hi>That he received of the Lord that which he delivered unto the</hi> Corinthians; yet, as there is a necessity of using one of those forms, so the Directory giveth us liberty to use either. The same advice will hold in this business of the two forms of <hi>Prayer:</hi> One we are bound to use, we have liberty to choose which; but Christian prudence directs us to use that which is most compleat; and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> assures us that the <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:63641:78"/>
Having proved it to be our duty, by vertue o Christs command, all objections for the non performance of it, arising from our own incapa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>city, will be found to be but vain pretences, an such is this.</p>
            <p>For first, I beseech the Objectors to consider, what our Saviour was doing when he delivered this <hi>Prayer;</hi> he was instructing, not onely his Disciples, but the whole multitude also, in the chief parts of Gods worship; wherein he no doubt descended to the capacities of them whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to instruct, and did not now speak in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, as at other times, but proposed plain truths, to guide their spirits, and raise their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and other exercises of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And I cannot thinke any man as good a Master of Method, or a plainer teacher then our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They that have not a competent degree of Knowledge to apprehend the prime sense of each Petition in this <hi>Prayer,</hi> if they be Ministers, they are not sufficiently qualified to utter <hi>Prayers ex tempore</hi> in the Congregation; or if they be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are less able at one and the first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to understand all the uncouth words, and mysterious expressions of those that do so pray before them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The prime and literal sense is obvious, and easie to be understood by every ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; but if there be any thing difficult, there are few established Ministers but are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it; and were all Ministers as diligent in unfolding the Method and heads of this <hi>Prayer</hi> as the ancient Fathers were, and as it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63641:78"/>
is their duty to be, this Objection would soon vanish.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which the whole Assembly makes an argument to commend the use of it as a form, namely, the comprehensiveness of it, is but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily urged by any one or more inferior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, against the use of it as such.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Objection would condemn the use of any Petitions wherein the Attributes of God are mentioned, and any Scripture-purase (to which more senses then one may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated) is used; and as the <hi>Jewes</hi> say, there are Mountains of Divinity on every point of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nor indeed is it necessary that we should in every <hi>Prayer</hi> have an actual apprehension of every particular that may upon deliberation be referred to each head of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> but onely of such things as we do stand in need of, and for the supply of which we do at that time make our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the throne of Grace; and if we should stand to enumerate our particular wants, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our several sins, and to implore grace against each infirmity, in every <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is not a day that would be sufficient for these and such like things. And it it not in vain that our Saviour hath said, <hi>Your heavenly Father knoweth what things ye have need of,</hi> so immediately before this injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thus therefore pray ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This Objection is so like that which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists make against the use of the Scriptures by the Lay-people, that one egge is not more like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> Because in them are some things hard to be understood, therefore they permit them
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63641:79"/>
not to converse with them, and to use means, &amp; lay hold on opportunities to understand them better; It is great pitty that the excellency of things should render them useless, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary justice and goodness of <hi>Aristides,</hi> should be the ground of his banishment. Besides, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the people be ignorant of the proper sense of one or two Petitions, it cannot charitably be supposed that they are ignorant of all; and their ignorance of some particulars will not be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient excuse for the total omission of this duty, no more I think then if a man should plead, I am not in perfect charity, I am dull and indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, therefore I will not pray; though such a one may sin in his prayer, yet he sins more in the wilful omission; and it is better to pray in a sense of our infirmities and unworthiness, which still accompany us, then not to pray at all, because we cannot in some things justifie our selves. Doctor <hi>Preston</hi> makes <hi>Prayer</hi> the best preparation to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and Saint <hi>James</hi> commends it as a good mean to obtain spiritual knowledge; <hi>If any man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">James 1. 5</note> 
               <hi>lack wisedome, let him aske it of God, and it shall be given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If this Prayer be so positively injoyned, then it ought to be used as the only prayer, at least it should</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obje. 6.</note> 
               <hi>be added to all other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Affirmative precepts doe alwayes oblige us to <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the performance of them, but not to the actual exercise of the duties injoyned by them at all times. Thus when we are bid <hi>to pray continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> we may as well conclude that we ought to do nothing but pray, (for which opinion the <hi>Euchites</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 17.</note> and <hi>Messalians</hi> were accounted Hereticks) as to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63641:79"/>
infer from hence that we ought to use this form only, or this at all times of <hi>prayer:</hi> and so from that Precept, vers. 6. of <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. we might as truly infer, that all but closet<hi>-prayers</hi> are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, because Christ there saith, <hi>when thou prayest enter into thy closet;</hi> whereas we might rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that as our Saviour commended closet<hi>-prayers</hi> to his Disciples, to distinguish them from hypocrites, who were wont to pray chiefly in the streets and high wayes; so he commendeth this form, to difference them from the heathen, and to be as a cognizance of their Discipleship, to be used <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> on solemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in publick, and once a day at least in private, as is implied in the fourth Petition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Supposing (as some contend) that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had injoyned this <hi>Prayer</hi> as a platform on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as then there would have been no necessity of conforming every occasional Petition to the whole method and frame of it, but it should have served as a rule by which to conform our more solemn Devotions; so now our publick <hi>prayers</hi> being framed by it, we ought to apply the form it self to these especially, as a rule to discover their rectitude or deficiency, and to supply their imperfections; which if it were duly done as oft as we worship God in publick, it would be as salt to season our Devotions, and give the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple assurance that we have done according to the pattern in the mount; it might cover a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of infirmities, and commend our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God and man.</p>
            <p>And lastly, it might prove an effectuall mean to revive that Unanimitie and Charitie
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63641:80"/>
which hath so long been cold and dead amongst us.</p>
            <p>When I have kept close to the matter of this <note place="margin">Obje. 7.</note> 
               <hi>prayer</hi> in my devotion, it is but a vain repetition to say over the form.</p>
            <p>If those that fail in observing the matter <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and method would use the forme, (and the use of one of these is undoubtedly their dutie) the farre greater part of our Ministers would use it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There can be no great danger in saying our <hi>prayers</hi> too oft, whether in the same or other words. Our Saviour repeated the same words three times when he was in an Agony, <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 44. <hi>O my Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me.</hi> And if the same conceptions may be often repeated in other words of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as is generally practised, why may they not be once repeated in Christs words? To goe from a less perfect form to a more perfect, from our own to Christs, is a good method. There is an Art taught by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> how to make an old prayer new, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. namely, by renewing our fervent affections; Of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of zeal, and fervour of spirit, will add new life and efficacy to any <hi>prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we find our hearts dull and cold under this, <note place="margin">Obje. 8.</note> as well as under other forms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this we may answer as the Apostle in another case, <hi>ye are not straitned</hi> by this forme, <hi>ye are straitned in your own bowels.</hi> It may <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 12.</note> be your hearts are stupid at the reading of the Scriptures, must that Ordinance therefore cease? Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> telleth us of one <hi>Smith,</hi> that would
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63641:80"/>
cast reading of Scripture out of the Assembly, because in his opinion it quenched the Spirit: But in such cases the deadness of our hearts is to be blamed, not the form of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is full of life and spirit; yet it is strange that any mans heart should be active and fervent under one that prayes a form to him ten or twenty times to him as long, and presently grow stupid and cold at the devout repetition of this form (perhaps) by the same Minister: Doth the holy Spirit assist you in hearing the Ministers form, and withdraw from you in hearing this? no, doubtless; but as we may be edified by Psalms, and Hymnes, and spiritual Songs brought into forms by men, so much more by the use of this form, composed, and injoyned by the Son of God. I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore think that the hearts of those that have been dull, or disaffected, under the <hi>prayers</hi> of the Ministers, should be quickned and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this; as the drooping Disciples going to Emaus, <hi>while Christ was speaking to them their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 24. 2</note> 
               <hi>hearts burned;</hi> and so indeed the people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes, by their more reverend gestures, their chearful and unanimous joyning with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in the use of this <hi>prayer,</hi> were wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their most hearty devotion.</p>
            <p>And here we may observe, how little the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the truth do agree; One accusing it for being more large and comprehensive then their spirits and understandings can apprehend; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for that it doth too much straiten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their spirits, and make them flat and dull: which accusations, as they cannot be both true, so without better proof we have no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve either.</p>

            <p>To the first part of the Objection, Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> answereth thus; They that doe deny this <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be used by any but real Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as they say) none but such can call God Father, either know not, or consider not, how u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual this compellation was among that Nation in their devotions; and Christ speaketh constantly according to the common and most usual Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Countrey; And if Christ did from the common practice of the <hi>Jewes</hi> insert it into his own <hi>prayer,</hi> it argues his approbation of it too in the common devotion of Christians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To both parts of the Objection I Answer, that every man that would pray fitly and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the congregation, or in his closet, ought to follow this <hi>prayer</hi> as his Rule &amp; Directory in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the matter of it at least, if not the form al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, (otherwise Christ hath made it a form and rule in vain:) Now I say, if our keeping of the form be dangerous, so is our observing the matter too; and then by this reason, if the most of men may not pray in this form, neither may they pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this matter; for as no solemn <hi>prayer</hi> should be made without asking God forgiveness, so no forgiveness can be expected without the <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 15.</note> condition of forgiving, our brethren: it is as <hi>Montanus</hi> saith, <hi>Praecisa &amp; irrevocabilis sententia</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:63641:81"/>
               <hi>sine exceptione,</hi> a general &amp; unalterable rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, <hi>If ye forgive not men their trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your trespasses.</hi> And what a vain excuse this will be in the ears of God, I did not pray nor aske pardon, because I could not call God Father, nor forgive my brethren, or because there were some in the Assembly that had not faith to call God Father, or charity to forgive their brethren, every Christian ear can try.</p>
            <p>But if this be the reason why some have so long omitted it, let me mind them of what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our told some of his Disciples, <hi>Ye know not what</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 9. 55.</note> 
               <hi>spirit ye are of:</hi> Now the frequent use of this Petition would lay on new and strong Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon all persons, to perform that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Christian dutie so much wanting among us, of a free and full forgiveness of our brethren; to which religious practice, it is well if by any Art we could oblige our people; yea this very terror of the Lord, which is here put into our own mouths of obtaining no forgiveness from God, but on condition of forgiving others, would effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually perswade us to it, or else keep us under a tacite sentence in our own consciences of being Excommunicated from the throne of Grace, and of receiving no benefit by all our prayers. And suppose there be some such in each Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as cannot, or at least will not joyn with the rest in saying this <hi>Prayer,</hi> must the rest of the Congregation be deprived of the benefit of it for their sakes? It may be all the Ministers <hi>Prayers</hi> may not be as suitable, and profitable to the most and best of the people, as this; and it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63641:82"/>
is a sad thing, if a Minister shall comply rather with the weakness and malice of a few, then with the devotion and benefit of many. The use of holy and honest things is not to be laid aside, because some are causelesly offended at them, especially when the greater part are justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced at the omission.</p>
            <p>And finally, this also is to be considered, that the yielding to scrupulous and contentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in lesser things, (although I account this one of the greatest magnitude) is the way to harden them in their present prejudices, and to dispose them for more and greater.</p>

            <p>THat which Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> p. 667.</note> the use of this form, is, in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Beedles</hi> 11. Questions, and the Answer thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beedles</hi> Question is this; <hi>Did not Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a form of Prayer to his Disciples, so that there remaineth no doubt touching the lawfulness of using a form?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this he answers, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. To this thus replieth:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. If Christ prescribed a form of Prayer to his Disciples, to be used as a form by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the same words, I confess it will be out of question that it is lawful to use a form.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> But Christ did prescribe a form of <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it is lawful to use a forme. The <hi>minor</hi> Proposition is chiefly to be proved, and the conclusion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the lawfulness of using a form (indefinitely) which is that which <hi>Beedle</hi> contends for, and the Doctor here grants,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63641:83"/>
will be of considerable importance hereafter. Now the truth of this Proposition will appear by the proof of its parts, thus: Either it is not a form, or not prescribed to be used as such; but it is a form, and prescribed to be used as such; <hi>Ergo.</hi> That it is a form is granted by all, and made the apple of contention by most that disuse it under that notion: but the rottenness of this assertion is so apparent, that the next scruple is added, as a leaf to cover it, <hi>(i.)</hi> whether it is prescribed to be used as such: This, although it be sufficiently clear, cannot be seen by those who have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the former prejudice, for being professed enemies to all forms of <hi>Prayer,</hi> they are resolved to make it good that our Saviour was no friend to them; which is contrary to his own practice, (as hath been shewed) and against a double pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept also, in as plain expressions as could be used to that purpose. But none are more unlike to discern the mind of God in the Scriptures, then they that sift them rather to find or fancy some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them to confirm their opinions, then to direct and settle their judgements: otherwise they that observe, and use a form of words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the administration of both Sacraments, might with the same eyes observe this also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for use in prayer: But</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is also granted that there is a plain and positive prescription preceding this form, <hi>When ye pray, say,</hi> And <hi>thus pray ye.</hi> And I never heard as yet that any have questioned the sufficiency of the injunction; about what then is the contest? this; they fancy, that the matter onely of that form doth fall under the prescription, and not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63641:83"/>
the form of words. So that the truth of both as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions is granted <hi>in sensu diviso, (viz.)</hi> that there is a form, and a prescription, but not <hi>insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su composito,</hi> that that form is to be used as such, by vertue of this prescription. But what God hath joyned together let no man put asunder; for the decision of this I will make my appeal to any impartial person, as Judge: when there is a form composed by Christ himself, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Disciples with a plain precept pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, <hi>viz. When ye pray, say,</hi> how unreasonable it is to affirm that the prescript should concern the matter, or the method only, and not the form of words also? <hi>Quis discrevit?</hi> what sufficient cause of divorce between these two can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed? or what reason hath any to distinguish, where the Law of God doth not? had the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple asked our Saviour thus; <hi>Master, teach us what things to pray for, give us some heads of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> then this inference might have some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth; but even then our Saviour giving and prescribing a form with the matter, it would have been hard measure to exclude the form of words from the prescription, when Christ had included it: The proposition being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the conclusion is granted by the Doctor, <hi>viz.</hi> that out of question it is lawfull to use a form: this <hi>Beedle</hi> infers<hi>—The lawfulness of using a form (indefinitely,)</hi> and in this the Doctor gratifieth him; which we do here observe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Doctor presently withdrawes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>His Conclusion must be; that, that forme ought to bee used, not at all that any else may.</hi>

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:63641:84"/>
Dr. <hi>Owen. But that is lawful not to use a form, or that a man may use any Prayer but a form on that supposition, will not be so easily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This is the Doctors Argument; <hi>If it be lawful to use a form of Prayer, then any other prayer: But a form is unlawful.</hi> As if forms and non-forms were as irreconcileable as light and darkness, or Christ and Belial; I know none that useth forms, so to Idolize them, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the use of Extempotary prayer, especially in secret, to which they doe earnestly exhort all Christians to aspire, as to a degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their devotion; neither their principles nor their practice will own this conclusion, of condemning all prayers that are not forms as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: We who account it lawfull to read the Scripture in the form that we have received it, do not make it unlawfull to meditate and comment, to write or reade pious and learned discourses, expounding the sense of it.</p>
            <p>The people may be holy in a sense as well as the Priests, although not so solemnly consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this <hi>Prayer</hi> indeed, like its Maker, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with a holy Oyl above its fellows, but yet that Oyl (as from <hi>Aarons</hi> head) runs down to the skirts of his garments, to every private ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Prayer and ejaculation that is breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a contrite heart.</p>
            <p>Prayers are not therefore lawfull or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because they are formes, or extemporary;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63641:84"/>
the Spirit may assist each, and either may be performed without the assistance of the Spirit: Therefore, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said in another case, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 15.</note> 
               <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the Understanding also;</hi> So, I may pray by a forme, and I may pray <hi>ex tempore</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. The words of Christ are, When ye pray, say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, not the Matter onely, but the Words also are attended, and that Forme of them which followes is prescribed to bee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by vertue of this Command of Christ, it will be hard to discover on what ground wee may otherwise pray, seeing our Saviours Command is Positive, When ye pray, say, &amp;c.</hi> (This is the Center to which many of the Doctors Lines doe tend.) <hi>That which Master</hi> Beedle <hi>is to prove, is, That our SAVIOUR hath prescribed the Repetition of the same words ensuing; and when hee hath so done (if hee can) his Conclusion must bee, that, that Forme ought to bee used not at all, that any else may.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> There is a plaine <hi>Non sequitur</hi> in this Argument, <hi>(viz.)</hi> If this Form be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then the other formes are unlawfull: The Standard was a rule to all other measures, were other measures therefore which agreed with the Standard unlawful? It is indeed the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63641:85"/>
perfection of other prayers to be as like this, both in matter and form, as may be; the contrary might indeed be more rationally inferred <hi>(viz.)</hi> If this form be prescribed and lawful, then other forms (especially prescribed ones) are lawfull also; which consequence seeing the Doctor did with good reason grant, we will take him to his word, not because we need it, or shall account it as a gift, but because we have right and just title to it: Indeed if the whole mass of form had been corrupted, and our Saviour had chosen and sanctified this one onely, the Doctors conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had been good; but seeing they were originally lawfull, and prescribed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Old Testament, and many of them approved by our Saviours practice, as well as this by his positive precept in the New: it seems harsh Doctrine (pardon the Expression) to leave them all under an absolute irrespective de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
            <p>In a word, our Saviour did not prescribe that which was unlawful before, to make it lawfull, but that which was lawfull to make it necessary. Besides, Christ doth not injoyn this <hi>Prayer (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusivè)</hi> as if it were unlawfull to adde other; but <hi>(eminentèr)</hi> as a visible Character of being his Disciples, to be used occasionally <hi>(pro hic &amp; nunc)</hi> as a token that they owned him for their Master, and were constant in the Faith delivered by him.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. If our Saviour have prescribed us a forme, how shall any man dare to prescribe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? or can any man doe it without cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:63641:85"/>
                  <hi>on this, the roproch of imperfection and insufficiencie?</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Saviour having prescribed us a form, it is a dutifull, no daring thing to follow him in so plain and practicall a part of Piety; we ought to conform all our Devotions to this pattern in the mount: They certainly are the daring spirits that neglect and slight this prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed form.</p>
            <p>All grant that we ought to conform our <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> to Christs; this then will be the question, Whether it is lawful to meditate and study that our prayers may be comformable to his, or to presume of such a conformity at an adventure: If you say (as all sober Christians will) that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and meditation are requisite, I rejoyn, study and meditation to compose our prayers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them unto Christs, is the constituting of them forms; therefore if study and meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be lawfull, other forms of prayer are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and being lawfull, the prescribing of them to such as need them, for helps to their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not make them unlawful.</p>
            <p>Suppose I should argue from the Doctors sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it is the matter onely that is prescribed, thus; If the matter of this <hi>Prayer</hi> onely be prescribed, then the prescribing and using of any heads or matter of prayer, more or less then are in this <hi>prayer,</hi> is unlawfull; I should not conclude rationally, nor piously, but cast a reproch on many devout supplications of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians, and on publick Forms and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories too: But certainly the framing of our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63641:86"/>
Petitions like to this, is to honour it as our rule, not to cast reproch on it as imperfect and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; let them look to that who reject the use of it, and are so much enamoured with their own forms (for forms they are to all but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) as to abandon this.</p>
            <p>But it is natural to us to see a mote in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye, and not to consider the beam that is in our own; If they reproch it that conform to it, and in a conscientious obedience to our Saviours prescription repeat it in the same words, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to their own prayers to supply the defects of them, what do they that pronounce the saying of it (which is prescribed) to be ridiculous, and a charm, and question whether the saying of these words, which Christ and his Evangelists have put into our mouths, be a part of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, or whether any promise of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (no matter with what affection and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it be said) be annexed to the saying so? and many such things, the mentioning of which will be a sufficient confutation. But I forbeare, and close with Master <hi>Ball,</hi> who first grants it is a form, and addeth; The principal use of it is to direct all Gods People to make their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by it.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. Our Saviour hath prescribed a forme of prayer to be used as a form by repetition of the same words; therefore we may use it, yea, we must use it, is an invincible Argument, on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the truth of the Proposition: But our Saviour hath prescribed us such a form, therefore we may use another, hath neither shew,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:63641:86"/>
                  <hi>nor colour of reason in it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> He must either wilfully shut his eyes, or have a weak sight, that cannot discern more then a colour of Reason in this consequence, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Our Saviour hath prescribed us one form as lawful, therefore we may use other formes lawfully: for surely our Saviour did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe any thing which was <hi>(in genere suo)</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. Indeed the contrarie inference is strange, and hard to be proved, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Our Saviour hath asserted the lawfulness of one or more forms, therefore all others (not so asserted) are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
            <p>When it was prescribed at a solemn Fast, that <note place="margin">Joel 2. 17.</note> the Priests should say, <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Is it reasonable to think that they made use of no other <hi>prayers,</hi> (as of <hi>Davids</hi> penitential Psalmes, and the like) but onely of that short form there prescribed; or that they did offend in so doing? Or what if any should argue thus; Our Saviour hath prescribed us this form, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those in <hi>Hosea, Joel,</hi> &amp;c. are unlawful to be used?</p>
            <p>The Primitive Christians saw more then a colour of Reason in this Consequence, when on this very ground, because Christ gave his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a form of <hi>Prayer,</hi> they did with study and meditation compose their publick devotions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Example. So <hi>Tertullian; Praemissâ le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimâ &amp; ordinariâ oratione quasi fundamento jus est desideriorum, jus est superstruendi extrinsecus petitiones.</hi>

The lawfull and ordinary prayer being premised, it becomes the rule of all our desires, and of raising all our Petitions upon it: and Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> who maketh it a form saith also that Christ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth all Languages, Words and Forms agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, whether read, rehearsed by heart or presently conceived: And <hi>Espencaus</hi> observeth the same, <hi>Ducta est hinc Ecclejiae consuctudo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. But how will Master</hi> Beedle <hi>prove that Christ doth not here instruct his Disciples in what they ought to pray for, and for what they ought in prayer to address themselves unto God, and under what considerations they are to looke on God in their approches to him, and the like, onely, but also, that he prescribeth the words there mentioned by him to be repeated by them in their supplications?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The task which the Doctor sets Mr. <hi>Beedle</hi> to prove in the Negative, should have been proved by himself in the Affirmative; and I think it will be sufficiently difficult to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that the matter and heads of Prayer, and the method and considerations by and under which we are to call on God, <hi>(cum multis aliis)</hi> and other such things, are all of them, and onely prescribed, and yet the form it self not intended,

               <hi>Hutchinsons</hi> third Note on this Verse is; <hi>Our words in prayer ought not to be such, or so ordered as we please, but God is the prescriber of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whose directions we are bound to follow; for so much doth this direction given by him teach.</hi> After consultation with these, and some other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, my thoughts are, that the faithful people of God then living, having received from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Prophet of the Lord a prescribed forme of <hi>prayer,</hi> whatever other prayers they did use besides, they did most certainly use this also. And that which the Doctor addeth, viz. <hi>that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to fervent Supplication as he should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to deal with him;</hi> doth not overthrow, but rather confirm the Prophets prescribing a form of words to be used; for seeing Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of inabling his people was by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given to his Prophets on their behalf, by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63641:88"/>
whose Ministrie the Lord puts words in their mouth, as here, and in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. It had been great presumption in them to have neglected the dispensation of the Spirit by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which with great Faith and confidence they might have used in the prescribed words, and to have expected it by an immediate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse on their own spirits in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner.</p>

those more solemne publicke Prayers can be so highly excellent which are hudled up without any respect to this, either as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, method, or form, and perhaps carry not the sense of more then one or two Petitions, though they exceed it almost an hundred times in length.</p>
            <p>But as for Apostolical practice, there are many credible authorities among the ancients to induce us to believe that they did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use it, as Saint <hi>Augustine, Gregory, &amp;c.</hi> nor can the bare denial of any one or more <note place="margin">ut suprà.</note> modern and prejudiced persons overthrow their testimonies; or at least such a way of Arguing would raze many fundamentals of our Religion.</p>
            <p>As for their commanding or prescribing the use of these words to others, I cannot think so uncharitably of the Apostles, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they omitted this dutie, seeing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior gave them in charge, <hi>To teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all things whatsoever he commanded</hi>

            <p>And why may it not be as well questioned, whether the Spirit of Grace be consistent with a form of words in the administration of the Sacraments, as in <hi>Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I aver therefore, that nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent then such a Divine Prescription of a forme of words, and the Spirit of <hi>Prayer,</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:63641:93"/>
for as much as the prescribed words of God are that Chariot, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, by which the Spirit of God ordinarily descendeth into the hearts of men, and the souls of men ascend up to God; and therefore to intimate an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency of these two, is as the dashing of the two Tables against each other, it is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Martine</hi> to <hi>Luther,</hi> and to sowe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among brethren; they have both one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The gift of the Spirit of <hi>Prayer</hi> is either Internall, which we may call the infused Grace; or Externall, which is the ability to exercise that Grace; which ability is attained <hi>per modum habitus acquisiti,</hi> as an acquired habit, by study, meditation, and frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise; so that he who would fitly exercise the Grace of the Spirit, is obliged to use such means as God hath appointed to inable him thereunto, (even as he who would exercise the gift of the Spirit in preaching;) and this studying and reducing the gift of the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a form, either of Preaching or Praying, doth not extinguish, but cherish the Grace of the Spirit, as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> precept to <hi>Timothy</hi> doth plainly teach; <hi>Meditate upon these</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>things, give thy self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing it is likely that we may serve God better, and edifie his people more, by our premeditating, and studying both the matter, and expressions of our Prayers, we ought to do it, unless we will adventure to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63641:93"/>
appear empty before the Lord, and to serve him of that which cost us nothing. The truth is, there is an immediate infusion, and an assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Spirit in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pretended unto in exemporary Prayers, as if there were a <hi>(dabitur in eâ hor â)</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent enthusiasme given from above to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede them from all study and premeditation; which Opinion all sober Christians must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, or they will cast a great prejudice upon the Devotion of all that have not a like faculty.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but ingenious and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed persons, may by the Gift of God, and the concourse of Naturall causes and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have their spirits so quickned, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of inventing and disposing matter so improved, and their delivering thereof in ready and significant expressions, so familiar, as may become the publick service of God; but still I say, he that can doe this <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> may doe much better with study and meditation, and that as well in Prayer as in Preaching.</p>

               <hi>righteousness, that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly furnished to all good workes;</hi> this Quere might have seemed superfluous: It may in a sort be as justly questioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scriptures be written, because we cannot be instructed in our Christian Faith and obedience without them; for, <hi>Eadem est ratio partium &amp; totius.</hi> Seeing that Christ did prescribe it to teach his Disciples, doubtless it <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> was intended as a help of devotion for all them that should believe in his Name, unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Hutchinson</hi> in his fourth Note on <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 2. speaketh very pertinently to this Quere; <hi>It may be</hi> (saith he) <hi>the condition of Gods humble and exercised People, that they cannot command their own dispositions, nor get their heaerts brought into frame before God; in which case, however he abhor those that draw nigh unto him with their lips,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet they who</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Is. 29. 13.</note> 
               <hi>are sensible of the backwardness of their hearts, ought not to stay away because of that, but should come, if it were but with words to God, to seeke of him that he would give them more to bring unto him.</hi> So much for this <hi>(take with you words)</hi> albeit they could command no more.</p>

               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:63641:94"/>
So that it is not derogatory to the glory of God, either to say that all believers have great help to their devotions from this form, or that some believers, at sometimes, need this or other formes of inferiour rank, with which they may go to God in Prayer; nor doth it derogate from the efficacy of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, promised and given to believers, because that spirit doth not alway work the external faculty or gift of exercising Prayer, where it doth infuse the inward Grace; the most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart may be joyned with a slow tongue, as <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 10.</note> it was in <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where the spirit doth work the gift, it is not by an immediate inspiration, suddenly elevating the Intellectuals and Faculties of man to an extraordinary degree of Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Elocution, but gradually, by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, study, and the use of means, especially such as are commended and prescribed in the Word of God for that purpose; of which means this form is the chiefest, and therefore most usefull to teach believers for what, and how to pray.</p>

            <p>And certainly, that injunction of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> is very considerable as to <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13.</note> this, who biddeth him <hi>to hold fast the forme of sound words which he heard of him,</hi> that is, (saith Master <hi>Calvin)</hi> not onely the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but the very form of speech, for the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> signifieth the lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of things, by words properly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to their Nature, which because none can be more adapt and fit then the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Holy Scriptures, therefore the least declining from that form of words is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; So that in these respects, the words of this <hi>Prayer</hi> being deliberate, proper, and pertinent, they will leave a strong and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impression upon the hearers, and as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Calvine</hi> saith, once again, <hi>Unigenitus Dei Filius nobis verba in os suggerit quae mentem nostram omni haesitatione expediant;</hi> The onely Sonne of God hath put such words in our mouths, as may clear our hearts from all doubtings. So that there is certainly great reason to keep exactly to these words,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63641:96"/>
because although there be no peculiar efficacy in them, in respect of God, yet there may be in respect of men; and therefore it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome Expression, to name a charm with that form of Divine words; God give us all grace to heare and obey the voyce of that Charmer, then whom never any charmed more wisely.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> It is to him that knoweth the use of that Language every way as effectual in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or Greek, as in English; yet to him that wants true devotion, there is much difference between the use of a prayer in a known tongue, where possibly the expressions, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary blessings desired by him may inflame his affections, and in an unknown tongue, where in all probability no such effect can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; I think if we should preach all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Latine, and so pray before our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we should do less good upon the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, then we may (by Gods blessing) in English.</p>

            <q>

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The right use of this form never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded or hardned any; nor is it easie to think how any that hath in faith and knowledge u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this <hi>Prayer,</hi> should not also endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for other inlargements. Instruct a poore soul in the right use of this, and there is no such method in the world to fit him for praying in the Holy Ghost; and therefore to oppose the use of this form (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of satisfiing the Conscience therewith) to pray in the Holy Ghost, is no pious or laudable Artifice, as if this <hi>Prayer</hi> were exclusive of the Grace of the Spirit; or as if that Holy Spirit had refused <hi>the waters of Siloah that goe softly,</hi> and chosen to reside in troubled waters and whirle-winds.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. And whether the asserting this forme of words, hath not confirmed many in their Atheisticall blaspheming of the Holy Spirit of God, and his Grace, in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his people.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:63641:97"/>
               <hi>Reply. Cujus contrarium:</hi> This I dare affirm with equal truth and confidence, that not the asserting, but the disusing, and condemning this form of words, hath confirmed many in their Atheistical blaspheming of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and his Grace, in the Prayers of his People.</p>
            <p>I offer this instance, which is notoriously known; When a Minister of God, of great integritie and abilitie (for many such there be beyond all contradiction that use this form) cannot repeat this <hi>Pryaer,</hi> but a great part of his auditors, in some Congregations, instantly conceive an invincible prejudice against both his Person and services, as if there were an impossibility of being edified by them; Can any good thing come out of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> yea, and when some actually withdraw from the Ordinance of Christ (as if the Preaching of the Gospel by such men were foolishness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) this is not far from an Atheistical blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of the Holy Spirit of God and his grace in the Prayers of his People; and this effect hath not been produced by the asserting, but by the laying aside the use of this form in our Prayers, as a fruitless carnall ordinance, which hath made too many of our people to conceit of it as so much <hi>Collquiutida,</hi> that maketh all the Service of God unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>And in my best observation I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver discover that it was the designe of those
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63641:97"/>
that assert this form, to cast any contempt <note place="margin">Hanc ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musque damusque.</note> upon other well-ordered Devotions; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though contrarily, the practice and pleading against the use of this bringeth a certain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect both upon this Forme, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all other Prayers to which this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
            <p>But what if the asserting of a commanded duty doe confirme some in causeless preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices? It is better that others be scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed without our fault, then Christ be disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dishonoured by our fault. The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel is a rock of offence, and a savour of death to many; shall these evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects be charged upon the Gospel as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per products thereof? God forbid! Indeed the wilfull neglect of an injoyned duty, and fixing of contempt upon a Precept of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and upon the universall practice of his Church in all Ages, may make wary Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans jealous of some other practices of such men; for we all know, they have not the Spirit who despise the Word; and it is as well known, that to speak against some opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and practices, which in our genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pretend much to the Spirit, is neither Atheisticall nor blesphemous; I suppose therefore we may safely walke by this rule, Not to judge of our duty by the event, but by the lawfulness thereof, and the authority of its prescription; If any draw an ill conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from good premises, it is his fault, not ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:63641:98"/>
When Christ hath commanded a duty, we must doe it, though all the world should be offended at it: <hi>Fiat justitia, ruat coelum.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen. And whether the repetition of these words, after men have been long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the things contained in them (as the manner of some is) be not so remote from any pretence or colour of warrant in Scripture, as that it is in plain terms ridiculous.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That our Saviour intended we should use other Prayers besides this I doubt not; and what warrant the use of this hath in Scripture, let every Christian Reader judge: I am sure the reviling of this Practice hath none.</p>
            <p>And now, it is too apparent who it is that casteth reproch on this Prayer, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of it is in plain terms pronounced ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; that stomach must be very foul that nauseates manna it self: It cannot be adjudged ridiculous in our Saviour to prescribe this form twice, and how cometh it to be so to use it once? It was not ridiculous in him to use the same words three times on the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 44. Psal. 136.</note> in a great agony; nor in <hi>David</hi> to bless God six and twentie times in the same words annexed to other; Nor is it adjudged ridiculous to use frequent variations of words on the same matter in our Prayers: nor when we have gone over the heads of our Sermons more then once, to recount them again in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63641:98"/>
our Prayers; and yet when we have prayed to God, and being conscious of the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and failings of our Prayers both as to the matter and manner, doe continue them in Christs own words, as a supply of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, this is pronounced in plain termes ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
            <p>The Prophet speaketh of some that have <note place="margin">Psal. 59. 7.</note> swords in their lips; such a sword is this tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the sides of Christs Ministers teacheth his own.</p>
            <p>I end this with a note of Master <hi>Mayer; As a wrestler</hi> (saith he) <hi>having used his best</hi>

expectation of the supply that is promised although I easily believe the Doctor may raise many more scruples, which (as he saith) may be of the like nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but seeing the Doctor hath already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed some time and labour in doing the cause of Christ acceptable service, my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advice is, that he should redeem all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie for those better services, lest by opposing this one sacred Truth, he should hazard all that credit which he hath got in confuting so many dangerous errors.</p>
