            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reverend Author of the
following <hi>Sermons,</hi> was a
Person of that great Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
that among those who knew
him, they need no other Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
than his own Name;
for (besides that they carry in 'em a
certain strain of serious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
Piety, and this imbellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such Clearness and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity,
such strength and vigour
of Expression, such solidity of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and Discourse, as must
<pb facs="tcp:96891:3"/>
have rendered the perusal of them
very pleasant and profitable to all
well-disposed Readers; though their
Author had been Anonymous) besides
which, I say, the truly Pious and
Learned Author of them was a
Person of such great Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both Moral and Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
as would have justly given
Credit, with all that knew his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Excellencies, to much meaner
Performances than these. The main
Objection this degenerous Age had
against him was, that he was a
faithful Son of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and a zealous Asserter
of its Doctrine and Discipline; and
one would think, for a Man to be
true to his Profession, to that
which he hath <hi>ex animo</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
his Iudgment, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:96891:3"/>
his unfeigned Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
it should be so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reputed a Fault, in him, by
those who pretend either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Honesty, or Modesty, that
it should rather be esteemed his
Glory and Excellency. As for his
Conversation, it was in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
so Sober and Regular, so
Pure and Uncorrupt, as that
though he had but little reason
to apprehend himself concerned in
that Denunciation, <hi>Wo be to you
when all Men speak well of
you;</hi> yet so far, as I ever heard,
even those who spoke worst of
him, durst never bespatter him
with an Immorality. He was a
very diligent Pastor of the Flock
committed to his Charge; and
that not only in the course of his
<pb facs="tcp:96891:4"/>
Publick Ministry, from which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some necessary Occasion he very
rarely absented himself, but also
in his private Converses: For
besides that, every Lord's Day
in the Evening, he generally spent a
considerable Portion of time in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
the Youth of his Parish,
(from which Pious and Charitable
Exercise, he very rarely suffered
himself to be diverted, even by the
Visits of his best and greatest
Friends) besides which, I say, his
known Abilities in resolving Cases of
Conscience, drew after him a great
many good People, not only of his own
Flock, but from remoter Distances,
who resorted to him as to a common
Oracle, and commonly went away
from him intirely satisfied in his Wise
and Iudicious Resolutions; and by
<pb facs="tcp:96891:4"/>
these his excellent Qualities and Labours,
he hath not only purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Crown of Glory in Heaven,
but also so indeared his Memory upon
Earth to all that are Virtuous and
Good, that like the Leaves of Roses
still retain their Fragrancy, though
the Rose it self is withered and
dead, and that being dead he may
yet speak to his surviving Auditors,
and that the Memory of his good
Example and Doctrin, may ever
flourish among them; it is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire of his Friends, that these
Sermons of his may be made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
which though they have not that
accomplished Accuracy as they would
have had, had they had his last hand
to them, and been prepared for the
Press by his own skilful Pen, yet as
they are, they are rightly worthy the
<pb facs="tcp:96891:5"/>
Christian Readers perusal, and as
such I recommend them to his View,
and remain his</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psalm lxxvi<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 7.</bibl>
               <q>Thou, even thou art to be feared; and
who may stand in thy sight, when
once thou art angry?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Know no Motives nor Arguments
more likely to awaken Sinners
to their Duty, than a due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Gods Infinite Goodness
and Almighty Power. <hi>Knowest
thou not,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God leadeth thee to Repentance?</hi>
Transcendently great is the Goodness of
God towards poor Sinners. He freely
gave us his Son to Purchase Heaven and
Eternal Happiness for us. He sent down
his Holy Spirit to dwell with us, that
he might sanctifie our corrupt Natures,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96891:6"/>
and make us meet to partake of the
vast Inheritance of the Saints in Light;
and he excites us to a due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of these assistances of the Spirit
by proposing the most glorious Rewards
of Heaven and Eternal Happiness.
Thus God draws Sinners to their Duty
by the bands of Love and the cords of a
Man, that is, by Arguments of such an
obliging Nature, as are most likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with men whom he hath endowed
with Reason and Understanding. But
how few are there who have so much
ingenuity as to be won by kindness?
The greatest part of Mankind must be
treated with severer methods, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the observation of St. <hi>Austin,
Plures sunt quos terror corrigit, pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores
quos allicit amor: Such,</hi> saith he,
<hi>is the corruption and degeneracy of our
Natures, that very few are drawn to
their Duty by the Bands of Love; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of men must be driven to it by
the fears of Punishment.</hi> For this reason
the wiser Heathens made <hi>Hercules</hi> their
God of Power, their God of Eloquence
too; intimating that no Arguments are
more forcible or more prevalent than
those which alarm our fears. Now God,
who is never wanting in any thing that
may conduce to our Salvation, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96891:6"/>
in Scripture frequently to urge
these powerful Arguments upon us.
<hi>Fear-not them,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>who
can do no more than destroy the Body;
but fear him who is able to destroy both
Body and Soul in Hell. Knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the terror of the Lord, we perswade
men,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 11. To the
same end and purpose we find <hi>Asaph,</hi>
the Author of this <hi>Psalm,</hi> magnifying
the power of God in the defeat of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheribs</hi>
Army. <hi>Thou hast broken the
Arrows of the Bow, the Shield, and
the Sword, and the Battel,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>The
Stout hearted are Spoiled, they have slept
their sleep, and none of the Men of Might
have found their Hands,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>At thy
rebuke, O God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>both the Chariot
and Horse are cast into a deep sleep,</hi> ver.
6. Those expressions of our Psalmist
relate unto <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> King of the
<hi>Assyrians;</hi> this Monarchy, in <hi>Daniels</hi>
Vision, is, for its strength, compared
unto the Lion: and it was at its <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith</hi>
in the reign of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> whose
very name signifies a fierce Warrier,
and whose Subjects, the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> are
deservedly stiled by our Psalmist the
Stout-hearted, because, being flush'd by
many Victories they feared neither Man
nor God himself, whom they reviled
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96891:7"/>
in a horrid manner, as appears by the
Blasphemies of <hi>Rabseca:</hi> And yet even
these stout-hearted <hi>Assyrians</hi> were spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the Army of this great Monarch
<hi>Sennacherib</hi> was miraculously defeated,
either by the Pestilence, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
or by a destroying Angel, as the
Scripture relates. Even <hi>Sennacherib</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
tho' then the greatest King upon
Earth, was not able to stand in God's
sight when he was angry; he came to
a fatal end, and was slain in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his God by his own Sons. Nay
farther yet, after his death he had a
Statue erected in the Temple of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
with this pious Lesson inscribed
on it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, that is
in English, <hi>Whosoever beholdeth me, let
him learn Piety.</hi> And since these things
were so, our Psalmist had good reason
to make this Epiphonema in the Text,
<hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared, and
who may stand in thy Sight, when once
thou art Angry?</hi> From the words thus
far explained, I shall take occasion to
shew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there is great reason to
fear the Lord our God. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The vanity of those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which cause most men to shew so
little fear of God in their Lives and
Conversations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96891:7"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let me shew you what great
reason there is to fear the Lord our God,
and this will appear at large by these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> We shall find reason enough
to fear the Lord our God, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his Sovereign Power over all
Creatures, which he is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
at his Pleasure, and make them
revenge his Quarrel upon impenitent
Sinners. As God Almighty by the bare
speaking of a word created all things
both in Heaven and in Earth; so he
can with as much ease command all
Creatures to execute his Wrath and
Vengeance upon Sinners. It is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Eloquent <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that
God, as soon as he had finished the
great work of the Creation, did then,
but not till then, assume the dreadful
Title of Lord of Hosts. And it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observed by others, that this Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Title is mentioned in Scripture more
than two hundred times, the better to
deter Sinners from affronting Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Majesty. It seems the Sinner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make War with Heaven, but he
must at the same time arm the whole
Creation against himself; he cannot fight
against the Almighty, but he must also
fight against all those Creatures which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96891:8"/>
are under the Command of this Lord
of Hosts. The Heathen Poet is able
to tell us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>All the Elements,</hi> saith
he, <hi>are full fraught with Evils, and
ready when God pleaseth to pour forth
ruin and destruction upon Sinners. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> did no sooner kindle
their impure flames, but the Element of
Fire descending in sulphureous Streams,
made them most dreadful Monuments
of Eternal Vengeance. As soon as <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
began to murmur against <hi>Moses,</hi>
the Element of Air mingled Pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Vapours with their Vital Breath, and
chastised their Rebellion with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Plague. When proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together all the strength of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and furiously pursued the Children of
<hi>Israel</hi> to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> the waters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
soon swelled themselves into moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
Billows, as if they had been
proud to be imployed in the service of
Heaven, and the destruction of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi>
The Earth also, as dull and
sensless as it seems to be, is yet able
to resent such indignities as are offered
to the Almighty; and when command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, will open its devouring
Mouth, and swallow down alive <hi>Corah,
Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> Thus all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96891:8"/>
are at Gods command, yea even
rejoyce to be employed by Heaven, in
executing Wrath and Vengeance upon
Sinners. And whither now will the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
fly from this Lord of Hosts? Will
his Alliance with Hell protect him from
the Almighty? Or can he hope to hide
himself from the heat of his fury in
the shades below? No <hi>certes;</hi> he may
as well seek Heaven in Hell as expect one
single beam of comfort from these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Darkness: for from these black
quarters it was that God of old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
an evil Spirit to vex <hi>Saul,</hi> and
drew whole Legions of Devils to punish
the degenerous <hi>Iews</hi> in the days of
our Saviour. Nor does our God rule
only in this sublunary World, in the
Seas and in all deep places, but he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
also in the Heavens. For if the
Almighty doth at any time frown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sinner, each Planet will put on
its Malign Aspect, and every Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall foretel his destiny. Thus the
Stars fought in their Ranks against
<hi>Sisera, and,</hi> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports, <hi>poured
down such prodigious showers of Hail,
as served instead of Shot to destroy his
Army.</hi> Thus also the Sun and Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
fixt Stars in Heaven, that the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
might not want the benefit of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96891:9"/>
light to compleat their Victory over the
<hi>Amorites.</hi> Thus the Elements, the Heavens
and Hell it self are at the Command of
Almighty God; and if there yet be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Forces to fight these Battles
of the Lord, the Angels are still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
those mighty Hosts of Heaven and
standing Militia of the Almighty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
God doth not always draw forth
these <hi>Trainbands</hi> of Heaven; an Army of
Lice serves sometimes to baffle a proud
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and a silly Worm, when commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by God, is able to spoil the
Divinity of a Blaspheming <hi>Herod:</hi> But
when the King of Heaven appears, as it
were, in Person against his Enemies;
then these Courtiers of Heaven attend
the Divine Presence, and putting on their
Robes of Light, add what Lustre they
can to the Majestatick Appearance.
Hence it is that Christ, when he shall
come at the last day to destroy at once
all the Works of Satan, he shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have Angels for his Trumpeters, but
<hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 27. he is said <hi>to come in the
Glory of the Father,</hi> because he shall
come attended with these Glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
And now when all these Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Almighty shall set themselves
in array against the Sinner, when he
shall not only fear with <hi>Cain</hi> lest he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96891:9"/>
fall a prey to every Wild Beast, but
with <hi>Pashur,</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Magor Missabib,</hi> that is, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with fears from all parts of the
Creation, then doubtless he will say with
the Psalmist, <hi>Thou, even thou art to be
feared, and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry?</hi> Our Saviour
in the Parable makes him more stout
than wise, who having only ten thousand,
is not affraid to meet him who comes
against him with twenty thousand: But
sure every Sinner stands guilty of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
greater madness, who with his
single valour dares the Almighty, and
bids defiance to him, who comes not
only with twenty thousand, but with
the whole Universe against him. <hi>O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this all ye that forget God, lest he
pluck you away, and there be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you:</hi> Take our Saviours advice,
send and sue for peace, whilst this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Adversary is but yet on his way:
Labour by your Prayers, your Fasting
and Humiliation to reconcile your selves
to this Lord of Hosts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> We shall find yet more reason
to fear the Lord our God, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
seriously that great power he
exercises over the Souls and Consciences
of men. It is a true Saying of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96891:10"/>
if understood with respect to men, <hi>In
corpore exercentur supplicia, animus ipse
sacer &amp; aeternus est, cui nequeat injici ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
The Sword of Justice which Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Potentates carry before them as the
Ensign of their Power, can only hurt
the Shell of Man; insomuch that the
greatest Tyrants are honoured in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with no higher Titles than <hi>those of
Masters according to the flesh:</hi> For the
Soul or Spirit is far enough out of the
reach of their Power, the Conscience is
secure from their Rage and Fury; and
it is the Prerogative Royal of God, as by
his Omniscience to know the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoughts; so by his Omnipotence
to be able to punish them. When the
Almighty pleases he breaks into the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Recesses of the Soul, and lodges
his revenging Furies in the Inner Man.
And now could we set a Casement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Breast of an <hi>Orestes,</hi> or some
despairing Sinner, and there see those
<hi>ictus</hi> and <hi>laniatus,</hi> those gnawings of the
Worm which prey upon all the Vitals
of the Soul, we should easily grant
with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that an inraged Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is <hi>praejudicium judicii,</hi> the Antedate
of the last Judgment: we might then
see Hell seizing the Wretched Sinner here
upon Earth; at least inflicting some part
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96891:10"/>
of its Torments on this side the Grave.
Such a dreadful Monument of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
was cursed <hi>Cain;</hi> no sooner did
he kill his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> but he became a
wretched Vagabond; he trembled at the
sight of every Beast, saith <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and
was forced to bear such incredible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as he himself confessed <hi>were
greater than he could bear.</hi> It is sad
enough for the <hi>Sinner</hi> to have God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and the whole World against
him, but his condition must needs be
sadder when he becomes a Traytor to
himself, nay more, his own Tormentor.
So much of Truth there is in that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Seneca, Nemini gravius imprecari
potes, quam ut seipsum habeat iratum.</hi>
Thou canst not, saith he, lay an heavier
Curse or imprecation upon any person,
than to wish him angry, or at enmity
with himself. And now, I hope, we
will join with the Psalmist in the
Text, and say, <hi>Thou, even thou, O Lord,
art to be feared; and who may stand in thy
sight when once thou art Angry?</hi> Fearful
we are to offend an earthly King; how
careful of our Words and Behaviour,
lest by Treason or any Misdemeanour
we fall under his Displeasure? But what,
I pray, are Gibbets, Racks, or the most
ingenious Torments they can invent,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96891:11"/>
to the sullen Lashes, and silent Girds of
an inraged Conscience? Let <hi>Solomon,</hi> if
you please, determin this matter, Prov.
18. 14. <hi>The Spirit of a Man,</hi> saith he,
<hi>can bear all his Infirmities, but a wounded
Spirit who can bear?</hi> How many noble
Martyrs have sung and danc'd amidst
the devouring Flames? But what <hi>Iudas,</hi>
what <hi>Spira,</hi> what daring Sinner, was
ever yet able to bear the stings of a
wounded Spirit? What reason then
have we to fear the Lord our God, who
can, when he pleases, wound our Spirits,
and fill our Souls with the ineffable Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of black Despair? But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We shall find yet more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear the Lord our God, if we
consider those most exquisite and eternal
Punishments he is able to inflict both on
the Bodies and Souls of Sinners in the
Lake below. If the bold Sinner has but
courage enough to look beyond the
Grave he will find prepared for him
the eternal <hi>Tophet,</hi> such a dreadful
place of Torments, as is most tragically
described by the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> Chap. 30.
33. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old,</hi> saith
he, <hi>the Pile thereof is Fire and much
Wood, and the Breath of the Lord, like
a stream of Brimstone, doth kindle it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>
See how each word is armed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96891:11"/>
with Thunder! It seems there is Fire in
this eternal <hi>Tophet,</hi> yea there is a great
Pile of Fire. Now how dreadful, how
terrible is Fire? Which the <hi>Persians</hi> of
old were wont to call, <hi>immanissima bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lua,</hi>
a most fierce and devouring Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
And yet this Fire of <hi>Tophet</hi> is no
ordinary Fire; it is no such material
Fire as we have in our Chimneys. For
the Scripture tells us, <hi>it was originally
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
Now the Devil and his Angels being
spiritual Beings, cannot be tormented
by any material or corporeal Fire: The
Fire therefore of <hi>Tophet</hi> must be some
strange metaphorical Fire, such as the
Fire we use is only fit to be made a
cold and faint emblem of it; and we
will the rather believe this, when we
consider that it is said to be kindled by
the Breath of Almighty God. The fiery
Furnace of <hi>Babylon</hi> was dreadful enough,
tho' kindled only by the finite power of
an earthly King: How dreadful then
must the Furnace of Hell be, which has
all the Treasures of Torment infinite
Wisdom could invent? If all this be not
sufficient to make these Torments dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
remember that they are said <hi>to be
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
We know these infernal Fiends are the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96891:12"/>
most inveterate and most malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Heaven; such as did not only at
first endeavour to dethrone their Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Creator, but have ever since imployed
all their malice and subilty to affront
God, and draw Mankind into a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
against him. Sure then that Fire
which was at first prepared for these
inveterate and malicious Enemies of
Heaven, cannot possibly want any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of Torture, either Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
could invent, or Infinite Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict:
And yet such devouring Flames
as these, are not only prepared for the
Devil and his Angels, but likewise for all
impenitent Sinners. How fearful a thing
then will it be <hi>to fall into the Hands of
the Living God?</hi> And yet it will be
more fearful, if we consider the eternity
of all these Torments. For, <hi>in Hell the
Worm never dies, and the Fire shall never
be quenched.</hi> When the Sinner has lain
in Hell as many millions of Ages as
there are Stars in Heaven or Sands on
the Sea-shore, he will be no nearer an
End of his Torments than he was the
first Moment he entred into that place
of Torments. <hi>Who then will not fear
the Lord our God? Who may stand in
his sight when once he is Angry?</hi> But it
seems our Psalmist met with some in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96891:12"/>
his days <hi>who had no fear of God before
their Eyes: who did set their Mouths
against Heaven, and bid defiance to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi>
And are there not still too many
in the World, who discover little or no
fear of God in their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
such, I mean, as are not afraid
to spit in the Face of Heaven by their
drunken Vomits, who profane his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
Name by Oaths and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
deride his Ordinances, and break
his Holy Laws, by their notorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries?
But sure these men have
other apprehensions of the Majesty of
Heaven than our Psalmist had; surely
they frame to themselves such notions of
a Deity, as allow them with <hi>Iehu,</hi> to
drive on furiously in the ways of
wickedness. It will therefore be a
piece of Charity to undeceive these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Wretches, to shew them the
weakness of those Principles they build
upon, and the vanity of those Reasons
which so much emboldens them in their
evil Practices, and this was the Second
General I proposed to speak to. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Atheism is one main Reason
why many discover so little fear of God
in their Lives and Conversations. As
the Belief of a Deity is the Foundation
of all Religion, and he that cometh unto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96891:13"/>
God must first believe that he is, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. So, on the
contrary, Atheism must needs be the
spring and source of all Irreligion and
Profaneness: Hence is that of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
Psal. 14. 1, 2. <hi>The Fool hath said
in his Heart, there is no God;</hi> and then
follows in the next words, <hi>they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
they have done abominable works,
there is none that doth good.</hi> But how
well doth he deserve the Title of a
Fool, who denies the Being of a God,
which the whole Creation is one great
evident and undeniable demonstration
of? This vast and wonderful Fabrick
of Heaven and Earth proclaims with a
loud voice, the infinite Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of that Glorious Being which did
at first Create it. For, as the <hi>Roman</hi>
Orator observed of old, Should a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
come into a strange Country, and
find some vast magnificent Palace there,
tho' he should see nothing but Rats,
Weasels, and such like Creatures in it;
yet he would easily conclude some
Wise and Skilful Architect had been
there: even so <hi>the Heavens declare the
Glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth
his Handy-work?</hi> Hence is that of S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
Rom. 1. 20<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
               <hi>The invisible things of God,
from the Creation, are clearly seen, being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96891:13"/>
understood by the things that are made,
even his Eternal Power and Godhead;
so that they are without excuse.</hi> The
Atheist therefore must needs be in a
very dangerous condition, who denies
that Almighty Being the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth so loudly proclaim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Infidelity of the Scripture
is another great reason why Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
so little fear of God in their
Lives and Conversations. Many there
are that believe a God, who do not
yet believe those dreadful punishments
which are threatned in the Scripture,
and therefore the hopes of impunity
makes them run to all excess of riot. For
when there is an evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
there will be a departing from
the Living God; hence is that advice
of the Apostle, Heb. 3. 12. <hi>Take heed;
Brethren, lest there be in any of you
an Evil Heart of Vnbelief.</hi> And what
better remedy can there be of this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
than a serious consideration of
those Miracles, which were wrought to
confirm our Faith in the Gospel? For
as Miracles are the highest Evidence
Heaven can give; and the Truths of
the Gospel have been confirmed by
many prodigious Miracles; so these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
have been attested both by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96891:14"/>
Friends and Foes. The Universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church, for more than
1600 years, cannot but be a very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Evidence of these Miracles to
all Christians: and yet besides this,
we have the concurrent Testimonies
both of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Pagans. Iosephus,</hi>
the <hi>Iew,</hi> reports of our Saviour, <hi>that
he went about doing good, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Doctrin by Mighty Signs and
Wonders:</hi> Nay farther yet, <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
as <hi>Eusebius</hi> informs us, sent a
large Narrative of our Saviours Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> who laid them
up among the Records of the Empire,
and accordingly they are appealed to
by the Ancient Fathers. Let us not
therefore be any longer faithless, but
believing. We cannot have a surer
Foundation for our Faith, than the
Evidence of Miracles; and he must
needs be a Miracle of Infidelity him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who doth not believe those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which were wrought by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
seeing they have been attested
both by Friends and Foes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to us, not only by <hi>Christians,</hi>
but also by <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall name but one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more, why many men discover so
little fear of God in their Lives and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96891:14"/>
Conversations; and that is a dangerous
opinion they have imbib'd of a state
of Annihilation after death. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Author of the Monstrous <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>
has sadly debaucht this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Age of ours, by teaching <hi>That the
Wicked after Death shall have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
no,</hi> as he tells them, <hi>they
shall return to their Primitive Nothing;
and have no more sense of Pain than
they had before they received their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
A Doctrin this, most fatal to
Piety and Vertue! For if Wicked Men
can once perswade themselves that they
need not fear any severer punishment
after Death than that of Annihilation,
then they will for certain run to all
excess of Riot. For this, and no other
was the use which was made of this
pernicious Doctrin in the days of
St. <hi>Paul;</hi> this and no other, was the
language of <hi>Epicureans</hi> then, as you
may read in 1 Cor. 15. 32. <hi>If the Dead
rise not,</hi> say they, <hi>let us Eat and
Drink, for to morrow we Die.</hi> But what
saith <hi>Solomon</hi> to such Sinners as these,
Eccles. 11. 9. <hi>Rejoyce, O Young Man, in
thy Youth, and let thy Heart chear thee
in the days of thy Youth; walk on in
the ways of thy own Heart, and in the
sight of thine own Eyes: yet know thou
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96891:15"/>
that for all these things God will bring thee
unto Iudgment.</hi> What a dismal day
will the day of Judgment be to such
deluded Sinners? They will then at
least find this Doctrin of Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sadly confuted, when they shall
wish in vain, that they had never
been born; and shall call upon the
Rocks and Mountains to do them so
much kindness, as to crush them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nothing. For certainly the gnawings
of the Worm, and the unquenchable
burnings of Fire denote another state
than that of Annihilation. I hope by
this time you will allow me to say
with the Psamist in the Text, <hi>Thou,
even thou, O Lord, art to be feared.</hi>
Believe it, there is no contending with
Almighty God Let the Potsherds
strive with the Potsherds of the Earth,
but wo unto him that striveth with
his Maker. Cease therefore to do
evil, and learn to do well; perfect
Holiness in this fear of the Lord all
the days of your lives, and then that
God who is able to destroy you, will
be found as able, and much more will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to save you for the Merits of your
dearest Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom,

            <p>ST. <hi>Ierom</hi> says of this Book of
<hi>Revelations,</hi> that it hath as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mysteries as Words; and
St. <hi>Austin</hi> gives a like Character
of it, when he tells us, it will
<hi>exercere mentes legentium,</hi> that is, set their
Wits to work, who set themselves to
read it. But notwithstanding all this,
what is said of the Scripture in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
is also true of this Scripture in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
Namely, that tho' there be
many Floods, yet there are many Fords,
tho' there be many Depths where the
greatest Elephants may swim, yet there
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96891:16"/>
are also some Shallows, where the least
Lambs will be able to wade. In some
places the Holy Spirit soars aloft a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of the Highest, and in
other places he stoops so low, as to
condescend even to the Capacity of
the Meanest: And so he doth here in
the Text, where there are no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to puzzle us, but plain things
to instruct and direct us. The Text
is a part of that Epistle which was sent
by Christ to the Angel of the Church
of <hi>Ephesus. Ephesus</hi> was a large City,
upon which depended several lesser
places, as the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> and
others observe. And according to that
Government Christ had set up in his
Church; there was an Angel or Bishop
constituted to oversee the Flock of
Christ in these places. Hence St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
speaking of the seven Angels which
are mentioned in this Book of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
stiles them the Bishops or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of these seven Churches. Such
a Bishop or Angel was set over the
Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and Antiquity
tells us, <hi>Onesimus</hi> was their Bishop; to
this Bishop or Angel doth Christ send
an Epistle, as may be learn'd from <hi>ver.</hi> 1
of this Chapter, <hi>Vnto the Angel of the
Church of Ephesus, write.</hi> The whole
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96891:16"/>
Epistle, besides the Prologue and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
consists of four Principal Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A commendation of them for
their Labour and Patience, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to suffer them that are Evil,
<hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Reprehension, wherein
they are blamed for leaving their First
Love, and abating something of the
Zeal and Fervour for the Gospel of
Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Exhortation to things of
great Importance here, in the beginning
of the Text, <hi>Remember from whence thou
art fallen, and repent, and do thy first
works.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Commination in the last
words of the Verse, <hi>Else I will come unto
thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick
out of his place.</hi> For the fuller under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of which words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We will first inquire why the
Church of Christ is compared unto a
Candlestick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew you that this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick
may be removed out of his
place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is an heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to have this Candlestick removed
out of his place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Causes of this heavy
Judgment. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96891:17"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Means to prevent it. I
begin,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> With the first of these, Namely,
to enquire why the Church of Christ
is compared unto a Candlestick. That
the Church of Christ is compared
to a Candlestick, is plain from <hi>Chap.
1.</hi> 20. where we are told, that <hi>The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Stars are the Angels of the seven
Churches; and the seven Candlesticks are
the seven Churches.</hi> And well may the
Church of Christ be compared unto a
Candlestick, since it holds forth the
Word of God, which is so often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
unto a Light. <hi>We have a more
sure word of prophesie,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter,
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed,
as unto a light shining in a dark place.</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 19. To the same purpose is
that of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 105. <hi>Thy word
is a lamp unto my feet, and a light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my path.</hi> The World indeed, of it
self, is a very dark place, and stands
in need of Light: It is a dark and
dismal place, in respect of those mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
troubles and miseries which infest
this Life. Now the Word of God is
a Light which helps to scatter and
disperse these Mists of Trouble. So
King <hi>David</hi> found it, Psal. 119. 50.
<hi>This is my comfort in my affliction; thy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96891:17"/>
word has quickned me. The whole world,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Iohn, lieth in wickedness;</hi> and
it were impossible for us to find our
way to Heaven without the light of
God's Word. But God is so gracious,
as to give us his Word to be <hi>a lamp unto
our feet, and a light unto our paths.</hi>
How ought we then to prize and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the Church of God, which is no
less than the Light of the World; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the direction whereof, we must
have wandred up and down the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
and never have found out the
way to <hi>Canaan!</hi> There is no Salvation
out of the Church, <hi>Nec erit illi Deus
Pater, cui non est Ecclesia Mater; God,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Cyprian, will not be his Father,
who doth not own the Church for his
Mother.</hi> Had we been born without
the Pale of the Church, we had been
Aliens from the Commonwealth of
<hi>Israel;</hi> Strangers to the Covenant of
Promise, without God, without Christ,
and without Hope in this World. Sure
then we who are born within the Pale
of God's Church, and enjoy the glorious
Light of the Gospel, should rejoyce in
this Light, and learn to Prize and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
it; otherwise we may be deprived
of it, and lose all the advantages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as will appear by considering the
Second General.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96891:18"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Which is to shew that this
Candlestick may be removed out of his
place. This is plain from the words
of the Text, where we have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speaking thus to the Church of
<hi>Ephesus, Except thou repent, I will
come unto thee quickly, and remove thy
Candlestick out of his place.</hi> Christ's
Church therefore may fail and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd.
But for the more distinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of this point, we must carefully
distinguish of Christ's Catholick and
Universal Church, and of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church of Christ, seated in some
particular Kingdom or Nation; as the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Church of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the
like. Now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> It is certain in the first place,
that the Catholick or Universal Church
can never fail, and be totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished;
this larger Candlestick shall
never be removed. We have several
promises in Scripture, which assure us
of the perpetuity of Christ's Church,
and that it shall continue even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the World. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
promises his Apostles, Mat. 28.
ult. <hi>Lo, I am with you always, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the world.</hi> And again, Mat.
16. 18. it is said, <hi>that Christ has built
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96891:18"/>
his Church upon a Rock, and the gates of
Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi> Thus
firm and stable is the Catholick Church,
as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speakes elegantly, <hi>it may
be assaulted, but not defeated; it may
be distressed, but not destroyed; it may
be wounded, but it shall not fall; it may
be tossed, but not wreck'd; it may, and
shall be militant, but yet never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Tho' the Catholick and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Church be thus stable and
perpetual, yet no particular Church can
claim this priviledge: The Church of
any particular Place or Nation, may
utterly fail, and have its Candlestick
removed from it. This is threatned in
the Text to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
and has been the sad fate of several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particular Churches. For where
are those many Famous Churches in
<hi>Africa,</hi> which were so glorious and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in the days of St. <hi>Austin?</hi> Where
are those seven Golden Candlesticks,
those seven Famous Churches of <hi>Asia</hi>
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> mentions in the three first
Chapters of this Book of <hi>Revelations?</hi>
Are they not utterly ruin'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?
And dwells there any thing
in these places but Ignorance, Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Mahumetanism? Thus ye see it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96891:19"/>
is most plain, that tho' the Catholick
shall never fail, yet the Church of
any particular Place and Nation may.
Tho' he will not remove his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
quite out of the World, but will
always have a Church in some place
or other; yet it is not certain it shall be
in this or that Nation: He may remove
his Candlestick from <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi>
or any other particular Nation, which
has filled up the measure of their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In such a case he deals with them
as our Saviour threatens to deal with
the <hi>Iews,</hi> Mat. 21. 43. <hi>Therefore I say
unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be
taken from you, and given to a Nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> Thus
Christ threatned, and because the <hi>Iews</hi>
did not repent, he dealt with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
for they are now become <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammi,</hi>
no more a People, but wrath is
come upon them to the uttermost. I
cannot dismiss this point, without an
Inference or two. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> If every particular Church may
fail, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is vain
in boasting so much of her Perpetuity
and Indefectibility. We know she is
but a part of the Catholick Church, and
a very corrupt part of it too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in vain do they fancy, <hi>that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96891:19"/>
gates of Hell shall never prevail against
them.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives them better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
Rom 11. 21, 22. <hi>Be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but fear; for of God spared not the
natural branches, take heed lest he also
spare not thee.</hi> This Epistle, ye know,
is written to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
if this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had been Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
and Perpetual, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
fail'd in his Logick; for he makes
them subject to the same fate which
befell the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that they might
fail as well as they had done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Since particular Churches may
fail, then this should make them study
their preservation, and use such means
as may be effectual to that purpose.
If the Professors of Christianity, in any
Nation, shall become vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
exchanging plain and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Truth, for fond Speculations and
Opinions; if they shall turn Factious
and Schismatical, neglecting their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Guides and Pastors; if they be
Dissolute in their Manners, and confute
their Religion by their Lives; they will
provoke God to remove his Candlestick,
and bring confusion upon them. Christ
is so far from promising safety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to any particular Church and
People, who neglect their own safety
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96891:20"/>
that he threatens ruin and destruction
to them, <hi>except thou repentest, I will come
unto thee quickly, and remove thy Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
out of his place.</hi> How careful then
should we, of this Nation, be to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Gospel among us, left God
carry it away from us unto a People
that will better bring forth the fruits
thereof? And to excite us all to this
study and carefulness, I proceed in the
third place to,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Shew you, that it is an
heavy Judgment to have this Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
removed out of his place. It is
in the Text threatned as an heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Except
thou repent,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>I will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee quickly, and remove thy Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
out of his place.</hi> So our Saviour
threatens it as an heavy Judgment unto
the <hi>Iews,</hi> Mat. 21. 43. <hi>Therefore I say
unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be
taken from you, and given to a Nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> And
the greatness of the Judgment will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at large from these following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> It deprives a Nation of its chiefest
Honour. As it is the highest Honour
in this World to be related to an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King, so it is a much higher Honour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96891:20"/>
to be related to the King of Kings.
Hence is that of the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi>
Chap. 43. 4. <hi>Since thou wast precious in
my sight, thou hast been honourable.</hi> Now
all this Honour is lost, when once a
Nation loseth its Relation to God. Thus
God dealt with the <hi>Iews,</hi> Hosea 1. 9.
<hi>Then said God, call his name Lo-ammi,
for ye are not my People, and I will
not be your God.</hi> When God removes
his Candlestick, and rejects a Nation
from being his People, they become then
as contemptible as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi>
as vile and despicable as the <hi>Iews</hi> have
been in the World ever since God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
them for his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> This heavy Judgment does also
deprive a Nation of God's special care
and providence. We know God's Church
and People are as dear to him as the
Apple of his Eye; and he is, as he has
promised, <hi>a Wall of Fire round about
them.</hi> Now a Wall of Fire is both
Defensive and Offensive, and denotes
that God by his special Providence does
not only defend his chosen People, but
also offends and destroys their Enemies.
Behold, saith the Psalmist, Psal. 33. 18.
<hi>Behold,</hi> take notice of this, saith he,
namely, <hi>that the Eye of the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that fear him:</hi> Of these he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96891:21"/>
takes a special Care, and exercises a
most tender and watchful Providence
over them, <hi>to deliver their Soul from
Death, and to keep them alive in the
time of Famine:</hi> thus happy are the
People <hi>whose God is the Lord.</hi> But if
by our Sins we provoke God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
our Candlestick out of his place,
and reject us from being his People,
then shall we lose our right and title
to this his special Care and Providence;
we shall soon then become a prey unto
our Enemies, a reproach and by word
to all that are round about us. When
the Jewish Nation had filled up the
Measure of their Iniquity, a Dreadful
Voice was heard in their Temple, saying,
<hi>Migremus hinc, migremus hinc,</hi> let us go
hence, let us go hence; intimating that
God and his Holy Angels were then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from them, and withdrawing
their Care and Providence over them:
And presently after this the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Desolation was brought upon
them, so that they have ceased ever
since, not only to be the Church and
People of God, but also to be a Nation;
being scattered and dispersed up and
down the World, and hated in all
places. But this will appear yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:96891:21"/>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> To be an heavy Judgment, if we
consider that the Holy Ghost in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
esteems it an heavier Judgment
than others are. Adversity and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
are heavy Judgments, and yet but
light in comparison of this. So much
may be gathered from Isaiah 30. 20. <hi>Tho'
the Lord give you the Bread of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and the Water of Affliction: yet shall
not thy Teachers be removed into a corner
any more; but thine Eyes shall see thy
Teachers, and thine Ears shall hear a
Voice behind thee, saying, this is the
way, walk in it.</hi> Tho' oppression and
Adversity be heavy burthens, yet are
they nothing to the loss of Teachers, and
the deprivation of God's Ordinances. So
long as God's Candlestick shines amongst
us, and we enjoy the great advantages
of Prayers, Sermons and Sacraments,
other Judgments may the better be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with. Famine is another very
sore Judgment; when this rages, God
is said <hi>to march through the Land in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,</hi>
Hab. 3 12. and we will not
stick to believe it, when we consider the
direful effects and consequences of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
We read in our Chronicles that
there was formerly such a dreadful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in this Island, that when Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
were lead out of Prison towards
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96891:22"/>
the place of Exeeution, the poor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
People would presently fall upon
them, and tearing them in peices, eat
them up. And we will not wonder at
it, when we read Ezek. 5 10. <hi>Of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eating up their Sons, and Sons their
Fathers:</hi> And which is stanger and
more unnatural yet, we find Lamen.
4 10. <hi>Tender compassionate Women,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the extremity of hunger, <hi>to
seeth their own Children.</hi> These are
horrid instances of a dreadful Judgment,
and yet we have a sadder instance of
it; and Famine is said to be such a
devourer, as causes a man to devour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as you may read Isai. 9. 20. where
every man is brought in <hi>eating the
Flesh of his own Arm.</hi> Thus great and
heavy a Judgment is Famine; yea,
by some it is thought to be one of the
sorest Heaven can inflict; and yet it is
inferiour to this of the Text, when God
in wrath <hi>removes our Candlestick out of
his place;</hi> when he takes his Gospel
away from us, and deprives us of all
the priviledges and advantages of his
Holy Ordinances. No less than this is
asserted, Amos 8. 11, 12. <hi>Behold, the
days come, saith the Lord God, that
I will send a Famine in the Land, not
a Famine of Bread, not a thirst of Water,
but of hearing the Word of the Lord,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96891:22"/>
And they shall wander from Sea to Sea,
and from the</hi> North <hi>even to the</hi> East
<hi>shall they run to and fro, to seek the
Word of the Lord, and shall not find
it.</hi> Thus a Famine of the Word is a
sorer Judgment than the Famine of
Bread; and well indeed it may, since
the one destroys only the Body, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destroys the Soul. If the Light of the
Gospel be taken away, worse than <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
darkness will ensue, such as will
cause us to fall, and that into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
Pit, from whence there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
Thus I have dispatched the
three Generals, and shewn you that 'tis
an heavy Judgment to have our <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
removed out of his place.</hi> For this
heavy Judgment deprives a Nation of
its Chiefest Honour, and makes them
become <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> or no people: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
them also of God's special Care
and Providence, and renders them an
easie prey unto their Enemies. And,
lastly, it surpasses the sorest of God's
Judgments; and a Famine of Bread is far
more tolerable than a Famine of the
Word. These Considerations, if any,
will teach us to value God's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at an higher rate than formerly we
have, and excite our greatest care and
diligence to prevent such an heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96891:23"/>
as this; and to help us to perform
this Duty the better, I come in the
fourth place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Briefly to consider some of
those Causes which bring such an heavy
Judgment upon a Nation. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Sin is the General Cause of
this heavy Judgment; we need no other
proof of this than the Text it self,
where Christ bids the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
remember from whence she had fallen,
and repent, and do the first works.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but our Iniquities can separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our God and us; if we do
not repent of them, they will be our
ruin. For God will not continue his
Gospel to a backsliding and disobedient
People, but will take it away, and give
it to a Nation that will better bring forth
the Fruits thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The contempt of God's Word
and his Messengers is another Cause
of this heavy Judgment. This may
easily be gathered from 2 <hi>Chron.
36.</hi> 15, 16. Where we are told, that the
Lord God sent to the <hi>Iews by his
Messengers, rising up betimes, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because he had compassion on
his People, and on his dwelling Place.
But they mocked the Messengers of
God, and despised his Words, and misu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96891:23"/>
his Prophets, until the wrath of the
Lord arose against his People, till there
was no remedy.</hi> So <hi>Amos</hi> 8. where the
Prophet threatens them with <hi>a Famine
of the Word,</hi> he assigns this among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reasons, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. namely, because
<hi>they prophaned his Sabbaths, and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Ordinances.</hi> And indeed when a
Nation undervalues the Light of the
Gospel, and judg themselves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, it is but just with God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
their Candlestick, and carry his
Gospel to a People more worthy of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Schisms and Divisions are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
grand Cause of this heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Historians tell us, that this was
it which opened the way to the <hi>Turks</hi>
and <hi>Saracens</hi> to overflow the Eastern
Churches, and let <hi>Mahumetanism</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World. It was this which brought
that deluge of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and
other barbarous Nations upon the <hi>West:</hi>
And indeed we need not wonder at it,
since S. <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, Chap. 3. 16. <hi>That
where envying and strife is, there will
be confusion and every evil work.</hi> Thus
I have dispatched the fourth General,
and shewn you some of those Causes
which provoke God to remove his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick
from a People and Nation. Sin
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96891:24"/>
in the General is the Cause of it: In
particular the contempt of God's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
and his Ordinances, and those
Schisms and Divisions which rage in a
Nation: And if we should now reflect
upon our selves, I fear we should find
so much wickedness and debauchery
raging in the Land; such gross propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of God's Sabbaths, contempt of
his Messengers and his Ordinances, and
withal so many dangerous Schisms and
Factions amongst us, as may justly
cause us to dread the heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Text. But I will not
foretel your danger, but exhort
you to prevent it, and that by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as the Text directs. Which</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> brings me to the fifth and last
General proposed, which is, to shew you
the Means to prevent this heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now this cannot better be
learned, than from that advice Christ
gives the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in this
place <hi>remember therefore from whence
thou art fallen, and repent, and do the
first works.</hi> Repentance therefore is the
best means we can take to appease
God's Wrath, and prevent his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
If we repent of the evil of
our ways, God also will repent of the
evil we have reason enough to fear he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96891:24"/>
is bringing upon us. Hear what is said
to this purpose in the Prophet, Jer. 3.
12. <hi>Return, O back sliding</hi> Israel, <hi>saith
the Lord, and I will not cause mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to fall upon you, for I am merciful.</hi>
What a gracious motive is here urged?
What will perswade us to repent, if
the hopes of Mercy will not? In what
a sad condition should we be, if God
should remove our Candlestick out of
his place; if he should take away his
glorious Gospel from us, and deprive
us of all the advantages and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his Holy Ordinances? Indeed
our sins call aloud for such heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Our Superiours both in Church
and State have acknowledged for us,
that prophane Swearing, Perjury, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and a violation of God's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
have sadly made this Land to
mourn. And may we not add, a great
contempt of God's Word, a misu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his Messengers, a slighting of his
Ordinances, besides those Factions and
Schisms which abound among us? And
may not God justly visit for these
things? Oh then it is time that we
should all smite upon our Breasts, and
return unto the Lord with humiliation
and repentance, that our iniquities may
not be our ruin, but every kind of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96891:25"/>
Repentance will not serve the turn: the
Greek word in the Text is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
which <hi>Lactantius</hi> translates <hi>mutationes
mentis in melius,</hi> that is, a change of
the Mind from worse to better; not a
change of the Looks, or hanging down
the Head like a Bullrush, for all this
may be done by a Pharisee or an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.
It is not a change of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
or a putting on of Sackcloath;
for such humiliation and repentance may
be performed by a wicked <hi>Ahab;</hi> but
the Repentance of the Text denotes a
real change of the Mind; or as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ioel</hi> describes it, <hi>a turning unto the
Lord with all our Hearts,</hi> Chap. 2. 12. Such
a Repentance as this, will make us fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in every good word and work, and
pay an universal Obedience to all God's
Commandments; it will make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our Lives, honour God's Gospel,
value his Ordinances, and have no hand
in the encouraging those Schisms and
Divisions which are amongst us: This
is the Repentance Christ recommends;
and if it be carefully Practised by us
we may prevent the heavy Judgment
of the Text, and procure the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Gospel amongst us; which
God Almighty grant for the sake of
Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a Famous Dispute among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Protestants, where St.
<hi>Peter</hi> was when he wrote this
and his former Epistle: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
would have him to be at <hi>Rome,</hi>
that they may the better establish
their Papal Monarchy, and derive
the Succession of their Bishops from
that great Apostle. But St. <hi>Peter</hi>
himself tells us that he was at <hi>Babylon</hi>
1 Pet. 5. 13. <hi>The Church that is at</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
<hi>elected together with you, salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
you.</hi> Indeed St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his Book of the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> takes <hi>Babylon</hi> in a mystical
sense for <hi>Rome,</hi> which well became his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetick
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96891:26"/>
and mystical style; but there is
no reason to believe that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who,
in these Epistles writes no Prophesie, but
only plain Instruction, for the dispersed
<hi>Iews,</hi> should take <hi>Babylon</hi> in any other
than a Literal Sense, namely for that
Antient and famous City which was
the Metropolis of <hi>Chaldea;</hi> and indeed
there are sundry Arguments to induce
this belief. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who about this time
wrote this Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> makes
no mention at all of St. <hi>Peters</hi> being
then at <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithstanding he sends
Commendation to all that were of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency
in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is agreed on by both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Protestants, that the Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the <hi>Iews</hi> was in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
committed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as that of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> This St.
<hi>Ierom</hi> calls <hi>Principale Mandatum,</hi> the
main of their Commission; from whence
it necessarily follows, that St. <hi>Peters</hi>
chief imployment must be where the
greatest numbers of <hi>Iews</hi> were. Now
it is certain that <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Chaldea</hi> was
the place where the <hi>Iews</hi> resided in
greatest numbers after their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> directs his Epistles
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96891:26"/>
to the <hi>Iews</hi> scattered throughout <hi>Pontus,
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
which all belonged to the Jurisdiction
of the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> writing to these
dispersed <hi>Iews,</hi> rehearseth several Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
where they resided, as <hi>Pontus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,
Cappadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> but
leaves out <hi>Chaldea,</hi> where they resided
in greatest numbers, which he would
never have done, had not <hi>Chaldea</hi> been
the place from whence he wrote these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles.
I shall add but one Argument
more, from <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 2. where we are told,
that <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> commanded all the
<hi>Iews</hi> to depart from <hi>Rome;</hi> so that we may
conclude St. <hi>Peter</hi> would not keep his
residence there, where he wanted his
Flock committed to his Charge; and
therefore it is more rational to believe he
resided at <hi>Babylon,</hi> where vast numbers
of the <hi>Iews</hi> resided also. I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
thus much to prove that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
wrote these two Epistles from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
in <hi>Chaldea;</hi> because it will follow
from hence, that the Papists have not
one Text of Scripture to found their
belief of St. <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> tho'
on it depends their whole Papal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
For this is the only Text they
pretend to, and you see how little it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96891:27"/>
makes for their purpose, so that they
have nothing but human Testimony to
build this great Article of their Faith
upon, and that such as is derived from
<hi>Papias,</hi> a weak, credulous person, as
<hi>Eusebius</hi> stiles him. By this time you
will in some measure understand the
Place from which, and the Persons to
whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes; and being short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he tells them, <hi>to put off his Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tabernacle,</hi> we need not doubt the
excellency of those Instructions he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths
to the <hi>Iews:</hi> All which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with the most important words
of the Text, <hi>Grow in Grace.</hi> For the
better understanding of which,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We will first consider the Duty
it self, <hi>Grow in Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will enquire what is that
degree or stature of Grace a Christian
must grow to before he can assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether any farther growth
in Grace be attainable in this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What Reasons and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
we have to endeavour after
the highest degrees of Grace. I begin
with the first of these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Namely to consider the Duty
it self, which is to <hi>Grow in Grace.</hi> A
Christians life must be a continual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96891:27"/>
in Holiness; he must not with
<hi>Hercules,</hi> erect his Pillars, and write a
<hi>non ultra</hi> upon them, saying hitherto will
I go and no farther: for true Grace is
of a growing and multiplying Nature;
so that the good Christian must not be
content with his present attainments,
but with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he must always be
pressing forward, forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth
unto those things which are before. To
this purpose is that Character <hi>Solomon</hi>
gives of the just Man, Prov. 4 18. <hi>The
Paths of the Iust is as the Shining Light,
that shineth more and more unto the perfect
Day.</hi> He is not like <hi>Iosuahs</hi> Sun that
stood still in the Firmament, much less
like <hi>Hezekiahs,</hi> which went ten degrees
backward; but he is like <hi>Davids</hi> Sun
<hi>which cometh forth as a Bridegroom out
of his Chamber, and rejoyceth as a Giant
to run his Race.</hi> Now this growth in
Grace denotes at least these two blessings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The getting all sorts of Graces;
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Serious endeavours after the
highest degrees of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> This growth in Grace denotes
the getting all sorts of Graces. It is a
known Maxim in Philosophy, <hi>aucto toto
augetur quaelibet pars,</hi> in the Natural
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96891:28"/>
Growth of Plants, when the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
every part increaseth also; and
the Maxim holds in Spiritual Growths
too: For all the Faculties of the Soul
are improved together, and the New
Creature must be adorned with all sorts
of Vertue. To this purpose is that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Cicero, Omnes virtutes inter se
nexae conjugataeque sunt,</hi> all the Vertues,
saith he, are linked and joyned together,
so that he that has one, must have them
all. Hence we find Christ's Spouse in the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> compared to a pleasant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
which is adorned with great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Flowers, and perfum'd with all
sorts of Fragrant Spices; thus <hi>the Kings
Daughter must be all Glorious within.</hi>
The good Christian that will grow in
Grace must be possessed with all sorts of
Virtues, according to that exhortation
our Apostle gives, Chap. 1. 5. <hi>Give all
diligence,</hi> saith he, <hi>and add to your Faith,
Vertue; and to Vertue, Knowledge; and to
Knowledge, Temperance; and to Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Patience; and to Patience, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and to Godliness, Brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to Brotherly Kindness, Charity.</hi>
All these Vertues must dwell together;
and that man hath none of them, who
has them not all in some degree and
measure. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96891:28"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Growth in Grace, as
it denotes the getting all sorts of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
so it denotes our serious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
after the highest degrees of
them. As the growing Christian must
add Vertue to Vertue, and pile one
Grace upon another; so he must not sit
down with some lower attainments, but
advance to the highest pitch and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of every Grace. I need not tell you
that there are several degrees in every
Grace and Vertue, the number of which
is variously reported by Learned Men.
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> that Prince of Philosophers,
reckons but eight; <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen;
<hi>Iohannes Climachus</hi> doubles the
number, and makes them Thirty. But
these Great Men do all fall short of
the truth, for there cannot be fewer
than infinite degrees in every Vertue;
seeing God Almighty possesses them all
in infinite degrees of Perfection. Now
this is the Pattern which is proposed to
the Christians imitation: For as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
speaks, he must endeavour to be
perfect even as his Heavenly Father is
perfect. Sure then he must endeavour
to grow very high, who is to grow as
high as Heaven; he must not be content
with low attainments, who is to imitate
the infinite Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96891:29"/>
Thus the Righteous must hold
on in his way, and he that hath clean
Hands, must wax stronger and stronger,
according to the advice of St. <hi>Ierom;</hi> it
must be his constant study to <hi>grow in
Grace</hi> as he grows in Years. Like the
Vine to which the Holy Ghost so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
compares him, he must know
no other period of his growth, than
that of his Life; and like <hi>Caleb,</hi> must
be active and vigorous, even at eighty
years of Age. The serious Christian
still finds something that needs to be
amended; something also decayed he
must be careful to repair, and something
not yet attained he must press hard after.
As the diligent Bee flies from Flower
Flower, that it may gather greater plenty
and abundance of Hony; so the serious
Christian goes from Duty to Duty, and
from Ordinance to Ordinance, out of a
longing desire to gain higher degrees of
Grace. To this purpose is that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
the Psalmist gives of a Righteous
Man, Psal. 92. 12. &amp;c. <hi>The Righteous
shall flourish like the Palm-Tree; he shall
grow like a Cedar in</hi> Lebanon; <hi>those
that be planted in the House of the Lord,
shall flourish in the Courts of our God.
They shall still bring forth Fruit, yea
even in Old Age; they shall be fat and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96891:29"/>
flourishing.</hi> What elegant and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Expressions are these! Here is not
only mention of growing, but of Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
too, and here is Flourishing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
no less than three times, and it is
the flourishing not of an ordinary
Tree, but of a Palm tree, which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for its Flourishing under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest
burthens: Nay further, it is flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
like a Cedar, and that not grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a barren Wilderness, but in <hi>Lebanon</hi>
it self, where the Best, the Goodliest,
the Tallest Cedars grew: Nor is he said
only to Flourish in Boughs and Leaves;
but also in Fruit; and that not for one
year only; but the Righteous Man is
still bringing forth Fruit, and that not
only in the Years of his Youth, or the
beginning of Grace, but in Old Age too.
What a Divine Climax, what an Elegant
Gradation is here used by the Holy
Ghost to represent the continual grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of a Righteous Man in Vertue! He
is still climbing higher and higher, till
he climbs as high as Heaven. Thus have
I considered the Duty it self, <hi>Grow in
Grace.</hi> And come now in the Second
place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> to enquire what is that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or Stature of Grace a Christian
must grow to, before he can assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96891:30"/>
of Eternal Salvation. I have shewn
already, that the degrees of Grace and
Vertue are no less than Infinite; so many
indeed, that the best of Christians may
more easily endeavour after them than
ever perfectly acquire or attain them.
But notwithstanding all this, there are
certain degrees of Grace, which must
be attained to, before a Christian can
have any comfortable assurance of his
Eternal Salvation. There is such a state
of Holiness and Perfection he must grow
to in this Life, before he can have any
evidence of his Title to a better Life.
Now for your better information in this
important Point, I shall shew you these
two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there is a certain growth in
Grace attainable in this World, which is
sufficient to assure us of Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What this saving growth in
Grace imports.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let me shew you, that there is
a certain growth in Grace attainable in
this World, which is sufficient to assure
us of Eternal Salvation. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells
us, Prov. 4. 18. <hi>That the Path of the
Iust is as the shining Light, which shineth
more and more unto the perfect Day.</hi>
There is therefore a perfect Day of
Grace the Just Man may arrive at; and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96891:30"/>
this will receive farther light from those
Elegant Expressions of our Apostle, 2
Pet. 1. 19. <hi>We have,</hi> saith he, <hi>a more
sure word of Prophesie, whereunto ye do
well, that ye take heed, as to a Light
shining in a Dark Place, until the Day
dawn; and the Day-Star arise in your
Hearts.</hi> It is plain from hence, that
the Day-Star of Grace doth arise in the
Hearts of Believers in this Life, such as
will be sufficient to bring us to Heaven.
It is yet a clearer proof of this, which
you'l find <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. where St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, that Christ at his Ascention
gave <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Teachers,</hi> for the edifying of
the Church, and the perfecting of the
Saints, till we all come in the unity of
the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the
Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto
the measure of the stature of the fulness
of Christ: From hence it is plain, that
there is a just and full stature Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may grow to in this Life; they may
come to the Perfect Man, that is, to
such degrees of Grace, to such a state
of Evangelical, tho' not Legal or Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Perfection, as will be sufficient to
carry them to Heaven. As in natural
growths Men have a fixt and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
stature to which they arrive;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96891:31"/>
so in spiritual growths there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
stature too, which, when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at, we become perfect Men, and
Compleat Christians, that is, such as
are infallibly in a state of Salvation.</p>
            <p>Thus I have shewn you, that there
is a certain growth of Grace attainable
in this Life, which is sufficient to assure
us of Eternal Salvation. I come now
in the second place to shew you, what
this saving Growth in Grace imports,
and that both Negatively and Positively.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> It doth not import an absolute
freedom from all sin, but is consistent
with sins of ignorance and infirmity.
There is no state of absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on this side the Grave; for there is
Dung in all our Sacrifices, and our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Righteousness is as filthy Rags. As
the best Grain hath its Chaff; and the
brightest Marble its Spots and Flaws; so
the best of Christians want not a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of sin; and the highest Saints have
some allay of Original Corruption.
Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>the justest
man falls seven times a day;</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
tho' the beloved Disciple, comprehends
himself in those expressions of his, <hi>1
Iohn 1. 8. If we say that we have no sin,
we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96891:31"/>
in us.</hi> Plain therefore it is, that sins
of ignorance and infirmity are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with this saving growth in Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> This saving growth in Grace, is
also consistent with some falls into wilful
and presumptuous sins. Thus <hi>David,</hi>
a man after Gods own Heart, was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Pride in Numbering the People; of
Adultery also and Murder, which he
himself calls presumptuous sins; and yet
recovered himself into a state of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by this timely Repentance. Thus
also the Prodigal, in the Parable, was
upon his Repentance, reinstated in his
Fathers Favour: so that willful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
sins, if repented of, are
consistent with this saving growth in
Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Saving growth in Grace denotes
such an habitual obedience to all God's
Holy Laws, as allows no continuance
or practice in any known sins. St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
gives a true Character of a Child of
God, 1 John 3. 9. <hi>Whosoever is born of
God,</hi> saith he, <hi>committeth not sin,</hi>
that is, he doth not live in the practice
of any known willful and deliberate sin:
And this he illustrates by the contrary
Character, of a Child of the Devil,
vers. 8. <hi>He that committeth sin, is of the
Devil, for the Devil sinneth from the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96891:32"/>
beginning,</hi> that is, goes on in a constant
trade and practice of wickedness without
repentance. He therefore that is a Child of
God, and has attained to a saving growth
in Grace, is one that doth not sin after
this manner; through the main tenor of
his Life he pays a sincere obedience to
all the Laws of God; his Actions are
generally innocent and laudable; and
when at any time, like <hi>David,</hi> he falls
into presumptuous sins, as he doth so
very seldom, so he always declares his
abhorrence of them by a speedy and
suitable repentance. Thus I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
the second General, and shewn
you what is that degree or stature of
Grace a Christian must grow to, before
he can assure himself of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I come now in the third Place to
inquire,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether any farther growth in
Grace be attainable in this Life, than what
is just necessary to eternal Salvation:
And indeed if it were not so, all God's
Saints would be of the same size and
stature, they would all be equal as to
their degrees and measures of Grace.
But tho' all of them have enough to
carry them to Heaven, yet there is a
difference in their attainments, and some,
like <hi>Saul,</hi> are taller than the rest by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96891:32"/>
Head and Shoulders. For every Saint
has not the pleriphory or strong Faith of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the Meekness of <hi>Moses,</hi> the
patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> the zeal of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> the
temperance of <hi>Timothy,</hi> or the diligence
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who is said to have <hi>laboured
more abundantly than the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi>
All indeed have so much
Grace as is necessary to Salvation, yet
it seems they have not all the same
eminent degrees and measures of Grace.
Some with their Pound, do only gain
five; others by their greater diligence,
gain ten pounds, as we have it in the
known Parable: And for this reason
God is pleased to promise higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Glory, proportionable to those
higher degrees of Grace men attain to
in this Life. Some shall have their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolae,</hi>
as the Schoolmen speak, that is
larger Crowns of Glory than ordinary
Saints shall wear, and those adorned
with peculiar Ensigns of Honour, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 2 Cor. 9. 6. <hi>He that
soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly;
and he that soweth abundantly, shall reap
abundantly;</hi> both it seems shall reap
and receive the rewards of their pious
labours, but yet in different degrees,
according to their different services in
this World. He that gains but five
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96891:33"/>
Pounds shall be made Ruler over five
Cities; whilst he that gains ten Pounds
shall be made Ruler over ten Cities.
There is therefore a further growth in
Grace attainable in this Life, than what
is just necessary to Salvation The
Christian therefore, who hath arrived at
this saving growth in Grace, is bound
still to advance higher, and endeavour
after further Improvements in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Vertue: For we are enjoyned,
not only to do the Work of the Lord,
but to abound in it; not only to grow
in Grace, but also to grow till we be
perfect, even as our Heavenly Father is
perfect. Here therefore is work enough
cut out to employ all our faculties for
ever; and tho' we should be growing
in Grace to all Eternity, we shall still
fall short of that Infinite Standard of
Perfection, whereunto we are obliged
to aspire. But tho' we are not able to
reach the Infinite Perfections of God,
yet by our greater watchfulness over
our selves, by our more frequent Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
fervent Devotions, zealous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on Ordinances, and eminent works
of Charity; by these and such like He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Exploits, we shall more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resemble God, and obtain a larger
share of Happiness: Whereas those that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96891:33"/>
content themselves with such a lower
growth as is just necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shall not indeed forfeit Heaven, but
only those higher degrees of Happiness
which are to be enjoyed there. Thus I
have dispatched the third General, and
shewn you, that there is a further growth
in Grace attainable in this Life, than
what is just necessary to Salvation. I
come now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the fourth place to shew
you what Reasons and Encouragements
we have to endeavour after the highest
degrees of Grace. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Our serious endeavours after the
highest degrees of Grace, will be an
excellent means to preserve that saving
growth in Grace the pious Christian has
already attain'd to. There is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Opinion in the World, that a man
cannot totally and finally fall away
from Grace. According to these mens
sentiments, he that is once sincerely
Righteous, will infallibly hold on and
persevere unto the end. Now if this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
were true, this exhortation would
be vain. But certainly nothing can be
more contrary to the plain Doctrine of
the Scripture: Hear what St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith,
Chap. 1. of this Epistle, vers. 10. <hi>Give
all dilligence,</hi> saith he, <hi>to make your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96891:34"/>
and Election sure; for if you do these
things you shall never fall.</hi> You see he
puts an <hi>if</hi> in the case, such as fairly
implies, that we may neglect our Duty,
and fall from our own stedfastness. For
the same reason St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Caution, Rom. 11. 20. &amp;c. <hi>Be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
but fear; for if God spared not
the natural branches, take heed lest he
also spare not thee.</hi> Behold therefore
the goodness and severity of God; on
them which fall severity; but towards
thee goodness, if thou continue in his
goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be
cut off. But a fuller confutation of
this dangerous Opinion we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
than what may be gathered from
the words of the Prophet, Ezek. 18. 24.
<hi>VVhen the righteous man turneth away
from his righteousness, and committeth
iniquity, and doth according to all the
abominations that the wicked man doth,
shall he live, saith the Lord?</hi> No, <hi>All
his righteousness that he hath done shall
not be mentioned; in his trespass that he
hath trespassed, and in his sin that he
hath sinned, in them shall he die.</hi> Thus
plain it is, that a Christian may fall
away from that saving state of Grace
he has attained to. And what, I pray,
is more likely to secure his steadfastness
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96891:34"/>
than serious endeavours after the highest
degrees of Holiness? Our Apostle, it
seems, thought so; for having in the
foregoing Verse given this necessary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Beware, Brethren, lest you fall from
your own steadfastness;</hi> he presently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
in the Text, as the properest
means to secure them from falling, but
<hi>grow in Grace.</hi> It is the same in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
growths, that it is in naturals: For
as a man by eating and drinking, and
other natural Actions, preserves his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Life; so the Christian, by serious
endeavours after higher degrees of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
preserves his spiritual Life. The
Musician screws up his Peg to an higher
pitch, that he may be sure it will not
fall lower than the true Note: Even so
the higher degrees of Perfection we
aspire to, the less danger shall we be
in of falling lower, than what is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary. And this certainly is
sufficient encouragement to continue
these our serious endeavours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> These serious endeavours after
a further growth in Grace, than what
is absolutely necessary to Salvation, will
give the pious Christian a more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
assurance of Eternal Happiness. It
is no doubt, a kind of Heaven upon
Earth to be assured of Heaven whilst we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96891:35"/>
are here upon Earth. This is that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Manna mentioned in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which fills the Soul with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Delights. Now, nothing besides
a particular Revelation from Heaven,
can be more likely to create this full
assurance in the Soul, than these Heroick
attainments of Grace and Vertue. Grace
is that Seal of the Spirit, by which we
are marked and sealed unto the day
of Redemption: And certainly the
brighter and more evident that Grace
is, the more evident will it be to our
own selves, and the fuller our assurance
of Heaven and Eternal Happiness. Many
good Christians are in a safe condition,
and yet their condition is not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
by reason of those fears and
doubtings, which do often accompany
these lower degrees of Grace: But the
more we abound in good Works, and
the more eminently our Graces shine,
the more comfortable will our Assurance
be, and the clearer our Title to Heaven
and Eternal Happiness. Read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
11 Chap. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where he sets
down a large Calendar of God's emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Saints, such as advanc't into the
highest form of Piety and Vertue, and
you'l find their Faith as great as was
their growth in Grace, and their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96891:35"/>
of Heaven bearing a just propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their improvements in Holiness.
For St. <hi>Paul</hi> describing their Faith, <hi>ver.
1.</hi> calls it <hi>the substance,</hi> or subsistence, <hi>of
things hoped for; the evidence,</hi> or clear
demonstration, <hi>of things not seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> These serious endeavours after
the highest degrees of Grace, as they
will secure our Title to Heaven, and
give us a more comfortable assurance of
it for the present, so they will hereafter
advance us to higher degrees of Glory
in Heaven. We know there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
degrees of Glory in Heaven, even
as <hi>one Star differeth from another Star
in Glory, so also,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, shall be
the Resurrection of the Iust:</hi> As St.
<hi>Austin</hi> speaks, <hi>Splendor dispar, Caelum
commune,</hi> the Saints shall dwell together
in the same Heaven, but yet like Stars,
they shall shine with different Rays of
Glory. Now these higher degrees of
Glory will be conferred on such who
arrived at higher degrees of Grace:
Hence when our Saviour tells his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
John 14. 2. <hi>In my Fathers House
are many Mansions, Tertullian</hi> remarks
thus upon the place, <hi>Quomodo multae
Mansiones, si non pro varietate Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum?
Wherefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>should our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
mention many Mansions in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96891:36"/>
House, if there were not several
Rooms of different Size and Glory provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for his Saints, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of their deserts?</hi> Indeed Heaven
has room enough to lodge all the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but as in other Magnificent<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so in this of Heaven, there are
higher and lower, larger and lesser Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
in which God's Saints shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of according to those Services they
have performed upon Earth. Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
hereafter shall be answerable to
their Obedience here. See then what
incouragement there is to endeavour
after the highest degrees of Glory.
These it seems, will create an Heaven
in our Souls whilst we live here on
Earth. These will at our Deaths,
carry our Souls as high as Heaven;
nay, which is more, they will lodge
them in the best Mansions there.
Hence is that of our Apostle, <hi>Chap. 1.
11. If these things be in you, and abound,
then shall an entrance be ministred unto
you abundantly, into the everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord and Saviour Iesus
Christ.</hi> Having therefore these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
Dearly Beloved, let us cleanse
our selves from all Filthiness both of
Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holiness
in the fear of the Lord. Let us go
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96891:36"/>
from Strength to Strength, and grow
from one degree of Grace unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
until we appear before our God
in <hi>Sion.</hi> I shall conclude all with
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation, 1 Cor. 15.
ult. <hi>Wherefore, my beloved Brethren,
be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in the work of the Lord; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as ye know, that your Labour
shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> This,
God of his Infinite Mercy grant unto
us all, for the sake of Jesus Christ,

            <p>THIS Psalm is confessed
by all, to be a Psalm of
Thanksgiving, a Song
composed to perpetuate
the Memory of some won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and extraordinary Deliverance:
But what this Deliverance was, is not so
well agreed on by Interpreters. Some
would have it to be a Psalm of <hi>David,</hi>
penn'd to commemorate those Victories
he obtain'd over the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites</hi>
and the <hi>Syrians;</hi> others would
have the occasion of it to have been the
discomfiture of that formidable Army
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96891:37"/>
which was brought up by the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
in the days of <hi>Asa;</hi> but most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it of that remarkable defeat
which was given by the Angel to <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacheribs</hi>
Army, in the Reign of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah.</hi>
Upon this account the LXX in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, the Latin
<hi>Canticum ad Assyr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>â¢â¢â¢</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that is, an Ode or
Song made upon the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> And
this Interpretation will receive further
Light from those words of vers. 5. <hi>The
stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept
their sleep, and none of the men of might
have found their hands.</hi> The <hi>Assyrian</hi>
was now an Universal Monarch, his
Soldiers were reputed the stoutest heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the World, having made their
Valour renowned by their innumerable
Conquests; but yet notwithstanding all
this, when they brought a formidable
Army against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and their Strength did signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for <hi>the Angel of the Lord went
forth, and in one Night slew 185000 men
in the Camp of the</hi> Assyrians, 2 <hi>Kings
19.</hi> 35. They indeed slept their sleep;
and the opinion of their own strength,
and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> weakness, made them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure;
but in the midst of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
God smote them in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96891:38"/>
by his Angel; so that the Mighty
Men of valour slept indeed, but it was
the sleep of Death, for they never awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned
again, never found their Hands.
Hence we read, 2 Chron. 32. 21. <hi>That
the Captains, the Leaders, and all the
Mighty Men of Valour were cut off in
the Camp of the King of</hi> Assyria. Thus
the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who had been blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> vindicated his
own Honour, by this wonderful over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
and his Servant <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who
was delivered, became Famous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
amongst the Nations. Hence
we read 2 Chron. 32. 23. <hi>That many
brought Gifts unto the Lord, unto</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<hi>and Presents to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>King of</hi>
Judah; <hi>so that he was magnified in the
fight of all Nations from thenceforth.</hi>
Thus <hi>the wrath of Man did praise the
Lord; the remainder of wrath he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I can draw from the words,
such Observations as the Solemnity of
the Day will require, I must bestow
some little explication on them.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The wrath of Man,</hi> the Hebrew
word is <hi>Chamath,</hi> and properly signifies
Rage. Tho' Anger, Wrath and Rage
be often in Scripture used promiscuously,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96891:38"/>
yet sometimes they are distinguished;
and indeed a real difference may be
found between them. For Anger is the
boyling of the Blood about the Heart, a
Fever darted into the Veins, which
causes a violent Commotion in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Wrath is the manifestation of this
inward distemper by Looks, or Gesture,
or Actions tending to Revenge. But
Rage is the height or extremity of both
the former; it causes the Heart to study
Destruction, to mediate and contrive
the utmost of Mischief and Villany,
and the outward Man to watch all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of putting it in Execution,
and that with the greatest depth of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and height of Fury. One would
think this one word had been sufficient
to express that Helish Malice which the
Wicked bear against the Church of God.
But what is <hi>Chamath</hi> in the beginning
of the Verse, is <hi>Chemoth</hi> in the close:
What was put in the singular number,
is afterwards put in the plural; for so the
words should be rendred <hi>the wrath of
Man shall praise the Lord; the remainder
of wraths or rages shalt thou restrain.</hi>
The Rage of the Wicked is not small;
their Fury does not terminate in one
Plot, but it is exceeding great, ever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96891:39"/>
working and multiplying by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
so that there is not any Design
so Barbarous, any Conspiracy so Bloody
or Devlish, which their Rage will not
put them upon; if one Plot fail, they
are ready for another; and like the
troubled Sea, they never rest, but are
still casting up Mire and Dirt: Well then
might the Psalmist call them Rages in
the plural number; they are as <hi>Gad, a
Troop;</hi> or if you please, you may call
their Name <hi>Legion,</hi> they are so many.
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is called <hi>the wrath of Man,</hi>
in the Hebrew, <hi>the wrath of</hi> Adam.
This Livery can fit the Shoulders of
none but a very wicked Man, one that
is descended from the First <hi>Adam,</hi> and
is not yet ingrafted into the Second.
But yet it is some comfort, that he is
but a Man, whose Heart is filled with
all this Rage; we may be safe it seems,
so long as the God of Heaven is on
our side: He can restrain all this wrath,
he can make it turn to the benefit of
his People, and his own Glory. The
LXX are very ingenious upon the last
words of my Text; for what we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
<hi>the remainder of Wrath shalt thou
restrain,</hi> they render <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Rage
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96891:39"/>
of Man shall keep Holy-Day unto the
Lord, and give his People opportunity
to Laud and Magnifie his Glorious Name.</hi>
By this you cannot but understand how
well the Text and the Day, will agree.
We shall in the Day, as well as in the
Text find Anger, and Wrath, and Rage,
yea Rages in the plural number. And
tho' our Adversaries call themselves
Christians, and pretend to be the only
Catholicks in the World; yet their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
will be found to be fierce and
Cursed, their Wrath and Rage, Cruel;
such as the Psalmist here calls <hi>the VVrath,
the Rage of</hi> Adam, <hi>of one that is not
yet regenerate or grafted into the New
Stock.</hi> Their Plots have been many,
their Conspiracies Black and Bloody; but
thanks be to Heaven, we have found
our Enemies to be but Men, tho' Cruel
and Wicked to the height; we have
had the experience of God's Power and
Goodness over-ruling and restraining
their Wrath and Fury; so that if our
Gratitude had kept pace with our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Deliverances, we should have
had more days of Thanksgiving in our
Calendar than now we have. But to
help us a little in the performance of
these Duties, which this Solemn Day
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96891:40"/>
calls aloud for: I shall observe from the
words three Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Rage of the Wicked
against God and his People is very
great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God by his Providence won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
does over-rule the Rage and
Malice of Wicked Men. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The end that God hath in
these Providences, his is Praise and
Glory; <hi>surely the wrath of Man shall
praise thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Rage of the Wicked against
the People of God is very great. This
is the very Nature and Disposition of
Wicked Men, as the Psalmist tells us,
Psal. 37. 12. <hi>The Wicked plotteth against
the Iust, and gnasheth upon him with his
Teeth.</hi> Nay so great is their Malice,
that the Holy Ghost in Scripture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
them <hi>to Fire and VVater, to Briars
and Thorns, to Lions, Bulls, Dogs, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,
VVolves,</hi> and the like. You'l find
this Truth also confirmed by a thousand
Examples: How did <hi>Cain</hi> hate his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abel?</hi> What wrath did boil in <hi>Esau</hi>
against <hi>Iacob?</hi> How cruelly were the
<hi>Israelites</hi> treated by the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> I
should be too prodigal of the time,
should I reckon up all those Examples
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96891:40"/>
of Holy Writ which are recorded for
this purpose: I shall therefore content
my self at present, with the Example of
<hi>Sennacherib,</hi> to which the Text, as you
hear, alludes. Now how did this Bloody
Emperor swell with Rage, how full was
his Heart of Wrath! The Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
speaking of this proud <hi>Assyrian,</hi> Chap.
10. 7. tells us, <hi>that it was in his Heart
to destroy and cut off Nations, not a few.</hi>
And what the Prophet avers of him, in
the general, is confirmed more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of him by <hi>Berosus,</hi> an Antient Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
which has left this Character of him,
<hi>Sennacherib, qui apud Assyrios regnabat,
omnem Asiam &amp; Egyptum Bello infesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat;
Sennacherib,</hi> saith he, <hi>King of the</hi>
Assyrians, <hi>infested all</hi> Asia <hi>and</hi> Egypt
<hi>with War.</hi> But tho' other Nations felt
the weight of his Wrath, yet none more
than the People of God. For the
Scripture tells us, that he waged War
three years together with the King of
<hi>Israel,</hi> whom he took at last, and carried
him, with the ten Tribes into the Land
of Captivity. Eight years after this, his
Rage brake forth against good <hi>Hezekiah;</hi>
for we read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. That he came
up and seized into his Hands all the
frontier Cities of <hi>Iudah:</hi> Whilst he was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96891:41"/>
at <hi>Lacish,</hi> one of the frontier Cities,
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> sent Ambassadors, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
an Ignominious Peace at a very
dear rate; for <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was forc't to
give him all the Silver that was found
in the House of God, and in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Kings House; nay, all the
Gold that was upon the Doors and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pillars of the Temple: And yet
all this would not satisfie his Wrath,
but he presently sends <hi>Tartan, Rabsaris</hi>
and <hi>Rabshakah</hi> with a great Host against
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and with words of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against God himself: Nay, <hi>Rabsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah</hi>
threatens the People, that they
should be forced to eat their own Dung,
and drink their own Piss. If all this
be not sufficient to shew the Anger, the
Wrath and the Rage of this proud <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
I shall add one instance of it more
out of the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> where we
find that after the slaughter which the
Angel made in <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army, he
was forced to return home, and dwell
at his great City <hi>Niniveh;</hi> his Fury
which was stopt at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> brake
forth against the poor <hi>Iews,</hi> the Ten
Tribes which were now Captive at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh,</hi>
and therefore <hi>Tobit</hi> tells us, Chap.
1. 18. <hi>That when King</hi> Sennacherib <hi>slew
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96891:41"/>
any of the Iews, after he was fled from</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;
<hi>I buried them privily (for,</hi> saith he,
<hi>in his wrath he killed many.)</hi> Here was
the remainder of his Wrath, here was
that which made it Rages in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
number: But even this remainder of
Wrath did God restrain; for this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King was soon after killed by his
own Sons, in the House of <hi>Nisroth</hi> his
God, as I shall shew you afterwards.
And as we have seen Anger and Wrath
in the Text, so may we see much more
in the Day; and find the Rages of the
Papists, far exceeding all the Rage of
these Barbarous <hi>Assyrians.</hi> It is the
saying of St. <hi>Gregory, Dilatat Behemoth
Caudam suam in fine Mundi nequius,</hi>
which Latin I cannot English better,
than in those known words of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
Wo unto the Inhabitants
of the Earth, and of the Sea, for
the Devil is come down with greater
wrath, because he knoweth that his time
is short.</hi> The Malice of Hell never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto the World with more Rage
and Fury, than since it has been mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Who can
recount without horror, and detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Barbarous Murders of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses,</hi>
the Massacres of <hi>France,</hi> the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96891:42"/>
Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the most inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Cruelties of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition?
Here is presented a large Field to range
in, and a Field of Blood too; but the
time would fail me to give a tolerable
account of that Wrath and Rage which
they have exercised from time to time
against this poor Church of <hi>England</hi>
since the Reformation. We may justly
take up the words of the Psalmist, and
say, <hi>Many a time have they fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, from our Youth up; yea, many
a time have they afflicted us from our Youth,
from the beginning of the Reformation,
may our</hi> Israel <hi>say.</hi> How many were
those Funeral Piles which were kindled
by them in the reign of Queen <hi>Mary?</hi>
How well did <hi>Ignatius</hi> deserve his
name, which signifies Fire, when several
hundreds of Innocent Protestants were
sacrificed to the <hi>Moloch</hi> of their Rage,
in the space of less than four years?
Nay, our late Historian of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
tells us, that like Wild Beasts, they
preyed upon the very Carkasses, and
dead Bodies of God's Saints, for they
digged up the Bones of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and
exercised the utmost of Malice upon
the Ashes of <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Fagius.</hi> If we
pass on to the reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:96891:42"/>
our English <hi>Deborah,</hi> we shall find
Anger, and Wrath, and Rage enough.
Indeed, for well nigh eleven years, they
were pretty quiet, hoping to gain Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> by their politick flatteries: But
as soon as these failed, they erected
three Colledges for English Seminary
Priests, one at <hi>Doway,</hi> another at <hi>Rhemes</hi>
and another at <hi>Rome;</hi> and indeed these
proved the Seminaries of all those Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Rebellions which were acted
afterwards. And now the Popes Bulls
begin to roar, the Queen is Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
her Subjects absolved from their
Oaths; and now see their Wrath and
Rage in the Rebellion of the unhappy
Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>VVestmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in the Treasons of the <hi>Stanlies</hi> in
<hi>Darbyshire,</hi> and of 120 Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
such as <hi>Sanders, Brislow, Parsons,
Campian,</hi> and the like: You may see
more of this Rage in the Plots of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
Mayne, Ntlson, Tompson,</hi> and the
rest of that Crew; and of <hi>Payne</hi> and
his fifty Resolutes, hired by the Pope, to
murder the Queen. What need I speak
of <hi>Throgmorton, Paget, Moody, Parry,</hi>
with several others; when the Invasion
of 88 proclaimed their Wrath and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to the full? For in their Ships they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96891:43"/>
had great Knives, with this Inscription,
(as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> reports) <hi>Cut English
Throats;</hi> they had also Whips of Cord
and Wire, which <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez,</hi>
one of the Commanders, confessed were
intended to whip us Hereticks to death;
and being asked by the Council what
they would have done with the young
Children, he answered boldly, that all
above seven years old should have been
murdered with their Parents, the rest
should have lived, but they were to be
branded in the Forehead with the Letter
L. signifying <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and so be reserved
for perpetual Bondage. These and many
other Specimens have they given of their
Cruelty, but this days Conspiracy seems
to exceed them all. For had this Hellish
Plot obtained its desired end, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
of our Nation had become a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Aetna,</hi> our Church and State been
turned into a Chaos, our Court into a <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha,</hi>
and our whole Island into an <hi>Acel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dama,</hi>
or Field of Blood. Here is more
than <hi>Assyrian</hi> Rage and Fury; now at
least we see the Rages of the Text, such
as we may well call the Wrath of Man,
the Wrath of <hi>Adam,</hi> of the worst, the
wickedest of Men: For let Men pretend
what they will, there is nothing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96891:43"/>
nothing of Christ in such Wrath
as this, for he would not suffer his
Disciples to call for Fire from Heaven
to destroy a little Village of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans;</hi>
whereas these Heathen Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
these Bloody Barbarous Papists,
would have fetched Fire, I cannot say
from Heaven, but at least from Hell, to
have destroyed one of the greatest Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the World, <hi>but the remainder of
wrath God did restrain.</hi> Which brings
me to the second thing proposed;
namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God by his good
Providence does over-rule and govern
the Wrath and Rage of Wicked Men,
so as may be for his own Glory and
his Peoples Good. As for the Wicked,
they are far from proposing such ends;
this proud <hi>Assyrian</hi> in the Text, did not
in the least design the Glory of God, or
the Good of his People, as the Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> tells us, Chap. 10. 7. <hi>He meant not
so, neither did his Heart think so, but it
was in his Heart to destroy, and to cut
off Nations, not a few.</hi> His Head and
Heart were full of devices how to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Ambition, and raise his Empire
on the ruins of other Nations; but
God's Providence over-ruled his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96891:44"/>
Rage, and made the Wrath of this
<hi>Assyrian</hi> to praise him.</p>
            <p>But for the fuller opening this part
of the Text, we will consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> How God makes the Wrath of
Man to praise him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whom he makes to praise
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let us inquire how God makes
the Wrath of Man to praise him. Now
he doth this several ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> By diverting their Power and
their Rage, otherwise than they first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
The Wise Man tells us, <hi>That
the Hearts of Kings are in the Hands of
God; he turneth them whithersoever he
will,</hi> Prov. 21. 1. Thus <hi>Nazianzen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, that when
he had designed the utter ruin of the
Christians, God cut him out work else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and made it necessary for him
to go first against the <hi>Persians,</hi> by whom
he was overthrown. So this <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi>
in the Text, you'l find <hi>Esay</hi> 10. 5.
called but <hi>the Rod of God's Anger, and
the Staff of his Indignation,</hi> to denote,
that the greatest of Men are but a kind
of Instruments in the Hand of God's
Providence, and must expect the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Superiour Cause. Hence it is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96891:44"/>
very observable, that when this proud
<hi>Assyrian</hi> had bent his Rage against <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
it was diverted by <hi>Tirhakah,</hi> the
King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> waging War against
him, as you may read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 9. And
it is easie to parrallel this out of the late
History of the Reformation. For in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Mary, Gardiner</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Papists, endeavoured to destroy the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on whom alone, under
God, the hopes of the Reformation did
depend. K. <hi>Philip</hi> did interceed for her,
and preserved her out of interest of State,
God putting it into his Heart, to fancy,
that if she were put out of the way, and
he should have no Issue from Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> which he very much feared; then
the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was to be
married to the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> would succeed,
and make too great an accession to the
<hi>French</hi> Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> God makes the Wrath of Man
to praise him sometimes, by suffering
it to proceed so far, till nothing but a
Divine Power, an immediate Arm of
the Almighty can deliver. God does
not always blast the designs of the
Wicked in the Bud, or crush their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes
in the Shell; but frequently
suffers them to come to the Birth, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96891:45"/>
his chosen People to fall into great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
thus the tale of Bricks was
doubled, before <hi>Moses</hi> was sent. Thus
<hi>Haman</hi> was allowed to go so far, as
even to erect the Gallows for <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was allowed to pursue
<hi>Israel,</hi> not only to the Banks, but even
into the midst of the Red Sea, that by
destroying him there, the Right Hand
of the Lord might become more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in Power. And were we not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in such a sort this day? Were
not all the Instruments of Death made
ready? Were not the Barrels lodg'd,
the Train laid, the Match burning, and
the time well-nigh expired, before the
Lord made bare his Arm, and pluckt
his People as so many Brands out of
the Fire?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> God does sometimes make the
Wrath of Man to praise him, by infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating
the Counsels of his Churches
Enemies; thus he is said <hi>to have made
the Princes of</hi> Zoan <hi>Fools, and the wise
Counsellors of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>to become brutish,</hi>
Isaiah 19. 11. Thus he Countermined
the politick Advice of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and
made that great Oracle appear accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Name in Hebrew, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Brother or Cousin-german to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96891:45"/>
a Fool. A like instance of of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
was that which happned in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> for when She
first fell into that kind of Dropsie,
which Physicians call the <hi>Mola,</hi> the
wisest of her Friends and Physicians
were so far infatuated, as to conclude
her to be with Child; by this means
all Physick was forbid, till her Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
grew Desperate, and that great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
of the Reformation was happily
removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> God does sometimes make the
Wrath of Man to praise him, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
wonderful discoveries of their most
secret Plots and closest Conspiracies.
Thus strangely did he discover <hi>Hamans</hi>
bloody Plot against the <hi>Iews;</hi> and that
of the <hi>Iews</hi> against St. <hi>Paul:</hi> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Goodness of God was never seen
more eminently in the discovery of any
Plot, than it was this day; for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of the Serpent did never appear
more, than in the managing of this
Conspiracy. We know it was laid in
the very Bosom of Hell, hammer'd in the
Devils Forge, nurst up in a dark Vault:
We know also that the Traytors bound
themselves by the Holy Sacrament, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96891:46"/>
the strictest Oaths of Secresie not to
discover it. But yet how wonderfully
did God discover it? For did not the
Lord cause one of the Conspirators, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he had taken three solemn
Oaths to conceal the Plot, to reveal it
by Writing, verifying that of the Wise
Man in his <hi>Ecclesiastes, That which has
Wings shall tell the Matter?</hi> Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was it not the over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God which inclined the Heart
of that Noble Lord to communicate the
Letter, which otherwise might easily
have been slighted as the off-spring of
some melancholy Brain? Nay, was it
not our merciful God, who at this time
put a Divine Sentence into the Lips of
the King, and suffer'd not his Mouth
to transgress in Judgment? His Royal
Breast, at other times, used to be free
from Jealousie, accounting it no less
than a Badge of Tyranny: But now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
so ordered it, that by an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
construction of an Aenigmatical
Phrase, he discovered that unnatural
destruction which was hatching by his
Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> God does sometimes make the
Wrath of Man to praise him, by infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96891:46"/>
some extraordinary Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enemies of his People. <hi>The
Lord, is known,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>by
the Iudgment he executeth; the Wicked
is snared by the work of his own Hands,</hi>
Psal. 9. 16. Thus God also chastised the
Wrath of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> at the siege of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
by sending his Angel to destroy
185000 of his Army: And tho' <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi>
himself was spared, that he might
the better know the Power of that God,
whom he had despised and blasphemed;
yet because he was not throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by this first Judgment, but his
Wrath still remained when he came to
his chief City <hi>Niniveh,</hi> where he fell
to persecute the Ten Tribes which were
captive there, God restrained this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his Wrath by another sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgment, and made him die an
ignominious Death by the Hands of his
two Sons, and that in the House of his
own God, whom he had blasphemously
opposed to the great <hi>Iehovah,</hi> but was
not able to protect him from the Hand
of his Almighty Vengeance. And did
not God also Glorifie himself thus, by
those strange Judgments which he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
on the Powder-Traytors? Was it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96891:47"/>
not remarkable what hapned at <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beach</hi>
in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> where some of
this days Conspirators, being drying
Powder to make Resistance, one spark
of Fire lighting accidentally amongst
the Powder, wounded them so sadly, that
they were forced to acknowledge the
Justice and Vengeance of God upon
them by that Powder, wherewith they
had intended the Destruction of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?
After this, <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi> two
Principal Conspirators, were accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shot to Death by one Shot of a
Musquet; and so fell by the Hand of
God, taking revenge on them by Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
before the Justice of Man was able
to seize them. Add to this what we
read in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Works, how that
God did secretly exasperate the Spirits
of all Men against these Popish Traytors,
that in the Countries where they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
some of them were killed, others
taken before any Proclamation could
overtake them, and before the People
who seized them, knew any thing of
this particular Treason. Thus God this
day <hi>did make the Wrath of Man to
praise him,</hi> to praise his Justice, his
Power in executing such strange Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96891:47"/>
upon these bloody unnatural
Traytors. But it is time I should shew
you in the second place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who they are God makes
to praise him.</p>
            <p>I shall name two sorts of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> God by such means as these
makes his very Enemies to praise him,
by acknowledging either his Power or
his Justice in their Punishments. Thus
<hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> acknowledged
God's Power in the Red Sea, when they
cried out, <hi>Let us flee from the Face of</hi>
Israel, <hi>for the Lord fighteth for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the</hi> Egyptians. It is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
what <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports of <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi>
the burthen of the Text; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he had a Statute erected after
his Death, with this good Advice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
on it, <hi>Whosoever looketh upon me,
let him learn to be Pious, and to fear
God.</hi> So <hi>Iulian,</hi> the Apostate, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Power of Christ, crying out
at his death, <hi>Vicisti Galilaee, Thou art
too strong for me, O thou</hi> Galilean. What
Confessions and Acknowledgments has
God also extorted from our Romish Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries!
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> seeing the terrible
dissipation of that invincible Armado
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96891:48"/>
which was sent in 88. professed, that
now he perceived that God was turned
<hi>Lutheran.</hi> And on this very day, <hi>Faux</hi>
who was appointed to be the Black Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner,
and <hi>Garnet</hi> the Priest, that
was to Consecrate the Plot, did confess
to the praise of God, as well as the
rest, at their Execution, the outragious
wickedness, and odiousness of their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
design. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> God does more especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Honour and Praise from his own
People, whom he wonderfully delivers
from the Rage of Wicked Bloody Men:
Thus <hi>Israel,</hi> when they saw the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
dead upon the shore, they sang praise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, proclaiming him fearful in praises
and doing wonders: Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
sent this Psalm to the chief Musician on
<hi>Neginoth,</hi> that solemn Praises and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
might be returned unto God,
for their wonderful deliverance from the
Rage of <hi>Sennacherib.</hi> Even so Religious
King <hi>Iames</hi> did erect this day for a
Pillar of Gratitude to our good God,
who did so miraculously preserve our
King, the Royal Family, the Parliament,
with our Laws, Liberties and Religion:
Let us therefore rejoyce in the Lord,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96891:48"/>
and again I say rejoyce; let us rouze
up our Spirits, call up our Hearts, and
let all that is within us bless his Holy
Name. Sure if God extort praises from
his very Enemies, he may more justly
inhabit the praises of his own People,
those that he has so wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:
Nay, consider how he has <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
also the remainder of Wrath;</hi>
How many Plots of these Blood thirsty
Papists he has since defeated. If it had
not been the Lord, who was on our
side, when Men rose up against us, they
had swallowed us up quick, when their
Wrath was kindled so hot against us:
Let us therefore bless the Lord our God,
who has not given us over as a prey
unto their Teeth. And to help us a
little in the performance of this Duty,
I shall conclude all with these two
following Directions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If you praise God aright for
the Mercies of this Day, you must be
zealous for that Church, which God
has hitherto so wonderfully preserved.
You have heard how that because God
had so wonderfully preserved <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
from the Fury of <hi>Sennacherib, they
brought Presents unto him, and he was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96891:49"/>
in the sight of all Nations from
thenceforth.</hi> How ought we then to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that Church which God has magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied!
How precious, how honourable
ought it to be in all our Eyes, which
God has honoured with so many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles!
We know this Church is the
greatest Eye-fore of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to use
the words of the Author <hi>of the Review
of the Council of</hi> Trent, <q>There has not
been more woful Tragedies of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Fury acted upon any Stage, than
this of <hi>England:</hi>
               </q> Yet how has God all
along <hi>restrained their Wrath?</hi> Well then
may we own that Church, and be zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for her, whom God has so signally
owned, and been at the expence of so
many Miracles to preserve. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Life of Thankfulness
does chiefly consist in the Lives of those
that are Thankful. He that ordereth
his Conversation aright, is said to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God, in this Book of Psalms. If after
such wonderful deliverances, as you
have heard this day, we still indulge
our selves in sin, our most costly Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
will prove an abomination; the
Lord will even spread the very Dung of
them on our Faces: See therefore with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96891:49"/>
what passion <hi>Ezra</hi> exhorts the <hi>Iews</hi> to
this Duty after their Deliverance from
the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, Ezra 9. 13.
<hi>VVhen we have received such deliverance
as this, should we again break thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
wouldst thou not be angry
with us, till thou hadst consumed us?</hi> We
must therefore keep holiness in our
Lives, otherwise we shall not be fit to
keep an Holy-Day to the Lord. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
well the just to be thankful;
let the high praises of God be in their
Mouths, and it will please him better
than a Bullock that has Horns and
Hoofs. Let us therefore reform our
Lives, and being thus wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the Hands of our Enemies,
let us serve without fear, in holiness and
righteousness before him all the days of
our Life; which God of his Infinite
Mercy grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

that is, in plain English, the Rich and
Happy City of <hi>Corinth.</hi> And as <hi>Corinth</hi>
was thus happy in respect of its Trade
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96891:50"/>
and Commerce, so it was much more
happy in having the Gospel planted
there by the great Apostle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> It was
accounted the honour of these Primitive
Churches to have some Apostle or other
to be their Founder; and the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
the Apostle was, the greater was
the honour of the Church he plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Now in this respect <hi>Corinth</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
unto none, as being founded by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apostle of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
one who is sometimes styled by
the Antients, Prince of the Apostles;
and who in that modest Character
which he has left of himself in 2 <hi>Cor.
11.</hi> 5. tells us expresly, <hi>That he was
not a-whit behind the very chiefest
Apostles</hi> The honour therefore of the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> could not but be
great, since it was planted by this great
Apostle St. <hi>Paul:</hi> And the honour of it
will appear yet greater, if we add the
observation of a Learned Author, <hi>Super
hac Ecclesia maxime triumphat Paulas,</hi>
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> saith he, <hi>tho' he converted seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Nations, and planted several
other Churches, yet he seems to glory most,
yea even triumph in the Conversion of the</hi>
Corinthians: These he calls <hi>his special
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96891:51"/>
work in the Lord, and the very Seal of
his Apostleship,</hi> Chap. 9. of this Epistle,
ver. 1, 2. And as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
had the honour to be planted by the
Labours of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> so it had also the
happiness to be watered by the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the powerful
Preachings of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Now one
would have thought a Church thus
happily Planted and Watred, might, if
any in the World, have promis'd it self
an immunity from Schisms and Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at least, so long as these Infallible
Apostles and Unerring Guides were still
alive: But alas even Infallibility it self
is so far from proving an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Schisms, that it was a great means
of raising and promoting them here at
<hi>Corinth;</hi> for in the first Chapter of this
Epistle we find them crying out, <hi>I am
of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I am of</hi>
Cephas: And besides these Schisms,
which took their rise from the eminency
of their Teachers; we find in this <hi>11th</hi>
Chapter, several other Divisions about
the Sacrament. Unity is indeed a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Blessing, yet such as the best of
Churches may not always enjoy. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
as Glorious and Eminent a Church
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96891:51"/>
as it was, was rent in pieces by Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Divisions; nay, which is stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
yet, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text, stamps
an <hi>Oportet</hi> upon them; <hi>there must,</hi> saith
he, <hi>be Heresies,</hi> or as he calls them in
the foregoing Verse, <hi>Divisions among you,</hi>
Satan and his Instruments will always
watch their opportunity to sow these
Tares: And God it seems is willing to
permit them, that the rottenness of
some, and the integrity of others may
be discovered. So much St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us in the Text, <hi>for there must be also
Heresies among you, that they which are
approved may be made manifest among
you.</hi> From which words I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to shew you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the best of Churches are
subject to the Misfortune of Schisms and
Divisions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> VVhat those Causes are
which make Schisms and Divisions in
some sort necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That God's design in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Schisms and Divisions is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Rottenness of some, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That those are truly Noble
and Honourable Persons, who continue
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96891:52"/>
stedfast in the Communion of God's
Church amidst these Schisms and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which arise in it: These are the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, the approved ones in the Text.
<hi>There must,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, be Heresies
among you, that they which are approved
may be made manifest.</hi> I begin with the
first of these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Namely, to shew you, that the
best of Churches are subject to the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of Schisms and Divisions. He
must be a very great Stranger both to
Scripture and Ecclesiastical History, who
does not know, that the misfortune of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> in the Text, is the usual fate
and misfortune of other Churches.
There is not any Church mentioned in
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> but what was sadly
distracted with Schisms and Divisions.
We find at <hi>Galata,</hi> such as preacht up
<hi>Iudaism,</hi> and bewitched the <hi>Galatians</hi>
with a Dangerous Opinion of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Legal Rites. St. <hi>Paul</hi> warns
the <hi>Colossians</hi> of such as were ready to
spoil them through vain Philosophy, and
bids them take care, that no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
them in a voluntary humility,
and worshipping of Angels. When he
wrote his Hierarchial Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:96891:52"/>
the first Bishop of <hi>Crete.</hi> It seems Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
were so numerous in that Church,
that he was obliged to give him this
Apostolical Canon among the rest, <hi>An
Heretick after the first and second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
reject.</hi> If we take a view of
the Seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> recorded in
the Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> will
shew us a Synagogue of Satan in the
Church of <hi>Smyrna; Nicolaitans and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laamites</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Sardis;</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
stigmatized with the name of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel,</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Thyatira;</hi> and
in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Mother Church, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Apostles, who said they were
Apostles, and were not, but upon trial
were found Liars. Tho' the Faith of the
<hi>Romans</hi> was at this time so famous, that
it was spoken of, saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole World, yet they were
not so happy as to be free from Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for our Apostle gives them this
Advise, Rom. 16. 17. <hi>I beseech you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
mark them which cause Divisions
and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine
which you have received, and avoid them.</hi>
Thus we have found Schisms and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in all those Churches which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> and if we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96891:53"/>
descend to succeeding Ages, we shall find
Schisms and Divisions too many. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
have learning and leisure enough
to consult <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> will
find them reckoning up no fewer than
an 100 Heresies, even in those best and
purest Ages of Christianity. All this,
I hope, will suffice to prevent any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
opinion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
which at this time is torn in pieces by
Schisms and Divisions: This indeed
ought to be matter of Lamentation to
us, and ingage our most ardent prayers
for the peace of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But sure it
cannot be managed as an Argument
against our Church, but the blow will
reach other Churches too, even all
those Churches which are now in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
and as you have heard, those
best of Churches which were in the first
and purest Ages of Christianity. Let
not therefore your present Divisions les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
your esteem of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The best of Churches are subject
to these misfortunes, and will be so to
the end of the World. For as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speaks, Luke 17. 1. <hi>It is impossible
but that Offences will come;</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
says the same in the Text, where he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96891:53"/>
tells us, <hi>that there must be Heresies,</hi>
which brings me to the second General
proposed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Namely, to enquire what
those Causes are, which make Schisms
and Divisions, in some sort, necessary;
and here I cannot but assign,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The first and principal place to
the infernal <hi>Fiends.</hi> Satan is the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in our Saviours Parable, who is
said to sow these Tares in the Field of
the Church. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
the Doctrins of Devils. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
styles them the Plants and Snares of
Satan; and to name no more, <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
calls the Arch-heretick <hi>Arius</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, the Image and
Statue of the Devil. However the Devil
labours to keep his own Kingdom
in peace and tranquility, yet he seeks
nothing more than to cause Divisions
in the Kingdom of Christ. The <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who worshipped of old, Dogs and
Cats, and shed penitent Tears before
the Shrine of a Deified Onion: The
<hi>Pagans,</hi> who worship the Sun, Moon and
all the Host of Heaven; and the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi>
who worship a cursed Impostor,
these never had such divisions among
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96891:54"/>
them, as have been, and still are in the
Church of Christ. Unity is the strength
and stability of all Communities: So
that Satan would fight against his own
Interest, should he disturb the quiet of
those Societies which are devoted to his
Service. But the Church of Christ, the
purer it is either in Doctrin or in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
the more does it threaten ruin and
destruction to Satans Kingdom; no
wonder then if this subtil Serpent does
use all his stratagems and devices to
stir up differences and contentions in
these Christian Societies. Well then
might St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> conclude, that the
Schisms and Heresies which happened in
his time, were industriously raised by
the Devil, that he might revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on the Christian Religion, which
had struck his Oracles dumb, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
banisht his Worship out of the
World. Thus Satan, you see, is the
Principal Cause of those Divisions which
disturb the Peace of God's Church; and
this, by the way, affords us another
Apology for the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
We must confess our Divisions are great
and sad; but this only argues Satans
greater Rage and Malice against her.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96891:54"/>
And, I pray, what wonder is it, that the
Father of Lies should be a malitious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against that Church which is the
Ground and Pillar of Truth. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Tho' Satan be the Principal Cause
of Schisms and Divisions, yet he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
the Lusts and Passions of Men as
Instruments to raise them. Hence is
that of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 4. 1. <hi>Whence are
Wars and Fightings among you? Are they
not hence, even from your Lusts?</hi> Man
before his Conversion is no better than
a Centaur, half Bruit and half Man:
And till Grace has ascended the Throne,
he exceeds for Rage and Fury the wildest
Inhabitants of the Forest. <hi>Lactantius</hi>
compares his Exorbitant Passions to mad
furious Horses, which hurry him vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
on such things as are mischievous
and pernicious to Society. Now Satan
works upon these Passions of Men, and
raises them as Wind does the Seas, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
tumult and commotion; no wonder
then if St. <hi>Paul, Chap.</hi> 5. 20. reckons
among the Lusts of the Flesh, <hi>Hatred,
Variance, Emulation, Strife, Seditions,
Heresies and Envyings:</hi> But tho' there
be not any Lust which does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
more or less to those contentions
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96891:55"/>
which happen in the Church; yet Pride,
Covetousness, Curiosity and self-love
are observed to be the chief <hi>Beautifeau's</hi>
and Incendiaries of them.</p>
            <p>1. Pride is one great Cause of those
Divisions and Contentions which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Church. It is a true saying of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. <hi>Only by Pride
cometh Contention. Melanchton</hi> in his
Comment upon the place mentions a
famous Proverb to this purpose, <hi>Duo
Montes non miscentur,</hi> two swelling
Mountains will not mix well together.
When Men begin to swell with Pride
and Ambition, they soon grow too big
for the little Fold of Christ. Thus <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otrephes,</hi>
loving the preheminence, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
the Peace of the <hi>Asiatick</hi>
Churches. Thus <hi>Arius,</hi> priding himself
in his skill in Logick, sought to raise
his reputation by opposing his Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san.
Ambition is a very turbulent and
seditious Passion; and if Men once give
the Reins to it, it will make them fire
the Temple of God, as <hi>Herostratus</hi> did
<hi>Diana's,</hi> only to get a name, and to be
talkt of in the World.</p>
            <p>2. Covetousness is another great
and special Cause of those Divisions
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96891:55"/>
which happen in the Church. Since
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that the love of mony
is the root of all evil,</hi> we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it one cause of the evil of Schism;
and indeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us so expresly,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. where the Character he gives
of Hereticks is this, <hi>Through Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they make merchandise of people with
feigned words. Mammon</hi> is own'd for a
God by the greatest part of Mankind;
and with most men in the world Gain
passes for Godliness. We need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then if the desire of Wealth prove
often both the Mother and the Nurse
of Heresies. As soon as <hi>Demetrius</hi> had
told the Silver-Smiths of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that
their Craft was in danger to be set at
naught, they presently fill the City with
noise and uproar; and cry out stoutly,
<hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Ephesians. St.
<hi>Iude</hi> describing the manners of the
<hi>Gnostick</hi> Hereticks, tells us, <hi>they ran
greedily after the error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes of the Heretick
<hi>Novatus,</hi> that he was <hi>Avaritiae inexple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili
rapacitate furibundus,</hi> most insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
covetous and rapacious, even to
a degree of madness. But to name no
more, the <hi>Magdeburgenses</hi> long ago ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96891:56"/>
               <hi>that Covetousness helpt to Spawn
most of the Heresies in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Curiosity is another unhappy
Cause of Schisms and Divisions. Christ
has given us a Rule to walk by; and
the Holy Scriptures contain all things
necessary to be believed in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
And so long as men hold fast
that form of sound words which was at
first delivered to the Church, there can
be no danger of Schisms and Divisions:
But curiosity makes men desire to be
wise above what is written, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
disturb the Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,
when he commanded <hi>Timothy</hi> to
charge some, <hi>That they give no heed to
Fables, and endless Genealogies, which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
Questions, rather than Godly Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi>
1 Tim. 1. 4. and Chap. 6. 3, 4. he
condemns such as dote about Questions
and Dispute about Words, whereof
cometh <hi>Envy, Strife, Railings and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Self-love is another unhappy Cause
of Schisms and Divisions. This is the
strongest and most violent Passion of
the Soul, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it
the precedence of all the rest, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96891:56"/>
It is a true saying of <hi>Luthers, Societies
would continue longer than they do, if it
were not for this little Pronoun</hi> Ego, <hi>I
my self.</hi> For whilst Men prefer their
own Interest before the Publick; whilst
they seek their own things, rather than
the things of Jesus Christ and his
Church; they tear his seamless Coat in
pieces, and make unhappy Divisions
among Christians. To prevent therefore
these Divisions, St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
amongst others, <hi>Let nothing be done
through strife: Look not every man on his
own things, but also on the things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
Phil. 2. 3, 4. Thus I have shewn
you what are the Causes of Schisms
and Divisions in the Church, and so
long as these Causes remain, we must
expect the fatal consequences of them;
so long as the Devil is allowed to go
about <hi>as a Roaring Lion seeking whom
he may devour;</hi> so long as he has mens
Lusts and Passions to join with him in
the Work; so long as he can imploy such
Instruments as the Ambitious, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
Curious and Lovers of themselves,
he will be able to disturb the Peace of
God's Church. Indeed God has power
sufficient to prevent these Divisions; he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96891:57"/>
can create a firm and lasting peace
among Christians. But as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
speaks, <hi>Fieri haec Dominus permittit &amp;
patitur, manente propriae libertatis arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio,
The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>suffers these
Divisions to be in his Church, because he
leaves men to act according to the liberty
of their Wills.</hi> God does not imploy
his irresistible power in keeping men
from Schism, more than from other sins.
But having forbidden it with all the
solemnity imaginable, having discypher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the damnable nature of it, and prest
Christians by innumerable, and those
most powerful Motives to keep this
Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of
Peace, he leaves them to act for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this, as in other matters, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a day in which he will judge
and punish everlastingly such as dare to
disturb the Peace of his Church. We
need not wonder then if men be Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to the Church as well as to the
State; if they rebel against Christ as
well as against their Prince; seeing God
leaves men at liberty to commit this as
well as any other sin. Now if any
should put the Question, why God
leaves men thus to their liberty? Tho'
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96891:57"/>
I might chastise such curiosity with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
Answer, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 10. who tells
such Curious Persons, <hi>That they do not
enquire wisely concerning this matter;</hi> yet
since St. <hi>Paul</hi> has furnisht me with a
more satisfactory reply in the Text, I
shall return them this Answer in my
third General, Namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That God's design in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Schisms and Divisions, is to
discover the rottenness of some, and
the integrity of others. This may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be gathered from the Text, where
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That there must be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
that they who are approved may
be made manifest.</hi> It is a Golden Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of St. <hi>Austin, That God who is
Infinitely Good, would never suffer Evil,
but that being also Omnipotent, he is able
to extract Good out of Evil.</hi> When God
suffers Schisms and Divisions to befall
his Church, his design is to discover to
the World, the Rottenness of some and
the Integrity of others. It may be said
of Religion, what good old <hi>Simeon</hi> said
of Christ, the Author of it, <hi>It is set
for the fall and rising of many in</hi> Israel.
So long as Religion prospers and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
in the World, Hypocrites and the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96891:58"/>
worst of Atheists will be content to
own it. But if at any time it falls into
Distress, or labours under Persecution,
then they fall off like Leaves in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</hi>
Indeed, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> observes,
<hi>Nemo existimet bonos Ecclesia posse disce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,
None can imagin,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Good
Men will abjure the Communion of God's
Church;</hi> as he goes on, <hi>the Wind drives
not away the solid Wheat, but the Chaff;
the Storm may overturn the weaker
Shrubs, but the sturdy Oak gains strength
and firmness by the Tempest.</hi> To the
same purpose is that of St. <hi>Iohn, 1 Iohn
2. 19. They went out from us, but they
were not of us: for if they had been
of us, they would, no doubt, have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with us: but they went out, that
they might be made manifest, that they
were not of us.</hi> Times of Division are
times of Trial; and do, as the Father
speaks, in some sort <hi>anticipate the day
of Iudgment; for at such times the Tares
will gather themselves into Bundles, and
leave the purer Corn without any mixture
in the Field of the Lord:</hi> Sound Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
will now be known from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
and though the Church may not
be crouded with such numbers as it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96891:58"/>
was before, yet its greatest loss will be
only of rotten Members: It will now
be able to discern its Friends from its
Foes: And tho' an <hi>Acacius,</hi> an <hi>Ecebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and such like Changlings, may
serve the Times and themselves more;
yet all sincere Christians will think it
both their Duty and Honour to adhere
couragiously to the Church of God,
which brings me to the fourth General
proposed. Namely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To shew you, that those
are truly Noble and Honourable Persons
who continue steadfast in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of God's Church amidst these
Schisms and Divisions which arise in it.
These are the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, the approved
ones in the Text. The Greek word
which is here rendred Approved, is a
Metaphor taken from Gold tried in the
Fire. We know such a trial makes its
solidity and lustre shine the brighter;
yea, it is now valued at an higher rate
than it was before. Even so Christians,
when they continue steadfast amidst
Schisms and Divisions, it renders them
much more honourable than they were
before: There is an advantage, saith
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> which men receive from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96891:59"/>
their very Enemies; had there been no
<hi>Trojan</hi> Wars, <hi>Hector</hi>'s Valour had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been so renowned; and the greater
the violence of a Tempest is, the more
highly does it commend the skill of the
Pilot: Even so the integrity of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Christians shines the brighter, when
others are unsettled by the turn of the
Times, or by the crafty subtilties of
Schismaticks and Hereticks. And the
honourableness of such stedfastness will
appear more at large, by these few
Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. This Steadfastness is an Argument,
that men have formerly taken just
pains to inform themselves about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion: As Ignorance is a
Stain to Human Nature, so Knowledge,
on the contrary, must be the Honour
and Glory of it. This is one of the
greatest perfections of the Soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, the
Mind cannot be good, and as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in the General, is thus honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so no Knowledge is so Honourable as
the Knowledge of Religion. Religion is
the chiefest concern of Mankind, and
consequently ignorance of this is the
most shameful brand; and yet such ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96891:59"/>
as this, for the most part, are
they guilty of, who prove unfaithful
to the Church of God. Hence St. <hi>Paul,
2 Tim.</hi> 3. 6, 7. speaking of some who
suffered themselves to be perverted by
Seducers, he calls the <hi>silly Women, such
as are ever learning, but never able to
come to the knowledge of the Truth:</hi>
Nay, elsewhere he styles them <hi>Children
in understanding, who are tossed to and
fro with every wind of Doctrin.</hi> For
a man therefore to be steadfast in the
Truth, must needs be Honourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it argues him to be a Knowing
Man, and that in matters of the highest
importance.</p>
            <p>2. Stedfastness in Religion must needs
be honourable, because it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the greatest Wisdom. To be
accounted wise is a piece of Honour
men have always been covetous and
ambitious of; and there are none
think they have a better title to it,
than such as change their Religion to
serve their Temporal Interests. Indeed
our Saviour tells us, <hi>That the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of this World, are in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
wiser than the Children of Light.</hi>
It must be acknowledged they are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96891:60"/>
wiser as as to worldly Affairs; and by
renouncing their Religion, they may
make better provisions for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their Life here. But alas!
<hi>What is a man profited, if he gain
the whole World, and lose his own Soul;
or what shall a man give in exchange
for his Soul? Esau,</hi> in the judgment
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was a very prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when he sold his Birth-right for
a Mess of Pottage; and <hi>Iudas</hi> made
but a sorry Bargain, when for thirty
pieces of Silver he betrayed his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and his Soul together; such worldly
Policy is not the best sort of Wisdom:
He is truly the wisest man, who prefers
his Soul before his Body, Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Earth, and Eternity before a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now none is such a Wise Man
as this, but he who adheres stedfastly
to the Church of God, and values his
Religion above Estate, Life, and all the
fading Enjoyments of this transitory
World.</p>
            <p>3. Stedfastness in Religion must needs
be Honourable, because such shall be
honoured by Christ in an especial
manner, at the day of Judgment. God
has promised, that those that honour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96891:60"/>
him, he will honour. Now we have
no better way to honour God, than
by owning his Truth, and adhering to
his Church. Religion is the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
God has in the World, for the
Honour and Advancement of which,
all those Miracles were wrought which
are recorded in the Bible: It is not
therefore possible to please God more,
than by being true and faithful to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Hear what Honour our Saviour
promises to put upon such at the day of
Judgment, <hi>Whosoever shall confess me
before men,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>him shall the
Son of Man confess before the Angels
of God,</hi> Luke 12. 8. However, sincere
Christians may be reviled and evil
intreated by a wicked World; it seems
they will be own'd and honour'd by
their Dearest Saviour: and if there be
one Crown of Glory larger than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he will bestow it on such as
are faithful to the death. I might, if
the time and your patience would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
add several other Arguments to
shew the Honourableness of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who continue stedfast in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of God's Church; but these
I am confident will suffice at present.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96891:61"/>
I shall therefore conclude with a word
of Exhortation, beseeching you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
stedfast in the Communion of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It will not
be prudence in me to make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on other Churches; but
this, I hope, may be said without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that I know not any Church
this day upon Earth, with which we
may more safely Communicate, than
with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is deservedly reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
one of the Ancientest Churches
in Christendom; and yet, if we may
believe <hi>Baronius,</hi> one of the best of their
Historians, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
to it more than five years. The
Government of this Church is known
to be Episcopal: That Government
which was instituted by Christ, and
was the only Government in the
Church for fifteen hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Times of the Apostles. And
as this Church is governed by Bishops,
so we have had a continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of them, from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
to this present day, as may
be learned from <hi>Godwins</hi> Catalogue
of Bishops, and <hi>Parkers Antiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96891:61"/>
Britannicae.</hi> The Faith which our
Church professes, may be found in
her Creeds, which are the Apostles,
the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creeds;
the only Creeds which were owned
by the Primitive Church: so that if
we may be saved by that Faith which
was thought sufficient by the Apostles
and the best of Christians, we need
not seek a new one from any Church
in Christendom. No Church can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to more Loyal Principles, or
recommend it Self more to the Favour
of Princes by the constant Fidelity
of its Members, than the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> This also is that Church
which enjoyed <hi>Lucius,</hi> the First Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King, and had the honour to have
born in it, the First Christian Emperor
and Empress, namely, <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great, and the most Religious <hi>Helena.</hi>
These are great and signal Honours,
such as no other Church is able to boast
of; and I shall add one greater than
them all, namely, that the Religion of
our Church was sealed by the Blood
of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the first Royal
Martyr that ever was in the World.
This certainly is a Church none of us
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96891:62"/>
have the least reason to be ashamed of,
and as little reason to be afraid to own;
since we are so well assured of their
present Majesties Gracious Protection.
I shall therefore conclude this Discourse
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does the <hi>15th</hi> Chapter of
the First Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,
VVherefore, my Beloved Brethren, be ye
stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in
the VVork of the Lord; for asmuch as you
know that your Labour shall not be in
vain in the Lord.</hi>

            <p>AS Repentance is owned by
all sorts of Christians to be
a Duty of absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and consequently most
seasonable to be performed
at all times; so they do not deserve the
Name of Christians, who refuse to set
about a Duty of such great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in this time of Lent. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
pressed this Duty on you by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Arguments. One you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
was taken from that Obedience
which we owe to our Lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.
He has not the least spark of
Loyalty in him, who does not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Obedience is due to those
Commands of our Superiours which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
indifferent things: And sure then
he must not pretend the least tittle to
Loyalty, who lives in actual disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the known Commands of his
Superiors, when they require things
of the greatest importance and most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity. Now we all know,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96891:63"/>
that our Superiours call upon us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in this season of <hi>Lent;</hi> and, I hope,
we will all acknowledge, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is a Duty of greatest importance,
and most absolute necessity. Where
then is that Loyalty we use to boast of?
Will he, think you, obey his Superiors
in smaller matters, who denies obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in matters of greatest concernment,
and of Eternal importance to his own
Soul? But because I know it is easie for
some to boast of their Loyalty, when,
in truth, they either know not what
it means, or at least are unwilling
to give the truest demonstrations of it:
I have urged other Arguments drawn
from the consideration of that Glorious
Prize God proposes unto sincere Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and those Dreadful Punishments
which are threatned the Impenitent.
Hope and Fear are the great Hinges on
which Human Nature is made to move:
And one would think Arguments, which
alarm two such powerful Passions of
the Soul, should not want success, but
prevail with sinners of what size soever,
to ingage themselves in this important
Duty: And yet experience sadly informs
us, that neither Heaven nor Hell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96891:64"/>
the Hopes of the one, nor the
Fears of the other can perswade the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Men to repent of their sins.
Sure then there is some considerable
Stumbling block in the way; something
more than ordinary that makes men so
careless and negligent in the performance
of this Duty. And indeed there is a very
great Stumbling-block in the way. For
tho' all Christians acknowledge Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to be a work of absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yet they believe it may be done
sufficiently when they are a dying. They
think they may safely dedicate the fair
Blossoms of their Youth to Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
provided they are careful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
their Souls to God in their last
Will and Testament; and they are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incouraged to this vain and most
dangerous belief, by the Example of the
penitent Thief in the Gospel. For this
Reason I have chosen this portion of
Scripture at this time; all the Parts of
which I do not intend to examine at
this time, but only shew you from them
these two things:</p>
            <p>First, That there is no encouragement
at all for a late Death-bed Repentance,
in the Example of the penitent Thief.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:96891:64"/>
Secondly, From the Example of the
Impenitent Thief shew you, that a late
Repentance is a thing most dangerous, if
not in some sort impossible.</p>
            <p>First, Let us Enquire, what little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
there is for a late Death-Bed
Repentance, in the Example of this
penitent Thief. Indeed this famous Story
of the penitent Thief, seems at first view
to give great encouragement to a late
Death-bed Repentance. It is, I confess,
a Relation of a Dying-man, one laden
with many and great sins: Sins of such
an heinous Nature, as deserved, by his
own Confession, the greatest of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to wit, that of the Cross. As he
had spent his whole Life in Robbing and
Stealing, sins which seldom want the
company of other Enormities; so when
he was upon the Cross, he joyned also at
the first with the other Thief in reviling
our Saviour; hence the other Evangelists
tells us, in the Plural Number, that <hi>the
Thieves reviled him.</hi> So great, so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a sinner was this poor Thief, and yet
upon his turning to God at the last gasp;
upon his humble Confession of his Faults,
and expressing his sorrow for them, his
Pardon is sealed, the Arms of Mercy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96891:65"/>
open themselves wide to embrace him,
and Christ gives him a Promise, that <hi>his
Soul should be with him that very day in
Paradise.</hi> And since these things are so,
who dares now bode ill to the Clinicks
of our Age, those I mean, who add
<hi>drunkenness to thirst, and thirst to drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,</hi>
who labour daily to swear
God Almighty out of Heaven; who,
with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Young-man, <hi>rejoyce all the
days of their Youth, walk in all the ways
of their own Hearts, and in the sight of
their own Eyes:</hi> Why should we, say
they, disturb our Mirth and Jollity, with
the melancholy Thoughts of <hi>Religion?</hi>
It is time enough to think of Heaven,
when we shall be allowed to stay no
longer upon Earth! A few salt Tears
at the Hour of Death, a little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to a Priest, attended with sighs
and groans, will be a sufficient atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our former Miscarriages:
God's Mercy, which was sufficient for
this penitent Thief, will also serve our
turns at the last; and therefore Ministers
shall never make us out of love with
our darling Lusts; we are not such
Fools, as to be cheated so easily of all
our Pleasures: Let them, if they can,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96891:65"/>
impose upon Vulgar Hearers, we are
too Learned ever to be perswaded to
begin so soon to think of Heaven and
Eternity. But how sadly, how fatally
are such Presumptous sinners mistaken!
Tho' the Text be a Relation of a Dying
man returning from great sins to God;
yet it is attended with extraordinary
Circumstances, such as will make even
the boldest Sinner to tremble, and, I
hope, be so wise, as to make more early
Provisions for his Immortal Soul: For
in some things this Example is vastly
different from their Condition, and in
many others it is above their imitation;
so that if they will but seriously consider
all Circumstances, they will find them
so remarkable, and so extraordinary,
that this Example can be no safe Rule
for them to walk by. For,</p>
            <p>1st, Let us consider, that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
this was the first Call that was
given this Thief to repent; it was the
first opportunity that was offer'd him
to be acquainted with Christ. The
Scripture says nothing at all to the
contrary, and Ecclesiastical History may
confirm us in this belief. Hear what
account St. <hi>Austin</hi> gives of this penitent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96891:66"/>
Thief<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
               <hi>Ad consequendam fidem, non fuit illi
extrema hora, sed prima: Nec Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
ante, nec Christum scivit: Non
remedia status sui in momenta ultima
infelici fraude posuit. If</hi> (saith this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>we respect his Opportunities for
attaining Faith, his Repentance was not
late, but early; he took the very first
season: As soon as ever he descried Christ
and Religion, he readily embraced them:
He did not wretchedly cheat himself of
the Remedies of his miserable condition,
he did not adjourn the use of them to a
late uncertain Futurity, which seldom or
never succeeds well.</hi> Let now the bold
Presumptuous sinners of our Times,
compare themselves, if they please,
with the Example of the Text: Let
them see, if they can extract any
Comfort or Encouragement from hence.
Will they say indeed, that they never
had any Call to Repentance? Will
they pretend, that there was never
offer'd them any Opportunity to be
acquainted with Christ? Alas! how oft
has Christ been Crucified before their
Eyes, in the Ministry of the Word?
How oft have they seen him in the
Sacrament bleeding for their sins? Have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96891:66"/>
they not had <hi>Line upon Line, and Precept
upon Precept?</hi> Have they not had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and publick Admonitions? How
many National Judgments and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have call'd aloud for their Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
How many publick Mercies and
Deliverances have invited them to the
Duty? Sure, then, they cannot draw a
parallel between their own Case and the
Case of the Thief: They cannot at the
Hour of Death expect any Comfort or
Consolation from his Example.</p>
            <p>2dly, Consider how remarkable, how
wonderful, how extraordinary the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of this Thief was. As Jewels
contain vast Riches in a little room, so
his short Life of Penitency had a whole
Age of Repentance in it. Tho' his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
had but a little time to breath
in, yet how busie, how active, how
vigorous was it in all the great and
important parts of hearty Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>1. We may view here in the Text, his
deep sense and humble acknowledgment
of his former sins. <hi>We suffer justly,</hi> saith
he to the other Thief; <hi>we receive no
more than the due rewards of our former
Deeds. Magnum enim poenitentiae signum
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96891:67"/>
in poena sua acquiescere. It is a great
sign of true Repentance,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius,
patiently to bear the Punishment which is
inflicted, or for the Malefactor to approve
of his own Condemnation. Confession</hi> is
called by the Father, the <hi>Vomit of the
Soul,</hi> it shews <hi>Sin</hi> to be bitter to us
when we cast it up by such open
Acknowledgments. And now, I pray,
what Comfort is there in this Example
for such Presumptuous sinners amongst
us, who put off their Repentance to the
time of <hi>Sickness?</hi> How rarely do we
find in them such a deep sense of their
<hi>Sins,</hi> and a serious Humiliation for
them? How lame are their Confessions,
and for the most part but General?
Ministers, when they come to Visit them
in their Sickness, are forced to transgress
the bounds of Modesty, before they can
extort a slender acknowledgment of
their Faults. Tho' they have sinned in
an impudent manner, and never were
ashamed to dishonour God, and affront
their Saviour; yet now they are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take shame to themselves, but
desire their sins may be buried with
them in the same Grave. Thus the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
of the Age, do generally fall short
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96891:67"/>
of the Example in the Text, as to this
part of Repentance. But,</p>
            <p>2dly, Let us Consider, that this honest
Penitent Thief was not only sensible of
his sin, and willing to make an open
Confession of it; but he shewed great
Charity to his fellow Thief, and labour'd
to bring him to an hearty Humiliation
for his Transgressions. See how his
Compassion to his Soul displays it self,
in his passionate Expostulation with
him? <hi>What,</hi> saith he, <hi>dost thou not fear
God? Is this a time for thee to revile this
Innocent Person, who has done nothing
amiss? It would better become thee to
reflect upon thy former Life, to call thy
past Sins to remembrance, and spend that
little Breath which is left thee, in suing
for a Pardon at the Throne of Grace.
Sure thine Heart must be harder than an
Adamant, if Death, that King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
has no Darts that can pierce it.
What,</hi> saith he, <hi>dost thou not at such a time
as this fear God?</hi> Thus great, thus
remarkable was his Charity to the Soul
of his Fellow-Thief. But alas! how
cold is that Charity which the Clinicks
of the Age express for the <hi>Souls</hi> of
others? Tho' they have been all their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96891:68"/>
life time Factors for Hell, and saved the
Devil the labour of Tempting men to
sin: Tho' they have delighted formerly
in <hi>putting the Bottle to their Neighbours
mouth,</hi> and even gloried when they have
been able to drink them into Brutes:
Tho' they have enticed them to all sorts
of Lusts, and made them bear a share
in all their Debaucheries; yet in their
sickness, how seldom do they send for
their boon Companions? How seldom
do they endeavour to rid their Souls of
the guilt of other Mens sins? If their
Brethren in Iniquity come at any time
unsent for, and have so much Civility as
to Visit them in their sickness, how
frothy, at least how unseasonable is
their Discourse? When do we hear
them reminding them of their former
Debaucheries, telling them the danger
of them, and by ghostly Admonitions
labouring to draw them out of the
snare of the Devil? And since they are
so unlike this penitent Thief, in their
Charity for the Souls of others, they
have little reason to encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by his Example. But,</p>
            <p>3dly, Consider farther, what a strong
prodigious Faith did live and act in this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96891:68"/>
penitent Thief when he was a dying?
We find in the Text, he believed Christ
to have been a <hi>Iust Person,</hi> even when
he was numbred among Transgressors:
He pronounces that our Saviour had
<hi>done nothing amiss,</hi> notwithstanding the
great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had pronounc'd him
<hi>worthy of Death,</hi> yea, the Death of the
Cross, and fit to be hanged between
<hi>two Thieves.</hi> This was a strange prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Faith indeed! And yet did it exert
more prodigious Acts than these, for
he farther believed, that Christ had a
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and that a Kingdom of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World; and therefore he saith to
our Saviour, at the point of Death, <hi>Lord
remember me when thou comest into thy
Kingdom.</hi> What a strong prodigious
Faith was here! The wisest of the <hi>Iews</hi>
dreamt of nothing so much as a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Kingdom;</hi> yea, his own Disciples
were deficient in this great Article of
their Faith: They are for sitting at his
Right hand, and at his Left hand, in
some worldly Empire. Nay, after Christ
had given several Checks to their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
Ambition, we find them still
harping on this string, and at the very
time of his Ascension, putting this foolish
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96891:69"/>
Question to him, <hi>Lord, Wilt thou at this
time restore again the Kingdom unto</hi> Israel,
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6. But this penitent Thief desires
no Earthly Glories; he begs not to sit
at his Right hand or at his Left; but,
<hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>remember me after Death,
when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</hi>
These are strange and wonderful Acts
of his Faith, and yet not all that are
here recorded in the Text; for it seems
he believed Christ to have been both
able and willing to save him, which is
in effect, to own him for a <hi>Mediatour:</hi>
Hence we find him making solemn and
earnest Addresses to him for Mercy;
<hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>remember me when thou
comest into thy Kingdom.</hi> One would think
these Circumstances which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
namely, his deep Sense of his
Sins, his humble Confession of them,
his Charity to the Soul of his Fellow
Thief, and his strange and prodigious
Faith; I say, one would think these
Circumstances so wonderful, and so
extraordinary, that they were sufficient
of themselves to evidence the sincerity
of his Repentance, how short soever it
was; and yet by way of Overplus, we
have the Testimony of our Saviour
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96891:69"/>
himself concerning it, <hi>This day,</hi> saith
our Saviour, <hi>thou shalt be with me in
Paradise.</hi> Sure that Repentance must
be sincere and perfect which enters into
Heaven, passeth into Paradise, and makes
so notorious a Thief, all on a sudden;
so fit a Companion for the Holy Jesus.
And now let us enquire, what matter
of Comfort here can be for the bold
Daring Sinners of the Times? Have they
any reason to expect such a lively,
vigorous, and extraordinary Faith? Or
is it possible they should be so well
assured of the sincerity of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
The Age of Miracles did expire
long ago, and God having abundantly
confirmed the Truths of the Gospel by
mighty Signs and Wonders, did resolve
to leave the succeeding Ages of the
Church to the ordinary Means of Grace.
How then can we expect at the Hour
of Death, to find such a wonderful Faith
wrought in those profligate Wretches,
who have all their Life time despised
Gods Ministers, quenched all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Holy Spirit, trampled on
the Blood of the New Covenant, and
shamefully abused all the ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
and Dispensations of the Gospel?
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96891:70"/>
And as we cannot expect to find in the
Clinicks of the Age such a prodigious
and extraordinary Faith, as was in this
penitent Thief; so neither is it possible
they should be so well assur'd of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of their Repentance, as he was<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
I am willing to be as Charitable to
these Penitents, as the Salvation of their
Souls will allow me to be: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us suppose such Presumptuous
sinners to be deeply sensible of their
sins, and willing to Confess them: Let
us suppose them sending for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
Companions, to remind them
of Eternity, and the great danger of
delaying their Repentance: Nay farther
let us suppose them <hi>watering their
Couches with their Tears,</hi> and making
most solemn Protestations of better
Obedience, if God should restore them
to their former Health. Supposing all
this be done by the Clinicks of the Age,
is it possible for a Minister to afford
them a Cordial, or any solid Comfort
from this Example of the Text? For
my part, I must declare, that I think
it impossible. We may hope well, in
the Judgment of Charity; but to give
them any such Assurance, as this peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96891:70"/>
Thief, is beyond the power and
skill of the wisest Minister; for the
<hi>Heart is deceitful above all things;</hi> and
since Ministers are not Omniscious, as
our Saviour was, they cannot pass an
infallible Judgment upon the sincerity
of such a late Repentance. When <hi>Esau</hi>
had lost his Birth-right for a <hi>Mess of
Pottage,</hi> did not he shed as hearty and
unfeigned Tears, as these supposed Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
can do, and yet it is said; <hi>found no
place for Repentance?</hi> Did not <hi>Iudas</hi> run
to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees?</hi> Did he
not confess publickly, that <hi>he had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Innocent Blood?</hi> Nay, did he not
throw down the <hi>Thirty peices of Silver?</hi>
And sure if he had not been in earnest,
such a Covetous Wretch would never
have parted with his Mony; and yet we
know his Repentance was not right.
Alas! the Horrours of Conscience, and
the ghastly Apparitions of Death, will
force men to do many things which
God will not accept of, because they
proceed from fear of Punishment, and
not from the Love of him. Nay, let me
add yet farther, that sad Experience has
set its Seal to this Observation, That
many such Penitents, who have made
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96891:71"/>
the most solemn Protestations of better
Obedience in the time of their Sickness;
when God has restored them in Mercy
to their former Health, they have with
<hi>the Dog return'd to their Vomits, and
with the Sow to their wallowings in the
Mire.</hi> Thus you see, that Repentance
of the Thief in the Text was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
so wonderful, so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in all the parts of it, as will afford
little solid Comfort to <hi>repenting Sinners</hi>
at the Hour of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> This Repentance of the Thief
will be found yet farther extraordinary,
and such as can afford little Comfort
to the Clinicks of the Age, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
those great and extraordinary
Temptations he had to grapple with.
Christ was now in his worst Estate, in
the very lowest degree of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
there was no Beauty, no Form, no
Comeliness in him, that he should be
desired: The <hi>Chief Priests,</hi> the <hi>Scribes,</hi>
and the <hi>Elders</hi> mocked him; all that
passed by reviled him, <hi>wagging their
Heads:</hi> Of his own Disciples, some
denied him, and all of them shamefully
and most ungratefully forsook him: This
poor penitent Thief was the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96891:71"/>
he had. And what Inducements
had he at this time to own him? He
could expect no Wordly Advantages;
all that he could promise himself was
only this, that as he was now Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
as a Malefactor only; so for such
his Confession, his Torments would
have been enhanced, and he persecuted
as a Martyr: And can now the Clinicks
of the Age shew us any such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Repentance? Is Christ now under
the same Circumstances of Pain and
Ignominy that he was then? Do not
all our Creeds tell us that he is now <hi>at
the Right Hand of God?</hi> That <hi>He is
made the Head of all things both in
Heaven and in Earth:</hi> And will it be
any such heroick Act of Faith now to
seek unto such a Glorious and Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Saviour? Sure there is a vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the case of the Thief,
and the case of the presumptuous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
The Thief had no inducements
to fly to Christ for succour; and these
have none to fly to but their Saviour
There is therefore but little solid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for such Penitents in the Example
of the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> The case of the Thief will yet
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96891:72"/>
further be found extraordinary, if we
consider the time when he obtained
Mercy; it was no ordinary time, but a
time when God was shewing a publick
Act of Grace and Mercy to the World.
God at this time was giving his own
Son, out of great love to Mankind: And
therefore it might seem proper and well,
becoming so solemn a time, that there
should be some Monument of this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Mercy. It may possibly deserve
your serious observation, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
did always something extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to grace the several Passages of our
Saviours Mediatorship. We know at his
Nativity, a Glorious Star shone in the
Air, and conducted the Wise Men of the
<hi>East</hi> to the Son of Righteousness. At
his Resurrection all the Graves were
opened; and those Patriarchs which had
slept for many years, had a Goal-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and graced the solemnity of our
Saviours Resurrection. The Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
<hi>Ignatius</hi> has left it upon Record, <hi>that
those very Saints who were with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
at</hi> Easter, <hi>had a share also in his
Ascention upon</hi> Holy-Thursday. What
wonder then if we find one Penitent Thief
converted, in a miraculous manner, to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96891:72"/>
grace his Crucifixion? Christ was now
triumphing over Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
he was now making a shew of them
openly on the Cross: That therefore he
should bear off the Field, the prey which
he had taken out of the Jaws of the
Enemy, was no more than was due to
the solemnity of his Triumphs. Very
pretty is St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Remark upon this
passage; <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>in rescuing the
poor Thief upon the Cross, was but quits
with the Devil; for the Devil took Man
from God out of the midst of Paradise:</hi>
Christ takes this poor Man from Satan
when he was no less than in the very
Jaws of Hell. Satan ruin'd Man on the
Forbidden Tree, and Christ saves him
on the Cursed Tree. How proper for
this occasion was such an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Sovereign Balsom? There
is then no question to be made, but this
Conversion of the Thief was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Act of Grace; <hi>Novae &amp; insolitae
quaedam Divinae Virtutis Efficacia; it was,</hi>
saith <hi>Grotius, an unusual Ray of Divinity,
which darting, at this time, into the
Thiefs heart, wrought such strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Repentance in him.</hi> And indeed
the Conclusion will run thus high, if we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96891:73"/>
lay all the premised circumstances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that the Grace of God should
work in this Thief such a deep sense of
his sin; such an open confession of it,
such wonderful Charity for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
such a miraculous Faith, yea such
a compleat change, all on a sudden, and
that without means; yea, as you have
heard, against means, and amidst the
greatest Temptations to the contrary:
All these shew the Conversion of this
Thief to have been perfectly extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and such as was designed to Grace
the Crucifixion of our Saviour. And
now, I pray, what comfort can this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
afford to the Clinicks of the Age?
Do they think that God Almighty is
obliged to work Miracles for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
And yet it is a known Rule in
Divinity, that extraordinary Cases must
not be made a Rule. Because God did
once translate <hi>Enoch</hi> into Heaven, must
any of us expect the same Honour and
Dignity? Because some Saints arose with
Christ, and ascended with him into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
is this any ground for our Faith, that
we shall rise before the General Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
So, because God did once, in
a wonderful manner, Convert a poor
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96891:73"/>
Thief at the hour of Death; we must
not presume upon such extraordinary
Mercy. It will better become us to be
terrified at the example of the other
Thief. We read he was left unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his Soul dropt into Hell sooner
than his Carcase was taken from the
Cross. If thou dost reject the ordinary
means of Grace, which God does plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
afford thee, thou canst not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
thy self extraordinary mercy at the
hour of Death: in all probability it will
fare with thee, as it did with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
Thief.</p>

            <p>I Told you the last Lords Day,
that I did not design to examine
all the parts of so large a Text,
but only take occasion from them
to shew you two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there is no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all for a late Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the Example of the Penitent
Thief. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take occasion from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Impenitent Thief, to shew
you, that a late Death-bed Repentance
is a thing most dangerous, if not in
some sort impossible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I shew'd you at large, the last
Lords day, that there is no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all in the Example of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Theif, for a late Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
For this example, in many things,
is vastly different from the condition of
presumptuous Sinners in our times. This
in all probability was the first Call that
was ever given to this poor Thief, the
first opportunity that was ever offer'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96891:75"/>
him to be acquainted with Christ;
whereas the Clinicks of the Age have
had the means of Grace plentifully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
them; they have had Line upon
Line, and Precept upon Precept, publick
and private Admonitions to Repent. I
shew'd you further, how wonderful and
extraordinary his Repentance was. We
find here in the Text, his deep sense of
his sins, his humble and publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his Faults; his great Charity
and Compassion for the Soul of the
other Thief: a Faith also strange and
Prodigious, such as pronounc'd Christ a
just and innocent Person, when the
great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had condemn'd him for
a Malefactor; such as own'd Christ to
have a Kingdom, and that a Kingdom
of another World, such as made him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
to Christ for Mercy, own him in
his lowest degree of Humiliation, when
all the World revil'd him, and his
own Disciples forsook him. Such a
change as this, so sudden, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
could not be wrought without a
Miraculous Power; and was design'd as
I shew'd you, to grace the Passion and
Crucifixion of our Saviour, but not to
encourage presumptuous sinners to delay
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96891:75"/>
their Repentance. As therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think God obliged to work Miracles
for the Conversion of bold daring Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
so we cannot administer any solid
comfort to them at the hour of Death,
from this example of the Penitent
Theif. All the kindness<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the Text will
allow us to shew unto bold presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sinners, is only to awaken them in
the time of their health, to a serious
and timely Repentance, from the Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
example of the Impenitent Thief.
This wicked Malefactor, as he had lived
a most wicked Life, so he dies a most
miserable Death; his Body was not sooner
buried in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> than his Soul was
hurried to the place of Torments. All
the Charity of the Penitent Thief is lost
upon him; all his Admonitions prove
ineffectual; he dies Reviling and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
his Saviour, and consequently
could not be long from receiving the just
but dreadful rewards of such final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.</p>
            <p>I come therefore in the next place to
shew you from this Example,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a late Repentance is a
thing most dangerous, if not in some
sort impossible. The generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96891:76"/>
are ready enough to acknowledge
the absolute Necessity of Repentance:
They know it is as possible for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
with his great Bunch upon his Back,
to pass through the Eye of a Needle,
as for an impenitent Sinner, made gross
with the sins of many years, to enter
in at the strait Gate of Heaven; but yet
with <hi>Felix,</hi> they put off their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to a more Convenient Season:
They think they shall have time enough
to repent, when sickness calls upon them
to pay their last debt to Nature. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
few men love their sins so well, as
that they are willing to be damned for
them: And therefore, however they live,
they earnestly desire they may die like
Christians; with <hi>Balaam</hi> they wish <hi>their
death may be like the Death of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi>
and resolve not to go out of this
World in an impenitent State. But yet
at present they think they are not at
leisure to prepare for such a death as
this. Alas, they are now young and
healthful; their Pulse beats evenly, and
their Blood moves briskly; they have
not the least Symptom of any Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to make them fear the approaches
of Death; and therefore, as yet, they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96891:76"/>
fancy they may safely delay their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
they fancy it will be time
enough to begin to live well, when they
shall be allowed to live no longer. The
great Enemy of Mankind hath not, in
all his Magazine, a more deadly Engine
for the destruction of Souls. So great,
so fatal are the dangers which attend
such practises, that Trembling is fitter
than Words to express them; however
the madness and folly of them will in
some measure appear in these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The madness and folly of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off Repentance to the time of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or the hour of Death, will appear
if we seriously consider the uncertainty
of Death. <hi>We cannot,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, boast
our selves of to morrow;</hi> we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the next fleeting minute. Death
lurks in every corner, and waits for us
in every Place. There is not a crumb
of Bread we eat, nor a drop of Liquor
that we drink; but if it goes a little
a-wry, Physitians tell us may be our
ruin. Histories afford us a thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of sudden death. <hi>Manlius Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus</hi>
died whilst he was at Supper;
<hi>Cn. Bebius,</hi> asking the hour of the day,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96891:77"/>
met with his last hour; two of the Rom<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
Emperors stept into their Graves, even
whilst they were putting on their Shoes;
<hi>C. Servilius</hi> died whilst he was stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the Market; <hi>M. Terentius</hi> whilst
he was a Writing; and to name but one
more, and that out of our own Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
Mr. <hi>H. Morris</hi> died at a game of
Tennis. Thus uncertain is the time of
Death, and therefore their madness is
both great and certain, who procrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their Repentance till the hour of
Death. We know not how soon this
may come, we know not how suddenly
it may surprize us. Were not <hi>Zimri</hi>
and <hi>Cosbi</hi> smitten in the very Act of
their Uncleanness? Were not <hi>Ammon</hi> and
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> taken in the midst of their
drunken Cups? <hi>Corah</hi> and his factious
Crew were swept away in their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And to name no more, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Fool in the Gospel received his
Summons to another World, even when
he was singing a <hi>requiem</hi> to his Soul in
this; saying, <hi>Soul take thine Ease, thou hast
Goods laid up for many Years.</hi> What
folly then will it be, to put off Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
till the time of Sickness, or the
hour of Death? But since Men are of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96891:77"/>
this Humour, let us, for once, take
them at their words; and try if they
will repent one day, at least, before
they die? This they profess they are
willing to do, because they know their
Salvation depends upon it. But if in
truth they are in earnest; if they are
unfeignedly resolved to Repent one day
before they die, they must begin the
Work this very day; for what know
they but this may be their last day?
Sure they have not made a Covenant
with Death, or an Agreement with Hell.
Sure it is not in their Power to dispose
of Times and Seasons: Their Breath is
in the Hands of God, and not in their
own. Hear what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, Eccles.
9. 12. <hi>Man knoweth not his time; as the
Fishes that are caught in an evil Net;
and as the Birds are caught in the
Snare; so are the Sons of Men snared in
an evil time, when it cometh suddenly
upon them.</hi> If therefore men have any
real kindness for their Souls, they will
not run the hazard of an uncertain fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity;
they will rather think it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to follow our Saviours advice,
Mat. 25. 13. <hi>Watch, for ye do not know
the day nor the hour when the Son of
Man cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:96891:78"/>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> A late Repentance will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be found a thing full of danger, if
not in some sort impossible, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the time of Sickness, or the
hour of Death is a very improper, and
unseasonable time for Repentance. If
Men be not surprized by sudden Death,
or snatcht away in wrath before <hi>the
Pots perceive the Thorns,</hi> as the Psalmist
phrases it; yet how often are they seiz'd
on by such kind of Diseases, as render
their Repentance a thing impossible? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
speaks of a <hi>Morbus insanabilis qui
animo afficiat, &amp; mentem concutiat,</hi> such
a violent Distemper, as either deprives
Men wholly of their Reason, or else
disturbs the use of their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
And tho' he speaks but of one in
the singular number, yet Physitians tell of
many in their Books, such as the <hi>Coma,</hi>
the <hi>Lethargy,</hi> the <hi>Carus,</hi> the <hi>Appoplexy,</hi>
the <hi>Catoche, Catalepsiis, Erisipylas, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy,
Mania,</hi> and several others. Now has
any presumptuous Sinner a protection
from Heaven against these drowsie stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifyed
Distempers, such as will deprive
him of his Reason, and consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitate
him for any works of Piety
and Religion? but supose the sinner should
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96891:78"/>
escape such Diseases as these, do not
other Diseases render the time of Death
a most improper season for the work of
Repentance? Let but such a presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sinner sometimes bestow a visit on
his sick Friends and Nieghbours, and
then let him judge whether the time of
sickness be a fit time to perform such a
difficult and important work as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is. May he not now see how
troubled and disturbed their thoughts
are? How uneasie and disturbed their
Minds? How strangely doth their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Understanding decay? How fast
their Memories and Senses fail them<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
whilst their Bodies groan under great
anguish and extremity of Pain? And is
this, think ye, a proper time to prepare
for Eternity? is so much Weakness able
to wrestle with Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
Is he, who cannot help himself,
fit to encounter sin at its greatest
strength; and work in himself all the
pious habits of the contrary Vertues?
We do not ordinarily account them wise
Men, who leave their Worldly Affairs
to be settled at this time. What stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
folly then will it be to leave all
our Spiritual Concerns, matters of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96891:79"/>
Moment and Importance to be
transacted at our dying hour? The best
of Men are so indisposed in the time
of sickness, that they are unfit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themselves in any Religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.
Good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as pious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a Prince as he was, was able in
his sickness to do no more than chatter
as a Crane. Tho' none at other times
knew better how to pray, yet now it
seems he can but chatter, and is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
by reason of his Infirmity, to beg
the prayers of the Prophet <hi>Esay:</hi> And
as it was with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> so it happens
unto other holy Men; which occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that advice of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 5.
14. <hi>Is any Sick among you let him call
for the Elders of the Church, and let
them pray over him.</hi> And if good men,
if such as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> be rendred by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unfit for Prayer, and the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of Religion; how must sickness
indispose the wicked, who never were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with these Religious Exercises
before? They of all men are most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to set about such Duties as these:
For besides those exquisite Pains they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
under; besides all those indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both of Body and Mind, which they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96891:79"/>
have common with other men; the sad
remembrances of their former sins, and
the more dreadful apprehensions of an
incensed Deity, will now inhaunce their
troubles; they will fill their Souls with
unspeakable horrors, and even deter
them from endeavouring to make their
peace with Heaven. And besides all this,
Satan, we may be sure, will be busie at
this time to draw these sinners to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair:
Tho' he used to tell them in the
time of their health, that it was too
soon to Repent, yet this malicious Fiend
will now suggest that it is too late; he
will tell them the Door of Mercy is
now shut upon them, and that God,
whom they refused to hear all their
life long, will now be as backward to
hear them. All these considerations laid
together, will, I believe, make a late
Repentance a thing most dangerous, if
not in some sort impossible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> a late Death-bed Repentance will
appear a thing most dangerous, if not
in some sort impossible, if we consider
what is required to the compleating
and perfecting of Repentance. Now
Repentance doth denote our ceasing to
do evil, and our learning to do well:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96891:80"/>
Our rooting out all the inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of Vice, and planting in our Souls
the contrary habits of Vertue: And this
sure must be a work of great difficulty,
and consequently of time. For sin, as
it grows up by degrees, and gains
strength by custom and continuance, so
it must be conquered by degrees, abate
by a long series and succession of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Acts. Every step we made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
must be repeated backward; the
Web we formerly spun, must now all
be unravelled: And believe it, we will
find it a work of time and difficulty
too, to correct our impetuous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to render our sensual Appetites ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious
to Reason, our Passions regular
and steddy, and cleanse our Souls from
vanity, sloth, perversness and all viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
distempers. It takes good men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
months and years to conquer one
impetuous Lust, and subdue one unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Passion; and do these presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sinners expect to conquer all their
Lusts in a trice, to blow them away
with a little breath, a Lord have mercy
upon us, and the like? And as Vice is
not easily conquered, so neither is Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
so easily obtained: It is not like <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:96891:80"/>
Gourd, which grows up in a night;
no, it is a tender and delicate Plant, it
grows but slowly, it needs much pains
to cultivate it, much care to guard it,
much time to mature it, especially in
the untoward Soil of corrupt Nature,
and the unkindly weather of this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
World. And if it be so hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to obtain one single Vertue, what
pains, what time is required to get the
whole circle of them; <hi>to add</hi> as St.
<hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>to our Faith, Virtue; to
Virtue, Knowledge; to Knowledge, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi>
and so on? Is this, think ye, the
work of a dying hour, the business only
of a day, or the short time of sickness?
The whole time of our life seems too
little for it, and would in truth be so,
if God were not so Merciful, as to
crown our imperfect Endeavours with
his gracious assistance, and render them
in some sort perfect by his favourable
Acceptance. One thing more I shall
add unto this Head, which you may
learn from Rom. 2. 7. where St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, that we must <hi>by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in well doing, seek for glory, and
honour, and immortality.</hi> It seems we
cannot expect Eternal life, unless we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96891:81"/>
conquer Sin, and gain the contrary
habits of Vertue, yea, which is more
yet, we must <hi>patiently continue in
well-doing.</hi> All this will certainly make
a Death-bed Repentance a thing
most dangerous, if not in some sort
impossible, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
represents it, Chap. 13. 23. <hi>Can the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
change his skin, or the Leopard his
spots? Then may you also do good, who are
accustomed to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> A late Repentance will yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appear to be a thing most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
if not in some sort impossible, if
we consider how little it is such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Sinner is able to do in the
Time of Sickness. I grant, such a
person may express some Grief and
Sorrow for Sin; but since this Sorrow
proceeds more from fear of Punishment,
than any real love of God and Vertue,
it cannot be that <hi>Godly Sorrow, which
worketh Repentance to Salvation, never to
be repented of.</hi> I grant yet farther,
that such a sinner may with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
beg pardon for his sins, restore
perhaps his Ill-gotten Goods, and which
is the most he can do, make solemn
Resolutions of Amendment and better
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96891:81"/>
Obedience, if God should restore him
to his former Health. This is all such
a sinner can possible do at the Hour of
Death; but will all this amount to a
sincere and hearty Repentance? Pray,
let it be consider'd, what I told you
the last Lord's Day, namely, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has frequently declared these
dying Resolutions to be but forc'd and
feign'd; and such Penitents, when by
God's Mercy they have been restor'd to
their former Health, notwithstanding all
their Protestations, have <hi>with the Dog
returned to their Vomits, and with the
Sow to their wallowing in the Mire.</hi> And
have we any reason then, to look on
such Resolutions as these to be hearty
Repentances? Besides, a Resolution to
repent and amend, is not properly to
Repent and Amend. Apply this to
other Cases, and you'l easily find the
falsity of it. Suppose a man resolves
to learn the Art of Sailing, does this
Resolution presently make him a skilful
Mariner? No more does a Resolution
to repent and amend, make a true
Penitent or honest Christian: Such a
Change as this is not so easily wrought
such a Reformation is not so suddenly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96891:82"/>
produc'd. The <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> or any
other Art, may more easily be
learned, than the Art of <hi>Living-well;</hi>
because all Arts must be acquired by
repeated Acts; and since Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is more opposite to the <hi>Art of
Living-well,</hi> than to any other, it is
impossible it should be attained by a
bare unactive Resolution. Now tho'
all this do abundantly shew a late
Death-bed Repentance to be a thing
most dangerous, and in some sort im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
and yet seeing this is a Subject
of most serious importance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> I will in the Fifth place add one
Consideration more, which will shew it
yet to be more dangerous, and in some
sort impossible: And pray let it be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
that the Day of Grace may be
lost, before the Day of Death come.
Sure, it is not possible that such sinners
should repent, without the assistance of
God's Grace; and yet before their death
they may sin to such an height, as to
forfeit this assistance of God's Grace.
It is the vain fancy of such presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
sinners, that the <hi>Day of Grace</hi> and
the <hi>Day of Life</hi> run parallel, and that
as long as the one lasts, the other will
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96891:82"/>
last too; and therefore they encourage
themselves in their wickedness, thinking
they shall have time enough to repent
when they come to dye. But if this
Fancy of theirs be vain, the delaying
of Repentance till the Hour of Death,
must needs be a thing most dangerous,
and in some sort impossible. Now it is
very plain from Scripture, that God has
set bounds to his Patience, and limits
to his Mercy: Tho' he bears very
much with sinners, and waits a long
time to be gracious; yet he has told us
expresly, <hi>Gen. 6. 3. My Spirit shall not
always strive with Men:</hi> We find in the
following Verse, that God allowed the
<hi>Anti-Deluvians,</hi> or Old World, a long
Day of Grace, he promised to bear
with them 120 Years: now during this
time he sent unto them <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher
of <hi>Righteousness:</hi> Besides those Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
and frequent Calls the Holy Man
gave them to repent, his very building
the Ark, was a constant daily Sermon
to them; but when they would not
hearken unto this Preacher, but scoffed at
his Discourses, God did not tarry for
the time of their death, but with a
dreadful Deluge <hi>swept them all away.</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:96891:83"/>
In <hi>Luc.</hi> 19. 41, 42. we find our Saviour
weeping over <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and declaring
their wretched Condition in such like
doleful Accents as these: <hi>O that thou hadst
known, even thou, at least in this thy Day,
the things which belong unto thy Peace,
but now are they hid from thine Eyes.</hi>
It seems the Day of Grace has an Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before the Night of Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches:
The things of Peace were
hid from the Eyes of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> before
they were closed by the Hand of Death.
To this we may add what we read in
<hi>Prov. 1. 28. Then shall they call upon me,
but I will not answer; they shall seek me
early, but shall not find me.</hi> There is a
certain measure of Iniquity, God is said
in Scripture to allow Sinners to fill up;
and when this Measure is full, they may
call upon him in vain, they may seek
him early and late, but he will not hear
them. And as is it thus plain from these
Texts, that the Day of Grace may be
lost before the Day of Death; so the
same Truth may be evidenced by sundry
Scripture Examples. God allowed <hi>Cain</hi>
a Day of Grace, and during the Time
of this Day, <hi>Cain</hi> tho' he sinned again
and again, yet he heard nothing but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96891:83"/>
this <hi>Still Voice, if thou dost well, shalt
not thou be accepted? but if thou dost ill,
Sin lieth at the door.</hi> But when all the
Means of Grace were lost upon him;
when notwithstanding the frequent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of his Father, and solemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
of Heaven, he added sin to
sin, till at last, he fill'd up the Measure
of his Iniquity, by murdering Righteous
<hi>Abel;</hi> His season of Grace was then
gone, and God tells him in plain terms,
that he was then <hi>accursed from the
Earth.</hi> Now this hapned unto him
some hundreds of years before his death.
Another Instance we have in <hi>Esau,</hi>
whom the Apostle styles a <hi>Prophane
Person:</hi> He was an idle, unprofitable
Fellow, one who spent too much of his
time in Gaming and impertinent Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations;
and to all his other sins he added,
the felling of his <hi>Birthright,</hi> on which were
entailed all the <hi>Blessings of Heaven;</hi> and
this indeed shewed him to be a <hi>Prophane
Person</hi> with a witness? one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
his Sports and Recreations before
God and his Religion. Now this great
sin fill'd up the Measure of his Iniquity,
so that his Day of Grace expir'd some
50 years before his death, as Divines
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96891:84"/>
compute: And tho' now he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to regain his <hi>Birth-right;</hi> tho'
he sought the Blessing earnestly and
with Tears, yet he was rejected, there
was <hi>no place found for Repentance,
Heb.</hi> 12. 17. I shall add but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
more, and it shall be the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of wicked <hi>Saul,</hi> God had striven
with <hi>Saul</hi> many ways, and many times:
He had given him Riches and Honours,
yea, all the Glories of a Kingdom, and
which were more than all, the gifts
of his Spirit; but when <hi>Saul</hi> multiplied
his Transgressions, and notwithstanding
such signal Tokens of his Favour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against the Lord, God then
cast him off; yea, he sent an <hi>Evil
Spirit</hi> to torment him, and would no
longer hearken to his Cries, as he sadly
confesses to the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> Now
this Rejection hapned 36 years before
he died, according to <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology.
Thus God does withdraw the
Assistance of his Spirit from sinners
long before they dye: In their Life
time he delivers them up to a Spirit of
slumber and of giddiness: He hardens
their Hearts, and sears their Consciences;
and gives them over to a Reprobate
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96891:84"/>
sense. And since these things are so, it
will be too late for the Clinicks of the
Age to Repent when they come to dye.
If they will obstinately go on in a
Course of wickedness, and multiply
their Transgressions, till the measure of
their Iniquity be full, then they are
beyond the possibility of Salvation;
they have then forfeited the Assistance
of God's Grace, without which it is
impossible they should repent. It will
therefore be safe for sinners to follow
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Advice, <hi>To day if you will hear
his Voice, harden not your Hearts:</hi> As the
Prophets Exhorts, <hi>Seek the Lord while
he may be found, call upon him while he is
near.</hi> Let not this present Discourse,
this present Opportunity be lost upon
you; for, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Now
is the accepted time, now is the day of
salvation:</hi> Begin this very moment to
resolve against thy sins; come this day
to the Holy Sacrament, and there vow
and swear, that thou wilt hereafter
keep all Gods <hi>Righteous Iudgments.</hi> I
shall conclude all with the excellent
Advice of the Son of <hi>Sirach: Say not,
God's Mercy is great, and he will be
pacified for the multitude of thy Sins:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96891:85"/>
For Mercy and Wrath is with him; he
is mighty to forgive, and to pour out Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
and as his Mercy is great, so
are his Corrections also. Therefore make
no long tarrying to turn to the Lord, and
put not off from day to day: For suddenly
shall the Wrath of the Lord come forth,
and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed.
Humble thy self before thou be sick, and
in the time of Sins shew Repentance: Let
nothing hinder to pay thy Vows in due
time, and defer not till Death to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Occasion of which
Words we may easily
learn from the Context:
We find <hi>Ver.</hi> 33. that our
Blessed Saviour was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
betwixt two Theives, or Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors:
Tho' he was <hi>without Sin,</hi> yet,
as the Apostles speaks, he appeared in
the <hi>likeness of sinful Flesh;</hi> and, as the
Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> tells us, was <hi>numbred with
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96891:94"/>
the Transgressors,</hi> Chap. 53. 12. Now
one of these Malefactors begins to rail
on our Saviour, saying, <hi>If thou be the
Christ, save thy self and us,</hi> vers. 39.
It is an Argument of desperate Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to insult over such as are in
Misery; it is no less than to defie Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, who is the Protector of
such as are in misery, and uses to avenge
their quarrel: And therefore the other
Malefactor rebukes him, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. saying,
<hi>Dost not thou fear God,</hi> especially <hi>since thou
art in the same Condemnation?</hi> Such as are
in Prosperity do ordinarily forget God,
but in time of Adversity most men will
consider: When they are approaching
towards the <hi>Gates of Death,</hi> they are
then generally serious, the Thoughts of
another World, and the prospect of a
Future State, usually strikes an awe into
their Souls: But this Thief is so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
wicked, that even on the Cross,
and when Death was near at hand, he
despises God, and reviles our Saviour.
But the other Thief gives ample de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of his sincere Repentance
and Faith in the Messiah: For he does
not only rebuke his Fellow Thief, and
endeavours his Conversion; but he also
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96891:94"/>
acknowledges his Fault, aud patiently
submits to the Punishment, as a <hi>just
reward of his evil deeds,</hi> ver. 41. If such
scandalous persons that are amongst us,
would, when they are upon their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds,
thus take shame to themselves
by a free Confession of their Faults: If
they would send for such persons, whom
in the time of their Health they have
endeavour'd to debauch, either by their
Example or Counsel, and acquaint them
with the danger of <hi>Sin,</hi> and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they then find in it; they would
give the World much better demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their sincere Repentance, and
much surer grounds to hope their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
welfare. And as this poor Thief
gives such ample demonstrations of his
sincere Repentance; so he gives also
very good proof of a true and stedfast
Faith in Christ; for <hi>ver.</hi> 42. he says
unto Christ Jesus, <hi>Lord, remember me,
when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</hi> Ye
see he believes Christ to be the Lord,
and to have a Kingdom, tho' not in this
World, which was more than Christ's
own Disciples did: Nay farther, he owns
Christ upon the Cross, and when in the
lowest degree of his state of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96891:95"/>
even when all the <hi>Iews</hi> were
mocking and persecuting him; yea, when
his own Disciples forsook him, and
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> one of the Chiefest, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
him thrice: Nay farther yet, how
wonderful was his Humility? He only
desires, that Christ would remember him
in his Kingdom. He does not presume
to ask, that he might sit on Christ's
Right hand, or on his Left, in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but only, that he would <hi>remember
him.</hi> A true penitent humble Soul will
think the least degree of Mercy great
enough, or too great for him. I have
the rather noted all this, because too
many encourage themselves in their
Wickedness by the Example of this poor
Thief: They think they may live as
they list, and yet be saved if they
repent on a Sick-bed, and at the Hour
of Death: But how rare is it, that God
does give such Presumptuous sinners
so much Grace in the time of their
Sickness? How seldom do they give
such ample demonstrations of their
Faith, Humility, and sincere Repentance?
Now, what Answer doth Christ return
to this honest Thief? The Text will
give you a fair account of this: <hi>Then said
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96891:95"/>
Iesus unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi>
In which Words we have a fair descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the happiness of pious Souls,
after they are departed from this
wretched Body. I shall consider the
Words in the same order that they lye:
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They assure us, That pious
Souls are immediately admitted to the
actual possession of Happiness, upon
their departure from the Body: <hi>To
Day,</hi> saith Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They do farther assure us
of the greatness of this Happiness;
they shall be with Christ, and they
shall be in Paradise: <hi>To day shalt thou be
with me in Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> These Words assure us, that
pious Souls are immediately admitted
to the actual possession of Happiness,
upon their depature from the Body.
There are a sort of Men in the World
they call <hi>Psychoparruychites,</hi> who hold,
that <hi>the Soul, after its departure from
the Body, sleeps all the while till the
General Resurrection, and consequently is
neither in a state of Ioy nor Misery till
the Day of Iudgment; when it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96891:96"/>
united to the Body, and sent with it either
to Heaven or Hell.</hi> But it is plain from
the Text, that the Souls of Good men
are immediately, after their departure
from the Body, admitted to the actual
possession of Eternal happiness: For
Christ does here promise this honest
Thief, that he should be that <hi>very day</hi>
with him in Paradise. Paradise is a place
of Joy and Bliss, and to be with Christ, is
to be in a state of Happiness. Now in
such a place, and in such a state was the
Thief to be that very day. So <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 56.
St. <hi>Stephen saw the Heavens open'd, and
the Son of Man standing on the Right
hand of God:</hi> He knew the Heavens
were open'd for him, and that Christ
stood there ready to receive him into
Glory; and therefore he prays, <hi>ver. 59.
Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.</hi> So again,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 8. We are confident, I say, and
willing rather to be absent from the Body,
and to be present with the Lord.</hi> It seems
the pious Soul, as soon as it is absent
from the Body, it is present with the
Lord, and consequently in a state of
Bliss and Glory. Again, <hi>Revel. 14. 13.
I heard a Voice from Heaven, saying,
Write, blessed are the dead which dye in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96891:96"/>
the Lord from henceforth, yea, saith the
Spirit that they may rest from their labours,
and their works do follow them.</hi> Ye see
here the Godly are said to be blessed as
soon as they dye; and not only to rest,
but also to receive the reward of their
good Works. I shall add but one Text
more, which you'l find, <hi>Phil. 1. 21, 22.
I am in a strait betwixt two,</hi> saith
St. <hi>Paul, having a desire to depart and to
be with Christ, which is far better. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
to abide in the flesh is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for you.</hi> As much as if the Apostle
should have said, I cannot tell whether
I should desire, to live longer, or to dye
sooner, being prest with Arguments on
both sides: If I consult my self and my
own good, it is doubtless better for me
to dye, and enter presently into Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
But then, if I consult your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
it were better I should live
longer in the World, to be serviceable
unto your Edification. Now I think it
is evident, that if the Apostle could
have supposed, that his Soul should have
slept after death, and not presently have
enter'd into the fruition of Bliss, there
could have been no strait in the case, nor
any dispute, but that it was better to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96891:97"/>
live still in the World, to continue in
the Comforts of a good Conscience, and
of doing good to others, rather than to
be in a constant sleep, or in a sensless
state of stupidity and inactivity. From
all which Places of Scripture it is most
plain, that the Souls of good Men do
not sleep, after their separation from the
Body, (as some among us fancy) but
are immediately received into Bliss, as
<hi>Lazarus</hi> was into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom, and
the Thief here in the Text into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> And we learn from hence the
Reason, why the Primitive Christians
did celebrate their Funerals with Joy and
Feasting: We use to rejoyce at the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of our Friends in this World;
and they much more, at their happiness
in a better. They did not therefore, as
we do now, hang their Houses and
Churches with Mourning; but, as <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi>
tells us, with <hi>White,</hi> the Emblem
of <hi>Ioy:</hi> For they looked upon the day
of their Deaths, as their Birth-day to an
Eternal life; and their going out of this
World, as an entrance upon the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Happiness of a better. And
indeed we shall find, they had Cause
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96891:97"/>
enough to rejoyce, if we consider the
greatness of the Happiness they were
possess'd of; and this I told you was
exprest in the Text by these two
things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> They shall be with Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> They shall be in Paradise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> The Godly, after death, are said
to be with Christ. Now, how great is
the Happiness which lies couched in
these Words? We cannot be with
Christ, but we must be with all the
Saints and Angels of Heaven: Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we must enjoy the sweet and
ravishing Communion of all the Persons
of the Ever Blessed Trinity: And sure
such Company cannot but enhaunce the
happiness of Heaven. Society is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
styled <hi>Sal vitae,</hi> the <hi>Salt of
Life;</hi> without this the Life of Man
would be most unsavoury and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
We know God said at the Creation
of the World, <hi>It is not good for Man to
be alone.</hi> It seems Paradise it self would
have been a Valley of <hi>Bacha,</hi> little less
than a Comfortless Solitude, without the
refreshments of Society. That therefore
nothing may be wanting to compleat the
happiness of the Paradise above, St. <hi>Paul,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96891:98"/>
Heb.</hi> 12. 22. gives us a large Catalogue
of that Glorious Company we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with in Heaven; <hi>We shall come,</hi>
saith he, <hi>to the General Assembly of the
First born, to the Spirits of Iust Men
made Perfect, to an innumerable Company
of Angels, and to God the Iudge of all,
and to Iesus, the Mediator of the New
Covenant.</hi> From which place it is most
plain, that we cannot be with Christ,
but we must also be with God, with
Angels, and with the Spirits of Just
Men made Perfect. Now such Glorious
Company cannot but make the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Paradise exceeding great, as will
appear more at large by considering in
particular what it is to be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> With all the Saints of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What it is to be with the
Angels. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What it is to be with God
and Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Let us enquire what it is to be
with all the Saints of Heaven, and how
the happiness of Paradise is inhaunced by
such Glorious Company. It is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
of the Godly here below, that
with <hi>Daniel,</hi> they are forced sometimes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96891:98"/>
to dwell in the same Den with Lions,
or else converse, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
with Men that did more truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the name of Beasts. How was
righteous <hi>Lot</hi> vexed daily with the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Conversation of the <hi>Sodomites?</hi>
How does <hi>David</hi> mourn, that he was
forced to dwell in <hi>Mesech,</hi> and sojourn
in the Tents of <hi>Kedar?</hi> The good Man
whilst he lives in this World, has his
Eyes daily bloodshot with Murders; his
Ears unhallowed with Oaths and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies;
his Nostrils offended with the
Drunkards Vomits; and his Memory
made too often the Cabinet of vain
frothy or obscene Discourses; so that
with good <hi>Lucullus</hi> in <hi>Tully,</hi> he frequently
desires his Memory were worse, or that
he could learn the Art of Oblivion. But
in Heaven the Godly shall be free from
all such vile and troublesom Company:
Here there will be no Murderers, no
Whoremongers, no Drunkards, no Dogs
to molest them, Rev. 22. 15. <hi>In the
Heavenly</hi> Canaan <hi>there will be no</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites
<hi>to be pricks in their Eyes, and
Thorns in their Sides: But they shall
converse for ever with all the Saints of
Heaven, and live in the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96891:99"/>
of the First-born.</hi> Now what it is thus
to live with all the Saints of Heaven,
I shall shew you more distinctly in these
following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The Godly shall know all the
Blessed Saints that are in Heaven. It is
a wonder it should be disputed by any
Divines, whether the Saints in Glory shall
know one another: But sure there can
be little comfort in Society, where there
is not a particular Knowledge and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Acquaintance. St. <hi>Austin</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tells us, <hi>In Caelo a singulis omnes,
ab omnibus singuli cognoscentur, In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
saith he, <hi>all Men shall be known of
every Man, and every Man shall be
known of all Men.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that being reasonable well the night
before he died, he sate at Table with
his Friends, and the matter of their
Discourse hapned to be, <hi>Whether they
should know one another in Heaven? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Father should know his Child, a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
his Wife, and a Friend his Friend?
Luther</hi> resolv'd the point in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
and gave this Reason, among
others, for it; <hi>Adam,</hi> saith he, <hi>knew</hi>
Eve <hi>as soon as he saw her; and be sure
our Knowledge in the Heavenly Paradise
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96891:99"/>
shall be much greater than his was in
the Earthly Paradise; none will be strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
there, but every Glorified Saint
shall know all the Patriarchs, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, and all the Servants
of God.</hi> We find, Mat. 17. 4. <hi>Peter,
Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who were allowed to
see. Christs Transfiguration, knew <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they had never
seen before; how much more shall we,
being fully illuminated, and perfectly
Glorified in Heaven, know exactly all
the blessed Ones, tho' never acquainted
with them upon Earth? This therefore
is one part of the Happiness of the
Godly in Heaven, they shall see <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Kingdom
of God, as our Saviour speaks, <hi>Luke
13.</hi> 28. They shall know all those Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
and Heroes that have gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before, or shall come thither after
them; but this is not all, For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> We shall not only know all God's
Saints in Heaven, but we shall have
more sweet and ravishing Communion
with them. Here a <hi>Nazianzin</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the embraces of his beloved <hi>Basil,</hi>
a <hi>David</hi> for ever enjoy his Dearest <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
and the Pious Soul possess what
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96891:100"/>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> could of old but wish for;
namely, the intimate converses of all
those Brave Heroes who have gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before him. And you'l easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there shall be most sweet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
among the Saints in Heaven,
when you have considered the important
Phrase, by which it is exprest, Mat. 8.
11. <hi>And I say unto you, that many shall
come from the</hi> East <hi>and</hi> West, <hi>and shall
sit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi>
Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> In
our Translation it is <hi>shall sit down,</hi> but
in the Greek it is <hi>shall lie down upon
Beds,</hi> as they used to do at their
greatest Feasts. So that there shall be
much sweet and pleasant Communion
among the Saints in Heaven, as uses to
be among Friends at their most solemn
Feasts. Hence also we read, Luke 16.
22. <hi>That</hi> Lazarus <hi>was carried by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Bosom.</hi> It was the
manner of the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they feasted, to
lean in the Bosom one of another: Thus
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he sat to eat with Christ,
is said <hi>to lean in his Bosom.</hi> So here,
<hi>Lazarus</hi> being laid in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom,
denotes they have a continual Feast of
Joy in Heaven; they are constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96891:100"/>
with the Supper of the Lamb;
and consequently must needs have sweet
and ravishing Society and Communion
each with other. And how does this
inhance the Happiness of Paradise above?
Ask your own experience, what sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
you have found in their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here below? Did not King <hi>David</hi>
account them the most excellent Persons
upon Earth, and delight exceedingly in
the society of God's Saints? And if so
much delight be to be found, if so much
Sweetness be to be tasted in the Society
of the Saints here on Earth, How much
more abundantly shall we be satisfied
with their Company and Conversation
in Heaven? Alas, here the very best of
men have so many Imperfections, and
are subject to so many Misfortunes,
as do often make their Acquaintance
troublesome and unpleasant to us. Hence
it was good Advice which was given
by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> namely, <hi>that we should not
greatly multiply Friends, because their
frequent falling into Miseries and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
would imbitter our Lives, and
make our Condition wretched and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
But in Heaven we are told to our
Comfort, that we shall converse with <hi>the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96891:101"/>
Spirits of just men made Perfect.</hi> The
Saints in Heaven will have no infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
no imperfections to abate and allay
the solaces of their Conversation: But
on the other hand, they will have all
those Excellencies and Advantages which
are requisite to make their Company
Sweet and Desirable; and how great
must this Happiness needs be? When
Christs Disciples, at the Transfiguration
enjoyed the Company only of <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Elias,</hi> they were so well satisfied
with it, that they cried out <hi>bonum est
nobis esse hic,</hi> it is good for us to be
here. How much greater will their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
be, who shall be with Christ in
Paradise! For they cannot be with him,
but they must be with all his Saints.
As soon as this Penitent Thief entred
the gates of Heaven, he was joyfully
received with all the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
and Troops above. There did
the Patriarch meet him, the Prophets
hug'd him, and the Martys struck up
their Harps and bid him welcome to
the Celestial Regions; such joy as this
did enter his Soul, when he did enter
into <hi>the joy of his Master.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:96891:85"/>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> To be with Christ, is not only
to be with all the Saints, but also with
all the Angels of Heaven. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, Heb. 12. 22. <hi>That when we come to
the Heavenly Ierusalem, we shall come to
an innumerable Company of Angels.</hi> How
great must the pleasure be of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with such Glorious Creatures!
How great the Happiness of hearing
their ravishing Musick! The Seraphims
and Cherubims are continually Blessing
and Praising God; and their Heavenly
Harmony consists of ten thousand times
ten thousand various Voices. So we
read. Rev. 5. 11. <hi>I heard</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn)
the Voice of many Angels round about the
Throne, and the number of them was ten
thousand times, ten Thousand, yea even
thousands of thousands:</hi> This is the true
Musick of the Sphears, and it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be most ravishing, since it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by such vast numbers of such
Glorious Choristers. This is the great
Happiness of the Godly in Heaven, they
shall live with the General Assembly of
the First-born, and with an innumerable
company of Angels, crying out conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
with them, <hi>Thou art worthy, O
Lord to receive Honour, and Glory and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96891:86"/>
Power.</hi> But this is not all, for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall not only be with Christs Saints
and Angels, But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> They shall be with Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Now the Godly in Heaven shall
be with Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In respect of his Humility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In respect of his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Godly shall be with Christ
in respect of his Humility. <hi>This day,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>shalt thou be with me.</hi> As
soon as Christ's Soul was separated from
his Body, it went to Heaven, and the
poor Thiefs went along with it. But
the Godly that die now, they see not
only the Soul, but also the Body of
Christ. Hence St. <hi>Paul,</hi> describing the
Happiness of the Godly in Heaven,
tells us, <hi>That they shall come to Iesus,
the Mediator of the New Covenant.</hi> Now
Christ, as Mediator, was Man as well as
God: And it will be part of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to be with him as Man. It was
one of St. <hi>Austins</hi> three wishes, <hi>that he
might see Christ in the Flesh:</hi> But in
Heaven we shall not only see Christs
Body, but we shall see all that Glory
God has bestowed upon it there. To
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96891:86"/>
this purpose is our Saviours Prayer,
John 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will, that they
also whom thou hast given me, may be
with me, where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
my Glory, which thou hast given me.</hi>
How great will our Happiness be, when
we shall behold all Christs Glory? When
we shall see him sitting at the Right
Hand of Power, highly exalted above
every Name; yea, even above the most
Glorious Cherubims and Seraphims. And
this Glory of Christ will rejoyce us the
more, because our Nature is Glorified in
him. As a Queen that sees the Prince
in his Glory, delights the more in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she looks upon it as her own. So
when the Church Triumphant shall see
Christ her Husband in all his Glory, she
will rejoyce in it, because it is her own
Glory. Who can express this part of
our Happiness? <hi>Blessed are the Eyes,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>which see those things that
you see here.</hi> If it were such a blessed
thing to see Christ in his state of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.
How great will that Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be, when we shall see him in his
State of Glory and Exaltation? It will
be the business of God's Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
eternally to follow the Lamb whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96891:87"/>
he goeth, and admire the
Lustre and Beauty of the Glorified Jesus.
So we are told, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. where
it is said, <hi>that when Christ shall come in
the Glory of his Power, he shall come to
be Glorified in his Saints, and to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in all them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Godly shall be with Christ
in respect of his Divinity. In Heaven
we shall enjoy the Glorious presence of
the Divine Majesty. Here we shall see
God, and which is more, we shall see
him as he is. Here it is that we shall
see the King of Heaven in his perfect
Beauty, and we shall not only see him,
but we shall also enjoy him, and have
sweet and ravishing Communion with
all the persons of the ever blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
And this is that which is the very
height of bliss. To enjoy the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Saints and Angels is happiness,
great beyond our utmost imagination;
and yet they are but as little drops, if
compared to that Ocean of Bliss which
will flow into the Soul upon the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God himself. It was a noble
saying of <hi>Luthers, that he had rather be
in Hell with God's presence, than in
Heaven without it:</hi> And if the presence
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96891:87"/>
of God be thus able to convert even
Hell it self into Heaven, the enjoyment
of this will certainly make Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
what it is styled in Scripture, <hi>an
Heaven of Heavens.</hi> This therefore is
the Flower of Joy, the Quintessence of
Comfort, the Crown of Blessedness, and
the very Soul of Heaven. For whilst
we enjoy God, we must needs enjoy all
things. All that is good did at first
flow from him, and therefore is more
eminently to be found in him, as in its
Fountain and Original. All that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
our Souls, or ravish our Hearts; all
that is lovely and desirable, are here to
be found, in their greatest perfections:
Well then might the Psalmist say<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Psal.
16. 11. <hi>In thy Presence there is fulness
of Ioy, and at thy Right Hand, there
are Pleasures for evermore.</hi> But because
so Copious, so Pleasant, and so edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Subject does deserve better than to
be lightly toucht in the close of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
I shall reserve the fuller handling
of it till the next opportunity. Thus
ye see the top of our Happiness in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
consists in our enjoyment of the
Blessed Trinity. And since these things
are so, give me leave to exhort you to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96891:88"/>
acquaint your selves with this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Trinity. The more we
know of the Trinity here, the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
shall we be of enjoying Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Father, Son and Holy Ghost
hereafter. When therefore ye go home,
meditate on the Lessons, and other Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scripture which our Church
this day recommends to your serious
consideration: This is the way to be
well acquainted with the Three Persons
of the Blessed Trinity, and prepare your
selves for the happy enjoyment of them
in Heaven; which God grant.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Luke xxiv. 43.</bibl>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have formerly made some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon these Words, and
hope now to finish them. The
Method I proposed was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To shew you, that the
Souls of the Godly are immediately
admitted to the actual possession of
Happiness, upon their departure from
the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:96891:89"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Happiness is exceeding
great, for it is said here in the Text,
<hi>That they shall be with Christ, and they
shall be in Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Souls of the Godly, after
their departure from the Body, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
admitted to the actual posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Happiness. There are a sort of
Men in the World they call <hi>Psycho-panni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletes,</hi>
who hold, the Soul after its sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Body, sleeps all the
while till the general Resurrection, and
consequently is neither in a State of Joy
or Misery. <hi>But how do these men err,
not knowing the Scripture?</hi> For here in
the Text, our Saviour says unto the
Thief, <hi>to day shalt thou be with me in
Paradise.</hi> Paradise is a place of Joy
and Bliss, and to be with Christ is to be
in a state of Happiness. Now in such
a place, and in such a state was this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Thief to be that very day. I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
several Texts for the clearing of
this Truth, but I shall only name one
of them at this time, which you will
find, Phil. 1. 21, 22. <hi>I am in a strait be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul having a desire
to depart, and to be with Christ, which is
far better: Nevertheless, to abide in the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96891:89"/>
Flesh is more needful for you.</hi> As much
as if the Apostle should have said, I
cannot tell whether I should desire,
to live longer, or die sooner, being
prest with Arguments on both sides. If
I consult my own good, it is doubtless
better for me die, and enter presently
into Happiness; but then if I consult
your convenience, it were better I should
live longer in the World to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to your Edification. Now I
think it is evident, that if the Apostle
could have supposed, that his Soul
should have slept after Death, and not
presently have entred into the fruition
of Bliss, there could have been no strait
in the case, nor any dispute, but that it
was better to live still in the World, to
continue in the Comforts of a good
Conscience, and of doing good to others,
rather than to be in a constant Sleep,
or in a sensless state of Stupidity and
Inactivity. From these places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it is most plain, that the Souls of
good Men do not sleep after Death, but
are immediately received into Bliss, as
<hi>Lazarus</hi> was into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom, and
this honest Thief, in the Text, into
Paradise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:96891:90"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Happiness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is exceeding great, for they are said,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> To be with Christ. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> To be in Paradise.</p>
            <p>1. The Godly after Death, are said to
be with Christ; and how great is the
Happiness which lies couched in these
words? For we cannot be with Christ,
but we must be with all the Saints, and
with all the Angels of Heaven; nay
further, we must enjoy the sweet and
ravishing Communion of all the Persons
of the ever Blessed Trinity. So much
may be gathered from Heb. 12. 22, 23.
<hi>We shall come,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly of the First-Born; to the
Spirits of Iust Men made Perfect; to an
innumerable company of Angels, to God
the Iudge of all, and to Iesus the Mediator
of the New Covenant.</hi> From this place it
is most plain, that we cannot be with
Christ, but we must be with God, with
Angels, and with the Spirits of Just Men
made perfect: And sure such Glorious
Company cannot but make the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Paradise exceeding great.</p>
            <p>1. I shew'd you, that we shall in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
be with all the Saints in Heaven;
nor shall we barely be with them, but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96891:90"/>
we shall know them. If the Three Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
who were admitted to Christ's
Transfiguration, knew <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>
whom they had never seen before; no
doubt but we, being fully illuminated,
and perfectly Glorified in Heaven, shall
know all the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Saints and Martyrs; and therefore
our Saviour says expresly, Luke 13. 28.
<hi>That the Godly hereafter shall see</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of
God:</hi> Thus we shall see and know all the
Blessed Inhabitants of Heaven: Nor shall
we only know them, but we shall have
sweet Converse and Communion with
them. To this purpose is that, Matt. 8.
11. <hi>Many shall come from the</hi> East, <hi>and
from the</hi> West, <hi>and shall sit down with</hi>
Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the
Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Sit down, that is,
as the Original imports, they shall feast
with them. And this sure does not only
denote their mutual Knowledge each of
other, but also the highest Caresses of
Love and Friendship, such as this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
of feasting is used in Scripture
to denote. And this sure cannot but
mightily inhance the Happiness of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:
<hi>David</hi> accounted the Saints of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96891:91"/>
God, the most excellent Persons here
upon Earth, and delighted in nothing so
much as in their Society: But in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
they shall be made perfect; there
they shall be freed from all those Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Infirmities and Imperfections
which use to allay the solaces of their
Conversation. Yea, on the contray,
they shall be adorned with all those
Excellencies and Advantages which are
requisite to make their Society most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and desirable. And indeed we find
the Disciples, at the Transfiguration,
were so satisfied with the Company of
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> two of these Glorious
Inhabitants of Heaven, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
cry out, <hi>it is good for us to be here,</hi>
and would have built Tabernacles, and
have been content to have taken their
rest on this side of Heaven. How much
greater will their Happiness be, who
shall enjoy the most ravishing Society
of all the Blessed Inhabitants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
But,</p>
            <p>2. We shall not only enjoy the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Saints, but of Angels too, So I
have shewn you already, from <hi>Heb. 12.
22.</hi> where it is said, <hi>We shall come to an
innumerable Company of Angels.</hi> Angels
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96891:91"/>
are far more glorious Creatures than the
Saints, and therefore the enjoyment of
them must needs be a farther addition to
our happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> We shall also in Paradise be
with Christ, in respect of his Humanity.
<hi>To day shalt thou be with me in Paradise:
With me,</hi> whom thou now seest hanging
on the Cross. It was one of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s
three famous Wishes to see Christ in the
Body; but it shall be our happiness in
Paradise, not barely to see Christ's Body,
but also to see that Glory God has
adorn'd it with there. To this purpose
is that Prayer of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh. 17. 24.
Father, I will that they also whom thou
hast given me, be with me where I am,
that they may behold my Glory which thou
hast given me.</hi> We shall there see Christ
sitting on the Right hand of Power,
highly exalted above <hi>Seraphims</hi> and
<hi>Cherubims;</hi> and the sight of all this
Glory will rejoyce us the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our Human Nature is glorified in
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> The Godly, by being with
Christ in Paradise, shall also be with
God himself. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore giving
a full Catalogue of that glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96891:92"/>
we shall enjoy in Heaven, tells us,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. that we shall not only
come to the <hi>General Assembly of the
First-born,</hi> and <hi>to an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Angels,</hi> and <hi>to Iesus, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
of the New-Covenant;</hi> but he
adds, <hi>to God the Iudge of all.</hi> To enjoy
the Company of Saints, Angels, and
Christ, as Man, is Happiness great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our utmost Imagination: But yet
they are but as little Drops, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to that Ocean of Bliss, which
will flow into the Soul upon the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God himself. It was a Noble
Saying of <hi>Luthers,</hi> That <hi>he had rather
be in Hell with Gods presence, than in
Heaven without it.</hi> Now if this Presence
of God be able to convert even Hell it
self into a kind of Heaven; the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this must certainly make Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
become what it is styled in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
an <hi>Heaven of Heavens.</hi> This
therefore is the Flower of our Joy, the
Crown of Blessedness, and the very
Soul of Heaven: For whilst we enjoy
God, we must needs enjoy all things.
All that is good did at first flow from
him, and is therefore certainly more
eminently to be found in Him, as in its
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96891:92"/>
Fountain and Original. All that can
delight our Souls, or ravish our Hearts;
all that is lovely and desirable, are here
to be found in their greatest perfections.
Well then might the <hi>Psalmist</hi> say, <hi>Psal.
16. 11. In thy presence, O God, there is
fulness of Ioy, and at thy right hand there
are Pleasures for evermore.</hi> But because
this will be the Quintessence of our
happiness in Heaven, we will enquire
wherein it will consist. But,</p>
            <p>1. Give me leave to premise this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That in this <hi>Vale of Misery</hi> we
cannot fully understand those Joys which
God has prepared for us in Heaven:
They are such, saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Eye
hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath
it entred into the heart of Man to conceive.</hi>
You'l find also St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaking the
same Truth, <hi>1. Ioh. 3. 2. Beloved, now
are we the Sons of God, and it doth not
yet appear what we shall be; but we
know that when he shall appear, we shall
be like him.</hi> As God gave <hi>Moses</hi> the
sight of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> only, from
Mount <hi>Nebo;</hi> so he gives us a prospect
of the Heavenly, but it is at a distance:
So that we do not fully here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the greatness of our happiness;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96891:93"/>
and it is some honour and advantage to
it, that it is so great, as that we cannot
fully comprehend it: But so far as God
in Scripture has revealed the happiness
of Paradise to us, it will chiefly consist
in these two Observations:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> A clear and perfect Knowledge
of God, and his Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> In the enjoyment of him to all
Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> Our happiness in Paradise will
chiefly consist in a clear and perfect
Knowledge of God, and his Infinite
Perfections. <hi>Knowledge</hi> was the fairest
Fruit that ever grew in the Earthly
Paradise; and we cannot imagin the
Paradise above should be compleat and
perfect without it. Knowledge is so
sweet and pleasant to the Soul, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Oratour calls it, <hi>Naturale Anim<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
pabulum,</hi> the <hi>most grateful and palatable
Food of the Soul. It is dearer to us,</hi>
saith <hi>Aristotle, than our Eyes, which are
usually wasted and worn away in pursuits
after it.</hi> Now as Knowledge in the
general is thus sweet and pleasant to
the Soul, so the nobler the Objects are
which we know, the sweeter and more
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96891:101"/>
pleasant must the Knowledge be. Now
there can be no Object so noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
as Almighty God: He is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in Perfections, and therefore to
have a clear and perfect Knowledge of
his Infinite and Divine Perfections, must
needs make a considerable part of our
future happiness. Now it is plain from
Scripture, that we shall have a clear
and perfect knowledge of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Here it is, that, as the Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> speaks, we shall <hi>see the King of
Kings in all his beauty,</hi> Esay 33. 17.
Indeed, the Soul here below, like the
Spouse in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> seeks her <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi>
only in the dark, beholds his Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
in the Glass of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> reads
a little more of him in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and tastes a litle more of him in
his <hi>Comfortable Ordinances;</hi> yet still
she sees him but darkly, and through
the Lattice, and all is able to do no
more, than to make her <hi>sick of Love:</hi>
But hereafter we shall <hi>see God face to face,
and we shall know him, even as we are
known, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 12 We shall not then
sit down content with the School-mans
Negative Knowledge, and be
proud, when we know only what God
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96891:102"/>
is not: No, we shall then have a Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Knowledge of him, and as St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
phrases it, <hi>see him even as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2.
What strange Expressions are these!
How clear and how full a Knowledge
of God do they import! We shall no
longer read of God in the Scripture, or
hear of him by his Ministers, but we
shall see him with our Eyes, yea, and we
shall see him as he is, in all that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Glory, which is the Light and Sun of
the highest Heavens. Now, how much
such clear Knowledge of God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our future happiness, we may learn
in some measure from the Story of the
Queen of the South: The Q. of <hi>Sheba</hi>
heard indeed some imperfect Reports
of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom in her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
but when she came and saw his
Person, heard his incomparable Wisdom,
and had been an happy Spectator of
all the Pomp and Royal Magnificence of
his Court, she was then sweetly asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
so that <hi>there was no more Spirit
left in her:</hi> Even so, when the pious
Soul shall come to the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and there see God, as he is cloathed
with Majesty and Honour, infinitely
beyond and above all she ever heard of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96891:102"/>
him by his Ministers, or read of him
in the Scripture; when she shall behold
the Attendance of his Throne, even
<hi>ten thousand times ten thousand Angels</hi>
and comprehend all those ineffable Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which neither Eye hath seen, nor
Ear heard, with what pleasing Ecstasies
of Admiration will she then be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported!
But this is not all: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Our happiness in Paradise will
not barely consist in the clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Knowledge of God; but also in
the enjoyment of him unto all Eternity,
Knowledge without Fruition, can only
give us the Happiness of <hi>Moses</hi> upon
Mount <hi>Nebo;</hi> at best, but a fairer prospect
of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> but we are
assured in Scripture, that we shall not
only see this <hi>Land of Promise,</hi> but we
shall taste the <hi>Milk</hi> and the <hi>Hony</hi> of it:
We shall not only see and know God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
but we shall also enjoy him. This
Enjoyment of God is elegantly set forth
in Scripture by the Metaphor of a Feast,
because Friends usually enjoy themselves
most, when they Feast together. Now
what strange Expressions to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are those which we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 9.
where the Angel bids S. <hi>Iohn</hi> write thus,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96891:103"/>
               <hi>Blessed are they which are called to the
Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</hi> They
used to have their greatest Feasts at
Supper; but the happiness of Heaven
is here set forth, not only by the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
of a <hi>Supper,</hi> but also of a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Supper,</hi> to denote that more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and pleasant enjoyment of God
and Christ the Saints may expect in
Heaven: And lest we should in the least
doubt of this, these Emphatical words
are added, which perhaps ye do not
use much to take notice of, but now I
desire you to do; <hi>these,</hi> saith the Angel,
<hi>are the true Sayings of God:</hi> So that we
may well believe, the Saints shall enjoy
all this happiness I have spoken of.
Tho' this which I last mention'd, be a
most comfortable Text, yet, I think,
you'l find one fuller to this purpose,
<hi>Luk. 12. 37. Blessed are those Servants,
whom the Lord when he cometh shall find
watching: Verily I say unto you, that he
shall gird himself, and make them sit
down to meat, and will come forth and serve
them.</hi> Here again the happiness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is set forth by the Metaphor of a
<hi>Feast;</hi> and our Saviour alludes to those
Feasts among the <hi>Romans,</hi> which they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96891:103"/>
called their <hi>Saturnalia;</hi> when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
were obliged to provide sumptuous
Feasts for their Servants, and to gird
themselves and come forth and serve.
It seems God will deal thus with his
poor unworthy Servants: He will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
as great a Feast for them, as
Heaven can afford, and will come forth
himself and serve them. In this World
he makes use of Angels, as <hi>Ministring
Spirits,</hi> and imploys them for the good
of his People: But in the other World,
the happiness of the Godly will be so
great, and so infinite, that Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but finite Creatures, cannot serve
any longer as Conduits, to convey it to
them: No, God himself, as he will be
the Feast, so he will be the Entertainer,
too, and in a word, <hi>All in all.</hi> Thus I
have shewn you, how great our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will be in respect of God himself;
we shall have a clear and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him and his infinite Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
and we shall also have a full
Enjoyment of him unto all Eternity.
I proceed now to the last thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
namely, to consider the greatness
of this happiness, with reference to the
place.</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:96891:104"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> We shall not only be with
Christ, but we shall be with Christ in
Paradise. To be with Christ in any
place, cannot but be happiness: Had
our Saviour took the Penitent Thief
along with him, when he descended into
Hell, there to have seen him Triumph
over <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> and all
our spiritual Enemies, this had been a
blessed and most pleasant sight: But to
carry him along with himself to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
the pleasantness and glories of the
place could not but add to the happiness
of it. To this end you'l find the Holy
Ghost in Scripture exceeding large in the
description of this place, and it is set
forth by such Metaphors as denote the
most incomprehensible, both beauty, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness,
strength, splendour, and glory:
for pleasure, it is in the Text called
<hi>Paradise;</hi> for Magnificence, a <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
yea, a <hi>Kingdom of Glory</hi> too: It is
styled, <hi>an House not made with hands,</hi>
but by God himself, to denote both its
strength and workmanship: For Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
it is called a <hi>Great City:</hi> For
Purity, the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
Would we some Evening take a
walk with <hi>Isaac</hi> into the Fields, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96891:104"/>
there view how God has garnished these
upper Regions of the World, how many
are those Stars which sparkle there?
And they are also, most of them, of such
an incredible Magnitude, as to be more
than an hundred times bigger than the
Earth; and yet this Firmament, as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as it is, is only the outside of the
Pavement of that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is
above. What incomprehensible Glory
then must shine within it! We read in
the Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> that the very
<hi>Streets are of pure Gold,</hi> the <hi>Walls and
Foundations all of Precious Stones:</hi> Such
incredible lustre and glory is in it, that
the <hi>Sun</hi> shall not need to give his Light,
nor the Moon to shine in it; <hi>for the Glory
of God shall inlighten it, and the Lamb
shall be the light thereof for ever.</hi> Thus
happy shall the Godly be after they
depart this Life, they shall be with
Christ, and which is more, they shall be
with Christ in Paradise. I come now
to draw some practical Inferences from
what has been delivered.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> Has the Holy Ghost in Scripture
made such discoveries of Paradise, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96891:105"/>
our future happiness; then certainly
they ought to fill our Souls with earnest
Longings, and vehement Pursuits after
them. When King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had shewn
to the Ambassador of <hi>Baladan,</hi> King
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the House of his Precious
things, his <hi>Silver</hi> and his <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>all
his Treasures;</hi> we read these finite pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Treasures, proved Load-stones
powerful enough to draw these <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
to War against <hi>Iudah:</hi> How
much more ought the infinite <hi>Glories of
Heaven,</hi> which God has revealed in the
Scripture, raise such violent Desires in
us, as may make us resemble the Spouse
in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> who is compared to a
<hi>Pillar of Smoak,</hi> mounting continually
towards Heaven; or them who lived
in the dayes of <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> who
are said to have <hi>taken the Kingdom of
Heaven by violence.</hi> Such a temper of
Spirit as this we find in the Saints of
God: <hi>My Soul fainteth for thy Salvation:
I have longed for it,</hi> saith Holy <hi>David
Psal.</hi> 119. 81 It is a remarkable Passage
of <hi>Cornelius a Lapide,</hi> upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.
where enquiring why the Patriarchs of
old were so passionately desirous to
have their bones buried in the Land
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96891:105"/>
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he gives this Reason: <hi>God,</hi>
saith he, <hi>had revealed unto these Holy
men the Day of Christ; they all, as well
as</hi> Abraham, <hi>saw Christ Day and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced:
Not only the Day of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
but that more glorious Day of his
Resurrection; In which not only Christ
himself should rise, but others that slept
should rise with him, and attend upon
him into Heaven at his Ascension. These
hopes of Rising with Christ, and getting
sooner to Heaven, both in their Bodies
and Souls, than others, made them thus
careful and solicitous to be buried near
the place where Christ was to rise.</hi> How
unlike these Holy Patriarchs are many
amongst us, whose heavy Souls move
down to Earth, as to their Center:
Neither God nor Heaven does ever so
much trouble their Thoughts, as to
make them breath forth their desires
after them. But such as are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and sincere Christians, are in
Scripture described by this known Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis,
of being such as <hi>love the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ;</hi> such as desire <hi>to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,</hi>
that they may be with him;
such as earnestly groan <hi>to be cloathed
upon with their House which is from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96891:106"/>
Heaven,</hi> and therefore pray often with
the Bride in the <hi>Revelations, Come Lord
Iesus, come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> If we do earnestly and seriously
desire this exceeding great happiness of
Paradise, we must be willing to use the
Means which will bring us to it. It is
a known Maxim in the Schools, <hi>Qui
vult finem, vult media ad finem: He
that effectually desires the End, desires
also the Means which lead unto that
End</hi> If, with the Thief upon the Cross,
we expect after Death to enjoy Christ in
Paradise, we must labour to imitate
him, and give such demonstrations of
our Humility, Faith in Christ, and sincere
Repentance as he did. Our Saviour tells
us, that the <hi>wise Merchant</hi> in the Gospel
had no sooner found a <hi>Pearl of great
Price,</hi> but he presently sold all he had
and purchas'd it. It is reported of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi>
that Famous French Commander,
that when he had tasted some of the
pleasant Grapes of <hi>Italy,</hi> he could never
be at rest, till he had raised a great
Army, and Conquer'd that pleasant
Country. God has been pleased in
Scripture, to present us with some of
the Grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to give us some
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96891:106"/>
taste of the Heavenly gift, and the
Powers of the World to come: How
should this make us restless and unquiet,
till we arrive at this happy Country?
Should we not now raise all the Forces
that we can to fight our Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and conquer those Lusts which
oppose our happiness? Should we now
spare any Sin, tho' it were as dear to us
as a beloved <hi>Ionathan?</hi> Sure, Heaven
will recompence the loss of a right Eye,
and a right Hand, should we pluck them
off and sacrifice them to our Saviour.
And indeed we must thus forsake sin,
every sin, the most darling sin, if ever
we hope to get to Paradise. The
<hi>Young man</hi> in the Gospel lacked but
one thing, and yet fell short of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
And if thou wilt still indulge
thy self in thy Covetousness, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Swearing, Drunkenness, or any
other known sin, thou canst never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be with Christ in Paradise. For
Christ has told us plainly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17.
that if we will enter into Life, we must
keep the Commandments.</p>
               <p>Which that we may all do, God of his
Infinite Mercy grant, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>THE Office of our Blessed
Saviours Mediatorship
consists chiefly in three
Parts, his Satisfaction, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession,
and Judging
the World at the Last Day. The First of
these he performed here on Earth; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96891:107"/>
he is still performing in Heaven;
and the Third he will perform in the
Air, <hi>When he shall come in the Clouds of
Heaven, with Power and great Glory.</hi> We
know he satisfied infinite Justice, when
he offered up himself a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
on the Cross; and he is still inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in Heaven at the Right Hand of
God. As he purchased Salvation for
sinners by dying for them, so he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that this Salvation may be
applied unto such as repent sincerely of
their sins and believe on his Name.
The third part of his Mediatorship is
still to be performed; for he is not, as
Mediator, to judge the World, till the
time appointed by his Father; and then
he will for certain Judge both the Quick
and the Dead. Indeed <hi>the Father himself
Iudgeth no Man, but hath committed all
Iudgment unto the Son,</hi> as our Saviour
speaks, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 22. and he gives the
reason of it <hi>vers. 27. because he is the
Son of Man</hi> As he became the Son of
Man, that he might be in a capacity to
save the Penitent: So God has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same Son of Man to judge the
World, that he may be able to punish
the Impenitent: Such as before would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96891:108"/>
not accept him for a Saviour, will
now be forced to admit him as a
Judge. Hence we are told, Act. 17. 31.
<hi>That God has appointed a Day, in which
he will Iudge the World in Righteousness,
by that Man whom he hath Ordained;
and whereof he hath given us assurance, in
that he hath raised him from the Dead.</hi>
Tho' we are not certain when the day
of Judgment will come, that we may
be alwayes preparing for it; yet you see
it is certain that there will be such a
day, and that Christ, our Mediator, is
ordained Judge: A happy day for all
that are truly pious; they need not fear
this Judge, who is no other than their
Merciful Saviour. But it will be a day
of darkness and gloominess unto the
Wicked; these will then mourn, <hi>when
they shall see this Son of Man coming
with great Power and Glory;</hi> so much
we are told in the Text, <hi>Then shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the sign of the Son of Man in
Heaven, and then shall all the Tribes of
the Earth Mourn; and they shall see the
Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with Power and great Glory.</hi> For
the better understanding of these words,
we will enquire.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:96891:108"/>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Why Christ is called the Son
of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is here meant by the
Sign of the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Son of Man will
come to Judge the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he will come with
great Power and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That all the wicked of the
Earth will then have just cause to
Mourn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let us briefly enquire why
Christ is called the Son of Man. Some
learned Men observe, that he is called
so in the Scriptures more than forty
times; and there are two reasons of
the Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> He is called the Son of Man, in
token of his Humanity. Christ our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Mediator, was both God and Man;
and therefore as he is often called the
Son of God, to denote his Divinity;
so he is as often called the Son of Man,
to denote his Humanity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> He is called the Son of Man, to
denote that state of Humiliation, to
which he condescended for our sakes.
It was usual for the Jews to style
Princes and Potentates <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> Sons of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96891:109"/>
strong Men; but such as were poor they
styl'd <hi>Beni-Adam,</hi> Sons of Men. Christ
therefore aspired to no higher title than
that of Son of Man: He was pleased
to humble himself for us. He, as the
Apostle speaks, <hi>became poor, that we
might become rich.</hi> Born he was of the
poorest Parents, such as neither had an
House of their own to lay him in when
he was born, nor able to procure any
place besides a Stable for his reception
into this World. And as he was born
in this poor condition; so tho' <hi>the Birds
of the Air have Nests,</hi> as he speaks, yet
whilst he lived, <hi>he had not,</hi> of his own,
<hi>where to lay his Head.</hi> Nay, further
yet, when he came to die, we know he
was beholding to the Charity of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea</hi> for a room in his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.
No wonder then if Christ be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of no more Honourable Title
than this <hi>of Son of Man,</hi> since he made
himself so vile, so mean, so contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for our sakes. Thus I have briefly
shewn why Christ is called so often the
Son of Man; it denotes the truth of
his Humanity, as also that state of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
to which he condescended for
our sakes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:96891:109"/>
I come now in the second place to
enquire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is here meant by the
sign of the Son of Man. It would spend
too much of our time to mention all
those conjectures, which learned Men
have made concerning this Sign, since it
is a matter we may be safely ignorant
of. I shall only set down two of the
best interpretaions I have met with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Very many learned Men, both
Antient and Modern, do by the Sign of
the Son of Man, understand the Cross.
St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and Venerable
<hi>Bede,</hi> upon this place, affirm this Sign
to be no other than that of the Cross.
The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Church is so peremptory
in this matter, that it is put into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of their Creed, as the Learned <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
informs us. There is hardly any
thing the Antient Fathers are more una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
in than this: And to say the
truth, there is some tolerable Reason for
this Antient Opinion. For what can be
more Honourable to our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or more full of Terror to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
than that the Cross of Christ,
which they counted foolishness; and
more than so, esteemed the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96891:110"/>
of the Christian Faith, should at
that day be made the Herald to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
his Coming, and call all Nations
of the World to appear before him? But
tho' this interpretation be backt both
with Reason and great Authorities;
Yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> There is another interpretation
that seems as plausible, if not more
plausible than it: For the learned <hi>Vossius,
Mede, Twisse, Millet,</hi> and several others,
do understand by the Sign of the Son of
Man, who is a Sign. This kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect,
this manner of Speaking is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the Scripture; thus the Law of
Faith is all one with Faith that is a Law,
the Law of Sin, that is, Sin it self,
which dwelling in unregenerate Persons,
reigns as it were by Law. So the Sign
of the Son of Man, that is, the Son of
Man, who is a Sign. And that which
gives the greatest Authority to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the parallel
place, interprets it so, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 27.
where the word Sign is left out, and
the Verse runs thus, <hi>Then shall they see
the Son of Man coming in a Cloud, with
Power and great Glory.</hi> And St. <hi>Mark</hi>
renders the words the same way, <hi>Chap.</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:96891:110"/>
13. 26. If therefore St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi>
may be allowed to be as good interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> as any other, by the
Sign of the Son of Man, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Son of Man himself, whose
Glorious appearance in the Clouds will
be a certain infallible sign that the day
of Judgment is come. Thus I have
shewn you what Conjectures learned
Men have made concerning this Sign of
the Son of Man: Some understand the
Cross, others Christ himself, whose Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
appearance will be a certain sign of
the approaching Judgment. I come
now in the third place to shew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Son of Man will
come to judge the World. None but
that God who made us, has any right
to judge us. As we have received all
things from him; so as Stewards, must
we render an account of all things to
him. Indeed this Judgment belongs
originally to the whole Trinity; but the
outward administration of it shall be
committed to the Son of Man. So we
are told expresly in the Text, <hi>Then shall
ye see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds
of Heaven.</hi> Thus you see the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last Day is committed to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96891:111"/>
Son of Man; and indeed it is committed
to him, <hi>because he is the Son of Man;</hi>
our Saviour tells us so expresly, John
5. 20, 27. <hi>As the Father has life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so hath he given unto the Son to
have life in himself, and has given him
Authority to execute Iudgment also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is the Son of Man.</hi> Ye see the
Son of Man will come as Judge at the
last Day, and he comes, because he is
the Son of Man. It will not be amiss
to enquire briefly into the Reasons
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> God has committed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last Day to the <hi>Son of Man,</hi>
because he has appointed it should be
Visible. This is fairly hinted in the
Text, where it is said, they <hi>shall see the
Son of Man coming in the Clouds of
Heaven.</hi> God himself is a Spirit, and
consequently invisible; but the <hi>Son of
Man</hi> is Visible, and therefore he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to Ride the Circuit, that he may
be seen of all his Enemies: And that
we might take the more notice of this
Reason, it is repeated again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 64.
where Christ tells his Enemies, that
<hi>hereafter they shall see the Son of Man
sitting on the Right hand of Power, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96891:111"/>
coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> It
seems the <hi>Son of Man</hi> shall come, and his
Enemies shall see him, and be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the sight of him. This may be
farther confirm'd from <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. where
you'l find the Angels preaching this
Doctrin; <hi>This same Iesus who is taken
up from you into Heaven, shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen him go into
Heaven.</hi> The Comparison is here made
between our Saviour's Ascending into
Heaven, and his returning again to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Ascendit visibiliter, &amp; descendit
visibiliter: He Ascended,</hi> saith <hi>Gerhard,
in a visible manner, and he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to Iudgment in a visible manner
too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> God has committed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last Day to the <hi>Son of Man,</hi>
for the reward of his Obedience, and
greater exaltation of his Human Nature.
It is but Justice in God to make this
<hi>Son of Man</hi> Judge the World, seeing
he came into the World, and was judged
by it. It is but equal to invest Christ
with a power of Absolution and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
seeing he was Condemned
by us to dye, and dyed that he might be
in a capacity to Absolve us. It is but
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96891:112"/>
reasonable that all the Sons of Men
should bow before his Throne, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his Judgment, who disdain'd
not for our sakes, to stand before the
Tribunal of wicked Men, and receive
the Sentence of Condemnation. To
this purpose are those Expressions of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. <hi>Being found in fashion
as a man, he humbled himself, and became
obedient unto the Death, even the death of
the Cross: Wherefore God also has highly
exalted him and given him a name which
is above every name, that at the Name of
Iesus every knee should bow.</hi> He that
came at first to save us, must it seems
come at last Judge us: And, it is but
just, that he who before carried a Reed
in his hand, and was derided by his
Enemies, should hereafter sway a Scepter
of Righteousness, and break his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in peices with a Rod of Iron.
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> God has committed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last Day to the Son of Man
for the greater Comfort and Consolation
of the Godly. What a joyful sight will
it be unto all sincere Penitents, when
they shall see the Advocate become their
Judge, and none but their Saviour sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96891:112"/>
on the Throne of Glory? For he
knows all the Frailties and Infirmities
of our Natures: <hi>He knoweth our frame,
and remembreth that we are but Dust:</hi>
Yea, he will be yet more ready to pity
us, seeing he was pleased to assume our
Natures, bear our Infirmities, and to be
tempted in all things like as we are.
Well then may the Godly be said in
Scripture, to long for this <hi>glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Well may
the Bride in the <hi>Revelations</hi> cry, <hi>Come
Lord Iesus, come quickly;</hi> seeing this Day
of Judgment will be to her, no other
than the Day of Nuptuals: A Day in
which Christ will be married to his
People, and admit them unto the nearest
Union and Communion with himself,
and that unto all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> God has committed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last Day to the Son of Man,
for the greater Terror and Confusion of
the Wicked. The Angels, who were
present at our Saviours Ascention, tell
his Disciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. that <hi>the same
Iesus who then ascended into Heaven,
should descend in like manner as he then
ascended up into Haeven.</hi> Now, we
know our Saviour, when he ascended
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96891:113"/>
into Heaven, carried along with him
the print of the Spear, and all those
Scars that were made by the Nails and
Thorns: And these it seems he will
bring along with him, when he returns
to Judgment. How then will the <hi>wicked
mourn,</hi> as we are told in the Text, <hi>when
they look upon him whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
pierced!</hi> Those Wounds which
were at first opened to heal their Souls,
will now open their Mouths and call for
Vengeance on them. Christ's <hi>Eyes,</hi> saith
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> will now become <hi>flames of Fire,</hi>
and such as will certainly consume them;
his <hi>Feet</hi> like <hi>fine Brass</hi> burning in a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and cannot but destroy them.
Well may the wicked call then upon the
<hi>Rocks to cover,</hi> and <hi>the Mountains to hide
them;</hi> since the <hi>presence of the Lamb</hi>
will be infinitely more dreadful, than
the presence of the fiercest Lion. For
unto such as have trampled this Son of
God and Man under foot; unto such as
have counted <hi>the Blood of the Covenant
an unholy thing;</hi> unto such, I say, there
will now remain nothing, but a <hi>certain
fearful looking for of Iudgment and fiery
Indignation,</hi> which shall devour these
Adversaries. Thus I have dispatch'd
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96891:113"/>
the Third General, and shewn you, that
this <hi>Son of Man</hi> must come at the last
Day to judge the World, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it. I come now,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>In the Fourth place to shew
you, that</hi> He will come with great Power
and Glory. <hi>This is plainly deliver'd in
the Text,</hi> Then shall they see the Son of
Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with
Power and great Glory. <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> He will come with <hi>great Glory.</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> He shall come with <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> Let us consider the greatness of
that Glory with which this <hi>Son of Man</hi>
shall come to Judge the World. Tho'
his first coming into the World was
mean and contemptible, clouded with
Poverty and Grief, and such other
humble Circumstances as were proper
for his state of Humiliation; yet his
second Coming will be splendid and
glorious, as will appear from these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars:</p>
            <p>1st, <hi>Let us consider the immediate
Fore-runners and Harbingers of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Second coming. Kings and Princes
have their Harbingers, and so has this
King of Kings too. St</hi> Ierome <hi>tells us
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96891:114"/>
of an Antient Tradition of the</hi> Iewish
<hi>Doctors, namely, that for fifteen Days
together, before the great Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there shall be transacted upon the
Stage of Nature, a continued scene of
fearful Signs and Wonders.</hi> The Sea
shall lift up his mountainous billows, and
make a fearful noise with its rouling
Waves: The Heaven shall crack night
and day with loud and roaring Thunders:
The Earth shall groan under hidious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions,
and quotidian Earthquakes: The
Air shall blaze with portentous Comets:
The Moon shall shed forth purple streams
of discolour'd Light: The Sun shall shroud
himself in perpetual Darkness; and the
rest of the Stars shall suffer themselves
to be hid in dismal Obscurity. Thus the
whole frame of Nature shall be hung with
Mourning, a little before the approach of
the Day of Iudgment. <hi>Nor is this only
a Tradition of the</hi> Iews; <hi>but it is also the
Prediction of our Saviour, who tells us
in the Verse foregoing the Text, that</hi> in
those days the Sun shall be darkened, and
the Moon shall not give her light; and
the Stars shall fall from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and then shall appear the sign of the Son
of Man. <hi>Such Harbingers, such Fore-runners
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96891:114"/>
as these, do abundantly declare
the glorious coming of our Saviour to
Judgment. But,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly</hi> His glorious coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will yet farther appear, if we
consider the transcendant lustre of his
own Person. How beautiful, how glorious
is our blessed Saviour, whilst he now sits
at the right Hand of God? He is now
cloathed with <hi>Light,</hi> as with a Garment;
and his Human Nature does far surpass
the globe of the Sun for lustre. What
an astonishing description of his Glory
is given, <hi>Rev. 1. 13, &amp;c. In the midst of
the seven Candlesticks was one like the
Son of Man: His Head was white as
Wool, and his locks were white as the
Snow: His Eyes were as a flame of Fire,
and his Countenance was as the Sun shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in his strength.</hi> Thus glorious is
Christ in his own Person: Wherever he
goes he carries Day along with him, and
therefore when at the Last Day he shall
descend from the right Hand of his
Father, to that part of the Air where
he will fix his Throne, he will appear
like a large walking Star, sparkling with
beams of Majesty, and dazling Glory.
And this is called in Scripture Christ's
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96891:115"/>
own glory, <hi>Luke 9. 26. When the Son of
Man shall come in his own Glory.</hi>
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> This glory of Christs own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will receive additional lustre from
the glory of his Attendants. This Son
of Man, when he comes to judge the
World, he will not come alone, but he
will come attended with Myriads of
Saints and Angels. St. <hi>Iude</hi> has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
an antient Prophecy of <hi>Enoch</hi>'s
to this purpose, <hi>ver. 14, 15. Behold,</hi> saith
he, <hi>the Lord cometh with ten thousand of
his Saints, to execute Iudgment upon all
and to convince all that are ungodly, of all
their ungodly deeds.</hi> Now how will the
attendance of so many glorious Saints
add to the lustre of this great Day?
We are told in Scripture, that <hi>the Iust
shall shine with the brightness of the Sun.</hi>
What an amazing spectacle then will it
be, to see this Son of Man descend from
his Imperial Seat, far above all Heavens,
and coming in the Clouds with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Train of shining Saints, all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him with Crowns of Glory on
their Heads, and the most ravishing <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs</hi>
in their Mouths. But he will
not be attended only with innumerable
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96891:115"/>
of his Saints; but Myriads of Angels
will also augment his Train. Hence in
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. 26 it is said, that he shall come
in his own glory, and in his Fathers,
and of his holy Angels. All the Angels
of Heaven will deck themselves with all
their Ornaments of Light, and wait
upon our Saviour, when he comes to
triumph over his Enemies. We know
these glorious Beings attended on him
at his Birth, and when he was but in a
state of Humiliation; and therefore we
need not question, but they will add to
the pomps and triumphs of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Day. Well then may our Saviour
be said in the Text <hi>to come with glory</hi>
when he shall come attended with all
the Host of Heaven, with an inume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Retinue of glorious Saints and
Angels. But this is not all: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> The great Glory of Christ's
coming to Judgment will yet farther
apear, if we consider the glory of his
Throne: According to the transcendant
Majesty of his Person, so shall his
Throne be, even a <hi>Throne of Glory:</hi>
Hence is that of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> Chap. 25. 31.
<hi>When the Son of Man shall come in his
glory, and all the Holy Angels with him,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96891:116"/>
then shall he sit upon the Throne of his
Glory.</hi> Now what this <hi>Throne of Glory</hi>
will be, is fairly hinted in the Text,
where it is said, that <hi>the Son of Man will
come at the last Day in the Clouds of
Heaven.</hi> Christ will sit on a bright
radiant Cloud, when he keeps the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assizes of the last Day. This
may farther be gathered from the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Angels, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. where
they tell his Disciples at his Ascention,
that <hi>the same Iesus who was then taken
up into Heaven, will so come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as they saw him then go up into
Heaven.</hi> Now if you will know how he
ascended into Heaven, the <hi>9th verse</hi> will
inform you, where it is said, that <hi>He
was taken up, and a Cloud received him
out of their sight.</hi> Now as he rode up
to Heaven on a radiant Cloud, so will
he in like manner come riding down
from thence. No wonder then if we
read often in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings
and Lightnings coming out of the
Throne of Christ:</hi> For these roaring Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
are ordinarily discharg'd from some
terrible Cloud. Christ therefore will sit
on a bright shining Cloud, when he shall
judge the World: And indeed this is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96891:116"/>
the general Opinion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as
Learned Men observe: For this is a
Common saying among them, as <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi>
reports, <hi>If ever the Iews deserve
that the Messias should come, he shall come
gloriously,</hi> according to the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
i. e. <hi>in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> Now
how will such a bright shining Throne,
hanging in the Air, add to the lustre of
of our Saviours appearing; For the
Heathens, when they would describe the
glorious Majesty of their Deities, were
wont to bring them wrapt up in some
bright and radiant Cloud. Thus <hi>Homer</hi>
represents one of the Gods coming to
<hi>Diomedes:â</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>With his Shoulders wrapt up in a Cloud:</hi>
And so <hi>Virgil</hi> represents <hi>Iupiter</hi> coming
to assist <hi>Aeneas</hi> in a <hi>bright shining Cloud.</hi>
Thus both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> looked
upon a <hi>bright Cloud,</hi> as a glorious sign
and Character of a Divine Majesty.
Thus I have shewn you with what Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Majesty the Son of Man will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at the last Day: His appearing will
be usher'd in with dreadful Harbingers
and Fore-runners; he will descend with
all the glory and lustre of his own person.
He will come attended with a glorious
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96891:117"/>
Retinue of shining Saints and Angels;
and he will sit upon a Throne of Glory,
namely, a bright and radiant Cloud.
All this will be sufficient to shew you,
that the <hi>Son of Man at the last Day will
come in the Clouds with great Glory.</hi>
before I proceed farther, I shall crave
leave to draw one or two Inferences
from what has been already delivered.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We may learn from hence, the
place which is appointed for the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last Day. This place it
seems will be the Air; for ye hear our
Saviour is to have a <hi>bright shining Cloud</hi>
for his Throne; and is said accordingly
in the Text, to <hi>Come in the Clouds of
Heaven.</hi> To the same purpose is what
we read, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17. where we are
told, that <hi>the Righteous shall be caught
up in the Clouds, and meet the Lord in
the Air:</hi> And indeed the Air is a most
proper place for our Saviour to keep his
great Assizes: For being here advanced
some distance above the Earth, he will
more easily be seen by all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of it. Nay farther yet, this is
now the Seat of the Devils Empire.
Satan we know is called <hi>the Prince of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96891:117"/>
the Air;</hi> and the Infernal Fiends are
styled <hi>Spiritual Wickednesses in high
places.</hi> Here therefore will the Son of
Man fix his Judgment Seat; here he
will place his Throne: That all the
World may know, that he has now
spoiled Principalities and Powers, and
got a compleat and perfect Victory over
these his malicious Enemies. Then is
the time when he will trample Satan
under his Feet, and put a full Period to
that Tyranny which he has exercised so
long over the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may infer from hence,
what deep Impressions such Doctrins as
these ought to make upon us. The
News of our Saviours coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with all this Glory, should cause us
to take the greatest Care imaginable, to
fit and prepare our selves to meet him
at this great Day. We have a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Instance to this purpose in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
History, which is attested by
many and great Authors. It seems about
Four hundred years after our Saviours
Ascension, one <hi>Gregentius,</hi> a Bishop,
endeavour'd the Conversion of those
<hi>Iews</hi> which liv'd in <hi>Arabia Felix;</hi> after
a tedious Disputation of three days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96891:118"/>
some of the <hi>Iews</hi> desired the
Bishop to shew them Jesus alive, and it
would convince them: Immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this the Earth began to tremble, and
the Sky to shine and eccho with Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and Thunder: After these ceased,
the Gates of the Celestial Palace open'd,
and a bright serene Cloud appear'd,
darting forth Beams of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
lustre: At last our Blessed Saviour
shewed himself, walking on this bright
Cloud; and a Voice was heard from
this Excellent Glory, saying, <hi>I am he
who was Crucified by your Fathers.</hi> This
glorious Appearance cast all the <hi>Iews</hi>
prostrate on the ground, and beating
their Breasts, they cried with a loud
Voice, <hi>Lord, have mercy on us;</hi> and
afterwards were Baptized into the Faith
of Christ. A like account we have of
the Conversion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where we read, that as he journied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Damascus,</hi> breathing forth nothing
but Rage and Malice against Christians,
suddenly there shined round about him
a Light from Heaven; and he heard a
Voice saying unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?</hi> Upon which he
trembling and astonished said, <hi>Lord,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96891:118"/>
what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Such
effects as these are the Natural Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
of such great and glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
as these: And ought they not
to have the same influence upon us?
What tho' they are not made to the
Eye of our Sense, yet in Scripture they
are made to the Eye of our Faith. If
we are sincere Christians, and do heartily
believe the Gospel, we have no more
reason to doubt of this Coming of our
Saviour <hi>with great power and glory,</hi> than
if we were actual Spectators of it. Let
us therefore bethink our selves, <hi>what
manner of persons we ought to be in all
holy and godly Conversation.</hi> If we were
certain this great Day were near at
hand, I am confident we would walk
more circumspectly, <hi>not as fools, but as
wise:</hi> We would then soon be perswaded
to break off our League with Sin, and
endeavour, by a sincere and speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to make a firm Peace with our
God and Saviour. I shall not pretend
to tell you the precise time of this Day
of Judgment; but this I can assure you,
that several Learned and Pious Divines,
who have lately enquired into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Prophesies with great accuracy and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96891:119"/>
diligence, do tell us, that this great Day
is even at the door, and that we may
expect this glorious Appearance of the
<hi>Son of Man</hi> in a very short time. But
tho' they should be mistaken in their
Conjectures, yet this is most certain that
it will come at last, and that the time
of our Life, which is all the time we
have to prepare for it, is exceeding
short. Let us therefore beseech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, that we all may be found
such wise and faithful Servants, as are
described, <hi>v.</hi> 46. then shall we with joy
meet our Saviour in the Air, and make a
part of his glorious Train, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to the highest Heaven; giving, as
is most due, all <hi>Honour and Glory unto
him that sitteth on the Throne, and unto the
Lamb for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore beseech Almighty God,
to give us Grace so to redeem our time,
that we may be found in the number of
his wise and faithful Servants; then shall
we at the Day of Iudgment meet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the Air, and return with him to
the Highest Heavens, singing Praises and
Hallelujahs unto him that sits upon the
Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.
<hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>WHat great Esteem and

World entertain'd
of Proverbs, may
easily be learned from
the Writings of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> He tells in his
Rhetorick, that they always allowed
them the next place to Oracles: And in

               </gap>,
as if they were the very Extract and
Quintessence of Refined Wisdom. The
Divine <hi>Solomon</hi> sets them yet higher,
and thinks them worthy to be placed in

               </gap>, which tho' our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and other Learned Criticks tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
them more agreeably to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<hi>Princes of Words:</hi> Intimating thus
much to us, That these Divine Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
which are called <hi>Proverbs,</hi> excel
as much other Schemes of Speech, as
Kings and Princes do their ordinary
Subjects. But tho' Proverbs in the
general have so much of Majesty in
them, and have always challenged a
particular veneration from the Sons of
Men: Yet the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of Holy Writ
are farther commended to us from the
very Inscription and Title Page of the
Book. It is a known Observation of
Learned Men, that neither the Books of
<hi>Moses, Ioshua,</hi> nor other Pen-men of
Sacred Writ, are recommended to the
World by the Name of the Author, till
we come to this Book of <hi>Proverbs;</hi> as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96891:120"/>
if the Holy Ghost had designed some
extraordinary advantage to this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Book, when in the very Front of
it was prefix'd the most August Name
of <hi>Solomon Son of David, King of Israel;</hi>
and we may be sure the Queen of the
South will rise up in Judgment against
us at the last Day, if we do not give
our best Attention to these Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Words of <hi>Solomon;</hi> that <hi>Solomon,</hi>
who was once a Famous and Renowned
King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and who, besides those
Advantages of Education which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the pious Care of his
Father King <hi>David,</hi> was also inspired
with Wisdom from on high, and
endued with such Understanding and
Largeness of Heart, as was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate
to the Sand of the boundless
Ocean. Besides what has hitherto been
said concerning the excellency of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs
in general, and these of <hi>Solomon</hi> in
particular, there is one Observation still
behind, which will yet farther recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Text to your best Attention.
For of all those three Thousand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,
which are Recorded as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom, there is not
any one the Holy Ghost has thought fit
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96891:121"/>
to repeat so often, or inculcate more
frequently, than this of the Text; for
it is repeated thrice in this one Chapter,
besides what it is in other places of this
Book of <hi>Proverbs.</hi> In all which places
the Wise man gives us to understand,
that the wonderful Providence of God
does rule and govern all the Actions
of Men. The Metaphor of a <hi>Way,</hi>
which is here used in the Text, is known
in Scripture to denote all the Actions
of Men, whether good or evil: And
according to this latitude, the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
here used is understood variously
by Divines: St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> refers it to the
good Actions of Men, and accordingly
interprets the Text thus, <hi>Cor viri cogitet
justa, ut Ã  Deo dirigantur gressus ejus:
Let the Heart of Man,</hi> saith he, <hi>think
righteous things, that so his goings may
be directed by the Lord.</hi> But tho' this
be a very great Truth, namely, that
<hi>Good Actions are govern'd and directed
by the Providence of God,</hi> yet others
rather understand the Text of mens
<hi>wicked Actions;</hi> for the Hebrew word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, which we render <hi>Deviseth,</hi> is for
the most part used in a bad sense; and
what we render <hi>Man,</hi> is <hi>Adam</hi> in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96891:121"/>
Original, which according to <hi>Luther</hi>'s
known Observation is seldom taken in
a good sense: So that the words taken
in this limited and restrained sense, will
run thus; <hi>A mans Heart,</hi> i.e. <hi>the Heart
of</hi> Adam, <hi>or of a wicked Man, deviseeh
and contriveth his wicked ways; but the
Lord, by his wonderful Providence, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth
and directeth all his steps.
The Heathen</hi> may <hi>rage,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
speaks, <hi>and the People devise vain things;
yet he that sitteth in Heaven shall laugh
them to scorn, the Lord shall have them
in derision.</hi> God, as he is Omniscient,
can easily know all the wicked devices
of sinful Men; and as he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
he can as easily over-rule them,
and direct them so as may be most for
his own Glory and the good of his
People. God, He is no idle Spectator
in this vast Theatre of the World; but
<hi>doth continually,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks,
<hi>whatsoever pleaseth him both in Heaven
and in Earth.</hi> Indeed, he has made Man a
free Agent; and therefore as the <hi>Son of
Sirach</hi> speaks, <hi>He leaves him in the
Counsel of his own hand, and allows him
to act according to the liberty of his Will:</hi>
But then, as the Wise Rector and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96891:122"/>
Governor of the Universe, He
over-sees and over-rules all the Actions
and Devices of wicked Men; so that
such as will not do him true and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
service, by obeying the known Will
of his Precept, are forced to obey the
secret Will of his Providence, and are
made subservient to his Everlasting
Counsels. Thus, tho' the <hi>Heart a of wicked
man deviseth his wicked ways; yet the
Lord governeth and directeth all his
steps.</hi> For the fuller opening of which
Words, I design to confine my present
discourse to the discovering of these two
things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> How the over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God is imployed about sin and
wickedness whilst it is but <hi>in fieri,</hi> or the
Heart of Man is but yet devising it.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How it governs and directs
sin <hi>in facto esse,</hi> when sin is brought
forth into act. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Of the First, how Gods, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
Providence is imployed about sin
whilst it is yet but <hi>in fieri, whilst the
Heart of Man is yet but contriving and
devising it.</hi> And this will appear in some
measure from these following Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:96891:122"/>
               <hi>1st.</hi> God's Providence orders and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
sin and wickedness to such objects
as he thinks fit. It is a true saying of
<hi>Hugo de Sancto Victo,</hi> i.e. <hi>Deus non dat
malis voluntatibus corruptionem, sed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
ordinem, God,</hi> saith he, <hi>never infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
any corruption or wickedness into the
Wills of Men, but only gives Order and
Direction to their Wicked Actions.</hi> All
the preparations and contrivances of sin
are from the depraved hearts of Men;
the ordering of them to particular and
suitable objects, from the good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God. As the Huntsman in
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> comparison, holds the Hound
in a Slip, and suffers him only to run
at such Game as he best liketh: So God
keeps a constant Watch upon the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he puts his Hook in their Nose, and
his Bridle in their Lips, and suffers not
their Rage to break forth, but only on
such persons as he thinks fit. We know
Gods Providence extended it self to the
very Swine, and would not suffer Satan
to enter into them without his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Warrant; and sure then we need not
doubt but this Providence of God is
more eminently concerned about Man,
whom he was pleased to make after his
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96891:123"/>
own Image and likeness. God does
therefore set a Guard upon the malice
of Satan and his Instruments, nor can
it break forth but as he permits it;
sometimes on his Enemies for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and sometimes on his own
People for their chastisement: A proof
of the latter we have, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7.
at the 5th Verse <hi>Sennacherib King of</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria
<hi>is called the Rod of God's Anger,
and the Staff of his Indignation;</hi> which
metaphorical expressions import thus
much, that Men are but Instruments in
the Hands of Gods Providence, and must
expect the direction of a superiour Cause.
Now this <hi>Assyrian,</hi> this <hi>Sennacharib,</hi> is
said to be sent and directed against <hi>Israel,</hi>
an hypocritical Nation, and now become
the People of God's Wrath. And at
the 7th <hi>Verse</hi> we find that this Staff of
Gods Indignation was more in the Hand
than in the Heart of this proud <hi>Assyrian
Howbeit,</hi> saith God, <hi>he meaneth not so,
neither doth his Heart think so; but it
is in his Heart to destroy, and to cut off
Nations, not a few.</hi> There was no need
God should instil any wickedness into
the Heart of <hi>Sennach arib,</hi> who is here
in the Prophet called the <hi>Assyrian;</hi> it
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96891:123"/>
seems it was full enough, and too full
before. <hi>Berosus,</hi> an Antient Historian,
has left his Character of him, <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,
qui apud</hi> Assyrios <hi>regnabat; omnem</hi>
Asiam <hi>&amp;</hi> Aegyptum <hi>bello infestabat, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi>
saith he, <hi>who was King of the</hi>
Assyrians, <hi>vexed and insested all</hi> Asia
<hi>and</hi> Aegypt <hi>with Bloody Wars.</hi> Ye see
the Head and Heart of this <hi>Assyrian</hi> were
full enough of devices how to satisfie
his Ambition and raise his Empire on
the ruins of other Nations. And now
was the time for God's Providence to
step in and determin him to what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
he thought most proper. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
directs the fury of this <hi>Assyrian</hi>
chiefly against <hi>Israel,</hi> and uses him as a
Rod to chastise his own chosen People.
And as God does thus imploy the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as Schoolmasters, to correct his
People; so he also imploys them as
Executioners to punish his Enemies.
Hence, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 13. 17. God is said to stir
up the <hi>Medes</hi> against the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> a
People notorious for their Enmity to
God, and the <hi>Iews.</hi> These <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Persians,</hi> are upon this account, called
God's <hi>sanctified ones,</hi> Verse 3. not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any inherent righteousness or
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96891:124"/>
holiness in them, but because, like the
Vessels of the Sanctuary, set a-part for
Gods service, and excited by a secret
instinct of Providence, to execute wrath
upon wicked <hi>Babylon. Thus God turns
the Hearts of Kings, as the Rivers of
Waters, whither soever he pleaseth.</hi> Tho'
their Hearts be very full of wickedness,
and like the troubled Sea, are always
ready to cast up the Mire and Dirt of
Sin, yet God's Providence shuts up this
Sea with Bars that it cannot pass, till
God is pleased to break up these Bars,
and let it rush sometimes on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to overwhelm them; sometimes on
his own People to chastise them, and
wash away their Filth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Providence of God does not
only determine the wickedness of Man,
as to the Object: but likewise as to the
<hi>Modus,</hi> and measure of it. If God did
not bound the Malice of Satan and
wicked Men, their little Finger would
be bigger than their Loins are now;
and instead of Chastising God's People
with Whips, like cruel <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> they
would scourge them with Scorpions.
When God was pleased to break down
the Hedge of his Providence, he had
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96891:124"/>
set about <hi>Iob,</hi> with what fury did the
<hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> kill his Servants,
drive his Camels, and spoil him of all his
Goods? Nor did all this mischief satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Satans Malice; he would fain have
gone further, and made attempts upon
his Life: But God here was pleased to
set limits to his fury, as we read, <hi>Iob
2. 6. Behold,</hi> saith God to Satan, <hi>he is
now in thy Hand, only spare his Life.</hi>
I need not spare much time in proving
the boundless Malice of Satan and his
Instruments against God's People; we
may learn enough of this, from that
remarkable Name the Prophet bestows
upon them, Isaiah 27. 1. <hi>In that day the
Lord, with his great and strong Sword,
shall punish Leviathan, the peircing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi>
By Leviathan in this place, is
generally understood Satan and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Instruments; and the word in
the Hebrew signifies Augmentation or
Addition, intimating the boundless Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Satan and his Instruments, who
still desire to lay more burdens on the
Godly, to increase their Troubles and
augment their Afflictions. But God, he
is faithful and merciful, and by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
takes care, that his People be
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96891:125"/>
not tempted above what they are able
to bear: And therefore the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
tells us at Verse 8. <hi>That God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
Satan and his Instruments to smite
his People only in measure.</hi> There is a
greater Elegance in the Hebrew, than is
exprest in our English Translation; for
the word which we render Measure,
signifies one of the smallest Measures in
use among the <hi>Iews,</hi> namely, that Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
which they called the <hi>Sea,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more than the third part of an
<hi>Epha.</hi> Such, you see, is the wonderful
goodness of God, that he curbs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
the Fury of those Leviathans;
and tho' they think no Strokes too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
no Burdens too heavy for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, yet he limits their Malice,
and allows them only to smite in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and with Moderation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The Providence of God does
also determin the Malice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Men, as to its time and durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is indeed a great and sad
truth in the observation of the Antient
Tragedian, <hi>Nullum ad nocendum tempus
angustum Ã¨ malis, No time,</hi> saith he, <hi>is
too little, no time unseasonable for the
Wicked to do Mischief;</hi> yet there is some
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96891:125"/>
comfort in what the Wise Man tells us,
Eccles. 3. 1 <hi>That God has set a Season
to every Thing, and a time to every Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
under Heaven.</hi> And indeed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God does limit the Wicked,
both as to the time, when their Fury
shall begin, and also how long it shall
continue. Our blessed Saviour was no
sooner born into the World, but there
was a bloody <hi>Herod</hi> seeking to destroy
him, and send him out of it again: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
when he was to enter upon
his Ministry, we find Satan carrying
him to a Pinacle of the Temple, and
tempting him to cast himself down from
that dangerous height: And when all
this proved succesless, several stratagems
were used by the <hi>Iews</hi> to dispatch
him out of this World. But God, who
has put Times and Seasons in his own
Power, defeated all these their wicked
purposes, till that determinate time was
come mentioned by St. Luke 22. 53.
<hi>Tho' I was with you daily in the Temple</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>yet you could not stretch forth
any hands against me; but now is your
Hour and the power of Darkness.</hi> And as
the Wickedness of Man is limited, in
respect of its beginning, so likewise in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96891:126"/>
respect of its continuance and duration.
Thus God determined the afflictions of
<hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> four hundred years;
and their Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> to seventy.
If God had not predetermined the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
of the Primitive Christians,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> could not have foretold they
should last no longer than forty two
Months. Now if we reckon these Months
by Sabbaths of Years (as the honest
Author of the Book of Martyrs tells
us, he was taught to reckon them by
a particular Revelation) they will
amount to the sum of two hundred
ninety four years, the precise time of
the ten first Persecutions. I shall add
but one instance more of these effects of
God's Providence, and that one is hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me by a Right Reverend Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of our own Nation. It seems in
Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days, <hi>Gardiner</hi> and the
other bloody Papists hoped to continue
their persecution of the Protestants till
they had utterly destroyed them: But
God's good Providence allowed them
but a very short time to rage in; for
when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> fell into that kind
of Dropsie, which Physitians call the
<hi>Mola,</hi> the wisest of her Friends and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96891:126"/>
were so far infatuated, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
her to be with Child. By this
means all Physick was forbid, till her
Distemper grew desperate, and so her
unexpected death put a speedy period
to the Rage and Fury of the Papists.
Thus I have shewn you how the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God is employed about sin
and wickedness whilst it is <hi>in fieri,</hi>
whilst the Heart of Man is but concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and devising it. I now proceed
to shew how the same Providence is
employed about sin <hi>in facto esse,</hi> after
it is finisht and brought forth into Act.
Tho' Almighty God can wither the Arm
of a wicked <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and hinder the
Execution of his wicked Designs: Tho'
he can strike the Sinner with a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt
into Hell before he accomplishes his
mischievous Enterprises, yet having
made Man a free Agent, as I said before,
he allows him to act according to the
liberty he has implanted in his Nature.
<hi>Ratio non est absque libertate Arbitrii,</hi>
saith <hi>Damascen, there can be no Reason,
where there is no liberty to act.</hi> But
tho' God does permit the heart of man
freely to devise and accomplish its ways,
yet still by his Providence, <hi>he rules and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96891:127"/>
directs his Steps.</hi> Indeed the wicked
themselves are far from designing any
good, but yet God makes their blackest
designs subservient to his glory. They
do at best but resemble those monstrous
People, in <hi>Pliny,</hi> whose Feet stood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Faces, or, if you please, to
take a more familiar comparison, like
Watermen, they are made by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to row one way whilst they look
another. To this purpose is the known
observation of St. <hi>Austin, Bonus Deus non
sineret fieri mala, nisi Omnipotens ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
bona elicere potuisset, God who is good,</hi>
saith he, <hi>would never permit sin, but that
being Omnipotent, he is able to extract
Good out of the greatest Evils.</hi> The Rod
of <hi>Moses,</hi> whilst it lay upon the Earth,
was an ugly, dreadful, and poysonous
Serpent, but in the Hand of God and
<hi>Moses</hi> an Instrument of great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
wonders. Such is the Power
and Wisdom of God, that he is able
to bring Light out of Darkness, and
work great and glorious ends out of
the most black devices and machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of sinful Men. Some few Instances
of this I shall give you in these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:96891:127"/>
               <hi>1st.</hi> God does often take occasion
from sin, to glorifie the Riches of his
Goodness and Mercy. It is the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Antients, that the Skull of
<hi>Adam</hi> was found on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> the
very place of our Saviours Crucifixion.
And there is not less Comfort in St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi>
Note, on <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. Namely, that no
holy Women, but such Notorious Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
as <hi>Thamar, Raab</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba</hi> are
mentioned in the Genealogy of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Jesus, and all this to denote thus
much unto us, that sin was the Cause
which brought our Saviour into the
World, and gave God an opportunity
to magnifie his Free Grace and Mercy
unto Sinners. So that now we may
take up the ranting language of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,
O felix culpa! quae talem meruit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptorem,
O happy sin! happy sure upon
this account, that it has through Gods good
Providence, obtained so great and so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Redeemer. The Whole,</hi> saith our
Saviour, <hi>needs not the Physitian;</hi> and
where there is no Misery, there is no
need of Mercy. Had there been no bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness
in the Waters of <hi>Marah, Moses</hi>
had not needed Sweet wood to have
thrown into them. So had there been
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96891:128"/>
no sin, there had not needed the Tears
of Repentance, and consequently there
had been no need of the Wood of the
Cross to sweeten these bitter Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> As God has thus taken occasion
from Sin to commend his Free Grace
and Infinite Mercy to the World; so
he has also taken occasion from hence
to glorifie his Holiness and Justice. If
bold sinners shall dare to run upon the
Bosses of his Buckler, and bid defiance
to the great Majesty of Heaven: If
neither the Threats of his Law can
drive them to Obedience, nor yet the
Promises of the Gospel invite them to
their Duty, there remains then <hi>nothing,
but a fearful looking for of Iudgment and
fiery Indignation,</hi> to devour these Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 4 of
this Chapter, that <hi>God has made all
things for himself; yea, even the wicked
has he made for the day of Evil</hi> Tho'
he may endure with much Long-suffering
the Vessels of Wrath, and
employ them as Rods for the Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others; yet at the last he casts
these Rods into the Fire, and magnifies
his Power and Justice upon them, when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96891:128"/>
once they are ripe for destruction. It
is very observable, that the first <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah</hi>
which we find in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> where mention
is made of the destruction of Gods
Enemies; and the first <hi>Hallelujah</hi> which
is mention'd in the New Testament, is,
where the overthrow of Antichrist is
foretold in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> Should God
suffer sinners still to go unpunish'd, it
would reflect upon his Holiness, and
cast a stain upon his Justice. Men
would be apt to think God a Patron of
Wickedness, and would be very much
encourag'd in the ways of Ungodliness.
God therefore, to vindicate his Honour,
and deter Men from sin, is pleased very
frequently, in this World, to send signal
Judgments upon the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Thus when proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had
a long time withstood all the Miracles
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and wrought his Heart at
last to the highest degree of hardness,
God did then resolve to glorifie himself
in his ruin and destruction: And that he
might leave some signal Monuments of
his Wrath to succeeding Generations,
<hi>Orosius</hi> an Ancient Author tells us, that
<hi>the prints and footsteps of their Chariots
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96891:129"/>
were a long time after to be seen on the
shoar, and in the bottom of the Red Sea.</hi>
We may do well also to remember that
<hi>Fire and Brimstone,</hi> which was rained
from Heaven on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.
Brochardus,</hi> and other sacred Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
inform us, that that very Land
does still mourn in Dust and Ashes, and
such dismal Clouds of Smoak continually
ascend from it, as make it represent
nothing so much, as the very Mouth
and Entrance of Hell. Nay farther yet,
that God might make abundant provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the Honour of his Justice (as
some have computed) this one single
Judgment is mention'd in Scripture
above twenty times: God's Providence
so ordering it, that these wicked <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
might be set forth for an Example,
suffering the vengeance of Eternal Fire.
And this is the second End to which
Gods Providence direct sin, namely,
the glorifying of his Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> God's Providence does farther
make use of sin, to humble his own
People. When <hi>David</hi> had murther'd
his loyal Subject <hi>Vriah,</hi> and committed
Folly with his Wife; God does after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
make use of these sins, to keep
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96891:129"/>
his Servant humble. To this end we
find <hi>Shimei,</hi> one a kin to <hi>Vriah,</hi> sent by
a secret impulse of Providence, first to
Curse <hi>David</hi> as a <hi>Bloody Man,</hi> and so to
remind him of the murther; and then
to make him sensible of his Adultery,
by casting Stones at him, a Punishment
under the Law appointed to the <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.</hi>
Now what Influence this piece
of Providence had upon <hi>David,</hi> we
learn from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 9, 10. where,
when the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> would have
slain <hi>Shimei,</hi> according to his deserts,
<hi>David</hi> returns a Negative Answer in
these passionate words, <hi>What have I to
do with you, ye Sons of Zerviah?</hi> And
then see his Humility in the next words,
<hi>Let him Curse, because the Lord has said
unto him, Curse David.</hi> He knew God,
by this piece of Providence had a design
to call his sins to remembrance, and the
sense of these makes him so humble, as
to think himself worthy of all the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
a Cursed <hi>Shimei</hi> could offer to
the Lords Anointed. There is a great
Truth in the Saying of St. <hi>Austin, Audeo
dicere superbis interdum utile esse in
peccatum cadere: I dare boldly affirm,</hi>
says that Holy Father, <hi>that it is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96891:130"/>
for proud men to fall sometimes into
Scandalous sins.</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that Great
Apostle, is observed by the Antients to
have been one of the forwardest and
most confident of Christ's Disciples:
And we may also gather so much from
that Confident Answer he returned to
Christ, when he told him, that <hi>tho' all
Men forsook him, yet he would follow him
to the last:</hi> But when God's Providence
had allowed Satan to sift him, and
chastise his Confidence by a sore Fall,
we find him falling lower in his own
Thoughts to: For when Christ, <hi>Iohn
ult.</hi> puts the Question to him, <hi>Peter,
lovest thou me more than these?</hi> And
he puts it thrice to remind him of
his thrice Denial. <hi>Peter,</hi> ver. 17. returns
this modest and humble Answer, <hi>Lord,
thou knowest all things, thou knowest that
I love thee.</hi> There is indeed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way to take down the Peacock's
Plumes, than by discovering her black
Feet; and hold but a Looking-Glass
before the stout Elephant, and you will
soon teach him to abhor his Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> One end more to which God
directs the Wickedness of the World, is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96891:130"/>
the glorifiing his Wisdom. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Esay</hi> tells us, that <hi>God is wonderful
in Counsel, and excellent in working.</hi>
Every Event of Providence is of such
excellent contrivance, and manag'd with
such admirable Wisdom, that we may
say of the Works of God's Providence,
what the <hi>Psalmist</hi> does of the Works
of Creation: <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy
Works! In wisdom hast thou made them
all; the Earth is full of thy Riches.</hi> So
clear a Truth is this, that it has not
escaped the Observations of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
hence it was that they set forth
their Gods with Harps in their hands,
to shew the Harmony they observed in
the Government of the World. Tho'
there may happen very often great
Confusions here below, and the World
may seem to run upon Wheels, as
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> himself once thought; yet the
same Prophet found at last, that there
were <hi>Eyes</hi> in these <hi>Wheels,</hi> a Wise
Providence which did move and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them all to great and Glorious
Ends. The truth of this might easily
be made to appear more at large by
considering some of the most rugged
passages of Providence, such as seem at
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96891:131"/>
first view to have been performed with
the greatest negligence and deformity,
and yet when examin'd from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end, have been found to
have admirable beauty and Comliness
in them. But because the Time will
not allow of many Instances, it may
suffice at present to shew the truth of
this in the famous History of <hi>Ionah:</hi>
That this Prophet, when sent about so
weighty a matter as the preservation of
great <hi>Niniveh,</hi> that he should make
delays even when their destruction was
but Forty days off: Nay more, that he
should fly to <hi>Tarshish;</hi> nay farther yet,
that he should be cast into the Sea by
the malicious Mariners; and swallowed
up presently by a merciless Whale: All
these seemed at first to be so many
Errata's of God's Providence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
little to the Conversion of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh;</hi>
yet all these seeming Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
were so wisely managed by God's
Providence, as to prove great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to that so important business:
For it is more than a probable Opinion
of Divines, that these malicious Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were a special Occasion that <hi>Ionah</hi>'s
Preaching was so successful. For it was
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96891:131"/>
these Mariners that informed the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
what had hapned unto <hi>Ionah,</hi> how
he had been cast into the Sea, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the Whale, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
could not, but by a special
Miracle, have been conducted unto
<hi>Niniveh:</hi> And this was that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the more credit to <hi>Ionah</hi>'s Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which frightned the <hi>Ninivites</hi> into
that most rigorous Fast, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> both on Man
and Beast. Thus we see how the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God's Providence directed the
sin of <hi>Ionah,</hi> and the malice of the
Mariners, to work out that end
they seemed directly to oppose. In
this and such like Instances as may be
observed in the World, we cannot but
take notice of the beauties of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ought to admire and adore
the infinite VVisdom of our God,
which does so eminently appear in the
wonderful goverment of the greatest
Disasters and Confusions here below.
I proceed now to draw some few Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolaries
from what hath been delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We may learn from hence, to
abhor the Blasphemy of such men as
seem to make God the Author of Sin.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96891:132"/>
Ye hear it is <hi>the Heart of Man</hi> which
<hi>deviseth its own wickedness,</hi> and that God
by his wise Providence does only direct
their Wickedness to great and glorious
Ends. Just as a skilful Physician, who
does not put Poyson into Serpents and
other Venemous Creatures, but only
converts their Poysons into Sovereign
Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We also learn from hence,
whence it is that there is no more Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
done in the World. When we
consider the great Malice of Satan and
his Instruments, how great also is their
Power, and how formidable their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
we may justly wonder that this
World is any better than a larger <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem:</hi>
But we owe our safety and
happiness to the good Providence of
God: He sets an hedge about his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
he curbs the Fury of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and directs even the Wickedness
of Satan and his Instruments, so as
may best serve his own Glory, and the
good of his People. It was well said
of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> that noble Philosopher,
<hi>Who would desire to live in this World,
if it were destitute of God and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?
If all were left to Chance and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96891:132"/>
we exposed every where to innumerable
Enemies and Dangers? But since there
is an over-ruling Providence,</hi> saith he,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>I
adore that Providence, and live sweetly
and pleasantly, confiding always in Gods
Almighty Protection.</hi> To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is that of the Royal Psalmist,
<hi>Psal. 97. 1. The Lord reigneth, let the
Earth rejoyce: Let the multitude of the
Isles be glad thereof.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is not enough that we
rejoyce under the protection of God's
Providence; but we must also adore and
worship his great and glorious Name,
who does such Wonders for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Men. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 10. we are told
that <hi>the Wrath of Man shall praise the
Lord: The remainder of Wrath he shall
restrain:</hi> The Septuagint read the latter
part of the Verse thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Rage
of Man,</hi> say they, <hi>shall keep Holiday unto
the Lord,</hi> i. e. <hi>give his People opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of lauding and magnifying his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Name.</hi> And sure no People in the
World ever had more cause to praise and
magnify the Name of God, than we of
this Church and Nation. VVhat mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Preservations has his good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96891:133"/>
wrought for us? VVhat Plots
and Descents has he detected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated?
How has he baffled the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
Policy of the subtilest <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi>
and made him prove, according to
his name in Hebrew, no better than the
Brother or Cousin-Germain to a <hi>Fool?</hi>
Oh then! let us praise our God according
to his excellent Greatness; and being
wonderfully <hi>delivered from the hands of
our Enemies, let us serve him without fear,
in holiness and righteousness before him all
the dayes of our life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This God of his infinite Mercy grant<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

displays the excellent Glory and
Majesty of our Saviour: He
styles him, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the <hi>Son of God;</hi>
the <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> and <hi>Maker
of the Worlds:</hi> He tells us us farther, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.
that <hi>He is the brightness of his Fathers
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96891:134"/>
Glory, the express Image of his Person, and
the upholder of all things:</hi> In the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of the Chapter he shews, how
far Christ transcends all the Holy Angels:
These, he says, are but <hi>Servants</hi> and
<hi>Ministring Spirits;</hi> but Christ, he is the
<hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>only begotten Son of God:</hi>
These are all commanded to fall down
and worship Christ; but He has Ã¡ Throne,
a Scepter, <hi>a Scepter of Righteousness,</hi> yea,
the Scepter of his own Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Thus great, thus glorious a Person
is Christ, Heaven it self has nothing
greater; and yet as great, as glorious as
He is, his Father thought fit to employ
him in the work of Mans Salvation. O
the wonderful Condescentions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
We may be sure God is most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to save poor Sinners, seeing he sends
to them, and that his own Son, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
and entreat them to accept of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Hence is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the
beginning of this Epistle, <hi>God, who, at
sundry times, and in divers manners, spake
in time past unto the Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
hath in these last days spoken unto
us by his Son.</hi> Had God spoken to us by
the meanest of his Prophets, it had
been strange and wonderful Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96891:134"/>
but that he should send his
own Son to preach the Gospel, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
Rebel sinners to be reconciled to
Heaven, and accept of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
this is such an instance of stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Love and Mercy, as does as
much exceed our imaginations, as it does
our Deserts!</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> having thus dispiayed the
Excellent Majesty of Christ, and the
infinite Riches of Gods Free Grace and
Mercy, in that he sent his Eternal Son
to be the first Preacher of the Gospel,
and tender Salvation to lost and undone
sinners, he begins the <hi>2d. Chapter</hi> with
a serious and passionate Admonition;
<hi>We therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>ought to give the
more earnest heed to the things which we
have heard, lest at any time we should let
them slip.</hi> If God had conveyed the
Gospel to Christians, as he did the Law
unto the Jews, by the Ministry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
we could not have slighted it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gross ingratitude; and our <hi>Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
as we are told, <hi>ver. 2. would have
received a just recompence of reward:</hi> Of
<hi>how much sorer punishment shall we now
he thought worthy,</hi> seeing the Eternal
Son of God condescended to be of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96891:135"/>
Order of Predicants, seeing Christ Jesus
himself vouchsafed to be the <hi>first
Preacher</hi> of the Gospel; how should
we then honour and value this Gospel?
What earnest heed should we give to
the things contained in it, or preached
from it? Whatever Admonitions, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
or Reproofs Ministers give
us out of these Sacred Oracles, should
not be look'd upon as the Words of frail
Men, but as they are in truth the Words
of God and Christ. Christians therefore
will be most inexcusable: They of all
men will deserve the severest Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>if they shall neglect so great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
And because the danger is thus
great, our Apostle is the more earnest
and passionate in his Exhortation: He
employs all his Divine Rhetorick, to
make Christians sensible of their greater
Priviledge, and consequently of their
greater Obligations to obey the Gospel:
<hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great
Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having by this short Preface led you
into the very Bowels of the Text, I shall
fetch from thence these Three Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:96891:135"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Salvation</hi> which is
published by the Gospel, is exceeding
great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That those Christians which
<hi>neglect</hi> this <hi>great Salvation,</hi> must expect
the severest Punishments in Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Ministers may very well
be allowed to be mighty earnest and
passionate in their Exhortations of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I begin with the first of these,
namely, to shew you, that the <hi>Salvation</hi>
which is published by the Gospel, is
exceeding great. It is called <hi>Great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
in the Text, yea the Apostle puts
an Emphasis upon it, and calls it, <hi>So
great Salvation.</hi> Learned Men render it
<hi>Eximiam ut mire magnam salutem,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Most admirable and most excellent Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
And it will appear at large to
be so from these following Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The greatness of this <hi>Salvation</hi>
will appear if we consider the greatness
of the Price that was paid for it. The
worth and excellency of a thing, is
usually measur'd by the greatness of its
price. Now how great was that price
which was paid for this Salvation?
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96891:136"/>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, we were <hi>not redeemed
with such corruptible things, as Silver
and Gold; but with the precious Blood of
the Son of God.</hi> Had we offer'd a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Rams, and ten thousand Rivers of
Oil:</hi> Had <hi>we given the fruit of our
Bodies, for the sin of our Souls;</hi> yea, had
it been possible for us to have sacrificed<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
whole Hecatombs of Angels to the
Justice of Heaven, they would not all
have been sufficient to atone for our Sins,
and purchase this Salvation: Nothing
could purchase it but the <hi>Blood of
Iesus;</hi> and that not only as he was Man,
but as he was God too. Hence we are
said expresly to be purchas'd with the
<hi>Blood of God,</hi> Act. 20. 28. We see an
Infinite price was paid Heaven to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
this Salvation: And therefore we
may well allow the Apostles Emphasis
of <hi>so great Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The greatness of this Salvation
will yet further appear, if we consider
the greatness of those evils it delivers us
from. It is an excellent saying of <hi>Seneca,
Lenocinium est gaudii antecedens metus,</hi> the
greatness of the danger uses to commend
and inhance the greatness of the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Now how great was the danger we
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96891:136"/>
were in? how great those Evils we were
exposed to? The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> gives us
a most Tragical Description of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
<hi>Tophet,</hi> which was to be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Rebellious Sinner, Chap.
30. 31. <hi>Tophet,</hi> saith he, <hi>is prepared of
old, the Pile thereof is Fire and much
Wood, and the Breath of the Lord like
a stream of Brimstone, doth kindle it
continually.</hi> See how each word is
arm'd with Terror: It seems there is
an eternal <hi>Tophet</hi> prepared for all the
Enemies of Heaven: It seems the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this dreadful place is set forth
by Fire, one of the cruellest of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nay give me leave to observe
farther to you, that this Fire of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
can be no ordinary material Fire,
seeing we are told it was originally
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.
For since they are Spiritual and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Beings, they cannot be Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by any ordinary material Fire,
The Fire therefore of <hi>Tophet</hi> must be
of such a strange and dreadful Nature,
that this Fire we use is only fit to be
a cold and faint emblem of it; and well
may we conclude so much, seeing it is
said to be kindled by the Breath of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96891:137"/>
Almighty. The fiery Furnace of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
was dreadful enough, tho' it was
kindled only by the breath of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King; how dreadful then must the
Furnace of Hell be, which has all the
Ingredients of Torture Omnipotent Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
can furnish it with? This Fire
of <hi>Tophet</hi> of Hell, is said yet farther,
to <hi>be prepared for the Devil and his
Angels.</hi> Now we know these Hellish
Fiends are the most malicious Enemies
of Heaven: These ambitious Spirits en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
at the very first to dethrone
their Almighty Creator; and since they
failed in that black design, they have
ever since discovered their inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of God, by tempting Mankind
into the same cursed Conspiracy against
him. Sure then that Fire, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for these malicious Enemies of
Heaven, cannot possibly want any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of Torture, Infinite Wisdom
can invent, or Infinite Power inflict.
Now such devouring Flames as these
were prepared for obstinate sinners, as
well as for these fallen Angels. There
is one Consideration still behind, which
will make these Torments appear more
dreadful, and that is the Eternal Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96891:137"/>
of them. For here it is that the
Worm never dies; here it is that the
Fire is not quenched: When the sinner
has lain in Hell as many millions of
years, as there are Sands on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore,
he will be no nearer an end of
his Torments, than he was the first
Moment of his entrance into them.
Who can read without trembling, what
St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 49. Namely,
<hi>that the Damned shall be salted with
Fire.</hi> Such it seems is the dreadful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Infernal Flames, that they
do Torment, but not Consume: Like
Salt they preserve those wretched Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they seem to devour. O cruel
Mercy of Hellish Flames! O Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
worse than the most dreadful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction!
Thus great are those Evils
we are delivered from, and you will
easily conclude how great that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is which delivers us from them.
The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did exceedingly
rejoyce when they were delivered from
the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But sure Hell is a
more dreadful kind of Bondage than
<hi>Egypts;</hi> and Satan a worse sort of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
than <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> therefore the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96891:138"/>
of the Text, which delivers us from
these dreadful and infinite Evils, must
needs be exceeding great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The greatness of this Salvation
will appear yet further, if we consider
that Infinite and Eternal Happiness it
brings along with it. This Salvation
does not only deliver us from Hell, and
Eternal Damnation; but it gives us
also a Right and Title to the endless
Joys of Heaven: Even those Joys <hi>which
Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath it entred into the Heart of
Man to conceive.</hi> If the sweet society
of Saints and Angels, if the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
enjoyment of the Blessed Trinity,
if an uninterrupted and eternal fruition
of the most desirable Pleasures; if all
this be sufficient to make the <hi>Salvation</hi>
in the Text exceeding great, then we
may pardon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Emphasis, and
allow him to call it <hi>so great Salvation;</hi>
for this is that <hi>Salvation</hi> which Christ
has purchast, and the Gospel publish'd
to the World. Hence Christ is styl'd
<hi>the Author of Eternal Salvation,</hi> Heb.
5. 9. and is said <hi>to have obtained Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Redemption for us, Heb. 9. 12.. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
was deservedly accounted <hi>a mighty
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96891:138"/>
Saviour,</hi> because having delivered <hi>Israel</hi>
from their malicious Enemies, he gave
them a quiet Possession of the Earthly
<hi>Canaan.</hi> How great a Saviour is our
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> or Jesus, who having vanquished
our Spiritual Enemies, has purchased for
us the possession of the Heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> The greatness of this <hi>Salvation</hi>
will further appear, if we consider the
Extent and Amplitude of it. This <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
is an universal <hi>Salvation,</hi> all Men
have a Right and Title to it; tho' <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
of old was only of the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet
now Christ <hi>is a Light to lighten the</hi>
Gentiles, <hi>as well as the Glory of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
Israel. God is now no respecter
of Persons, but in every Nation, he that
feareth God and worketh Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is accepted of him. They are highly
injurious to the goodness of God, and
to that <hi>Salvation</hi> which was wrought
by Christ, who would have it restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a certain number of Persons. For
it is most plain from Scripture, that
God would have all Men to be saved.
Hear what the Angels said unto the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
Luke 2. 10. <hi>Behold, I bring you
good Tidings, of great Ioy, which shall
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96891:139"/>
be unto all People.</hi> Hence Christ is said
<hi>to give himself a Ransom for all,</hi> 1 Tim.
2. 6. as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks, 1 Epist. 2. 2.
<hi>He is the Propitiation for our Sins, and
not for ours only, but also for the Sins
of the whole World.</hi> If these places of
Scripture be not full and clear enough,
St <hi>Paul</hi> will tell you, <hi>that Christ tasted
Death for every Man,</hi> Heb. 2. 9. I shall
add but one Text more to convince
you of this Truth, and it shall be that
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epist. 2. 2. where he
speaks of <hi>False Teachers, such as privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring in Damnable Heresies, even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Lord that bought them, and
bring upon themselves swift Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
It seems Christ bought those that
are Damned, as well as those that are
Saved; and consequently the <hi>Salvation</hi>
or <hi>Redemption</hi> which he wrought, must
needs be Universal: None are excluded
from it, but such as exclude themselves
by their Obstinancy and Impenitency.
Now if we lay these Four Cnsiderations
together; namely, <hi>The greatness of the
Price which was paid for this Salvation.
The greatness of those Evils it delivers
us from. The Infinite and Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
it brings along with it.</hi> And
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96891:139"/>
Lastly, <hi>The Extent and Amplitude of it,
which is so great, as to include</hi> both <hi>Iew</hi>
and <hi>Gentile;</hi> we may safely conclude
with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that it is <hi>great Salvation.</hi>
Thus I have dispatched the First General
I proposed, and proceed now to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Namely, To shew you that
those Christians, <hi>who neglect this great
Salvation,</hi> must expect the severest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
in Hell. This may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the words of the Text, where
St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivers himself in these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
Expressions, <hi>How shall we escape
if we neglect so great Salvation?</hi> As
much as if the Apostle should have
said, Christians, who disobey the Gospel,
must never hope to go unpunisht; nay,
these, of all others, must expect the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
punishments. He tells Christians
in the foregoing Verse, that the <hi>Iews</hi>
for transgressing the Law of <hi>Moses, were
to receive a just recompence of reward; how
then,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall we escape, if we neglect
the much greater Salvation of the Gospel?</hi>
fairly intimating, that Christians, as they
have greater Priviledges and Advantages
than others, so the abuse of them will
bind them over to proportionably greater
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96891:140"/>
Punishments. It is the observation of
<hi>Menochus,</hi> that <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
the sin of <hi>Achan,</hi> plays the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld,
and gives an account of his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree;
for we are told, Jos. 7. 1. <hi>that</hi>
Achan <hi>was the Son of</hi> Carmi, <hi>the Son
of</hi> Zabdi, <hi>the Son of</hi> Zerah, <hi>of the Tribe
of</hi> Judah. Had <hi>Achan</hi> been a poor Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Heathen, his sin, even in these
lower circumstances, would have kindled
the Wrath of Heaven, and have pulled
down heavy Judgments upon him: But
<hi>Achan</hi> that was a <hi>Iew,</hi> and that no
mean <hi>Iew,</hi> but of the Royal Tribe of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and descended from such Noble
Progenitors, as <hi>Carmi, Zabdi,</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
All Honourable Persons; for him
to commit a Trespass of this Nature;
his Priviledges and Advantages loaded
his sin with the heavier Aggravations,
and rendred him obnoxious to a double
Punishment, to wit, that of Lapidation,
and the other of Burning, which were
both inflicted on him, as we read,
<hi>Ios.</hi> 7. 25. It seems God proceeds with
Sinners according to the Rules of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributive
Justice: He proportions his
Punishments according to their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Priviledges and Advantages. Such
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96891:140"/>
as have enjoyed lesser Priviledges, shall
be beaten with fewer Stripes. The
poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> still find a cooler place
in Hell than the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the
<hi>Iews</hi> than the <hi>Christians.</hi> Hear what
St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Rom. 2. 12. <hi>As many as
have sinned without the Law, shall perish
without the Law, and as many as have
sinned in the Law, shall be judged
by the Law.</hi> As St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, <hi>the
Law of God which</hi> Moses <hi>delivered to
the</hi> Jews, <hi>as it did more clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and forbid all manner of Sin, so
it did ingeminate, or double their guilt.</hi>
The poor <hi>Gentile,</hi> who wants the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, will
have the Law of Nature only to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for. But the <hi>Iew</hi> at the day of
Judgment will find himself condemned
both by the Law of Nature, and the Law
of <hi>Moses;</hi> and consequently, his Guilt
will be double, and his Punishment so
much the greater. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, in that same, Rom. 2. 9. <hi>That God
will render Tribulation and Anguish up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every Soul of Man, that doth Evil,
of the</hi> Jew <hi>first, and also of the</hi> Gentile.
It seems the <hi>Iew</hi> shall have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>Gentile</hi> in Hell; a cursed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96891:141"/>
kind of precedence, and such, as I
fancy, few will be very ambitious of.</p>
            <p>Thus you see the <hi>Iew</hi> shall, in Hell,
be beaten with more stripes than the
<hi>Gentile:</hi> And the Condition of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<hi>Christian</hi> will be worse than
the <hi>Iews.</hi> He has enjoyed greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
than the <hi>Iew,</hi> and must expect
greater Punishments: He has the Law
of Nature, the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the
Law of the Gospel to answer for; and
therefore if the Guilt of the <hi>Iew</hi> be
double in respect of the <hi>Gentile,</hi> the
<hi>Christians</hi> Guilt will be treble, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him worthy of much sorer Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hence it is that our Apostle, <hi>Chap.
10.</hi> of this Epistle <hi>Vers. 28, 29. If he
that despised</hi> Moses's <hi>Law, died without
mercy, of how much sorer Punishment shall
he be thought worthy, who has trampled
under Foot the Son of God?</hi> It's plain
the <hi>Christians</hi> Punishment will be greater
than the <hi>Iews;</hi> even as great as the
Salvation which was offered him; in
a word, so great, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
had the gift of Tongues, was not able
to express it otherwise, than in these
most Astonishing Expressions, <hi>of how
much sorer Punishment shall he be thought
worthy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:96891:141"/>
Thus you see, that as there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Torments in Hell, so the
greatest of them will be the Portion
of such sinners as do neglect the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel; and you will more
easily believe this Dreadful Doctrin,
when I have given you the true Reason,
of it. And,</p>
            <p>1. The Gospel which bringeth this
great Salvation, was first Preacht and
Publisht by Christ, the Eternal Son of
God; and this does mightily aggravate
the disobedience of Christians. God he
sent his Messengers, his Prophets, yea
sometimes his Angels to publish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Law unto the <hi>Iews.</hi> But he has
sent his own Eternal Son to Preach and
Publish the Gospel to the Christian
World; and sure such a wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of astonishing Mercy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention,
cannot but load the sins of
Christians with the most dreadful ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations.
Hear what our Saviour
himself saith, John 15. 22. <hi>If I had not
come and spoken unto them, they had
not had sin, but now they have no Cloak
for their sin.</hi> The same Argument is
here urged by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Text,
<hi>How shall we escape,</hi> saith he, <hi>if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96891:142"/>
so great Salvation,</hi> which at the
first began to be spoken by the Lord?
As much as if the Apostle should have
said, the Gospel which we, the Ministers
of Christ, Preach unto you, it is Christs
Gospel, the very same that he, in his
own Person, first Preacht and Publisht to
the World. Sure then you will reverence
this Eternal Son of God. Sure ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think it your Duty to obey his
Gospel. As he is the Lord, he may
command your Obedience; and as he is
your Saviour, who died for you, he
does most deserve it. Ye cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
offend against this Gospel, but you
must affront the highest instance and
demonstration of God's Love. And
what Punishments can be great enough
to punish such Ingratitude? The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
the Jews and Devils themselves,
who are now howling amidst everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Burnings, they never sinned against
such stupendious Mercy as Christians
do; <hi>Of how much sorer Punishment shall
they be thought worthy, who trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Foot the Son of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Reason, why Christians
must expect the severest Punishments <hi>if
they neglect this great Salvation,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96891:142"/>
the Light of the Gospel is greater
and clearer than that of the Law. <hi>Esay</hi>
Prophecying of the times of the Gospel,
Chap. 11. 9. Says, <hi>That the Earth shall
then be full of the Knowledge of the Lord,
as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>
2 Epist. 1. 19. Compares the Light of
the Law, <hi>to a dim Light shining in a
dark place;</hi> alluding, as 'tis thought, to
those Candles which were always shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the Temple, because it was a
dark place, as having but very small
Windows to let in the light of the Sun.
But the Light of the Gospel he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
to the Day, intimating that the
Light of the Gospel does as far exceed
the Light of the Law, as the Light of
the Sun does that of a Candle. We
know the Vail was upon the Face of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and the weighty concerns of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
were then wrapt up in obscure
Types and Shadows. But the Shadows
being now vanisht, the Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is risen, and <hi>Christ has brought Life and
Immortality to Light, through the Gospel,</hi>
2 Tim. 1. 10. Thus great is the Light of the
Gospel, and therefore those sins which are
committed against it, are the more hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and damnable sins against Knowledg,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96891:143"/>
have more of wilfulness in them, and
argue greater contempt of God. Hence
such sinners are said in Scripture <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Lord,</hi> Numb. 15. 30. Yea, <hi>to
rebel against the Light,</hi> Job 24. 13. Since
therefore Christians sin against greater
Light, they must expect severer Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<hi>Fer he that knoweth his Masters
will, and doth it not shall be beaten with
more stripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Another reason why Christians
must expect the severest Punishments,
<hi>if they neglect this great Salvation,</hi> is
because the means of Grace, which the
Gospel affords for the obtaining of this
<hi>Salvation,</hi> are now more plentiful than
they were before. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, Chap.
1. 17. <hi>That the Law was given by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>but Grace and Truth came by Iesus
Christ; of whose fulness,</hi> saith he, Verse
16. <hi>we all have received, and Grace for
Grace,</hi> or Grace upon Grace, to denote
the great plenty and abundance of
it. The Law could do no more than
shew Man his Duty, but the Gospel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
him Grace to perform it. Hence
the Preachers of the Gospel are styled
<hi>Able Ministers of the New Testament,
not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96891:143"/>
the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth
Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. The Law is here call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Letter, and is said to Kill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it shews our Duty, and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of neglecting it, but gives no Grace
to help us in the performing of it. But
the Gospel is called the Spirit, because
the Spirit of Grace does by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Operations, accompany the outward
Ministration of the Gospel, and so gives
us Life.</p>
            <p>Thus you see what plentiful Means
of Grace, the Gospel affords us for the
obtaining of this great <hi>Salvation:</hi> And
therefore if we do neglect these Means
of Grace, our Condemnation, as it will
be more just, so it will be more heavy
too. This is plain from our Saviours
threatning <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> Mat.
11. 21, 22. <hi>Wo unto thee</hi> Chorazin, <hi>wo
unto thee</hi> Bethsaida, <hi>for if the mighty
works which were done in you, had been
done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have
repented long ago in Sackcloath and Ashes:
But I say unto you, it shall be more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>at the day
of Iudgment, than for you.</hi> Thus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as they enjoy more plentiful
Means of Grace than others; so if all
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96891:144"/>
these be lost upon them, they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the severer Punishments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I come now in the Third
and Last Place to shew you, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
may very well be allowed to be
mighty earnest and passionate in their
Exhortations and Admonitions. See
how earnest and passionate St. <hi>Paul</hi> is
in the Text; with what Vehemency and
Fervency of Spirit does he cry out,
<hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so
great Salvation?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of
the greatest Orators in the World: And
he never thought his Oratory better
employed, than in the winning Souls to
Christ. Hence we find him in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
Preaching with such Zeal and Eloquence
that the Men of <hi>Lycaonia</hi> fancied <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
their God of Eloquence, was come
down from Heaven. And as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was thus Fervent in Spirit, serving the
Lord, and promoting the Salvation of
Souls, so 2 Tim. 4. 2. <hi>He charges Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to be Instant in Season, and out of
Season, Reproving, Rebuking, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
with all long Suffering.</hi> And in
truth what Zeal, what Vehemency can
be thought too much for the Pulpit?
Indeed the Heathen of old said well,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96891:144"/>
               <hi>Stultus labor ineptiarum, It is a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thing,</hi> said he, <hi>to make a noise about
Trifles.</hi> But sure Life and Death, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell, these are no Trifles. Men
do not well consider the worth of Souls,
and the greatness of that Salvation
Christ has purchast for them, when they
are offended at the Zeal and Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Ministers; when they are angry
at the seriousness of their Exhortations,
or the severity of their Reproofs. But
what pity is it, that Hell should be
hung with such rich Furniture as the
precious Souls of Men? And who would
not employ their utmost Zeal to save
such wicked sinners, as are ready every
moment to drop into Hell Fire? Let me
therefore with all seriousness intreat you
<hi>to work out your Salvation with Fear and
Trembling.</hi> As you love your own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls, and value that Infinite
Price which Christ has paid for them;
as you dread the everlasting Burnings
of the infernal <hi>Tophet,</hi> and earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the endless Joys of Heaven, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to break off your League with
Sin, and make your Peace with Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, that when ye come to die, your
Blessed Saviour may see the travel of his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96891:145"/>
Soul, and be satisfied; that he may then
be as ready to Bestow on you, as he was
to Purchase for you; that you may at last
obtain this great <hi>Salvation.</hi> Which God
grant unto us all, for the sake of Jesus
Christ, to whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

in this most excellent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to confirm them in the
same, by sundry Arguments.
Some of these Arguments are drawn
from the consideration of that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96891:146"/>
condition they were in before; and
some from the excellency and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their present State. Their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
condition is displayed in all its
colours, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. of this chapter, where
he tells them, that they were then
<hi>without Christ,</hi> they were then <hi>Aliens
from the common wealth of</hi> Israel, <hi>strangers
from the covenants of promise, having no
hope, and without God in the World.</hi> It
seems such as are without the pale of the
Church, are no better than the Children
of Wrath; they are expos'd to all the
dreadful effects of God's anger in this
World, and must hereafter be cast into
everlasting burnings in the next. But
tho' this was the lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of these <hi>Ephesians</hi> before their
conversion, yet the planting of the
Gospel had made a happy change, for
they were now <hi>no more strangers and
forreigners, but fellow citizens with the
Saints,</hi> they were now delivered from
the fears of Eternal damnation, and
had a Right and Title to all these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Priviledges, which <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
the other blessed Citizens of Heaven,
did actually possess. And what was
it which gave them a right and title
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96891:146"/>
to all this happiness? If you please to
look a little farther into the Text, you'l
find it was because they were <hi>of the
houshold of God;</hi> or in plain terms
Members of the true Church; for this
indeed is the true Gospel which enjoys
the bright beams of Heavenly light,
whilst all the World besides groans
under worse than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkness:
This is the true <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece which is
watred with the dew of Celestial Grace,
whilst the other parts of the Earth lyes
dry and parch'd, not unlike some bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and cursed wilderness. This in
St. <hi>Austine</hi>'s comparison is the true Ark
in which alone we can be secure from
the deluge of God's wrath: Thus great
is their happiness who are in the Church
of Christ! But some difficulty there
is to find out the true Church, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
observed of Old, <hi>faciunt favos
&amp; vespae faciunt Ecclesias &amp; Marcionitae,</hi>
the most dangerous Wasps have their
Cells, saith he, even so the worst of
Hereticks are ready to cry out the
Temple of the Lord are we: That
therefore we may not mistake <hi>Leah</hi> for
<hi>Rachel,</hi> or embrace a Cloud instead of
a <hi>Iuno;</hi> we must carefully observe that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96891:147"/>
description St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us of the
true Church; he tells us it is founded
on the Doctrine of Heaven, or if you
had rather take it in the words of the
Text, it is; saith he, that <hi>houshold of
God which is built upon the foundations
of the Apostles and Prophets:</hi> From the
words thus far explained, I shall crave
leave to prove these four things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
and Prophets is the foundation on
which the true Church is built.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Doctrine of the
Apostles and Prophets is sufficiently
delivered to us in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>is</hi> built upon this foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets; <hi>And</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That such as continue in
the communion of this Church, are as
happy as were those <hi>Ephesians</hi> of whom
St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, they were <hi>no more
strangers and forreigners, but fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
with the Saints of this houshold of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the first of these, to
shew you that the Doctrine of the
Apostles and Prophets, is the only
foundation upon which the true Church
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96891:147"/>
is built: The Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> if
we'l believe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was <hi>the houshold
of God,</hi> or a true Church of Christ:
and it seems it was so, because <hi>built
upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets;</hi> we are sure these inspired
Ministers of the Holy <hi>Iesus</hi> preached
and planted none but the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and we may be sure it can be no
bad Church, which owns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
the same Religion. I know there
are several marks given of the true
Church, such as Unity, Universality,
Antiquity, Succession, Sanctity, and
the like; but tho' these, where they
are found, are Great Ornaments to a
Church; yet the best and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
mark to know it by, is its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Doctrines delivered by
the Apostles: For the true Church as
the Apostle speaks elsewhere, is <hi>the
ground and Pillar of Truth;</hi> but it will
not deserve this honourable Character,
if its Doctrines be repugnant to the
Doctrines delivered by the Apostles.
It's said of the best and most Catholick
Christians, <hi>Acts, 2. 42. That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
stedfast in the Apostles Doctrine:</hi>
And therefore, such as follow the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96891:148"/>
example, will be far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the brand of Hereticks. Does
not our Saviour himself tell us, that his
Sheep will hear his Voice, and not
the Voice of Strangers? And where
is this voice of Christ to be heard,
but sounding in the writings of these
Apostles and Prophets? This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is <hi>the sure word of Prophecy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto</hi>
saith St. <hi>Peter, ye do well if you
take heed:</hi> nor is this any other mark
of the Church of God, then what is
generally own'd by the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> brings in the Church
speaking such words as these, <hi>Sum,
Apostolorum, sic teneo, sicut illi testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento
caverunt:</hi> I am Heir, saith she,
to the holy Apostles, whatever Truth
they left me in their Writings; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Doctrines they bequeath'd me in
their Testament; these I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
these I will constantly hold. <hi>Ireneus</hi>
calls the Gospel, <hi>columnam &amp; firmamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Ecclesiae,</hi> the Ground and Pillar of
the Church. St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> treating
at large upon this Question, How the
true Church may be known? returns
this answer more than once; <hi>The true
Church is best known by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:96891:148"/>
saith he, that is the Christian
Church which agrees with these sacred
Oracles: and that is the Heretical
which is repugnant to them. None
speaks more largely, or more excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this point, than the great St.
<hi>Austine,</hi> who in his admirable Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Donatists</hi> writes thus, <hi>The
question between us and the</hi> Donatists <hi>is,
where we shall find the Church? What
therefore shall we do? shall we seek it in our
own words? or in the words of our Lord
Iesus Christ? I think, we had rather seek
it in his words, who is the truth, and
best knoweth his own Church. Let not
therefore these Speeches be heard amongst
us, This I say, and this thou sayest; but
let us hear, Thus saith the Lord: There
are certain Books of God to whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
we both stand, we both consent, we
both believe; there let us seek the Church,
there let us try our cause: I will not have
the Church demonstrated by Man's teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but by the holy Oracles of God.
Setting therefore aside all such matters,
let them shew forth the Church, if they
can, not by the speech and rumours of the</hi>
Africans, <hi>not in the Councils of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
not in the Writing of any Disputer,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96891:149"/>
not in Visions and Revelations, not in
Signs and false Miracles; because God's
word has abundantly prepared us, and
made us ready against these things. But
let them declare it out of the Prescript of
the Law, the predictions of the Prophets,
the Songs of the Psalms, the testimonies
of the Apostles, the words of the Pastor
himself, whether they have a Church or no;
let them declare only by the Canonical
Books of the holy Scripture; these be the
instructions, these be the foundations, these
be the supporters of our cause.</hi> Thus
far St. <hi>Austine,</hi> and because he is so
clear and so full to this case, I shall not
need to trouble you with any further
Authorities, especially, since the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> doth acknowledge in her
<hi>Trent</hi> Catechism, that no Church is
Catholick that does not profess that
faith which is <hi>built upon the foundation
of the Prophets and Apostles.</hi> She must
not hold any new faith, say they; but
that which was delivered of old by the
holy Apostles. And it follows in the
same Catechism, the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers
did well to add the word Apostolick
to their Creed, saying, I believe one
Catholick and Apostolick Church;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96891:149"/>
namely, that all might know that is
the only true Catholick Church, which
is Apostolick. That therefore must
needs be the truest mark of the Church,
which both <hi>Romanists</hi> and Protestants
own to be so: and indeed without this
all those other marks which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
will signifie nothing. Unity
without Apostolical Doctrine, is so far
from being a mark of the Church,
that it may not only be found in the
Societies of the worst of Men; but of
the Devils themselves: For it is the
known saying of our Saviour, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
kingdom if it were divided against
it self, it could not stand. Unity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is such a blessing as the Church of
God will earnestly desire and pray for:
but yet the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did not
cease to be a true Church, when it
wanted this blessing, and was torn in
peices by divisions. In vain also do
some Men make Universality or large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of extent a mark of the Church:
for we are told plainly in the Holy
Scriptures, that Christ's flock is but a
<hi>little flock,</hi> and it is at this day so far
exceeded in Amplitude, both by <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:96891:150"/>
and <hi>Pagans,</hi> that if the whole
World were divided into thirty Parts,
as <hi>Breerwood</hi> calculates in his <hi>Inquiries,</hi>
five only would be found <hi>Christians,</hi>
six <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and nineteen <hi>Pagans.</hi>
As for Antiquity, which some pretend
is the mark of the Church, tho' we
may well allow it to be a great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when attended with truth: yet
when this is wanting, it is but <hi>vetustas
erronis;</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls it, not Age
but dotage, nothing but error of a
longer standing, and so harder to be
rooted out. Some also are fond of a
long Series, or uninterrupted Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Bishops in the Church; but, as
St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks, those who have not
St. <hi>Peters</hi> faith, cannot succeed to St.
<hi>Peters</hi> Inheritance; and since the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
of <hi>Aaron</hi> may sometime descend
upon a wretched <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> such an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Pedigree as this may be more
honourable in Heraldry than it can be
in Religion.</p>
            <p>But of all the marks which some
make of the true Church, that of
Holiness best deserves the name; for
the Church of Christ should be holy
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96891:150"/>
like its Head; but when we say the
Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets
is the true mark of the Church, we do
not exclude, but include Sanctity: for
since the Doctrine of the Apostles is,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> defines it; <hi>a Doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto Godliness,</hi> where this
Doctrine is preach'd in its greatest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
there substantial holiness, free from
from all Superstition and Hypocrisie,
is most likely to be found; and if such
holiness does not at all times flourish
alike, the fault is not in the Church,
but in the Professors of it: These are
reckoned by some the principle marks
and Characters of the true Church;
but since they are so far from being
true marks, that without Apostolical
Doctrine they signifie little; I hope,
you will allow me to conclude accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Sense of the holy Scriptures
and the Ancient Fathers; That the
Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets
is the only foundation on which the
true Church is built: I come now in
the next place to shew you, That this
Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets
upon which the true Church is built;
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96891:151"/>
is sufficiently delivered to us in the
holy Scriptures. Whatever Doctrines
are contained in these sacred Oracles,
are own'd by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as well as by us, to be the Doctrines of
the Apostles and Prophets: but they
are pleased to charge the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with imperfection, pretending
that they contain not all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation; but must be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their unwritten and uncertain
Tradition: but sure if there were any
such Traditions handed down from
the Apostles through the several Ages
of the Church to this present Age;
these Traditions must needs pass thro'
the hands of the Ancient Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could come to ours: but
the Ancient Fathers knew no such
Traditions, but every where assert the
Perfection and Sufficiency of the holy
Scriptures. <hi>Ireneus</hi> calls the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
such a Rule of Faith, as none
must vary from. St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> says,
that all things that are necessary are
plain and manifest in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<hi>Non credimus, quia non legimus,</hi>
we believe no more than we read,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96891:151"/>
saith St <hi>Ierome.</hi> I shall only add the
Authority of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> who saith, it is
contrary to Faith, and a certain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Pride, to reject any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Scriptures, or to impose
any thing that is not written there:
Thus the Fathers knew nothing of
any unwritten Traditions; that were
to cut out the holy Scriptures, but
they refer us to them, as to a perfect
Rule. And well indeed they might,
since St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us they <hi>are able to
make us wise unto Salvation:</hi> and he
adds more fully yet, if it be possible
to do so, when he tells us, they <hi>are
able to make the man of God perfect,
throughly furnished unto every good work.</hi>
Thus great is the perfection of these
holy Oracles, and thus plain it is, that
the Doctrine of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
on which the true Church is
built, is fully and sufficiently delivered
to us in the holy Scripture. I come in the</p>
            <p>Third place to shew you, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.
King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, as he was not
unwilling to dye a Martyr for the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96891:152"/>
Church of <hi>England;</hi> so at his death he
left her the richest legacy he could,
even the most honourable Character
that could possibly be bestowed on
the best of Churches; for this advice
he gave to his Royal Sons, <hi>The best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion I have ever esteemed
that of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>I tell
you I have tried it; and after much search
and many disputes, I have concluded it to
be the best in the World, as coming nearest
to the word of God for Doctrine, and the
Primitive example for Government.</hi>
Whosoever does but look into the
Articles of our Church will find how
well she deserves this most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Character: For she professes to
believe the Holy Scriptures, which (as I
shewed above) contains the whole
Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets.
She believes the same Faith, and no
other than that which is comprized in
the Apostles <hi>Creed,</hi> and explained more
largely in those <hi>Creeds</hi> which are called
the <hi>Nicene</hi> and the <hi>Athanasian.</hi> And
as for those Doctrines which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
between us and the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> a little examination will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96891:152"/>
which Church is <hi>built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (1.) Let us examine that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
does challenge for St. <hi>Peter:</hi> If we look
into the Holy Scriptures, we shall
find nothing there that makes St. <hi>Peter</hi>
the chief of the Apostles: For if Christ
had ever intended St. <hi>Peter</hi> any such
Power over the rest, he would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have declared so much when the
Apostles were at strife <hi>who should be the
greatest:</hi> But so far is our Saviour from
declaring St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, that
he chides them for their vain strife and
contention; yea tells them in plain
terms, that it should not be among them
as in secular Kingdoms and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
where one is chief. And if St.
<hi>Peter</hi> had at any time afterwards been
made a Prince, we cannot imagin St.
<hi>Paul</hi> could have been ignorant of it,
and yet he tells us, <hi>2. Cor. 11. 5. That
he was not behind the very chiefest Apostles.</hi>
We read also, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9, 11. that he
did not only rebuke St. <hi>Peter</hi> openly at
<hi>Antioch,</hi> but also took of him <hi>the right
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96891:153"/>
hand of fellowship:</hi> Now we cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, but we must
convict St. <hi>Paul,</hi> either of gross Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
when he said <hi>he was not a whit
behind the very chiefest Apostles;</hi> or of
greater rudeness when he took place of
his Prince: and yet so true it is, that he
did so, that in memory of it, the Popes
own Seal hath St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi>
engraven upon it, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hold the dexter point.</p>
            <p>2. If we examin by Scripture, that
Controversie between the Church of
<hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about
the Deposing Doctrine; we shall find
which is <hi>built upon the foundation of
the Apostles and Prophets.</hi> For how
does the Scripture every where abhor
and detest that most disloyal and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Doctrine! <hi>Let every Soul be
subject to the higher Powers,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
and that <hi>not only for wrath, but also for
Conscience sake.</hi> Observe, <hi>Let every Soul,</hi>
of what rank, quality, or degree soever,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
says St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
upon these words, <hi>Tho thou art an
Apostle, tho an Evangelist, tho a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96891:153"/>
yea what ever thou art, thou must
be subject to the higher Powers.</hi> Thus
saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yea St. <hi>Peter</hi> also, from
whom the Pope pretends to derive his
Power, is so far from challenging any
power over Kings and Princes, either
for himself or Successors; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Christians to <hi>submit</hi> themselves
not unto him, but <hi>unto the King as
Supreme.</hi> Nay, he would have them
be subject <hi>not only to the good and gentle,
but also to the froward.</hi> And is not this
the Apostolical Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> which teaches all her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to pay active obedience unto all
the lawful Commands of Princes; and
when their commands interfere with
the Laws of God, not to resist, but to
obey Passively?</p>
            <p>3. The Prayers of our Church are
made in a Language well known unto
the People, and such as will tend (if
they are not wanting to themselves)
to their Edification. And sure I need
not tell you, that this is agreeable to
the Doctrine of the Apostles, when St.
<hi>Paul</hi> hath spent a whole Chapter to
assure us of it: For in <hi>1. Cor. 14. 14.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96891:154"/>
If I pray</hi>(saith he) <hi>in an unknown Tongue,
my Spirit prays, but my understanding is
unfruitful;</hi> but I will pray with the
Spirit, <hi>and I will pray with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
also.</hi> Again, ver. 16. <hi>How shall
he that occupieth the room of the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
say Amen at thy giving of thanks;
seeing he understandeth not what thou
sayst?</hi> Again, v. 19. <hi>In the Church I had
rather speak five words with my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that by my voice I might teach
others also, than ten thousand words in
an unknown Tongue.</hi> These are plain
Texts of Scripture, and shew the
practice of our Church to be Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</p>
            <p>4. The Church of <hi>England</hi> allows
the Laity the Cup as well as the
Bread; and this is no other Doctrine
than what Christ and his Apostles
teach. For our Saviour delivering the
Cup to his Disciples, says, <hi>Drink ye all
of it. Mat.</hi> 26. 27. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> assures
us, that in his time the People partook
of the Cup as well as of the Bread.
1 <hi>Cor. 12. 13. We have all been made to
drink into one Spirit.</hi> But I need not
produce any more Texts of Scripture
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96891:154"/>
for the proof of this, since it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For
in the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> we find
these expressions, <hi>Notwithstanding the
Institution of Christ, and the Practice of
the Apostles, we decree and determine that
the Laity shall not partake of the Cup.</hi>
It seems they find some inconvenience
in the Institution of Christ, and the
Practice of his Apostles: but our
Church thinks it convenient to stick
close to both.</p>
            <p>5. The Church of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
Transubstantiation, as being
contradictory to Sense, Reason, and
Scripture. Our Senses tell us it is
Bread and not Flesh after Consecration.
Our Reason will not allow one and
the same body to be in millions of
places at the same time: And as for
Scripture, S. <hi>Paul, 1. Cor. 11. 26. &amp;c.</hi>
calls it Bread at least three times after
Consecration. But tho we have all
this to say for our selves, yet we are
anathamatized by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
because we refuse, as they say, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as plain words as any are in the
Bible. For what can be plainer, say
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:96891:155"/>
they, than these words of our Saviour;
<hi>This is my body?</hi> But in truth, if these
words were as plain as they tell us,
we would be content to sacrifice both
our Sense, and our Reason to our
Faith. But if these words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
be taken in a literal Sense, as
they take them, they are so far from
being plain, that their Learned men
are very much divided about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. For ask them only what
is the subject of the Proposition, or
what is denoted by this demonstrative
Pronoun <hi>Hoc</hi> or <hi>This;</hi> and you will
find them mightily at a loss about it;
for <hi>Scotus</hi> says, it is <hi>Hoc ens,</hi> this entity
is my body; <hi>Aquinas</hi> this substance;
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> these species of bread; the
<hi>Sarbone</hi> this <hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> and
the famous <hi>Glossary, Hoc nihil,</hi> or this
nothing. Now if these words of our
Saviour were so very plain and easie,
as they say; 'Tis very strange their
Learned men should differ so much, and
at last make nothing of them. But
indeed, if we take them in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sense, as Protestants use to do,
they will be plain and easie enough:
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96891:155"/>
For the demonstrative particle <hi>Hoc</hi> or
<hi>This</hi> must needs relate to bread; for
it is said in the Text, that <hi>as they were
eating, Iesus took bread, and blessed it,
and brake it, and gave it to the Disciples,
and said Take, Eat, This is my body.</hi>
It seems what our Saviour took, blessed,
brake, and gave to his Disciples, was
bread; and of this and nothing else
can he speak, when he saith, <hi>This is
my body.</hi> Now this bread is my body,
is false, if we take it in a literal sense;
for bread is not flesh; but it is true in
a Figurative sense, This bread is, <hi>i. e.</hi>
does signifie Christs body. And this
kind of Dialect or manner of speech is
very usual in Scripture. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 26.
we read these words concerning <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
Dream, <hi>The seven kine are seven</hi>
years, <hi>i. e.</hi> they signifie seven years.
So again <hi>Exod. 12. 11. Moses</hi> speaking
of the Paschal Lamb, says <hi>it is the Lords
Passover, i. e.</hi> it signifies the Lords
passing the Children of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
when he destroyed all the First-born
of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now if, according to this
known Dialect of Scripture, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
our Saviours words, <hi>This is my
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96891:156"/>
body,</hi> the meaning will be plain and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
this bread does signifie or represent
my body. And this will appear to be
the sense of these words, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what our Saviour says of the
Cup, namely, <hi>This is my blood,</hi> which
must be taken in this Figurative sense,
this Cup represents my blood: For it
follows presently after, <hi>I will not drink
henceforth of the fruit of the vine,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>until that day when I drink it
new with you in my fathers kingdom.</hi> The
fruit is called sometimes the blood of
the Grape; but sure without a figure
it cannot be called the blood of Christ.
Thus you see that our Church is Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
also in denying Transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>6. The Adoration of the Host is
accounted by the Church of <hi>England</hi>
a most dangerous crime; for since, as
you have heard, there is no Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
but it remains bread, we
dare not pay our Adoration to it which
we believe a Creature; for it is the
plain Doctrine of our Saviour, <hi>Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The Church of <hi>England</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96891:156"/>
the Worship of Images, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
only what the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
had condemned before; for this
charge is given in the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Thou shalt not make unto thy self any
graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing
that is in heaven above, or in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
or in the waters under the earth; thou
shalt not bow down to them nor worship
them.</hi> Here we are forbid, and that in
most comprehensive terms, the making
of any Image whatsoever to Worship
it. It is not said, Thou shalt not make
Images of Idols or false Gods; but it
is said, <hi>Thou shalt not make any graven
Image, nor the likeness of any thing.</hi> To
make an Image of the true God is a
violation of this Commandment; for
the Golden Calves are condemned in
Scripture, notwithstanding the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel</hi> worshiped the true God
under those representations. Our
Church therefore doth not allow her
Members to picture God the Father in
the likeness of an Old Man, or the
Holy Ghost in the similitude of a Bird
or Dove. For God is a Spirit, yea an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
glorious Spirit, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96891:157"/>
cannot be pictured without an injury;
but to worship such Pictures or Images,
is as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Rom. 1. to change
the glory of the incorruptible God into an
Image made like unto corruptible Man,</hi>
and to Birds.</p>
            <p>8. The Church of <hi>England</hi> does also
justly condemn the Invocation of Saints
by mental and vocal Prayers, as the
<hi>Trent</hi> Council enjoyns. This Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Learned Papists, hath neither
Precept nor Example in Scripture to
warrant it, and consequently it cannot
be built upon the foundation of the Text,
i. e. <hi>the foundation of Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
The Temple of old was called
<hi>the house of Prayer,</hi> to denote that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Prayer is a principal part of the
Worship of God; and does not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
say expresly, <hi>Thou shalt worship
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve?</hi> To hear mental Prayers belongs
only to God, <hi>who alone trieth the reins
and searcheth the heart;</hi> and therefore to
make such Prayers unto Creatures, is to
make them more than Creatures. The
Saints must be Omnipresent, if they can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96891:157"/>
hear all their Votaries, who pray to them
in all quarters of the Earth: Now Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence
is an Attribute which belongs
to the Divine Essence. <hi>Thou art a God
that heareth Prayers,</hi> saith the Psalmist,
and therefore <hi>unto thee shall all flesh come.</hi>
We are told in Scripture that <hi>there is but
one Mediator between God and Man, the
Man Christ Iesus;</hi> and since he is most
willing and <hi>able to save them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
who come unto God by him,</hi> we do
not use the Intercessions of the Saints,
for fear we should injure the merits of
that All-sufficient Mediatour, <hi>who ever
liveth to make intercession for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these few Instances which I have
given, and I might have given you
many more, it cannot but be evident to
all serious unprejudiced persons, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> keeps close to the
Rule of the Scripture, and like the
Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in the Text, <hi>is built
upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets.</hi> And because the Testimony
of an Adversary has always been
thought considerable, I shall conclude
this head with the Testimony of Pope
<hi>Paul</hi> IV. who, as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96891:158"/>
made this offer to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
that if she would but own his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
he would confirm our way of
serving God in all things appertaining
to his Worship in the very same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as we now do. Sure this Holy
Father would never have confirmed
the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
had he not thought it consonant to the
Doctrine of the Apostles. But since he
was pleased to offer his Confirmation,
we will requite his kindness by valuing
our Church the more upon his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus I have dispatcht the Three
Generals I proposed. I have shewn you,
That the Doctrine of the Apostles and
Prophets is the only Foundation upon
which the True Church is built; That
this Doctrine of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
is sufficiently delivered to us in
the Holy Scripture, and that the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> like that of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in
the Text, is built upon this and no
other foundation.</p>
            <p>I shall now in the close, leave a
word or two of Exhortation with you,
and beseech you to continue stedfast
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96891:158"/>
in the Communion of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> It is the chief design of St.
<hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle, to keep the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
stedfast in the Faith of Christ:
He <hi>desires them</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>not to faint;</hi>
and <hi>bows his knees to the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> that he
would strengthen them <hi>by his Spirit
in the inner Man;</hi> He bids them
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. have a care they were <hi>no more
Children tossed to and fro with every
wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of men,
and cunning craftiness whereby they lye
in wait to deceive.</hi> As he would not
have them scared out of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by fear of Persecution; so neither
would he have them gull'd of it by
the sleights and subtleties of false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.
It is therefore our duty, when
we have found the True Church, to
continue stedfast in the Communion
of it. We must resemble those best
of Christians, of whom it is said, <hi>Acts
2. 42. That they continued stedfast in
the Apostles Doctrine and fellowship:</hi>
But alas! how apt are men to barter
away Religion for some worldly emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument?
How many are there who
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96891:159"/>
carry their Religion in their Pockets,
and stick not with <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray
their Master for Thirty pieces of
Silver; unless perhaps their Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be greater, and a larger sum be
requisite to patch up their broken For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
If <hi>Naamans</hi> Preferment be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with his Religion, you must
allow him a dispensation, and permit
him to bow in the House of <hi>Rimmon:</hi>
and to name no more, rather than
<hi>Pilate</hi> will hazard the loss of <hi>Caesars</hi>
favour, he will pronounce our Saviour
innocent one hour, and condemn him
the next. Thus Christ is made to
truckle under the World, and Gain
will be Godliness in spight of the
Bible. But those that are sober and
serious in the World, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
such Texts of Scripture as
these, <hi>Prove all things, hold fast that
which is good.</hi> 1. Thess. 5. 21. Take
heed, <hi>lest ye being led away with the error
of the wicked, fall from your own stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
2. Pet. 3. 17. Nay St. <hi>Iude</hi> carries
the duty one step higher, and tells us
we must <hi>contend earnestly for the Faith
which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:96891:159"/>
Ministers must contend by their Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and Pens; Magistrates and Gentry
by their Power, Interest and Authority;
and private Christians by their Prayers
and open Profession of it. And if St.
<hi>Iude</hi> would have the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
not barely own, but even <hi>contend,</hi>
and that <hi>earnestly for the faith,</hi> when
they groaned under the heavy Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Pagan Emperours; sure we
have little reason to be afraid to do so,
who live under the Protection of a most
gracious King.</p>
            <p>And since these things are so, I hope,
I shall need no more than these two
Motives to back the Exhortation, and
to enforce the Duty.</p>
            <p>1. Let us consider, The great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of such as continue stedfast in the
Faith of Christ, and Doctrine of the
Apostles.</p>
            <p>2. The lamentable condition of those
that shall dare to disown it.</p>
            <p>1. Let us consider the great Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such as continue stedfast in the
Faith of Christ and Doctrine of the
Apostles. As the Church of Christ is
that Golden Candlestick which holds
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96891:160"/>
forth the light of the Gospel, so it is
the Treasurer of all the Riches of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for to it belong the Adoption
and the Glory; to it appertain the
Covenants, the Service of God, and
all the Promises. Here we may enjoy
all the Ordinances of God, and <hi>satisfie
our Souls with the marrow and fatness</hi>
of his Sanctuary. Yea, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our Apostle in the Verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Text, every Christian does now
<hi>grow into an holy Temple in the Lord,</hi> he
becomes an habitation where God
vouchsafes to dwell, and manifest his
special Presence by the saving Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Holy Spirit. Happy Souls!
who have the Honour and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to lodge and entertain their God!
What Joys and Comforts will now
crowd into the Soul, and attend this
glorious Guest! And yet all this is only
a preparatory for much greater Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
For these happy Believers, as
our Apostle speaks, are now become
<hi>fellow citizens with the Saints;</hi> such are
here <hi>of the houshold of God;</hi> and if they
make a just improvement of that Grace
which is afforded them, they shall
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96891:160"/>
hereafter be admitted into the Society
and Fellowship of Saints and Angels.
And what Tongue is able to express this
Happiness! How great an Honour,
how great a Priviledge was it thought
of Old to be a free Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and to have a right to all the Offices
and Franchises of that Imperial City?
So highly valuable was this Freedom,
that the chief Captain in the <hi>Acts</hi> tells
us, he did not obtain it but with a
great sum of Mony. To these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
S. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, when he tells
the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and in them all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
that if they are <hi>of the houshold
of God, and built upon the foundation
of the Apostles and Prophets,</hi> then they
are <hi>fellow citizens with the Saints,</hi> that
is, Denizons of Heaven, and free of
that City, which is above, even the
heavenly <hi>Ierusalem. Glorious things
are spoken of thee, O thou City of
God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb. 12. That
here dwell an innumerable company of
glorious Angels, the general Assembly
of the First-born,</hi> That is, the Holy
Apostles the First-born of the Gospel,
<hi>the Spirits</hi> of Prophets, Martyrs,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96891:161"/>
Confessors, and all those <hi>just men</hi> that
are already <hi>made perfect.</hi> Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet, here God the Judge of all
vouchsales his glorious Presence, and
Jesus the Mediatour of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
appears in all his Glory. To
be Citizens therefore of this Heavenly
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is to enjoy the most ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Society of Saints and Angels, to
be admitted to the Beatifick Vision
of God himself, and to live for ever in
Paradise with the Holy Jesus. It is to
lye with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom,
feeding continually on the feast of
the Lamb, and drinking of those
<hi>Rivers of pleasures,</hi> which ran <hi>at Gods
right hand for evermore.</hi> This one
would think should be argument
enough to make us <hi>hold fast the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith stedfast unto the end.</hi>
But if all this will not prevail with
us, I know nothing that can, unless
it be what I proposed to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2d.</hi> place, Namely the Lamentable
condition of those who dare disown
and deny the Truths of the Gospel.
And I cannot give you a truer pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:96891:161"/>
of their sad condition than in
the words of our Saviour. <hi>Mat. 10.
33. Whosoever shall deny me</hi> or be
ashamed of my words, <hi>before men,
him will I deny before my Father and
his holy Angels.</hi> How many Woes
are crowded into this one sentence,
<hi>I will deny him?</hi> It is, to say no
more, a compendious expression of
Hell, an Eternity of torments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in a word. Oh the ineffable
horror that will seize the poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when he stands arraign'd before
the Tribunal of Heaven! When at
the great Assize, at the last day, he
shall see his very Advocate become
his Accufer, and hear his Sentence
pronounced by his merciful Saviour;
the very hearing of it will be a
kind of Hell, and the Promulgation
of the Punishment anticipate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
            <p>And now, if I could give you a
lively representation of the guilt and
horror on the one hand, and paint
out eternal Wrath and Vengeance on
the other; I might then hope to
shew you the condition of such a
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96891:162"/>
Sinner, as shall be thus disowned
and denied by his Saviour. But
alas! this is not all; we shall find
more ingredients of horror in this
Condemnation, if we consider that
Christ threatens to deny such a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before his Father and the Holy
Angels.</p>
            <p>If there could be any room for
comfort after the Sentence of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it would be this, of being
executed in secret: But it seems the
Sinners folly must be laid open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and his Holy Angels, and
all his baseness ript up before the
whole World. Christ will now in
the presence of God the Father, of
Men and of Angels, compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
who was denied, and the Cause
for which he was denied together;
he will now parallel his infinite
Merits with a Lust, and lay Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the ballance with a Trifle;
he will now propose that worthy
price for which he was denied, he
will hold it up to open view; he
will call upon Men and Angels,
saying, Behold that piece of dirt, that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96891:162"/>
windy applause, that corruptible dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that poor transitory satisfaction,
for which I was dishonoured, and
my Truths disowned; for which
Life, Eternity and God himself was
scorned, yea trampled on by this
vile wretched Sinner. Judge all the
World, whether what he despised
in the other Life, he deserves to
enjoy in this. How will the vile
wretched Sinner then crawl forth,
and appear in all his filth? He
will then call in vain upon the
Mountains to cover him, and the
Rocks to hide him.</p>
