         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Certainly did Men but look to the Emergent Providences of God, towards His Preſent Majeſty from his very Infancy; they may eaſily ſee that he is the Darling of Heaven and deſign'd by God to do Eminent Service; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all the Plots and Contrivances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Wit and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Policy of Mankind can form againſt him, will be brought to naught; for as when he was but a Child, he was by a Potent Faction, in a manner, turn'd out of all that ever he had a right to, from his Noble Progenitors, ſo he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly reſtored to all, nay, to a greater Power than they enjoyed, and the Miſcreants that Injured him, brought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment. When he expoſed himſelf <hi>(Codrus</hi> like) to many Dangers, for the Safety, and Liberty of his Country; which otherwiſe had undoubtedly been at this day Groaning under <hi>French Slavery,</hi> it pleaſed God many times to preſerve him, and by him his Country. And no leſs Stupendious was the Providence that attended his Expedition hither, when he came to Reſcue us ſrom the Jaws of Death, and to deliver us from the Antichriſtian, Aegyptian Darkneſs, which overſpread our Horizon; and how it hath pleas'd God ever ſince to defeat the Attempts of many Wicked and unreaſonable Men. Nay, What conſidering Man does not ſee the great deſign of God in it? That Foundations are thereby laid for a beautiful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Peace and Truth: While it has pleas'd God to ſet forth in their own Colours, a Party of Men, who how ſtrong retences ſoever they have made to Loyalty and Peaceableneſs beyond all others, have been really our Incendiaries all along, and have had a hand in all the Callamities that have befallen us; they all along diging their Councils deep as Hell, and what by Violence, Importunity, and Brazenfacedneſs, ſticking at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may carry on their Deſigns. And when they have done all, like that Impudent Harlot in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> they can wipe their Mouth, and ſay, they are Innocent.</p>
