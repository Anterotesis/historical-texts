            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Raiſe</hi> is the end of all Arts, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Praiſe is onely in Eminence, which begets Example and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Seeing then (great

Prince) your Birth giues you the beſt priuiledge to expreſſe the worthineſſe of Vertue, I ſee not but her followers, eyther in Art or Action, ſhould neceſſarily flie to your High Patronage. This conſideration makes my low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts looke vpward, which in this at leaſt will merit your view, that the Science of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> not vnworthily ſtiled No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (if eyther truely practiſed, or rightly vnderſtood) was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before in our Language brought to any Method. The Profeſſors thereof being ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that they could rather doe, then make demonſtration,
<pb facs="tcp:22759:3"/>
or reduce their doing to any certaintie of principle.</p>
            <p>Many are the imputations laid vpon this Art, (for ſuch I dare now affirme it) the chiefe whereof is, the increaſing our bloudy and irreligious Duels, which if the name of this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being called of <hi>Defence,</hi> will not auoyd, yet the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious age of the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſhall ſufficiently cleare: No Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of thoſe times making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Duello or ſingle fight to the loſſe of any Noble Perſon in that State, or diſreputation of the publique Iuſtice. Yet that this kinde of battell was knowne
<pb facs="tcp:22759:4"/>
and in ſome caſes approued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Romanes.</hi> The <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perduels</hi> betweene the <hi>Curatij</hi> and the <hi>Horatij,</hi> and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Duell</hi> betweene <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and the French-man, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly ſpeake.</p>
            <p>It is not then the publique profeſsion of this Science, nor the multiplicitie of Profeſſors that increaſe theſe deſperate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſsinations: for, Knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Wiſedome, and Wiſedome by how much it participates of skill with Diſcretion, miſdoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame in another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes ſafety as the ſumme of her abilitie. This is manifeſt
<pb facs="tcp:22759:4"/>
in the <hi>Italians,</hi> the firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Foyle-weapon, and the cunningst Practiſers, where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats are rather reported then ſeene; and yet in ruder Countries as <hi>Poland, &amp;c.</hi> nothing more common; which I impute wholy to a daring Ignorance. Neyther had this knowledge of <hi>Defence,</hi> if iuſtly taxt with any ſo wicked effects, been graced with ſo many Authentick priuiledges in all well gouerned States, nor the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof had receiued ſuch honor and reſpect, inſomuch that amongst the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſome of them had their Statues erected,
<pb facs="tcp:22759:5"/>
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witneſſeth. Theſe Reaſons (if my iudgement faile not) forcing the ſame.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Neceſſitie at home,</hi> as a Remedie to an vnauoyded Diſeaſe, in oppoſing ſodaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, which from <hi>Caine,</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Antiquitie, will not now loſe their plantation. And ſince Innocence is no protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt murtherous intents, God and Nature tollerate this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Publique good abroad,</hi> for auoyding bloud, if the ſtate of a War ſhould require a ſingle Tryall, which howſoeuer was preſumption in <hi>Goliah,</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:22759:5"/>

The Schoole of our priuate Practiſe being the ſame to the Battell, that the Muze is to the Troope: for with what confidence ſhall hee goe on vpon many, that hath no knowledge to giue him hope of ſafety from one.</p>

Hee that is the moſt obſtinate enemie to himſelfe, in reiecting the benefit of
<pb facs="tcp:22759:8"/>
skill, muſt needes confeſſe it no vaine Exerciſe, if the aptneſſe and facilitie be onely thought on, to which the actiue practiſe of it brings the body, and enables it for enduring in fight. But to the point of materiall vſe.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch mens vnderſtandings I would know how comes it (then) that an ignorant handler of a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon meeting vvith an ordinarie Profeſſor of <hi>Defence</hi> at <hi>Foyles,</hi> can neyther certainely giue offence, nor auoid it.</p>
               <p>They will anſwere mee, that at blunt, a man comes boldly on, and is not troubled with any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, as at ſharpe muſt of neceſſitie diſorder his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and put him out of fight.</p>
               <p>To that, thus; All rules (indeed) muſt admit ſome exceptions: heat or cold may ſome-what diſtract a
<pb facs="tcp:22759:8"/>
fighter; heate in caſting him too forwardly vpon a danger: cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in not preparing him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an aduantage of offence, yet theſe come neuer wholy to preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the vſe of skill: for, ſpeaking of ſuch an heate as alwayes fals vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this perill; wee muſt not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to be ſimply that heat need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully belonging to courage; for then it is an orderly Vertue, and loſeth no ſtrength eyther borne with it, or taught it; but it muſt be forced vp into much anger (which ſeldome happens in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, for whoſe cauſe onely wee profeſſe teaching) before it can turne a man into that weakneſſe. Where it doth happen, it is a kinde of madneſſe, which (for the time) loſeth all reaſon, as much as that part of skill: and ſhall good aduice be altogether neglected becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:22759:9"/>
a madde man is vncapable of it?</p>
               <p>Then touching Coldnes, though it be brought downe into the very baſeneſſe of Feare in one, yet it is impoſſible to make Skill vtterly of no vſe to him. For the geſture of the body vpon ſuch a danger, will naturally fall into thoſe motions that it hath got by practiſe.</p>
               <p>So that skill to euery reaſonable man is ſomething a friend. But when it is entertained by one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of a good temper, it can by no meanes fall vnder any of their Obiections that diſpiſe it; for ſuch a man brings no more fury, nor leſſe aſſurance with him into the Field, then the Schoole, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will haue as much aduantage of an ignorant man in fight, as there is difference betweene them in practiſe.</p>
               <p>To exemplifie this, you may
<pb facs="tcp:22759:9"/>
read of one <hi>Coranſo,</hi> a Noble man, who from two and twenty <hi>Duelloes</hi> returned Conquerour: Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the reaſon by ſome that conſidered the equalitie of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries in ſhew, and the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine chances of the field: hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Strength, Length, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Temper and Cunning. So he concluded Nature in Art, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the managing of thoſe parts hee was borne with, to the abilitie of thoſe hee was taught.</p>
               <p>Since therefore that the Science of <hi>Defence</hi> is vnderſtood to be a profeſſion of vſe, it followes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the defects of Teachers, and to reſolue vpon the worth of the knowledge: which followes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after our Definition.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:22759:22"/>
againſt this vnequall oppoſition (as in the Chapter before preſcribed) he ſhall finde himſelfe enabled not onely for defence in this extremity, but alſo may offend his aduerſarie, as I haue ſeene vpon the publique Stage, a ſingle Rapier moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully foyle both Halberd and halfe Pike. To adde to this ſupply of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I would haue a man wanting one hand, or one eye, by practiſe, to helpe his imperfection: or being lame in both armes, with his feete and ſhift of body, to cleare that defect (all cunning in this Art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting more in feete then hands.) Further, ſhould one be lame in feet hauing eyes and armes, I would haue him practiſe thoſe Weapons and Guards may beſt perfect his condition, being neyther able to purſue nor retyre.

                     <p>Why ſhould ſo few of our Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ariue to this knowledge, or to no more height of doing, then this diſcouery of their defects hath manifeſted?</p>

knowledge vnto rule, in ſmall time out-goes his Teacher hauing both Hands, Art and Nature, his Schoole-maſter wanting one, and many times both of them.
