            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In ſucceeding ages the devil hath often plaid over the <hi>old game;</hi> ſometimes oppreſſing the Church by the <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> of <hi>pſeudo-chriſtians,</hi> as many Martyrs being made by <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> as <hi>Pagan, perſecutions,</hi> Revel. 14. 13. at other times <hi>corrupting the trueth</hi> by <hi>error,</hi>

or <hi>rendring it ſuſpitious</hi> by the <hi>diviſions</hi> about it: <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies</hi> revolve as <hi>faſhions,</hi> and in the courſe of a few years, <hi>antiquated errors</hi> revive again, and that by their means who did not ſo much as know them by name.</p>
            <p>When God firſt called his people out of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Luthers reformation,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian religion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be reſtored to its <hi>priſtine purity,</hi> there was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Roman party</hi> to <hi>perſecute,</hi> but a <hi>fanatical party</hi> to <hi>perplex</hi> the eſtate of reformation, and retard the courſe of the Goſpel, as hiſtories do abundantly declare, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Sleidan</hi> in his Commentaries.</p>
            <p>What hath been our <hi>late experience,</hi> we all know, and have cauſe to bewail, aſſoon as wee were freed from our <hi>hard task-maſters,</hi> and a <hi>door of hope</hi> began to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ſwarm of libertines</hi> have ariſen among us, and do every day increaſe in <hi>number, power</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and under <hi>various forms</hi> oppugn the unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable intereſts of Ieſus Chriſt, to the great <hi>ſcandal of reformation</hi> and the ſadning of the hearts of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We ſeem to be <hi>ripe for a judgment,</hi> but from what corner the ſtorm ſhall blow we cannot tell; ſome fear a <hi>return of Popery,</hi> and that a <hi>ſecond deluge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſme</hi> ſhall overwhelm the <hi>Weſtern Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (I confeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are <hi>dangerous,</hi> but the <hi>great</hi> and next <hi>fear</hi> I think to be from <hi>libertines</hi> and a <hi>yokeleſs</hi> generation of men who are most <hi>reproachful</hi> to religion and most <hi>troubleſom.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>drift</hi> of this Epiſtle is carried out mainly againſt this <hi>fanatical</hi> and <hi>libertine party;</hi> and therefore I ſuppoſe it to be a miſtake in Dr <hi>Willet,</hi> Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> and others, when they would turn the edg of it againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I confeſs they had a temptation that

If the <hi>Judicious Reader</hi> let alone the larger diſcuſſion of the obſervations, and go but over the explications of each verſe, hee will ſoon finde my obſervation true.</p>
            <p>What I have done, through grace, to the <hi>clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> of the Apoſtles <hi>ſcope,</hi> and the <hi>larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation</hi> of the <hi>common places</hi> here offered, I ſhall not mention, but leave to the Readers judgment: ſome will blame mee for being <hi>too large,</hi> and others in many places for being <hi>too ſhort;</hi> I ſhall only let the firſt ſort know, that in the <hi>larger explications</hi> of points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I have rather ſatisfied the <hi>deſires of others,</hi> than followed my <hi>own judgment;</hi> who, when theſe things were <hi>firſt delivered</hi> (which was long ſince) in the way of <hi>ſhort notes,</hi> were willing to hear the <hi>points</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115193:8"/>
more largely debated, and ſo I went over them again in a <hi>Sermon-faſhion:</hi> if any blame mee for being <hi>too ſhort,</hi> let them know, that therein I have more ſatisfied my ſelf, as keeping to the Laws of an <hi>expoſitory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</hi> I confeſs I am ſo conſcious to the many imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this work, that the Reader had never been troubled with it, had it not been extorted from mee by ſuch importunity as I could not withſtand: eſpecially did I judg the publication needleſs, the <hi>Elaborate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi> of my Reverend Brother Mr <hi>William Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns</hi> being already printed; but when I ſaw that wee went different waies in proſecuting the ſame truth, that objection ceaſed: ſeaſonable things muſt be often urged, and the <hi>variety of method</hi> maketh the repetition gratefull. I obſerve Gods providence in it, when divers men fall upon the ſame work, <hi>that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every truth might be eſtabliſhed. Beza</hi> (I remember) perſwadeth <hi>Olevian</hi> to print his Meditations on the <hi>Galatians,</hi> though many <hi>excellent Writers</hi> had but lately and diligently explained that Epistle: Dr <hi>King,</hi> Dr <hi>Abbot</hi> and Dr <hi>Benefield</hi> all wrote upon <hi>Jonah</hi> and with approbation near about the ſame time. As much as my occaſions would permit me, I conſulted with my Reverend Brothers Book, and when I found any point at large diſcuſſed by him, I either <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> it, or <hi>mentioned it very briefly;</hi> ſo that his Labors will be neceſſary to ſupply the weakneſſes of mine.

the <hi>Saluter,</hi> and the <hi>ſaluted.</hi> 1. The Saluter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by his name, <hi>Judas;</hi> his office and condition of life, <hi>the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> by his kindred and relation, <hi>and Brother of James.</hi> 2.

                  <hi>called,</hi> that is to be read firſt, as <hi>Beza.</hi> 2. By the effects and manifeſtations of it, which are two: 1. <hi>Sanctified by God the Father.</hi> 2. <hi>Preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe are the parts, I ſhall explain them branch by branch in the order propounded, with practical hints from each, which I ſhall handle in no fuller latitude then the preſent Text will allow.</p>
               <p>1. The Saluter, and there his name <hi>Judas,</hi> called alſo <hi>Thaddeus, Mat.</hi> 10. 3. and <hi>Lebbaeus;</hi> theſe ſeveral names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the ſame thing, and were given him either by the <hi>people</hi> or the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> partly to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Judas the Apoſtate,</hi> partly to note his conſtancy in <hi>confeſſing</hi> and <hi>praiſing</hi> God; for ſo it ſignifieth, as you may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 35. <hi>Now Leah ſaid, I will praiſe the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore ſhe called his name Judah.</hi> Divers note hence, 1. <hi>That Chriſtian names ſhould be ſignificant, ſuch as may remember us of duty.</hi> Again,<note place="margin">Obſervations.</note> 2. <hi>That it is lawſul to divulge or conceal our names in our writings, according as it may make for the glory of God, to do either the one or the other. Jude</hi> mentioneth his name, but <hi>Paul</hi> doth not, or whoſoever was the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> 3. <hi>That godly men and wicked may both be called by the ſame name:</hi> So <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate:</hi> There was <hi>Enoch Cains</hi> ſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. and <hi>Enoch Seths</hi> ſon of the Church line, <hi>that walked with God, Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>2. His office and condition, <hi>the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is a thing uſual with the Apoſtles to prefix this among other their honorary titles; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1.

Gods Will and ſecret Counſels, or inſtrumentality in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Decrees: ſo wicked men may be ſaid to be Gods ſervants, ſo far forth as he ſerveth his deſigns of their endeavors: as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was Gods ſervant, becauſe he ſhould perform all his pleaſure: ſo <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Jer.</hi> 27. 6. <hi>Theſe things have I given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> 2. It noteth a pious care to perform Gods revealed Will; they that out of a ſenſe of his love reſign up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do his Will, are called his ſervants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lord, whether he be bond or free, is ſaid to be <hi>Chriſts ſervant,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22.

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115193:12"/>
                  <hi>up your ſelves, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 6. 13. Chriſt loveth to have his right and title eſtabliſhed by our <hi>own conſent.</hi> We take Chriſt for Lord and Maſter, and give up our ſelves to him, that we may be no longer at our own diſpoſe, and therefore it is not only <hi>robbery,</hi> but <hi>treachery</hi> and <hi>breach of Covenant</hi> to ſeek our ſelves in any thing. This reſignation muſt be made out of a ſenſe of Chriſts love to us in his death and ſufferings: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Chriſt dyed, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them:</hi> We enter upon other ſervices <hi>out of hopes,</hi> but we enter upon Chriſts ſervice out of <hi>thankefulneſs.</hi> Again, This reſignation muſt be <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> without reſervation of any part: You muſt have no other Maſter but God; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>Ye cannot ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> Uſually men divide themſelves between God and the world; they would give their <hi>Conſciences</hi> to Chriſt, and their <hi>hearts</hi> to Mammon: The Devil pleadeth for a part, for by that means he knoweth that the whole will fall to his ſhare; therefore all, the <hi>whole man,</hi> in vow, purpoſe and reſolution, muſt be given up to God. 2. Having given up your ſelves to Gods ſervice, you muſt walk as his ſervants, that is, not as you liſt, but as the Maſter pleaſeth: The Angels are Gods Miniſters, <hi>doing his pleaſure, Pſal.</hi> 103. 21. A ſervant hath no will of his own, but hath given up his liberty to the directions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of another; therefore if you be Gods ſervants, you muſt earneſtly deſire the knowledg of his Will, and readily comply with it; you muſt not do things as they pleaſe ſelf and fleſh, but as they pleaſe God: <hi>David</hi> beggeth for knowledg as Gods ſervant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 125. <hi>I am thy ſervant, grant me underſtanding, that I may know thy Teſtimonies.</hi> A faithful ſervant would not willingly offend his Maſter, and therefore would fain know what is his will: They plead with God, and ſearch themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. and all to know his pleaſure; and not only to <hi>know</hi> it, but to <hi>do</hi> it, otherwiſe <hi>they are worthy of many ſtripes</hi> by Chriſts own ſentence: The Maſters will ſhould be motive enough, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. If God will have it ſo, if Jeſus Chriſt will have it ſo, it is enough to a faithful ſervant: The very ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115193:12"/>
of Gods Will carryeth with it reaſon enough to enforce the practiſe of it. Yea you muſt equally comply with every Will of God, not only with the eaſie and pleaſant ways of obedience, but ſuch as croſs luſts and intereſts. When two men go together, a man cannot tell whom the ſervant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth till they part: When God and our luſts or our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts command contrary things, then you are put to the tryal whether you are Gods ſervants.</p>
               <p>Again, Obſerve from the proper acception of the phraſe,<note place="margin">Obſervat. 3.</note> as it is applyed to thoſe that ſtand before the Lord in ſome ſpecial Office and Miniſtration; as to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and by conſequence to the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> The Note is, <hi>That Miniſters are ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt; Paul a ſervant,</hi> and <hi>Jude a ſervant.</hi> We are to deal between God and the Soul, <hi>Factors for Heaven;</hi> there is many a good inference may be collected from this Notion, I ſhall refer all to two heads, the <hi>Ministers</hi> Duty and the <hi>Peoples.</hi> 1. It hinteth Duty to <hi>Ministers,</hi> it teacheth us <hi>diligence</hi> in our Lords work, for we are Servants, and muſt <hi>give an account, Heb.</hi> 13. 17. what good we have done in our places, how we have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed our parts, improved our Intereſts, for his glory. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 19. <hi>After a long time the Lord of thoſe ſervants cometh and reckoneth with them.</hi> We are entruſted with the talent of gifts, with the talent of office and authority in the Church; now God will ſee what we have done for his Glory, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have <hi>beaten our fellow ſervants,</hi> or helped them in the way of Salvation; whether <hi>our pound</hi> hath been hidden in a napkin, or layd out for the gain of Souls. Again, it hinteth <hi>faithfulneſs:</hi> We are not to trade for our ſelves, and to drive on our own deſigns of credit and advantage; we are ſervants, employed for the Maſters uſes: <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Do I yet pleaſe men? If I pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt.</hi> A man that ſets up for himſelf, is to trade for himſelf; but all that a ſervant doth, ſhould be for his Maſters honour and profit. 2. It hinteth duty to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Regard Miniſters <hi>as ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> that you may give their perſons all due honour; conſider, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them as for a nearer ſervice to himſelf: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.

                  <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of the Gospel.</hi> The world counteth the Calling <hi>probroſum artificium,</hi> a ſordid artifice and way of living, whereby men ſet their tongues and parts to ſale, and think that of all Callings this can beſt be ſpared; therefore it is high time to aſſert the dignity of the Office: Men ſhould not think ſo baſely of thoſe who are Chriſts ſervants, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do his buſineſs, but to wait upon his perſon, his ſpecial <hi>Attendants;</hi> nay <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5 20.</note>

                  <hi>and exceptions againſt our perſons.</hi> I obſerve this, becauſe the Scripture doth elſewhere, <hi>Joh. 14. 22. Judas ſaith unto him, not Iſcariot, How is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world?</hi> The Scripture would not have you miſtake him that ſaid ſo: Men drink leſs freely of a ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fountain. Partly becauſe this would make the Epiſtle the more welcome: <hi>James</hi> was of great credit and repute, reckoned by <hi>Paul</hi> among <hi>the Pillars, Gal.</hi> 2. 9. From whence obſerve, 1. <hi>That it is lawful to uſe the credit of others for the</hi>

                  <hi>advantage of the Truth.</hi> In the 15 of the <hi>Acts</hi> the Apoſtles might have determined the caſe by their own infallible ſpirit; but for the greater credit ſake they take in the conſent of others, verſ. 23. <hi>The Apoſtles, and Elders, and Brethren, &amp;c.

                  <hi>honour to our relations.</hi> This is one of <hi>Judes</hi> titles, <hi>the Brother of James;</hi> He took it for an honour to be related to ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent an Apoſtle: Worthy men reflect a credit upon their families: To be <hi>brother, father, ſon,</hi> to ſuch as have deſerved well of the Church, is no mean honour and engagement to virtue. Well then, live ſo that you may not diſgrace your lineage; and you that come of worthy Anceſtors, walk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to the dignity of your extraction: The images of your Progenitors are not more fullied with duſt, and ſmoak, and age, then they are with your vices: The Spirit of God brands a degenerate Iſſue for walking unworthy their birth, and the priviledges of their blood, 1 <hi>Chron. 4. 22, 23.

But there is an <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>effectual calling,</hi> by the perſwaſion of the Spirit, or <hi>the voyce of the Son of God,</hi> which cauſeth <hi>life, Joh.</hi> 5. 25. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of the <hi>called according to Purpoſe,</hi> and that by an inward and effectual calling: Whence note, <hi>That it is the condition of the people of God to be a called people;</hi> this is<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> firſt in their deſcription: ſee <hi>Rom. 1. 6. Among whom are ye alſo the called of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Saints by calling, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. and <hi>Heb. 3. 1. Holy Brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling.</hi> Now the Saints are a call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, firſt, Becauſe all they have and enjoy is from Gods<note place="margin">1 Reaſon.</note> calling; a Chriſtian is nothing and hath nothing but what God is pleaſed to work in him by his creating Word: <hi>Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things that are not as though they were, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. Now God is pleaſed to work this way, partly <hi>to give us a Warrant,</hi> that we may poſſeſs our priviledges in Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intruſion and uſurpation: <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>No man taketh this honour upon him till he be called of God;</hi> This is that we have to ſhew to Conſcience, that we do not preſume and uſurp; we have <hi>a calling</hi> ſo to do: Why doſt thou vile wretch go to God in the Name of Chriſt? How durſt thou that art a ſinner look him in the face? lay hold of Chriſt? hope for glory? Still the Call is our Warrant and Title.

So in <hi>Mat. 20. Why do not you go into the Vineyard?</hi> their anſwer was, <hi>No man hath hired us;</hi> they had no calling.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115193:14"/>
God is forced to call and hollow after us. By nature we are not only <hi>exiles,</hi> but <hi>fugitives:</hi> Before God baniſhed <hi>Adam,</hi> he firſt ran away from him, he ran to the buſhes, and then God called him, <hi>Adam, where art thou? Gen.</hi> 3. 9. How often doth God hollow after us in the Word before we return, and come out of the buſhes? He maketh proclamation, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Ho every one that thirſteth, &amp;c.</hi> We are under ſpiritual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Egypt</hi> under corporal bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and God ſendeth again and again, and out of very anguiſh of heart we will not beleeve him; therefore he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and cryeth, Sinners, where are you? why will you not return unto me? Gods outward Call is managed by men, and therefore it is very hard to perſwade them to diſcern the voyce of God; as <hi>Samuel</hi> would not be perſwaded but that it was <hi>Eli</hi> called him when it was <hi>the Lord:</hi> We think it to be the charity of the Miniſter, and will not eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg a call from God, and therefore do not only need <hi>leave,</hi> but <hi>encouragement.</hi> Partly becauſe God will work in a way ſuitable to his own nature and ours; <hi>fortiter &amp; ſuaviter, ſtrongly</hi> like himſelf, and <hi>ſweetly</hi> with reſpect to us; and therefore he doth not only <hi>draw,</hi> but <hi>call;</hi> not only put forth the power of his Spirit, but exhort and invite by the Word; the efficacy of divine grace is conveyed this way more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the nature of man; There is grace <hi>offered</hi> in the Goſpel, and the Spirit <hi>compelleth</hi> to come in. In all the Works of God, there is ſome word by which his Power is educed and exerciſed: In the Creation, <hi>Let there be light, &amp;c.</hi> At the Reſurrection there is <hi>a Trump,</hi> and the voyce of an Archangel, <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to Judgment.</hi> In all Chriſts miraculous cures there are ſome words uſed, <hi>Be thou clean,</hi> and <hi>Be thou whole,</hi> and <hi>Be thou opened;</hi> and to <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the grave Chriſt uſeth words of <hi>miniſterial excitation, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, come forth:</hi> So in converting a ſinner, there is not only a <hi>ſecret power,</hi> but a <hi>ſweet call</hi> and <hi>invitation;</hi> ſome word by which this power is conveyed and repreſented in a way ſuitable to our capacity. For all theſe Reaſons doth God work grace by calling.</p>
               <p>Again, Gods people are well ſtiled a called people, becauſe<note place="margin">2 Reaſon.</note>

Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden:</hi> The main end of a call is to bring Chriſt and the Soul together; every diſpenſation of God hath a voyce; and God ſpeaketh to us by Conſcience, by his Works, by benefits, by croſſes, but chiefly by <hi>his Word,</hi> the application of which by the Spirit is as it were an <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening call:</hi> but the chief call of God is by the <hi>voyce of the Gospel,</hi> wherein the offers of grace are diſcovered to us; <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God, which ariſeth meerly from his choyce, preventing and anteceding not only the <hi>merit,</hi> but the <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> of the creature: ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.

Once more, here we have the cleareſt and moſt ſenſible experience of the work of grace: After converſion the work may be carryed on <hi>tacitly,</hi> and with more ſilence; but in calling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion (as in all changes) the operations of grace are more ſenſible; we may grow inſenſible, as a plant doth: The ſtep <hi>from ſin to grace,</hi> is a work of greater difficulty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then to go on <hi>from grace to grace;</hi> as the Apoſtle maketh it a matter of more eaſe to <hi>ſave a Saint,</hi> then to <hi>gain a ſinner, Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10. and therefore <hi>degrees</hi> cannot be alike ſenſible as <hi>change of ſtate.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 9. Ye know what manner of entring we had unto you.</hi> The firſt approaches of Gods Power and Word to the Soul, as they meet with more oppoſition, ſo they cannot but be more ſenſible, and leave a greater feeling upon us: It were ſtrange if an <hi>Almighty Power</hi> ſhould work in us, and we no way privy or conſcious to it, and all done as in our ſleep; to think ſo, were to give ſecurity a ſoft pillow whereon to reſt, and to ſuffer men to go away with golden dreams, though they feel no change in themſelves, pleaſing themſelves with the ſuppoſition of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary grace wrought without their privity and knowledg. I would not preſs too hard upon any tender Conſcience; I do foreſee the Objection that may be made, namely, That if Calling giveth ſuch a ſenſible experience of the work of grace, how cometh it then to paſs that ſo few of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have aſſurance or any ſenſe of their converſion? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. It is poſſible Gods Power may work in us, and we not be ſenſible of it; there is a difference between our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward ſenſes: we may loſe our <hi>ſpiritual feeling;</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115193:17"/>
and <hi>inward ſenſe</hi> doth not ſo clearly diſcern its object, becauſe of the way in which God conveyeth his power; it is <hi>ſtrong,</hi> but <hi>ſweet;</hi> like the influences of the Heavens, of a great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, but ſcarce diſcerned: as there was a <hi>great power</hi> wrought in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> but they did not diſcern it ſo ſufficiently, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18, 19. 2. It is the fault of Gods children not to be ſenſible of the power that worketh in them; ſometimes it is their <hi>careleſſneſs,</hi> ſometimes their <hi>peeviſhneſs:</hi> Their careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in not obſerving the approaches of God, and how he worketh and breaketh in upon their hearts in the Word; ſo that <hi>the time of loves</hi> is not <hi>marked</hi> when it is preſent, nor <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered</hi> when it is paſt. As God ſaid of <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ. 11. 3. When Ephraim was a child, I taught him to go, taking them by the arms, but they knew it not,</hi> that is, did not obſerve it: So God communicateth grace to his people, giveth in help and ſupports, but they obſerve it not. Sometimes it is <hi>peeviſhneſs</hi> and perverſeneſs of judgment; ſenſe of ſin, and many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, like a thick cloud, hinder their clear diſcerning; God hath called them, but they will not own and acknowledg it, and ſo underrate their ſpiritual condition. 3. God doth not call every one in a like violent and ſenſible manner: ſome mens converſion is more <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>ſilent;</hi> whereas to others Chriſt cometh like a ſtrong man armed, and ſnatcheth them out of the fire: ſome are drawn they know not how, and love by a gentle blaſt ſweetly and ſoftly bloweth open the door; <hi>Ere ever I was aware, &amp;c.

As in the natural birth, ſome children are brought forth with more eaſe, others with greater pains and throws: ſo the new birth in ſome is without trouble and delay; <hi>God opened the heart of Lydia,</hi> we read of no more, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. but others are brought in with more horror of Conſcience, extream ſorrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation; God biddeth men <hi>put a difference, Jude</hi> 22, 23. ſo doth God himſelf. 4. This different diſpenſation God uſeth according to his own pleaſure; no certain Rules can be given: Sometimes they that have had <hi>good education</hi> have <hi>leaſt terrors,</hi> as being reſtrained from groſs ſins; ſometimes

Thus you ſee no certain Rules can be given; only in the general we may obſerve, That this different diſpenſation maketh the work of God in calling more or leſs ſenſible: thoſe that are brought in by the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way</hi> and <hi>roughly,</hi> muſt needs be ſenſible of that omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent pull by which their hearts are divorced from their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and can diſcourſe of the time, the means, and the manner, and all the circumſtances of their calling with exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 12. 2. I knew a man in Chriſt fourteen years ago, &amp;c.</hi> Now every one cannot deliver a formal ſtory, nor tell you the exact method and ſucceſſive operations of grace in converſion. 5. Though there be a <hi>different diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> uſed in calling, yet there is enough to diſtinguiſh the <hi>uncalled</hi> from the <hi>called;</hi> Partly becauſe though Gods call be not diſcerned in the <hi>acts</hi> of it, yet it may be diſcerned in the <hi>effects</hi> of it: Converſion is evident, if not in <hi>feeling,</hi> yet in <hi>fruit:</hi> Many works of Nature are for the <hi>convoy</hi> of them inſenſible, but the <hi>effects</hi> appear: <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 5.

                     </gap>w ſee:</hi> Early or late the Soul will give this teſtimony, <hi>How I got him I cannot tell, but I am glad I find he is here.</hi> Partly becauſe where converſion and calling is carryed on more tacitly or ſilently, there will be ſomething felt and found in them; there is at leaſt an <hi>anxiouſneſs about their everlaſting eſtate:</hi> Every Soul doth not walk <hi>in the region of the ſhadow of death;</hi> but every Soul firſt or laſt is brought to <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> which is uſually upon ſome ſecret or open ſin into which God ſuffereth them to fall againſt Conſcience: there will be <hi>care,</hi> though not <hi>horror;</hi> and <hi>ſolicitouſneſs,</hi> though not <hi>utter despair:</hi> No Soul ever came to Chriſt without a load upon his back, though every one be not ready with the Jaylor to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for anguiſh: You will be at a loſs ſometimes; it is <hi>eaſie ſecurity</hi> that goeth on from the <hi>cradle</hi> to the <hi>grave</hi> in the ſame tenor of hope without variation.

Partly becauſe there is a <hi>conſtant calling,</hi> ſo that firſt or laſt we ſhall be ſenſible of the <hi>motions of the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>hearts anſwer:</hi> to ſome God ſpeaketh <hi>in thunder,</hi> to others in <hi>a ſtill voyce,</hi> but to all he ſpeaketh; therefore did you ever diſcern Gods calling and your anſwering? <hi>Pſal. 27. 8. The Lord ſaid, Seek ye my face; my heart ſaid, Thy face Lord will I ſeek:</hi> There is no gracious heart but they are often ſenſible of ſuch <hi>a dialogue</hi> between God and the Soul; this diſcourſe is conſtant: he ſpeaketh to us by the <hi>injection</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115193:19"/>
                  <hi>of holy motions</hi> and the <hi>actual excitations of his grace,</hi> and we ſpeak to him by <hi>ſerious promiſes</hi> and <hi>reſolutions of obedience:</hi> God calleth us into his preſence often, and the heart eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Lo I come.</hi>

               <p>Well now, upon all theſe Conſiderations labour to get <hi>your calling</hi> evidenced, that will clear up your title to the great priviledges of grace; by it you may rebuke your doubts and fears: When Conſcience asketh, What have you to do with theſe comforts? to look upon your ſelves as objects of Gods Election? as heirs of Glory? you may anſwer, <hi>I did not take this honour upon me, I was called of God.</hi> But you will ſay, What are the infallible Notes and Marks of effectual calling?

               <p>2. Again, The next Note or occaſion of diſcovery may be taken from the <hi>inſtrument</hi> or <hi>means</hi> by which God hath called us, namely the Word; 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 14.

                  </hi> that God might more freely talk with him, <hi>Ezek. 3. 22. Ariſe, go forth into the plain, that there I may talk with thee:</hi> So <hi>Cant. 7. 11. Come my Beloved, let us go forth into the fields, &amp;c.</hi> Uſually his firſt motions are to go aſide and conſider; Chriſt is <hi>baſhful</hi> before acquaintance, and doth not ſpeak to us in company, but in private: Did he ever thus invite you into ſecret places? did he ever <hi>call thee by name,</hi> ſpeak ſo expreſly to thy caſe, as if he had ſaid, Here is mercy for thee, comfort for thee, here is thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Firſt or laſt Gods children have ſuch experiences: There is a <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>time of loves</hi> which they cannot forget; at leaſt a time wherein the <hi>Maſter of the Aſſemblies</hi> faſtened a nail in their hearts. Gods people are wont to talk how <hi>ſeaſonably,</hi> and yet how <hi>ſtrangely</hi> Providence caſt them upon ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 93. <hi>I ſhall never forget thy Precepts, for by them thou haſt quickened me:</hi> Oh I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget ſuch an Ordinance, ſuch a Sermon, wherein the Lord was pleaſed to take notice of me, and to ſpeak to my heart: Weak impreſſions are ſoon razed out, but powerful effects of the Word leave a durable mark and character that cannot be defaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115193:20"/>3. The next Mark may be taken from the <hi>formal anſwer,</hi> or <hi>correspondent act</hi> of the creature to the call of God, for that is it which ſealeth our Election; for otherwiſe <hi>many be called, but they are not choſen,</hi> unleſs the heart be prevailed with to obey the call: Yea the notion of <hi>Vocation</hi> in its full latitude, implyeth not only <hi>Gods act,</hi> but ours, our <hi>anſwer</hi> to his <hi>call. Chriſts ſheep hear his voyce:</hi>

So <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Return ye back-ſliding children, and I will heal you;</hi> and then, <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> The Soul is enabled to do that which it is exhorted to do: God ſaith, <hi>Come to Chriſt,</hi> and the Soul ſaith, <hi>Lord I come.</hi> Well then, is the call obeyed? do you receive Chriſt for your Lord and Saviour? The proper anſwer of the call is the conſent and full purpoſe of the heart to take Chriſt; for <hi>offering</hi> is the <hi>call,</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> is the <hi>anſwer:</hi> Have you ſubſcribed and conſented to take Chriſt upon his own terms? as the Prophet, when he was to take a wife, maketh an offer, <hi>Hoſea 3. I will be for thee, and thou ſhalt be for me;</hi> Are you content? Chriſt will be for you in all his graces, merits, benefits, if you will be for him in all your motions, tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, aims: alas, your hearts know that you are for your ſelves, luſts, intereſts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. Again, You may know your calling by the <hi>concomitant dispoſitions</hi> of the Soul that go along with ſuch a <hi>return</hi> and <hi>anſwer:</hi> Where ever Chriſt is received, he is received with worthy and ſuitable affections; theſe are moſt notable. 1. <hi>Godly ſorrow, Ier. 31. 9.

                  <hi>The power of grace;</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> wondered at his deliverance by the Angel out of that ſtrong Priſon, we have much more cauſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the yoke is broken, and that we are ſet free by Chriſt: the ſweet effects of this grace cauſe wonder; <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> 3. A <hi>free reſolution</hi> and <hi>confidence;</hi> come what ever cometh, they will obey God. As <hi>Abraham being called obeyed God, not knowing whither he went, Heb.</hi> 11. 8. So when they have a warrant, they will make <hi>adventures of faith,</hi> though they know not the <hi>ſucceſs;</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> would caſt out the net at Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, though there were little likelyhood of taking fiſh; <hi>Howbeit at thy command, &amp;c.

So it is unlikely God will receive me to grace, yet I will adventure, I know not what will come of it: Where Faith is ſenſible of a Command, it doth not <hi>dispute</hi> a duty, but <hi>accompliſh</hi> it: The Spirit ſpeaketh to the Soul, as the Diſciples did to the blind man, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 49. <hi>Be of good comfort, riſe, becauſe the</hi>

               <p>5. It may be evidenced by the fruits and effects of a call; the call inferreth a change of the former eſtate, both in <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. There will be a change in the <hi>whole heart:</hi> In the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> there the activity of the new nature is firſt diſcovered; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Renewed in the ſpirit of the mind;</hi> in that which is moſt intimate and excellent there: In our diſcourſe and reaſon, all the diſcourſes, debates, purpoſes and cares of the Soul will be to pleaſe God: The mind is made <hi>a forge</hi> for holy uſes, wherein to debate and contrive how to carry on the work of grace, how to glorifie God in our relations, concernments; certainly this will be found in all thoſe that are called and converted. So in the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> there will be a conſtant inclination towards God, as the chiefeſt good: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 57. <hi>Thou art my portion O Lord, I have ſaid that I w'll keep thy Words:</hi> The Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; there is <hi>a decree</hi> iſſued forth in that behalf, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it ſelf to God and his Will: This is the great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between men and men, in fixing their <hi>chiefeſt good</hi> and <hi>utmoſt end;</hi> The Soul finding comfort in God, ſetteth the whole bent of her endeavors towards him. So for the other affections, which attend upon the other act of the will, <hi>aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> and <hi>loathing:</hi> a Soul that is called and converted hateth ſin, its own <hi>beloved ſin,</hi> as the greateſt evil: <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 8. <hi>What have I any more to do with Idols? Iſai.</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay to it as to an abominable rag, Get thee hence.</hi> A <hi>keen displicency</hi> and <hi>hearty indignation</hi> is kindled in the Soul againſt ſin: when God changeth a Soul, he putteth a diſpoſition into it ſomewhat like his own nature; God cannot abide ſin, and a ſanctified heart cannot abide it, <hi>Get thou hence, &amp;c.</hi> the new life hath an <hi>antipathy</hi> to that which is contrary to it.</p>
               <p>2. In the <hi>life</hi> there will be a change; men will walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy their calling, not diſgracing it by ſcandals, or unſeemly practiſes: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith ye are called;</hi> that is, ſuitable to the <hi>purity,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:115193:22"/>
ſuitable to the <hi>dignity</hi> of it. When <hi>David</hi> was a Shepherd, he thought of nothing elſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but keeping his fathers ſheep; but when God called him to be a Shepherd of the people, then he had other projects, and was of other manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior: A <hi>new calling</hi> requireth a <hi>new converſation.</hi> So 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his Kingdom and his Glory:</hi> The divine calling puts an honour upon you: it is not for <hi>Princes to embrace the dung,</hi> nor for Eagles to catch flies; to be vain, voluptuous, carnal and worldly, as others are: you are called to the fellowſhip of Saints and Angels, will it become one of your hopes to drive on ſuch a low deſign as a <hi>worldly intereſt?</hi> If you ſaw a man laboring in filthy ditches, and ſoyling himſelf, as poor men do, would you beleeve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he were heir apparant to a Crown, called to inherit a Kingdom? Who will beleeve your calling, when you ſtick in the mud of pleaſures, and and are carryed on with ſuch a zealous reſpect after ſecular intereſts?

What it is to <hi>be ſanctified:</hi> and then, 2. Why Gods <hi>called people</hi> muſt be ſanctified.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What it is to be ſanctified; there are many accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the term, the moſt famous are two; to ſanctifie is either <hi>to ſet apart,</hi> or <hi>to cleanſe;</hi> theſe two notions will be enough for our purpoſe, if in each of them we ſuppoſe both ſomething <hi>privative,</hi> and ſomething <hi>poſitive:</hi> as when it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>to ſet apart,</hi> you muſt conceive not only a ſetting apart from common uſe, but a <hi>dedication to holy uſes,</hi> or a ſetting apart for God, which is the moſt proper acception of the word: So when it ſignifieth <hi>to cleanſe,</hi> you muſt not only conceive a <hi>purgation</hi> from filthineſs, but a <hi>plantation</hi> of ſeeds of grace; not only an <hi>abolition</hi> of natural corruption, but a <hi>renovation</hi> of Gods Image. In this method let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſider the thing in hand.</p>
               <p>1. To ſanctifie, is <hi>to ſet apart,</hi> and <hi>dedicate:</hi> Now Gods people are <hi>ſet apart</hi>

They are ſet apart by God both <hi>in time</hi> and <hi>before time:</hi> Before all time they are ſet apart by <hi>Gods Decree</hi> to be an <hi>holy ſeed</hi> to himſelf in and by Chriſt, ſeparated from the periſhing world to be <hi>veſſels of honour;</hi> as the Reprobate are called <hi>veſſels of wrath and diſhonour:</hi> thus we are ſaid to be <hi>choſen to be holy, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4.

               <p>2. To ſanctifie, is to <hi>cleanſe,</hi> together with its poſitive act, to <hi>renew</hi> and <hi>adorn</hi> with grace.</p>
               <p>Let us firſt ſpeak of the <hi>privative</hi> or <hi>cleanſing</hi> work; this notion is neceſſary to be added to the former: They that are <hi>ſanctified</hi> muſt not only be <hi>ſeparated</hi> to an holy uſe, but muſt alſo be <hi>cleanſed:</hi> as to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> ſignifieth to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> ſo there is a difference between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> and as it ſignifieth to <hi>cleanſe,</hi> ſo there is a difference between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>themſelves.</hi> They differ from others, becauſe they are a people ſet apart to act and live for God; they trade for God, eat for God, drink for God, more or leſs, all is for <note n="*" place="margin">1.

               <p>2. <hi>New Ends:</hi> here indeed the diſcovery is moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Principles</hi> are more hidden, and diſcovered moſtly by <hi>ends;</hi> Now the only end muſt be <hi>Gods glory:</hi> All that is done in the ſpiritual life, be it an act of piety, juſtice, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance or charity, it muſt be done with this aym, that God may be glorified by our obedience to his Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I owe this duty to God, and I muſt do it for Gods ſake; be it a duty

of worſhip, or in your civil relation and traffique, as if I pray, the laſt end of prayer muſt be Gods glory, whither I ſeek grace and pardon, or the conveniences and ſupports of the preſent life: Grace ſtill ſublimateth the intention of the creature, therefore carnal men are taxed for praying out of ſelf-intereſts; <hi>Hoſea 7. 14. They have not cryed unto me when they howled upon their beds; they aſſemble themſelves for corn, and wine, and oyl:</hi> It is but a <hi>brutiſh cry,</hi> when men ſeek only their own commodity and welfare; as beaſts will <hi>howl</hi> when they are ſenſible of any ſmart and injury; dogs or any brute beaſts may do the ſame, there is no act of grace in it. So in charity, many men make it a kind of bargain and traffique, they do it to <hi>be ſeen of men, Mat.</hi> 6. 2. to gratifie their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſts, not to pleaſe God or honour God, for their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and repute, to be well thought of; and there Chriſt ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

Carnal,</hi> when men make a market of Religion, their worſhip, righteouſneſs and charity is <hi>ſet to ſale,</hi> and by a vile ſubmiſſion made to ſtoop to their own private intereſts; as the Phariſees <hi>made long prayers to devour widows houſes,</hi> that is, to beget a fame and repute of honeſty, that they might be entruſted with the management of their eſtates: So ſome may pray to <hi>ſhew parts,</hi> preach out of <hi>envy,</hi> and to rival others in eſteem, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15. Often is this vile ſcorn put upon God, that his worſhip is made a cover and pretence to unclean intents; which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if a cup of gold made for a King to drink of, ſhould be filled with excrements; or as if we did ſet up another god beſide him; for that which we make our <hi>utmoſt end,</hi> we make it our God: as falſe Teachers are ſaid to <hi>make their belly their God, Phil.</hi> 3. 19. becauſe all that they did was for belly chear, to flow in abundance of wealth and worldly pleaſures, by this means ſetting up the belly and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the belly in Gods ſtead. 2. There are <hi>natural ends:</hi> It is grace (as I ſaid) that ſublimateth the intention of the creature: A carnal man can go no higher then Self;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115193:26"/>
as water cannot aſcend beyond its ſpring: Now all natural men are not hypocrites, to put on a pretence of ſtrictneſs out of deſign: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They do by nature the things contained in the Law, Rom.</hi> 2. 14. that is, upon the impulſes of natural conſcience, they avoyd ſuch ſins as Nature diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, upon ſuch arguments and reaſons as Nature ſuggeſteth: If they worſhip, it is to ſatisfie their own conſciences; if they be ſtrict and temperate, it is not out of reaſons of obedience, but becauſe the matter of carnal pleaſure is groſs and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and hindereth the free contemplation of the mind; or becauſe theſe pleaſures emaſculate and quench their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bravery, and ſo hinder their reputation in the world: if they be juſt, it is to maintain commerce between man and man; if they be kind in their relations, it is for their own peace and quiet; nothing is done <hi>as in and to the Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle enjoyneth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. God is neither at the beginning nor at the end of any of theſe actions; the <hi>love of God</hi> is not their <hi>ſpring</hi> and <hi>riſe,</hi> nor the <hi>glory of God</hi> their <hi>aim:</hi> If they pray, there is no intention beyond Self, and the welfare of their own natures; the matter is but the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>outward work</hi> of the Law, and their aim is but the freedom and welfare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 3. There are <hi>legal ends:</hi> When wicked men are moſt devout, it is but to quiet conſcience, to ſatisfie God for their ſins by their duties; they would fain buy out their peace with Heaven at any rate: <hi>Micah 6. 6, 7, 8. Wherewith ſhall I come before him? what ſhall I give for the ſins of my Soul?</hi> They are devout, charitable, that by diligence in worſhip, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in charity, they may expiate the offences of a carnal life: If peace of conſcience were to be purchaſed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they would not ſpare; they would rather part with any thing then their corruptions, becauſe nothing is ſo dear to a carnal heart as ſin. So that you ſee devout nature is very corrupt and perverſe, and therefore all its actions are juſtly hated of God: <hi>Prov. 21. 27. The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, how much more when he offereth it with an evil mind?</hi> that is, to buy an indulgence in other ſins, that he may ſin them freely and with leave from Heaven: In ſhort, all their duties of worſhip and charity are performed as a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115193:26"/>
                  <hi>ſin-offering,</hi> and not as a <hi>thank-offering;</hi> to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> God, not to <hi>glorifie</hi> him; uſually they are extorted from him in a pang of conſcience; as a Mariner caſts out his goods in a ſtorm, or a traveller yieldeth his money when beſet with theeves; there is no true delight in God or in obedience. And thus I have ſhewed you what it is to be ſanctified in heart and life, which was the firſt thing propounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let me now ſhew why Gods called people muſt be ſanctified, and that brieſly and in few words.</p>
               <p>1. For the honour of God, of every Perſon in the Trinity, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> For the honour of the Father, that his choyce may not be diſparaged: <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. He hath elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to be holy.</hi>

Now you may diſcern it, partly becauſe <hi>love</hi> is of little uſe and force with ſuch kind of ſpirits; they are chained up by their <hi>own fears:</hi> The great Evangelick motive is mercy; <hi>Rom. 12. 1. I beſeech you by the mercies of God:</hi> The heart is moſt ingenuous when it yeildeth to ſuch intreaties: It is good to ſerve God with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, but a ſervile awe hath little of grace in it. It is true indeed, it is better to have a <hi>ſlaviſh fear</hi> then none at all; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith to them that would be held in with no other reſtraints, <hi>Pſal. 4. 4.

The heart is not <hi>renewed,</hi> though the action be <hi>checked;</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had an adulterous heart towards God, when <hi>her way was hedged up with thorns, Hoſea</hi> 2. 6.

               <p>4. The next thing that looketh like Sanctification, but is not, is <hi>common grace:</hi> This is a diſtinct thing from all the reſt, yet I call it <hi>common grace,</hi> becauſe it may be in them that fall away and depart from God: It differeth from <hi>Civility,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more Chriſtian and Evangelical; from <hi>Formality,</hi> becauſe that is only in pretence and ſhew, whereas this is a real work upon the Soul; from <hi>reſtraining grace,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115193:31"/>
that is only converſant about ſins and duties out of a ſervile awe of God, but this ſeemeth to carry out the Soul with ſome affection to Chriſt; it is a common work, good in its ſelf, which God ordaineth in ſome to be a <hi>preparation</hi> and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the work of grace: Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. where he calleth it <hi>an enlightening, a taſte of Chriſt and of the powers of the world to come,</hi> and a <hi>partaking of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> meaning of the gifts of the Spirit, abilities for holy duties, &amp;c. of all which elſewhere; only now let me note three things. 1. That <hi>the light</hi> there ſpoken of is not <hi>humbling. 2. The taſte</hi> is not <hi>raviſhing,</hi> and drawing out the Soul after more of Chriſt. 3. Their <hi>gifts</hi> are not <hi>renewing</hi> and ſanctifying.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>light is not humbling;</hi> He ſaith, they are <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi> but he doth not ſay they are <hi>humbled:</hi> Foundations totter that are not layed deep enough: The more <hi>true light</hi> a man hath, the more cauſe of <hi>ſelf-abaſement</hi> will he find in himſelf: You can never <hi>magnifie Chriſt</hi> enough, and you can never <hi>debaſe ſelf</hi> enough; and certainly Chriſt is moſt exalted when you are moſt abaſed, <hi>Iſai. 2. 19. Dagon</hi> muſt fall upon his face, if you mean to ſet up the <hi>Ark;</hi> and if Chriſt ſhall be <hi>precious</hi> to you, you muſt be <hi>vile</hi> in your own eyes; none have ſuch <hi>true revivings</hi> as the humble, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 15, 16. True humiliation is far from <hi>weakening</hi> your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, it maketh them more <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ſure:</hi> therefore a main thing that was wanting in thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and their fault was a <hi>raſh cloſing</hi> with Chriſt in the pride of their hearts.</p>
               <p>2. Their <hi>taſte was not raviſhing,</hi> and affecting the heart ſo as to engage it to ſeek after Chriſt; they had but looſe and ſlight deſires of happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> glances upon the glory of Heaven and the comforts of the Goſpel, which poſſibly might ſtir up a wiſh, <hi>Oh that I might dye the death of the righteous, &amp;c.</hi> they were not ſerious and holy deſires after Chriſt, after grace and ſtrength to ſerve him: The Saints that have a <hi>taſte</hi>

               <p>3. <hi>Their gifts are not renewing and ſanctifying;</hi> ſuch poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as may make them <hi>uſeful to the Church,</hi> but do not change the heart: the Apoſtle ſaith, they were made <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, had ſome ſhare, it may be a plentiful ſhare of Church gifts, ſo as to be able to carry on duties to the edification and comfort of others; but alas what is a man the better, if the heart be oppreſt with ſins in the mean time, and be not upright with God? 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 1. Though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and Angels, and have not charity, I am become but as a ſounding Braſs, and tinkling Cymbal.</hi> Though you can ſpeak of the things of God with much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement and affection, pray ſweetly, all is but as <hi>tinkling</hi> with God if there be not <hi>ſaving grace:</hi> It is a great evidence that we are ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, when the <hi>affection</hi> doth not anſwer the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of a duty, nor <hi>the life</hi> our <hi>knowledg,</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> have not a proportionable influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>practiſe.</hi> So much for that Point.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of the State, I come now to ſpeak of the Author of it, <hi>God the Father.</hi> But why is it ſo diſtinctly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Father? is not Chriſt <hi>our Sanctification? 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and is it not called <hi>the Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 14. The Anſwer ſhall draw out the ſtrength of the phraſe in theſe Propoſitions. 1. It is true, that the whole Trinity one way or other concurreth to the work of holineſs; thoſe works <hi>ad extra</hi> are <hi>indiviſa</hi> common to all the Perſons; the Father ſanctifieth, the Son ſanctifieth, and the Holy Ghoſt ſanctifieth: the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>preſerving</hi> and <hi>calling.</hi> 2. Though all work joyntly, yet there are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſonal operations,</hi> by which they make way for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of each other; the <hi>love</hi> of the Father for the <hi>glory</hi> of the Son, and the <hi>glory</hi> of the Son for the <hi>power</hi> of the Spirit. See how the Scripture followeth theſe things: You ſhall find firſt, that no man cometh to the Son but from the Father by Election; <hi>Iohn 6. 37. All that the Father giveth ſhall come to</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115193:32"/>
                  <hi>me:</hi> ſo verſ. 65. <hi>No man cometh unto me, unleſs it be given him of my Father.</hi> Look again and you ſhall find that no man cometh to the Father from the bondage of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but by the Son, through his Redemption and Mediation; <hi>John 14. 6. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</hi> Again, you ſhall ſee no man is <hi>united to the Son</hi> but by the Holy Ghoſt, who <hi>worketh</hi> in thoſe whom the Father did <hi>chooſe</hi> and the Son <hi>redeem;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit</hi> is as neceſſary as the <hi>Blood of Jeſus, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. So that you ſee all have their diſtinct work; the <hi>Inchoation</hi> is from the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi> by the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Conſummation</hi> by the <hi>Spirit: from</hi> the Father, <hi>in</hi> the Son, and <hi>through</hi> the Spirit; there is <hi>Gods choyce, Chriſts purchaſe,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits application:</hi> all are joyned in one Verſe, for indeed they muſt not be ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even in the place laſt alledged, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. 3. Becauſe the firſt diſtinct operation is the Fathers, therefore the whole work in Scripture is often aſcribed to him; he is ſaid <hi>to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie; The Iuſtifier of them that beleeve in Ieſus, Rom.</hi> 3. 26. So he is ſaid elſewhere <hi>to purge; Iohn 15. 1, 2. I am the Vine, and my Father is the Huſbandman; he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit:</hi> All dependeth upon the <hi>decree of his love:</hi> Chriſt doth not work upon a perſon, unleſs he be given to him by the Father; and therefore he being <hi>firſt</hi> in <hi>order</hi> and <hi>operation,</hi> the whole work is made his work: <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in God the Father.</hi> Obſerve,</p>

Becauſe 'tis a great ſupport and comfort to faith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the Father in the act of beleeving: two are better then one; and 'tis often made a priviledg to have <hi>the Father and the Son, 1 John.</hi> 1. 3. and 2. 23, 24. 2 <hi>John 9. &amp; alib.</hi> There is the <hi>Fathers love</hi> and the <hi>Sons merit;</hi> either ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally will not yeild that joy and peace in beleeving, and therefore 'tis good to have them both together: There is no acceſs to the Father but in the Son: What will <hi>guilt</hi> do with <hi>Juſtice? ſtubble</hi> with <hi>conſuming fire?</hi> God out of Chriſt is <hi>terrible,</hi> rather then <hi>comfortable;</hi> therefore 'tis ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. that <hi>by him we beleeve in God;</hi> that is, by Chriſt through his merit we come comfortably to pitch upon God the Father. So again, Chriſt ſeparate from the Father doth not yeild ſuch firm grounds of confidence; there muſt be ſome act of the Father to give us full ſecurity; for in the buſineſs of Redemption God the Father is repreſented as the <hi>offended wronged party,</hi> who is to receive ſatisfaction: we are ſenſible of the wrong and offence, Conſcience feeleth that; we muſt be alſo ſenſible of his favour and grace towards us: now when we ſee him <hi>firſt</hi> in all acts of grace, that taketh away all jealouſie and ſcruple. 4. Becauſe in the Fathers Love there are many circumſtances which are <hi>very engaging</hi> to the Soul, which are not to be found in the reſt of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons; for he being <hi>firſt in order,</hi> hath the <hi>chiefeſt work</hi> aſcribed to him; but eſpecially are not to be found in Chriſt <hi>as Mediator:</hi> and becauſe Chriſt as Mediator is moſt known to the creatures, I ſhall proſecute this matter with reſpect to that Conſideration. 1. In the Fathers love and acts of grace there is an <hi>original Fulneſs;</hi> Chriſts fulneſs as Mediator is but derived out of the Fathers plenty; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115193:34"/>
                  <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell:</hi> And 'tis limited by the Fathers Will in the diſpenſation of it; all that Chriſt diſpenſed was according to the Charge and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment given him by his Father; ſee <hi>Mat. 20. 23. It is not mine to give, ſave to thoſe for whom it is prepared of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Chriſt doth not deny his <hi>Authority to give glory</hi> as well as grace; only he ſheweth how in all the diſpenſations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Mediator he was <hi>limited</hi> by the Will and Counſel of the Father: And ſo he denyeth to diſpenſe the knowledg of times and ſeaſons, becauſe <hi>the Father had kept it in his own Power, Acts</hi> 1. 7. So that now 'tis an engaging Conſideration to remember that the Father, whoſe Will is abſolute, who hath an original Fulneſs of all grace, that <hi>he himſelf loveth us,</hi> and is firſt in all acts of bleſſing. 2. In the Fathers acts you have the pureſt and freeſt apprehenſion of love; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and firſt broke the buſineſs of our Redemption: God the Son can have an <hi>higher motive,</hi> the Fathers Will; but God the Father can have no higher motive then his own love; his <hi>elective love</hi> was the firſt riſe and ſpring whence all that love that paſſeth out to the creature iſſueth forth, and therefore here we have the freeſt apprehenſion of love: there was a love of the Father anteceding the merit of Chriſt; <hi>John 3. 16. God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only Son;</hi> there was the moſt <hi>independent</hi> and <hi>free</hi> act of love.</p>
               <p>It ſerveth to preſs us to give a <hi>diſtinct glory</hi> in beleeving<note place="margin">

'Tis ſaid, <hi>John 5. 23. That God will have all men honour the Son as they honour the Father.</hi> God is moſt honoured when your thoughts are moſt diſtinct and explicite in this matter.

He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine;</hi> ſo Chriſt came <hi>to glorifie the Father, and to finiſh his</hi>

                  </hi> but the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fathers love:</hi> You deal with a God of bowels and bounty; Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, all are yours.

                  <hi>called and ſanctified people are preſerved and kept in their ſtate of grace and holineſs in and by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Point aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two things, that they are kept <hi>by Chriſt</hi> and <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> that is, not only for <hi>his ſake,</hi> but by vertue of <hi>union with him;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>the Cabinet</hi> wherein Gods Jewels are kept; ſo that if we would ſtand, we muſt get out of our ſelves, and get into him, in whom alone there is ſafety.

general Doctrine of the Perſeverance of the Saints: And firſt, I ſhall give you the <hi>ſtate</hi> of it, how far we may expect to be preſerved. 2. The Grounds of Certainty and Aſſurance in this kind.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How far we may look for Preſervation: The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Perſeverance is much impugned; but the Earth is never the more unſetled, becauſe to giddy brains it ſeemeth to run round: however let us grant what muſt be granted, and then the truth will be burdened with leſs prejudice. <hi>Seeming grace</hi> may be loſt; <hi>Take from him that which he hath, Mat.</hi> 25. 28. is <hi>Luke 8. 18. Take from him that which he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have.</hi> Blazing <hi>Comets</hi> and Meteors are ſoon ſpent, and fall from Heaven like lightening, while <hi>ſtars</hi> keep their orb and ſtation: A <hi>building in the ſand</hi> will totter; and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites be diſcovered before the Congregation, Prov.</hi> 26. 26. Again, <hi>Initial</hi> or <hi>preparative grace</hi> may fail, ſuch as is ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. to wit, <hi>illumination, external reformation, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary faith, devout moods,</hi> ſome <hi>good beginnings,</hi> &amp;c. Plenty of bloſſoms do not always foretell ſtore of fruit; ſome dye in the very pangs of the birth, and are ſtill born. Yet again, <hi>True grace</hi> may ſuffer a <hi>ſhrewd decay,</hi> but not an <hi>utter loſs;</hi> the leaves may fade when the root liveth: In temptations Gods children are ſorely ſhaken; their <hi>heel may be bruiſed,</hi> as Chriſts was, but their <hi>head is not cruſhed: Peter</hi> denyed Chriſt, but did not fall from grace; there is a <hi>remaining ſeed, 1 John</hi> 3. 9. 'Tis notable what <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerveth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts prayer for <hi>Peter, Luke 22. 32. I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not:</hi>

this may laſt for a long time: <hi>David</hi> lay in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſwoon <hi>nine moneths;</hi> for he awaked not till <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. the title; and when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him, the child begotten upon <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was born; for he ſaith, 2 <hi>Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. 14. The child which is born to thee ſhall dye.</hi> Yet further, Grace if <hi>left to us</hi> would ſoon be loſt; we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in Innocency: but 'tis our advantage that our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity lieth in <hi>Gods promiſes,</hi> and not <hi>our own;</hi> that we are not our <hi>own keepers;</hi> that grace is a Jewel not truſted but in ſafe hands; that perſeverance is <hi>Gods gift,</hi> not <hi>mans act;</hi> and that Chriſt hath a Charge to conduct the Saints, and keep them ſafe to everlaſting Glory, <hi>John</hi> 6. from 37, to 40. and <hi>John 10. 28. I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any periſh, non ſhall pluck them out of my hand: My Father which gave them is greater then all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand:</hi> They neither <hi>ſhall</hi> nor <hi>can;</hi> God and Chriſt are engaged in the keeping of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt by Gods Command as Mediator, and God by Chriſts merit: therefore he that ſeparateth us from God muſt tug with Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and be too hard for him alſo, or elſe he can never pluck them out of his hands. If they ſhould queſtion Chriſts power, becauſe of the ignominy of the Croſs; the <hi>Fathers hands</hi> are alſo engaged, for our greater aſſurance: Can any creature looſe his eternal and almighty graſp? and pluck out thoſe whom the Father hath a mind to keep?</p>
               <p>We do not plead for any wilde aſſurance and certainty of Perſeverance; we do not ſay that they that neglect means, or grieve the Spirit, and do what they liſt, are ſure that they ſhall not miſcarry; that is againſt the <hi>nature of Gods dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> and the <hi>nature of this aſſurance,</hi> and therefore but a <hi>vain cavil.</hi> 'Tis againſt the nature of Gods diſpenſation; whom he maketh to perſevere, he maketh them to perſevere in the uſe of means: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had aſſurance from God of life for fifteen years, yet he taketh a <hi>lump of figs,</hi> and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it as a plaiſter to the boyl, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. 5, with 21. More clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Acts 27. 31. All ſhall come to Land;</hi> but, <hi>Except ye abide in the ſhip ye cannot be ſafe:</hi> We are ſure of life as long as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115193:36"/>
God hath any ſervice to do for us, yet we are bound to get food and rayment, and to uſe all means to preſerve life: This was Satans cavil againſt Gods protection over Chriſt, Thou art ſure not to fall, therefore neglect means, caſt thy ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on danger, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 9, 10. You learn this Doctrine from the Devil; Thou mayſt do what thou lift, thou art ſure to be ſafe; 'tis the <hi>Devils Divinity.</hi> Again, 'Tis againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this aſſurance; he that hath taſted Gods love in Gods way, cannot reaſon ſo: A child that hath a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that will not ſee him periſh, ſhall he waſte and embezzle his eſtate he careth not how? A wicked child may preſume thus of his father (though it be very diſingenuous) becauſe of his natural intereſt and relation to his father; the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he expecteth is not built upon <hi>moral choyce,</hi> but <hi>nature:</hi> but a child of God cannot, becauſe he cannot grow up to this certainty but in the exerciſe of grace; 'tis begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and nouriſhed by godly exerciſes: and the thing it ſelf implyeth a contradiction; this were to fall away becauſe <hi>we cannot fall away:</hi> You may as ſoon ſay that the fire ſhould make a man freeze with cold, as that certainty of perſeverance in grace ſhould make us do actions contrary to grace.</p>
               <p>Again, We do not ſay that a Beleever is ſo ſure of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in a ſtate of grace, as that he needeth not to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and jealous of himſelf; 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 12. Let him that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> There is a <hi>fear of Caution,</hi> as well as a fear of diffidence and diſtruſt; and there is a great deal of difference between weakening the <hi>ſecurity of the fleſh,</hi> and our <hi>confidence in Chriſt:</hi> None more apt to ſuſpect themſelves then they that are moſt ſure in God, leſt by improvidence and unwatchfulneſs they ſhould yeild to corruption: Chriſt had prayed that <hi>Peters</hi> faith might not fail, yet together with the other Apoſtles he biddeth him <hi>Watch, Luke</hi> 22. 40, and 46. The <hi>fear of God</hi> is a preſerving grace, and taken into the Covenant; <hi>Jer. 32. 40. I will put my fear into their hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> This is a fear which will ſtand with faith and certainty; 'tis a fruit of the ſame ſpirit, and doth not <hi>hinder</hi> aſſurance, but <hi>guard</hi> it; 'tis a fear that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115193:37"/>
maketh us watchful againſt all occaſions to ſin and ſpiritual diſtempers, that we may not give offence to God: as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous man that hath an inheritance paſſed over to him by his friend in Court, is careful not to offend him.</p>
               <p>Again, This certainty of our ſtanding in grace doth not exclude prayer; <hi>Luke 22. 46.

               <p>Again, 'Tis not a <hi>diſcontinued,</hi> but a <hi>conſtant perſeverance</hi> that we plead for; not as if an elect perſon could be quite driven out of the ſtate of grace, though he be ſaved at length; he cannot fall <hi>totus a toto in totum,</hi> the <hi>whole man</hi> with <hi>full conſent</hi> from <hi>all grace</hi> and godlineſs; he may ſin <hi>foully,</hi> but not fall off <hi>totally,</hi> no more then <hi>finally;</hi> there is ſomething that remaineth, <hi>a ſeed, an unction, a root in a dry ground,</hi> that will bud and ſcent again: Briefly, true grace ſhall never ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be loſt, though it be much weakened, but in the uſe of means it ſhall conſtantly be preſerved to eternal life.</p>
               <p>Once more, and I have done with the ſtate of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God doth not only require the condition of ſtanding, or continuing in the exerciſe of grace, but give it infallibly: The Precepts of the Covenant of Grace are alſo Promiſes; <hi>Heb. 8. 10.

but all the fear is of our departing from God: So ſome ſay, God will not <hi>depart from us,</hi> if we be <hi>not wanting to our ſelves:</hi> And <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerved that our <hi>own fleſh</hi> is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Rom. 8.

For as <hi>grace</hi> is ſure, ſo are alſo the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of grace:</hi> This was figured under the Law; an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite could never wholly <hi>alienate his inheritance</hi> and <hi>title to the Land; Levit. 25. 23. His title to the Land ſhall not be cut off, nor ſold for ever:</hi> This was a type of our ſpiritual inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Chriſt, which cannot be alienated from us; he might for a while paſs it away, but it was to return again; ſo thoſe that are made coheirs with Chriſt, are never diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited: 'Tis true, we forfeit it by the <hi>merit of our actions,</hi> but God doth not take the advantage of <hi>every offence:</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>we loſe the evidences</hi> that are in our keeping, peace of Conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; but the eſtate it ſelf is undefeaſible, and cannot be made away from us. Sometimes we are under a <hi>king of ſequeſtration,</hi> and there is a ſuſpenſion of comfort and grace; as the Iſraelite might make away his inheritance for a time; but we ſhall <hi>recover poſſeſſion</hi> again, though not by our ſelves, yet by our <hi>Goel, our kinſman,</hi> or him that is <hi>next of blood:</hi> As under the Law, if a perſon were not able to redeem the inheritance, the kinſman was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it; ſo Jeſus Chriſt, our kinſman after the fleſh, he is our <hi>Goel,</hi> he interpoſeth by his merit, and reconcileth us to God. Well then, You ſee <hi>grace</hi> is kept, and the <hi>priviledges of grace</hi> are kept in Chriſt: But now becauſe comforts are never prized but in <hi>their ſeaſon,</hi> and men that have not been exerciſed in <hi>ſpiritual conflicts,</hi> nauſeate theſe <hi>ſweet truths,</hi> they know not what it is to be left to uncertainty when troubles come like waves one in the neck of another; therefore let us ſee when this truth will be moſt ſweet and ſeaſonable. 1. In <hi>great troubles,</hi> when God ſeemeth to hide his face; Oh how ſweet is it to hear him ſay, <hi>I will not forſake thee till I have performed all that I promiſed thee, Gen.</hi> 28. 15. all this ſhall better thy heart, and haſten thy glory. In times of diſtreſs we are apt to think that God hath caſt us off, and will never look after us more, though formerly we have had real expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of his grace: What a fooliſh creature is man to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his aſſurance when he ſhould come to uſe it? to unravel
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115193:42"/>
all his hope and experiences in <hi>times of trouble,</hi> which is the only ſeaſon to make uſe of them. 2. In the <hi>hour of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and hard conflicts</hi> with <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> when we are ſenſible of the power of ſin, and how difficult it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it out of the heart, we are apt to ſay as <hi>David</hi> after all his experiences, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 27. 1. and many times out of diſtruſt give over the combate. Oh then remember now you are <hi>preſerved in Chriſt,</hi> and that nothing ſhall ſeparate: as <hi>Sarcerius</hi> came to <hi>Camerarius</hi> his wife, when ſhe had been exerciſed with a long and tedious conflict, and read to her the latter end of the eighth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhe brake out in triumph, uſing <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Nay, in all theſe things we are more then Conquerors.</hi> Oh Chriſtians, neither <hi>ſin,</hi> nor <hi>Devil,</hi> nor <hi>world</hi> can divide you from Chriſt, for he <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 16. 20.</note> did not only <hi>tread down Satan,</hi> but <hi>under your feet.</hi> 3. In times of <hi>great danger</hi> and <hi>defection,</hi> either through <hi>error</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> as <hi>Saunders</hi> trembled to think of the <hi>fire;</hi> eſpecially when others fall fearfully, who were before us in knowledg and profeſſion of zeal and piety; when the <hi>firſt</hi> become <hi>laſt;</hi> when <hi>glorious Luminaries</hi> are eclipſed, and leave their orb and ſtation; as the Martyrs were troubled to hear of the revolt of ſome great Scholars that had appeared for the Goſpel: When <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> two eminent Profeſſors, fell, there was a <hi>great ſhaking, 2 Tim. 2. 18.

Look upon me, and be merciful to me, as thou uſeſt to do to thoſe that love thy Name:</hi> Surely that which God giveth to his <hi>people,</hi> that's a better mercy then that which God giveth to his <hi>enemies.</hi> Again, theſe are mercies that coſt God dearer; they flow to you in the Blood of his own Son: yea, they are mercies that are better in themſelves; wealth and honour may become a <hi>burden,</hi> yea, <hi>life it ſelf</hi> may become a burden, but not <hi>mercy,</hi> not <hi>grace,</hi> not <hi>peace of Conſcience;</hi>

and therefore they are <hi>better then life, Pſal.</hi> 63. 3. then wealth, then honour: none ever complained of too much mercy, of too much love of God: Theſe are bleſsings that ſwallow up other miſeries, yea, the loſs of other bleſsings; grace with poverty 'tis a <note n="*" place="margin">James 1. 9.</note>

Again, If you pray for others, pray for grace in the firſt place; that's an evidence of <hi>ſpiritual affection:</hi> Carnal men wiſh ſuch things to others, as they prize and affect themſelves; ſo alſo do gracious men; and therefore their thoughts run more upon <hi>mercy, peace</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> then <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>greatneſs.</hi> When a man ſendeth a token to a friend, he would ſend the beſt of the kind: Theſe are the beſt mercies; if you were to deal with God for your own Souls, you can ask no better: You may ask temporal things, for God <hi>loveth the prosperity of his Saints;</hi> but theſe ſpecial bleſsings ſhould have the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your wiſhes and deſires of good to them, and then you are moſt likely to ſpeed.

among themſelves; firſt <hi>mercy,</hi> then <hi>peace,</hi> and then <hi>love; mercy</hi> doth not differ much from that which is called <hi>grace</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, only <hi>grace</hi> doth more reſpect the <hi>bounty</hi> of God, as <hi>mercy</hi> doth our <hi>want</hi> and <hi>need:</hi> By <hi>mercy</hi> then is meant the favour and good-will of God to miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and <hi>peace</hi> ſignifieth all bleſsings inward and outward, as the <hi>fruits</hi> and effects of that favour and good-will; more eſpecially <hi>calmneſs</hi> and <hi>ſerenity of Conſcience,</hi> or a ſecure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of the love of God, which is the top of <hi>ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity:</hi> And then <hi>love</hi> ſometimes ſignifieth <hi>Gods love</hi> to us; here I ſhould rather take it for <hi>our love to God,</hi> and to the Brethren for Gods ſake: So that <hi>mercy</hi> is the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> of all, <hi>peace</hi> is the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>fruit,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> is the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> He beginneth with <hi>mercy,</hi> for that is the fountain and beginning of all the good things which we enjoy; higher then <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> we cannot go, for Gods Love is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it ſelf, <hi>Deut. 7. 7, 8. Rom. 9. 15. Iſai.</hi> 45. 15. and we can deſerve nothing at Gods hands but wrath and miſery, and therefore we ſhould ſtill honour Mercy, and ſet the Crown upon Mercy's head (as further anon;) that which you give to Merit, you take from Mercy. Now the next thing is <hi>peace;</hi> mark the order ſtill; without <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> there can be no <hi>true peace: Iſai. 57. 21. There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked;</hi> they ſay, <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> but my God doth not ſay ſo. Chriſt left his peace with his <hi>own Diſciples, John</hi> 14. 27. and not as worldly and external peace is left, in the happineſs of which both good and bad are concerned; that is <hi>general,</hi> but this is <hi>proper,</hi> confined within the Conſcience of him that enjoyeth it, and given to the godly: 'Tis the Lords method to pour in firſt the <hi>oyl of grace,</hi> and then the <hi>oyl of gladneſs:</hi> Alas, the peace of a wicked man 'tis but a <hi>frisk,</hi> or <hi>fit of joy,</hi> whileſt Conſcience, <hi>Gods watchman</hi> is nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>ſtoln waters and bread eaten in ſecret, Prov.</hi> 9. 17. The way to true <hi>peace</hi> is to apply your ſelves to God for <hi>mercy,</hi> to be accepted in Chriſt, to be renewed according to the Image of Chriſt; otherwiſe ſin and guilt will create fears and troubles. Again, the laſt thing is <hi>love; great priviledges</hi> require <hi>anſwerable duty; Mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> need another

               <p>8. <hi>Conſider in how many notions Mercy is repreſented to us:</hi> Gods Mercy hath many Names; a <hi>diſtinct conſideration</hi> of them yeildeth an advantage in beleeving: for though they expreſs the ſame thing, yet every notion begetteth a <hi>freſh</hi>

                  <hi>thought,</hi> by vvhich Mercy is more taken abroad in the vievv of Conſcience: This is that <hi>pouring out of Gods Name</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. Ointment in the Box doth not yeild ſuch a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy as vvhen 'tis <hi>poured out;</hi> and Spices do not give forth their ſmell till they are chafed. Nothing is more conducible to beget a truſt, then <hi>diſtinct thoughts</hi> and <hi>conceptions</hi> of Gods Mercy. Let us take notice of ſome places vvhere 'tis ſet forth: See <hi>Pſal. 103. 8. The Lord is merciful and gracious, ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and plenteous in mercy:</hi> The expreſſion is diverſified; and I note it the rather, becauſe in other places the ſame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mercy are punctually expreſſed: ſee <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 17. ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 5. 8. and in <note n="*" place="margin">Joel 2. 12.

Novv vvhat doth the Spirit of God aim at in this expreſs <hi>enumeration</hi> and <hi>accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of names of Mercy, but to give us an help in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that our thoughts may be more diſtinct. 1. The firſt notion is <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is <hi>an Attribute whereby God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to ſuccour them that are in miſery:</hi> 'Tis an Attribute that meerly reſpecteth the creature: The Love and knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God firſt falleth upon himſelf; but Mercy is only <hi>tranſient,</hi> and paſſeth out to the creatures: God <hi>knoweth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>loveth</hi> himſelf, but he is not <hi>merciful</hi> to himſelf. And then it reſpecteth the <hi>creatures in miſery;</hi> for <hi>miſery</hi> is <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s only motive: <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſeeketh a <hi>

The next notion is <hi>Grace,</hi> vvhich noteth the <hi>free bounty</hi> of God, and excludeth all <hi>merit</hi> of the creature: Grace doth all <hi>gratis,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>freely,</hi> though there be no <hi>precedent obligation,</hi> or <hi>debt,</hi> or <hi>hope of recompence,</hi> vvhereby any thing may accrue to himſelf; only that it may be vvell vvith the creature. Gods <hi>external motive</hi> is our <hi>miſery,</hi> his <hi>internal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> is his ovvn Grace and elective Love: Am I <hi>in want?</hi> there is <hi>mercy;</hi> Am I <hi>unworthy?</hi> there is <hi>grace. Mercy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects us as <hi>we are in our ſelves</hi> vvorthy of condemnation, Grace as <hi>compared with others</hi> not elected: The ultimate Reaſon of the choyce is <hi>Gods grace.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> that never ſinned, are ſaved meerly out of <hi>grace;</hi> but <hi>men</hi> that vvere
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115193:49"/>
once <hi>miſerable,</hi> are ſaved not only out of <hi>grace,</hi> but alſo out of <hi>mercy.</hi> 3. The next notion is <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> or <hi>ſlowneſs to anger:</hi> The Lord is not eaſily overcome by the <hi>wrongs</hi> or <hi>ſins</hi> of the creature, but eaſily overcometh them by his own <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>goodneſs:</hi> He doth not only <hi>pity</hi> our <hi>miſery,</hi> that's <hi>mercy;</hi> and do us good <hi>for nothing,</hi> that's <hi>grace;</hi> but <hi>beareth long</hi> with our infirmities. <note n="*" place="margin">Niſi expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret impium non inveniret quem glorificar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

God might have ſued out the Bond long ſince; what is the meaning of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation? Is God <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>unjuſt?</hi> or hath he a mind to be gracious? Surely he would not have ſpared me all this while, if he had not a mind to ſave my Soul. Such reaſonings as theſe many times give us the firſt encouragement to apply our ſelves to God: Wicked men like Spiders draw other concluſions, <hi>Pſal. 50. 21. But ſhould not his patience, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 2. 4. 2. Conſider <hi>Gods goodneſs,</hi> in giving thee food, and clothing, and honour, and gladneſs of heart, and all this without thy deſert; ſay, Certainly all theſe benefits are but ſo <hi>many baits</hi> to catch my Soul; I ſee the Sun riſeth every day with a freſh countenance, and ſhineth upon the fields of <hi>juſt and unjuſt;</hi> to what purpoſe? but to ſhew that God is gracious without hire: This bodily Sun is but an <hi>obſcure type</hi> of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is willing to diſplay his beams and wings over a poor languiſhing Soul. Common mercies are the <hi>taſtes</hi> of Gods love while you are ſinners, and the common fruits of Chriſts death, that you may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come for more: Why hath he given me the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Mammon,</hi> but that I may look after the <hi>true Riches?</hi> What a vile unthankful heart ſhould I have, if I ſhould be contented with <hi>Mammon</hi> without <hi>Chriſt?</hi> and be like <hi>Judas,</hi> with the <hi>bag</hi> in my <hi>hand,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> in my <hi>heart?</hi> Gods children are wont to make theſe gifts a <hi>ſtep</hi> to higher diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: they know God, like the good houſholder, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth <hi>the beſt at laſt;</hi> therefore they muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above and beyond all theſe things: <hi>Common hearts</hi> are contented with <hi>common mercies;</hi> but they are ſtill wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the <hi>Maſter of the feaſt will bid them</hi> ſit higher: I may have this and be damned; Where are the arguments of his ſpecial Love? 3. Conſider <hi>deliverances from imminent dangers:</hi> Then the Curſe began to ſeize upon you; but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115193:50"/>
God ſnatched you out of the fire like <hi>brands out of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Amos</hi> 4. 11. or like a <hi>debtor</hi> that eſcapeth out of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants hands. Every <hi>deliverance</hi> is a <hi>temporary pardon:</hi> See <hi>Pſal. 78. 38.

So <hi>Mat. 18. 32. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave them the debt;</hi> yet 'twas after required; the meaning is, <hi>ſpared</hi> them for the preſent. Thus when God taketh you out of the teeth and jaws of Wrath, when you are delivered out of ſickneſs and apparent danger, you have a <hi>reprieve</hi> or a <hi>temporary pardon.</hi> Oh if you had dyed, you had dyed in your ſins, and ſo been eternally miſerable: If the Lord had taken the preſent advantage, you had been howling a ſad note among the <hi>ſcreech-owls of darkneſs;</hi> For ever bleſſed be that Mercy that made a reſcue.</p>
               <p>10. Conſider <hi>Gods invitations:</hi> Mercy pointeth and beckneth to thee to come and be ſaved: How many means hath God uſed to call thee to himſelf? Every good motion is a <hi>call;</hi> every Preacher a <hi>meſſenger</hi> ſent from Heaven to invite thee to Chriſt; every Sermon a <hi>new ſummons:</hi> Plead with thy ſelf, Though God hath not <hi>drawn</hi> me, yet he hath <hi>warned</hi> me. The <hi>Elect</hi> have no more favour in the <hi>general means</hi> then thou haſt: Though Gods grace be limitted by the pleaſure of his Wiſdom, yet thou haſt a <hi>fair warrant</hi> and <hi>encouragement,</hi> and every way as good a ground to come to Chriſt as others have; <hi>Whoſoever, &amp;c. John</hi> 6. 37. When the Goſpel doth not exclude me, why ſhould I exclude my ſelf? Doubts that God will not accept me if I come, are but fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh jealouſies without a cauſe.

if we <hi>take ſanctuary at Grace;</hi> for God is now upon a <hi>treaty</hi> with us, or <hi>offer of peace;</hi> therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Peace on Earth, Luke</hi> 2. 14.

But now on our part this enmity is carryed on with a great deal of ſpight; We ſeek to <hi>deſtroy God,</hi> and to deface all the memorials of him that are impreſſed upon the Conſcience; we <hi>ungod</hi> him in our thoughts and affections: 'tis a <hi>pleaſing thought</hi> to us to ſuppoſe <hi>if there were no God;</hi> as guilty pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners wiſh there were <hi>no Judg, no Aſſizes,</hi> that they may not be called to account.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Man being at enmity with God, all Gods creatures are at enmity with him: Angels, men fire, ayr, water, they are all at Gods beck,</hi> and are ready to deſtroy man when ever the Lord biddeth them; as good Subjects take part with their Prince againſt Rebels: The Angels <hi>harken for the voyce of his Word, Pſal.</hi> 103. If he do but <hi>hiſs for the fly of Egypt, Iſa.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis ready preſently: 'Tis ill conteſting with him that can <hi>command Legions;</hi> The <hi>fire</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let me burn his houſe or dwelling place;</hi> the <hi>water</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let me drown his ſhips;</hi> the <hi>Earth, Let me ſwallow him up quick as I did Corah and his complices.</hi> Certainly the Lord cannot want inſtruments of Vengeance: Man as <hi>Gods creature</hi> is his <hi>own enemy:</hi> God needeth not fetch forces from <hi>without,</hi> there is enough <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> the <hi>humors</hi> of the body, the <hi>paſſions</hi> of the mind, all theſe are willing to ſerve God as creatures for our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that if God ſhould but arm our <hi>own thoughts,</hi> our <hi>own affections</hi> againſt us, man is ſoon overwhelmed: Who can bear <hi>the wounds</hi> given him by his own Conſcience?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>We being in this eſtate, can only be reconciled by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> He <hi>obtaineth</hi> it by his <hi>Merit,</hi> and <hi>conferreth</hi> it by his <hi>Power.</hi> For his <hi>Merit,</hi> ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. and <hi>Iſai. 53. 5. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of our Peace was upon him:</hi> It will not ſtand with the Majeſty of God to make Peace with us without <hi>ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> That there might be no wrong done to his <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> his <hi>Law,</hi> his <hi>Truth,</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> it was meet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115193:54"/>
that we ſhould be <hi>chaſtiſed</hi> either in our <hi>own perſons</hi> or in <hi>our Surety;</hi> and alſo all the notions of the Godhead are kept inviolable. Then for his <hi>Power;</hi> He <hi>worketh it at firſt,</hi> and then <hi>maintaineth</hi> and <hi>keepeth it afoot</hi> between God and us: He worketh it at firſt, and bringeth it about thus, by <hi>opening the Goſpel,</hi> wherein God is revealed as pacified in Chriſt; which is the only doctrine that can <hi>calm the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and eſtabliſh the Soul in peace and hope: All <hi>falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions</hi> are accompanied with <hi>ſcruples</hi> and <hi>jealouſies, Jer.</hi> 6. 16. there is <hi>no reſt for the Soul.</hi> And then he applyeth the Goſpel by his Spirit: The Goſpel is a <hi>ſoveraign Plaiſter,</hi> but Chriſts own hand muſt make it ſtick. There is a double ground of enmity in mans heart, the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of ſin; Chriſt wipeth <hi>guilt</hi> out of the conſcience by the application of his own blood, and weakeneth the <hi>power</hi> of ſin more and more: <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>Makebate,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Prince of Peace, Iſa</hi> 9. 6. The great end for which God ſet him up, was to plant grace in our hearts, and ſo to work a friendſhip between God and us. But Chriſt is not only the <hi>Author,</hi> but the <hi>great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator</hi> of the Peace between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> Partly by his <hi>Interceſſion:</hi> as forreign States have their Agents in Princes Courts to preſerve a mutual Correſpondence; ſo Chriſt taketh up all differences that fall out between us and God, that no breach may enſue, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. Partly by a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Gods love to the conſcience, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 3. Partly by ſtirring us up to watchfulneſs, that no occaſion may be given on our part by <hi>returning to folly, Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. Thus you ſee what Chriſt doth; all is briefly ſummed up by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. God was in Chriſt reconciling the World:</hi> Where note, that our peace with God is a <hi>reconciliation</hi> or a peace after a breach, and this <hi>reconciliation is mutual;</hi> God appeareth in a <hi>form of grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to us, and we lay down <hi>cur enmity</hi> againſt God; he is <hi>gracious</hi> to us, and we <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> him: only obſerve, that God <hi>beginneth firſt,</hi> though he the <hi>wronged party;</hi> he <hi>was reconciling:</hi> And mark again, 'tis <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> to ſhew 'tis <hi>ſure:</hi> Thoſe that are reconciled to men, are ſtill in <hi>

not return to <hi>perfect grace;</hi> When the <hi>wound</hi> is cured, the <hi>ſcars</hi> remain: But our reconciliation with God 'tis like the <hi>ſodering of a veſſel,</hi> which is ſtrongeſt in <hi>the crack;</hi> or as a leg broken, if <hi>well ſet,</hi> it is the ſtronger: ſo are vve upon <hi>firmer terms</hi> then vve vvere <hi>in innocency;</hi> there vvas a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of being at odds vvith God, vvhich is novv taken avvay.</p>

that never ſtirreth, doth not feel the lameneſs of his joynts: <hi>Formal duties</hi> make men the more ſecure; as the Phariſee thought himſelf in a good caſe, becauſe, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. but <hi>ſpiritual duties</hi> ſearch us to the purpoſe, as <hi>new wine</hi> doth <hi>old bottles.</hi> Or elſe ſecondly, They do not <hi>exasperate their luſts,</hi> and ſeriouſly reſiſt ſin: Tumult is made by <hi>oppoſition.</hi> When a man yeildeth to Satan, no wonder that Satan lets him alone: <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21. The <hi>goods are in peace,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Devils poſſeſſion</hi> is not diſturbed; he rageth moſt when his Kingdom is tottering <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. Pleaſe the <hi>worſt natures,</hi> and they will not trouble you: There is no tempeſt where <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tyde</hi> go together: You let <hi>Satan</hi> alone, and he lets you alone; this is a <hi>peace</hi> that will end in <hi>trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now come to ſpeak of the third thing prayed for, and<note place="margin">Love.</note> that is <hi>Love,</hi> which (being taken here not for <hi>Gods love</hi> to us, but <hi>our love to God</hi>) may be thus defined; <hi>'Tis a gracious and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Definition.</note> 
                  <hi>holy affection, which the Soul upon the apprehenſion of Gods love in Chriſt, returneth back to God again by his own grace.</hi> The<note place="margin">1. Grounds &amp; Cauſes of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it are two; the one worketh by way of <hi>argument</hi> and <hi>ſwaſion,</hi> the other by way of <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It ariſeth from <hi>the ſenſe and apprehenſions of Gods love in Chriſt.</hi> Love is like a <hi>Diamond,</hi> that is not wrought upon but by its <hi>own duſt: 1 John 4. 19. We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> Love is like an <hi>eccho,</hi> it <hi>returneth</hi> what it <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;</hi> 'tis a <hi>reflex,</hi> a <hi>reverberation,</hi> or a caſting back of Gods <hi>beam</hi> and <hi>flame</hi> upon himſelf. The <hi>cold wall</hi> ſendeth back no <hi>reflex of heat</hi> till the Sun ſhine upon it, and warm it firſt: ſo neither do we love God till the Soul be firſt filled with a ſenſe of his Love: And as <note n="*" place="margin">Radius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexus languet.</note> rays in their relection are more faint and cold; ſo our <hi>love to God</hi> is much weaker then <hi>Gods love</hi> to us. <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> ſaith, <hi>God loveth the loweſt Saint more then the higheſt Angel loveth God.</hi> Once more, The more <hi>direct</hi> the ſtroke and beam is upon the wall, or any other <hi>ſolid body,</hi> the ſtronger always is the reflection; ſo the more ſenſe we have of the love of God, the ſtronger is our love to him.</p>
               <p>2. The next Cauſe of Love is the <hi>grace of God:</hi> there is not only an <hi>apprehenſion of Love,</hi> but the <hi>force of the Spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:115193:57"/>
goeth along with it: Our <hi>thoughts,</hi> our <hi>diſcourſes</hi> upon the love of God to us in Chriſt, nay our <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of it, is not enough to beget this grace in us. Love is a <hi>pure flame,</hi> that muſt be kindled <hi>from above,</hi> as the <hi>Veſtal fire</hi> by a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam. 1 John 4. 7. Love is of God;</hi> that is, of a celeſtial or heavenly original. There is in the Soul naturally an <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>hatred of God,</hi> and a <hi>proneneſs to mingle with preſent comforts,</hi> which can only be cured by the Spirit of grace: Our <hi>naked appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions</hi> will not break the force of <hi>natural enmity;</hi> and 'tis God that muſt <hi>circumciſe</hi> and pare away the foreskin of the heart before we can <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. There is a natural proneneſs to <hi>dote upon the creature,</hi> and <hi>hate the Creator.</hi> Baſe creatures <hi>neglect God,</hi> and <hi>pollute themſelves with one another;</hi> and there is no help for it till the heart be over-powered by grace. Thus for the Cauſes of Love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of Love is <hi>God</hi> himſelf; not meerly as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>in himſelf,</hi> for ſo he is <hi>terrible</hi> to the creature; but as <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> for ſo he will be known and reſpected by us in the Goſpel, and ſo we have the higheſt engagement to love him; not only upon the reſpects of <hi>Nature,</hi> as <hi>our Creator,</hi> but of <hi>Grace,</hi> as <hi>our God</hi> and <hi>Father in Chriſt.</hi> Now God is the <hi>ſupream Object</hi> of Love, and other things are loved for <hi>Gods ſake,</hi> becauſe of that of God which we find in them: as <hi>his Word,</hi> which is the Copy of his Holineſs; his <hi>engraven Image;</hi> as the Coyn beareth the image of the Prince; ſo 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 119. 47. I will delight my ſelf in thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I have loved.</hi> And then <hi>his Saints,</hi> which are his <hi>living Image,</hi> as children reſemble their father; ſo 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 16. 3. To the Saints, and to the excellent of the Earth, in whom is my delight.</hi> And then <hi>other men,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 1 Pet. 1. 5. Add to brotherly-kindneſs, love.</hi> So his <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> becauſe in them we enjoy God, the effects of his Bounty. But chiefly <hi>his Ordinances,</hi> as they exhibit more of God then the <hi>creatures</hi> can: So that Love reſpects <hi>God</hi> and other things for <hi>Gods ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, In the Deſcription I take notice of the <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> nature of it, and call it <hi>the return of a gracious and holy affection to God.</hi> Love is carryed out to its Object two ways,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115193:58"/>
by <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>delight:</hi> Our <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>need</hi> of God is the ground of <hi>deſire;</hi> and our <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> is the ground of <hi>delight: Deſires</hi> are <hi>the feet of love,</hi> by which it runneth after its Object; and <hi>delight</hi> is the <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>contentment</hi> of the Soul in the enjoyment of it: Becauſe of our <hi>imperfect fruition</hi> in this life, <hi>Love</hi> bewrayeth it ſelf by <hi>deſires</hi> moſtly, or purſuing after God: See <hi>Pſal. 63. 8. My heart followeth hard after thee:</hi> It noteth thoſe <hi>ſallies</hi> and <hi>earneſt egreſſions</hi> of Soul after the Lord, that we may have more communion and fellowſhip with him. In ſhort, the <hi>radical</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) and principal diſpoſition of <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>deſire of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> for all other effects of love flow from it: This is that makes the Soul to <hi>prize</hi> the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> becauſe God is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed there; and theſe are means of communion with him; <hi>Pſal. 26. 8. I have loved the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi> This maketh <hi>ſin terrible,</hi> becauſe it <hi>ſeparateth from God, Iſai.</hi> 59. 2. This maketh <hi>Heaven amiable;</hi> the faireſt part of our portion in Heaven is a cloſer and nearer communion with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. This maketh the <hi>day of Judgment ſweet,</hi> for then we ſhall <hi>meet with our Beloved in the ayr, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 18. In ſhort, this maketh the Soul to take ſuch contentment in <hi>thinking</hi> of God, and <hi>ſpeaking</hi> of God; 'tis the feaſt of the Soul; <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, Pſal.</hi> 104. 34. Their Souls cannot have a greater ſolace then to think what a God they have in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Having in ſome manner deſcribed the Love of God, let<note place="margin">Reaſons why we muſt love God. 1. God hath commended it.</note> me uſe ſome Arguments to preſs you to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God hath commanded it:</hi> The ſum of the Law is Love. When the Scribe came to Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 22. 36. Maſter, which is the great Commandment in the Law? Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul, and all thy might:</hi> Mark, this is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>great Commandment,</hi> to love God; 'Tis not a <hi>ſour</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>profitable:</hi> God might have burdened us with other manner of Precepts, conſidering his <hi>abſolute right;</hi> to offer our children in ſacrifice, to mangle our fleſh with whips and ſcourges; but theſe are <hi>cruelties</hi> proper to the <hi>Devils worſhip.</hi> The Lord is a <hi>gentle Maſter,</hi> and only
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115193:58"/>
deſireth <hi>the love of his ſervants;</hi> we have cauſe to thank him for ſuch a <hi>gracious Precept.</hi> If he ſhould require us not to love him, this were <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf; that is the <hi>Hell of Hell,</hi> that they which are there do not <hi>love God.</hi> 'Tis our <hi>priviledg</hi> as much as our <hi>duty.</hi> God loveth <hi>all his creatures,</hi> but hath commanded none to love him again but <hi>man</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> ſo that it is the great <hi>priviledg</hi> of the Saints, to <hi>love God.</hi> It had been a <hi>great favour</hi> if God had <hi>given us leave</hi> to love him: as it would be a great favour if <hi>a King ſhould give leave</hi> to one of his <hi>meaneſt Subjects</hi> to have the key of his privy Chamber, to come to him and viſit him, and be familiar with him when he pleaſeth; how would this be talked of in the world! yet this is not ſo wonderful, ſince the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Peaſant</hi> are <hi>both men;</hi> in their <hi>natural being</hi> they are <hi>equal,</hi> though in their <hi>civil diſtinction</hi> and <hi>condition of life</hi> there be a <hi>difference.</hi> But what a favour is this, that he who is the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> doth not only <hi>permit</hi> his creature made by his own hands to come to him, and love him, and deal with him when he pleaſeth, but hath <hi>expreſly commanded it?</hi> nay this is <hi>the great Commandment:</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is very deſirous of our love, when he layeth <hi>ſuch an obligation</hi> upon us: Was there ever ſuch a Maſter, that made this to be his ſervants chiefeſt duty, that they ſhould <hi>love him?</hi> Again, I obſerve in Gods Command that the Precept runneth thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> The Lord would not loſe one grain of the creatures love; Surely he <hi>valued</hi> it, when he is ſo <hi>ſollicitous</hi> about it. If we ſhould ſee a <hi>wiſe man</hi> careful to preſerve <hi>the reliques</hi> of what we counted <hi>a neglected weed,</hi> it would make us think there were ſomewhat in it. We laviſh away our love upon <hi>trifles,</hi> and God prizeth <hi>every grain of it:</hi> you ſee he ſpeaketh as if he would not loſe one duſt of love; <hi>all thy ſoul, all thy heart, and all thy might.</hi> When he biddeth us love our neighbor, he ſets limits to it, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf;</hi> but when he biddeth us love God, he requireth <hi>all the heart:</hi> The only meaſure is to love him without meaſure. The next place that I ſhall take notice of, where the Precept is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115193:59"/>
recorded, is <hi>Deut. 10. 12. And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul?</hi> God doth not require of us things without the <hi>ſphere of duty;</hi> that we ſhould go into the depths of the Sea, toſs mountains in the ayr, pluck the ſtars from Heaven, &amp;c. theſe things lie out of the <hi>power of man:</hi> He doth not require of us <hi>barbarous auſterities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to offer <hi>our firſt-born,</hi> to lance our ſelves, to mangle our fleſh with whips and ſcourges: He doth not require of us abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſuch things which ſome men can and ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; not ſuch a <hi>meaſure of alms,</hi> what then would become of the <hi>poor?</hi> not ſuch a <hi>degree of wiſdom and learning,</hi> what then would become of the <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>unlearned?</hi> But <hi>O Iſrael, what hath the Lord required of thee, but that thou ſhouldſt love the Lord thy God?</hi> A duty to be performed by <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>rich, learned</hi> and <hi>unlearned;</hi> what ever their eſtate and condition be, they may all <hi>love God:</hi> There are many in Heaven that never were in a condition to <hi>give,</hi> but to <hi>receive,</hi> that were never <hi>learned,</hi> and <hi>skilled in ſciences,</hi> but none that <hi>never loved God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God hath deſerved love.</hi> Let us a little take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice<note place="margin">2 Reaſon, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it.</note> of <hi>Gods love to us;</hi> He <hi>beginneth,</hi> and loveth us, that we may love him again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. If God ſhould <hi>hate</hi> us, we were bound to <hi>love him,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>excellency,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> as we are <hi>creatures;</hi> how much more when God hath <hi>loved us,</hi> and beſtowed ſo many benefits upon us? <hi>Love</hi> is an affection which God will have repayed <hi>in kind:</hi> When he <hi>chideth</hi> us, he doth not expect that we ſhould <hi>chide</hi> him again; when he <hi>judgeth</hi> us, we muſt not <hi>judg</hi> him again: in theſe things the creature is not to <hi>retaliate:</hi> 'Tis true, we do it too often, but ſtill to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But now when he <hi>loveth</hi> us, he willeth us to <hi>love</hi> him again; he <hi>loveth</hi> us for no other cauſe but that he may be <hi>loved;</hi> Love muſt be payd in kind: As water is caſt into a Pump when the ſprings lie low to bring up more water; ſo God ſheddeth abroad his love into our hearts, that our love may riſe up to him again by way of <hi>gratitude</hi>

From everlaſting to everlaſting, &amp;c.</hi> With reverence we may ſpeak, ever ſince God was God he was <hi>our God:</hi> You may track his Love from <hi>one Eternity</hi> to <hi>another; Before the world was</hi> he loved us, and when the <hi>world is no more</hi> he loveth us ſtill: His Love began in <hi>eternal purpoſes of Grace,</hi> and it endeth in our <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal poſſeſſion of Glory.</hi> 'Tis not a thing <hi>of yeſterday;</hi> he is our <hi>ancient Friend;</hi> He loved us not only before <hi>we were lovely,</hi> but before <hi>we were</hi> at all. We adjourn and put off our love of God to old age, and thruſt it into a narrow corner: When we have waſted and ſpent our ſtrength in the <hi>world,</hi> we dream of a <hi>devout retirement:</hi> But the Lord thinketh he could never love us <hi>early enough; From everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, &amp;c.</hi> We receive the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of Love in time, but all cometh out of Gods <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Love; this grace was provided for us <hi>before we were born.</hi> Yea look upon Gods Love <hi>in time;</hi> how merciful was God to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could ſhew the <hi>leaſt ſign of thankefulneſs</hi> to him?

                  <hi>God</hi> in giving Chriſt, and the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> in giving himſelf. When the <hi>Sea wrought and was tempeſtuous,</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaw the ſtorm, he ſaid, <hi>Caſt me into the Sea, and it ſhall be calm to you;</hi> but the ſtorm was raiſed for his <hi>own ſake.</hi> Now Chriſt when he ſaw the miſery of mankind, he ſaid, <hi>Let it come on me;</hi> We raiſed the ſtorm, but Chriſt would be caſt in to allay it. If a Prince paſſing by an execution ſhould take the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors chains, and ſuffer in his ſtead, this would be a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtance indeed: Why? <hi>Chriſt hath born our ſorrows and carryed our griefs, Iſai.</hi> 53. 4. the very ſame griefs that we ſhould have ſuffered, ſo far as his holy Perſon was capable of them: his <hi>deſertion</hi> was equivalent to <hi>our loſs,</hi> his <hi>agonies</hi> to our <hi>curſe</hi> and <hi>puniſhment of ſenſe;</hi> and all this very willingly for the ſake of ſinners. 'Tis notable, he doth with like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation <hi>rebuke Peter</hi> diſſwading him from ſufferings, as he doth <hi>the Devil</hi> tempting him to Idolatry, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. He is well pleaſed with all his ſorrows and ſufferings, ſo he may gain the Church, and eſpouſe her to himſelf in a firm League and Covenant: <hi>Iſai. 53. 11. He ſhall ſee the travel of his Soul, and be ſatisfied;</hi> as if he ſaid, <hi>Welcome agonies,</hi> welcome <hi>death,</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>curſe,</hi> ſo poor Souls be ſaved! As <hi>Jacob</hi> counted the days of his labour nothing, ſo he might obtain <hi>Rachel;</hi> and yet there is a vaſt difference between the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>love of Jacob: Rachel</hi> was <hi>lovely,</hi> but we are <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy creatures;</hi> and Chriſts <hi>love is infinite,</hi> even beyond his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> and the <hi>outward expreſſions</hi> of it; as the windows of the Temple were more large and open within then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Well then, every one of Chriſts wounds is a mouth open to plead for love; He made himſelf ſo vile, that he might be more dear and precious to us: Certainly if Love brought Chriſt out of Heaven to the Croſs, to the grave, ſhould it not carry us to Heaven? to God? to Chriſt, who hath been thus gracious to us? Thus God hath deſerved our love.</p>
               <p>The third and next Argument is, <hi>God hath deſired it:</hi> What<note place="margin">3. God hath deſired it.</note> doth the Lord ſee in our hearts that he ſhould deſire them? If <hi>a Prince</hi> ſhould not only <hi>make love</hi> to <hi>a vile and abject</hi>

Chriſt doth not only <hi>oblige</hi> us, but <hi>woo</hi> us: If man were ſuch as he ſhould be, he would not need <hi>enforcements,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>multitude of his obligations;</hi> and if the Lord did deal with us as we deſerve, he would <hi>ſlight</hi> us and <hi>ſcorn</hi> us, rather then <hi>woo</hi> us: He doth not <hi>want lovers,</hi> there are <hi>Angels</hi> enough in Heaven, whoſe wills and affections cleave to him perfectly; yea God doth not need the love of any creature, all this wooing is for <hi>our ſakes;</hi> Wherein can frail men be beneficial to God? What increaſe of happineſs hath he if all men ſhould love him? 'Tis his happineſs to love himſelf, and he would have us to ſhare in this happineſs; therefore he <hi>threateneth,</hi> and <hi>promiſeth,</hi> and <hi>beſeecheth:</hi> As one that would gladly open a door, tryeth key after key, till he hath tryed every key in the bunch; ſo doth God try one method after another to work upon mans heart.</p>
               <p>He <hi>threateneth eternal torments</hi> if we do not love him:<note place="margin">1. Threatneth.</note> 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha:</hi> The form of ſpeech imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the moſt dreadful curſe that may be: 'Tis not arbitrary, whether you will love him or no; you are either to love him, or to periſh eternally. Among men if love doth not come kindly, we neglect it; that which is forced is nothing worth: yet the Lord is ſo earneſt after the love of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he would have it by any means.</p>
               <p>He <hi>promiſeth:</hi> We have not only mercies <hi>in hand,</hi> but<note place="margin">2.

The Lord will give a gift for a gift, becauſe he hath given us to love him; therefore he will give us Heaven as the reward of love. Who

If you loſe but a ring which you affect, how are you troubled till it be found again! <hi>Ye have taken away my gods</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>and do you ask, What aileth thee? Judg.</hi> 18. 24. So when God is withdrawn, all viſits of love and influences of grace are ſuſpended, and they have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in their duties, <hi>ſhould they not mourn?</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 15.

               <p>1. <hi>Prize nothing that cometh from God, unleſs thou canſt ſee his love in it.</hi> God giveth <hi>many gifts</hi> to wicked men, but he doth not give them <hi>his love:</hi> The poſſeſſion of all things will do us no good, unleſs we have <hi>God himſelf;</hi> other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may be ſalted with a curſe. Gods children are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied till they can ſee him and enjoy him in every comfort and mercy. <hi>Eſau</hi> was reconciled to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and therefore <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gen. 33. 10.

               <p>2. <hi>Prize nothing that thou return to God, unleſs there be love in it.</hi> We accept a <hi>ſmall gift</hi> where the party loveth, and otherwiſe the <hi>greateſt</hi> is refuſed: <hi>If I give my body to be burned, and have not love, &amp;c. 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 1.

                  </note> there will be <hi>growth;</hi> and if grace be <hi>true,</hi> it will ſurely <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> A <hi>painted flower</hi> keepeth always at the ſame pitch and ſtature; the Artiſt may beſtow <hi>beauty</hi> upon it, but he cannot beſtow <hi>life:</hi> A <hi>painted child</hi> will be as little ten years hence as it is now. So a pretence of Religion always keepeth at the ſame ſtay; yea when their <hi>firſt heats</hi> are ſpent, they are <hi>fearfully blaſted:</hi> But now they that have <hi>true grace</hi> are compared to a <hi>living plant,</hi> which increaſeth in bulk and ſtature, <hi>Pſal</hi> 92. 12, 13. and to a <hi>living child,</hi> which groweth by receiving kindly nouriſhment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. Therefore 'tis not enough to get <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> but we muſt get them <hi>multiplyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2.

wherein are many notable things applicable <hi>to growth in Grace;</hi> ſaith, that a man that hath made ſome progreſs in virtue is like a Phyſitian, that coming into a Garden he doth not conſider flowers for their <hi>beauty</hi> as gallants do, but for their <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> in medicine; So he doth not conſider ſpeech for its <hi>fineneſs</hi> but <hi>fitneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> to preſent uſe; the ſame holdeth good alſo in growth in grace, the more we grow the more we regard the ſpirituall part of the Word and ſuch as is of a practicall uſe and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>It ſheweth us how far they are from being Chriſtians, that care not for the leaſt degree of Grace, that do not ſpend a thought that way, theſe <hi>are farre from the Kingdome of God.</hi>

upon the <hi>promiſes</hi> of it?

So, what will you forbear upon the <hi>threatenings of the Word?</hi> If there were a Law made, that every time we deceive or ſlander one another we ſhould hold one of our hands in ſcalding Lead for half an hour, men would be afraid of the offence.

               </p>
               <p>1. To <hi>publiſh, own and defend the Truth,</hi> by <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Martyrdom;</hi> and therefore the Church is called <hi>the pillar and ground of Truth, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 15. namely in reſpect <hi>of men,</hi> and as it <hi>holdeth it forth</hi> to the world; and therefore we ought to harken to the <hi>Churches teſtimony</hi> till we have <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence:</hi> We do not <hi>ultimately</hi> reſove our faith into

               </p>
               <p>2. The next Office of the Church is to <hi>preſerve the Truth, and tranſmit it pure to the next age:</hi> As the <hi>Law</hi> was kept in the <hi>Ark,</hi> ſo was Truth delivered to the Church to be kept. 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 11.

               <p>Theſe things might be obſerved, but I ſhall rather pitch upon two Points; one <hi>particular,</hi> and reſtrained to the ſcope of the Context; the other <hi>general,</hi> as being taken from the conſideration of the expreſſions in their full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:<note place="margin">Obſervat. 5.</note> The firſt is, <hi>That Hereſies and Errors do not fall out by chance, but according to the certain pre-ordination and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God.</hi> There are two Reaſons for it, <hi>Nothing can come to paſs without his Will,</hi> and <hi>Nothing can come to paſs againſt his Will.</hi> 1.

Exempt any thing from Providence, and you weaken that reſpect which is due from the creatures to God: If Satan may do what he will, and God only be a <hi>looker on,</hi> then the <hi>Devil-worſhip</hi> of the Heathens would ſeem more rational; 'twas their cuſtom firſt to <hi>appeaſe the angry gods</hi> leſt they ſhould hurt them, and then to <hi>invoke the propitious:</hi> Upon this doctrine we might fear the Devil and carnal men, though God be propitious for many things are done whether he will or no. 2.

To open this Doctrine. 2. To prove it. 3. To vindicate it. 4. To apply it: In the <hi>Firſt,</hi> you will underſtand <hi>the Nature:</hi> In the Second, the <hi>Reaſons:</hi> In the Third, <hi>the Righteouſneſs;</hi> In the Fourth <hi>the profit</hi> of this Decree.</p>
               <p>1. I ſhall open the Nature of it in ſeveral propoſitions. 1. 'Tis <hi>an Eternal Decree:</hi> Gods <hi>Internal Acts</hi> are the ſame with his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and therefore before all time, as beleevers are <hi>Elected before all worlds, Eph.</hi> 1. 4. ſo are ſinners repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, they are both in <hi>time</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> before ever the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was, Rom. 9. 11. <hi>Before the Creatures had done either good or evil, it was ſaid, Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated. Election and Reprobation</hi> are not a thing of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and ſubſequent to the Acts of the creature; but from all Eternity. 2. <hi>There is a Decree and preordination, not onely a naked fore-ſight of thoſe that periſh:</hi> Some <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay that <hi>Praedeſtination</hi> is proper onely to the <hi>Elect;</hi> but as to the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> there is onely a <hi>praeſcience</hi> or <hi>naked fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge:</hi> no <hi>Preordination,</hi> leaſt they ſhould make God <hi>the Author</hi> of the creatures <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ruin;</hi> but theſe men fear
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115193:99"/>
where no fear is, the Scriptures ſhew that the greateſt evil that ever was, did not onely fall under the <hi>Fore-knowledge,</hi> but <hi>determinate Counſel of God, Acts</hi> 2. 23. 'twas not onely fore-known, but unchangeably ordained and determined. 3. <hi>This Decree of God, is founded in his own good will and pleaſure;</hi> for there being nothing higher and greater then God, 'tis a great errour to ſuppoſe a cauſe of his will, either <hi>before</hi> it, <hi>above</hi> it, or <hi>without</hi> it: Gods actions do all begin in himſelf, and his Will is the <hi>ſupream Reaſon,</hi> Mat. 11. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Even ſo Father becauſe it ſeemed good in thy ſight:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt would give no other reaſon why the Goſpel was <hi>hidden from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed unto Babes:</hi> we are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſputing, why of two men that are <hi>equal in miſery,</hi> the one ſhould be taken the other left; why the Lord will ſhew mercy to ſome that are no leſs unworthy then others; but when we have all done, we muſt meerly reſt in the Will and good Pleaſure of God, <hi>Even ſo Father, &amp;c.</hi> See Rom. 9. 18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth:</hi> 'tis not from the fore-ſight of our wills re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or rejecting grace propoſed, for then mans will would be made a <hi>ſuperiour cauſe</hi> to an act in God. 4. <hi>In this matter of Reprobation, Preterition, and Praedamnation, muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed:</hi> look as in <hi>Election,</hi> God hath declared to beſtow firſt, <hi>grace,</hi> and then <hi>glory,</hi> to the Decree of giving grace <hi>preterition</hi> is oppoſed, to the Decree of giving glory, <hi>

Ye beleeve not becauſe ye are not of my ſheep,</hi> that is, not elected of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaving grace runneth in the Channel of Election, ſo <hi>Acts 13. 48. as many as were ordained to eternal life beleeved</hi> Gods <hi>ſpecial gifts</hi> are diſpenſed according to his <hi>Decrees. 6. Men being left of God and deſtitute of ſaving grace, freely, and of their own accord fall into ſuch ſins as render them obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to the juſt wrath and vengeance of God,</hi> Rom. 11. 7. <hi>The Election hath obtained, and the reſt were hardened,</hi> freely and of their own accord, they turned all things to their own judgement and ruine: ſo Rev. 13. 11. <hi>The dwellers on earth did worſhip the whore, whoſe names were not written in the Book of life,</hi> that is, they turned aſide to Antichriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, and pollutions. 7. <hi>Gods Decree concerning ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is immutable,</hi> it is not reſcinded and diſannuled, but is fully executed and accompliſhed in the damnation of the ſinner; the Lords Counſels are all unchangeable, both as to <hi>Election, 2 Tim. 2. 18. Heb.</hi> 6. 17. and <hi>as to Reprobation,</hi> no Reprobate can be an Elect perſon, nor an Elect perſon a Reprobate, <hi>Job. 12. 14.

               <p>2ly. Let me prove that there is ſuch a Decree, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for reaſon here hath no place, take here three that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115193:100"/>
are moſt full; the firſt is 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 9. God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which plainly implyeth that <hi>ſome are appointed unto wrath:</hi> The ſecond is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome that were diſobedient and refuſed Chriſt, <hi>whereunto alſo they were appointed:</hi> The third place is <hi>Prov. 16. 4.

               <p>But now for the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why God hath choſen ſome and appointed others by ſin to come unto judgement: I can onely tell you that <hi>Gods judgements are paſt finding out, Rom.</hi> 11. 33. We muſt <hi>admire,</hi> we cannot <hi>ſearch</hi> them to the bottom: ſo far as God hath revealed his Will, we may clearly judge that 'tis for the diſcovery of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> neither of which could have been diſcovered to the world with that advantage, had it not been for his double Decree of God to ſave ſome and leave others to their own ruin: if grace were given <hi>to all,</hi> how ſhould the word know that God were <hi>free;</hi> again, if <hi>all</hi> were pardoned, how ſhould the world know that God were <hi>juſt:</hi> in <hi>Election,</hi> God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the <hi>freeneſs of his grace, Eph.</hi> 1. 6. 'tis <hi>love,</hi> that we injoy grace, <hi>elective love,</hi> that we enjoy it alone: In <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> God diſcovereth his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and by it, the <hi>ſecurity of his juſtice,</hi> and <hi>power of his wrath, Rom.</hi> 9. 22. in chuſing one and leaving another, there God diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his <hi>Liberty,</hi> and that he doth not act out of <hi>ſervile ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> and his <hi>ſeverity</hi> in the eternal pains of them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſins.</p>
               <p>3. Let me vindicate this Doctrine, which in the eyes of ſome ſeemeth to blemiſh the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> to infringe the <hi>comfort of man;</hi> Yea to aboliſh the <hi>duty of man;</hi> therefore it needeth a little cleering, reaſon cannot eaſily digeſt this ſtrong meat: partly becauſe we are apt to <hi>reprehend</hi> what cannot <hi>comprehend,</hi> partly becauſe this Doctrine checketh carnal eaſe and ſecurity, which is uſually fed with a <hi>general</hi>

In regard of God, that you may not pollute and ſtain his excellency, with impure and prejudicial thoughts: you will ſay, is God juſt, that onely upon his will and pleaſure ordaineth his creatures to condemnation; hath not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates cauſe to complain if he hath paſſed a Decree upon which their condemnation doth infallibly follow? I anſwer, 1. our underſtandings are not the meaſure of Gods Juſtice, but his own will, things may be juſt, though the reaſons of them do not appear to us, humane reaſon groweth giddy, by peeping into the deep of Gods Decrees, our worke is not to <hi>dispute,</hi> but <hi>wonder:</hi> Gods freedom is a riddle to reaſon, becauſe though we will not be bound to Laws, yet we are willing God ſhould be bound: Gods Actions muſt not be meaſured by any <hi>external rule,</hi> things are good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God willeth them, for his Will is Juſtice it ſelf. 2. The Electing of ſome, and paſſing by of others, is not an Act of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but <hi>dominion;</hi> for he doth not act here as <hi>a Judge,</hi> but as <hi>a Lord;</hi> 'tis a matter <hi>of favour</hi> not of <hi>right and wrong condemnation</hi> of a man for ſin, or <hi>puniſhing</hi> a man for ſin, is act of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> but to <hi>have mercy,</hi> or <hi>not to have mercy,</hi> that dependeth meerly upon <hi>Gods will,</hi> otherwiſe it would follow, that God were <hi>a debtor</hi> unto man: <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>debt,</hi> or ſomething due, no <hi>wrong</hi> is done them in not giving grace, the Elect can ſpeak of <hi>undeſerved grace,</hi> and the Reprobate of <hi>deſerved puniſhment;</hi> when we are not bound to do good, if we act according to pleaſure, there is no injury, as in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, preferments, and all acts of favour: we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

that a right ſhould be challenged; the good man in the Parable pleaded, <hi>I may do with mine own as it pleaſeth me, Mat.</hi> 20. 15. The Lord may juſtly challenge grace as his own, and therefore leave him to his pleaſure in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; for he is bound to none. 3. Gods not giving grace to the Reprobate, is not <hi>their ſin,</hi> but <hi>their miſery,</hi> Preterition made them <hi>miſerable,</hi> but not <hi>ſinful:</hi> it doth not infer a <hi>Coaction</hi> and <hi>compulſion</hi> to ſin, ſin followeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it not as an <hi>effect,</hi> but a <hi>conſequent;</hi> as upon the abſent of the Sun, darkneſs doth neceſſarily follow, and yet the Sun is not the cauſe of darkneſs: In grace God <hi>purpoſeth,</hi> God <hi>worketh,</hi> in ſin God <hi>ordereth</hi> the ſin, and <hi>maketh uſe of it</hi> to the glory of his Juſtice: but man ſinneth <hi>freely:</hi> the water while it runneth its own courſe, ſerveth the end of the Lord of the Soyl, in driving Mils, and bringing fiſh into his Ponds, and overflowing his Meadows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So God cauſeth not ſin in any, onely <hi>permitteth</hi> it and <hi>endureth</hi> it, and <hi>ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> his righteous ends of it, <hi>Rom. 9. 24.

Yet <hi>Davids order</hi> was no cauſe of <hi>Joabs</hi> death, but his own <hi>treaſon,</hi> nor of <hi>Shimeis</hi> death, but his <hi>own flight:</hi> God never damneth the creature, or decreeth to damn it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſin; <hi>Gods Will</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>Preterition,</hi> his Juſtice is the cauſe of <hi>Predamnation,</hi> for damnation is an act of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Justice:</hi> God is <hi>ſo juſt,</hi> that he doth not condemn any, but for ſin; ſo <hi>gracious,</hi> that he doth not condemn every man that doth ſin. 5.

God <hi>deſireth</hi> and <hi>effecteth</hi> the ſalvation of a ſinner in a ſubordination to his own glory; but in <hi>Preterition,</hi> God endureth a ſinner with much long ſuffering, till by his own deſtruction, he bringeth to him the glory of his juſtice, <hi>Ezek 23. 11. As I live ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of a ſinner,</hi> So Ezek. 18. 23. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all, that the wicked ſhould dye?</hi> the meaning is, God doth not will theſe things with ſuch a will as is <hi>terminated in the destruction of the creature,</hi> but onely ordereth them in a <hi>ſubornination to his own glory,</hi> or in plainer terms, God delighteth not in the <hi>deſtruction of a ſinner,</hi> as 'tis the <hi>deſtruction of the creature;</hi> but as it is the <hi>execution of Justice:</hi> in the execution of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, there is a difference between <hi>puniſhment</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;</hi> his <hi>puniſhment</hi> is of the <hi>Judge,</hi> his <hi>deſtruction</hi> is of himſelf; ſo in this caſe, <hi>Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf O Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9.</p>
               <p>2. Concerning the ſecond Objection, whether it doth not infringe <hi>our comfort,</hi> and diſcourage men from looking after their Salvation? If I am elected, I ſhall be ſaved, if I am not Elected, I ſhall be damned: thus many men plead (ſay they) and how will you ſtir up the <hi>negligent,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> ſuppoſing that doctrine which you have layd down.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, this ſcruple is but <hi>affected,</hi> not <hi>offered,</hi> and therefore ſhould be <hi>chidden,</hi> and not <hi>Anſwered:</hi> a queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods <hi>ſecret will</hi> when we know his <hi>revealed:</hi> Gods <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will</hi> hath relation to his <hi>own actions,</hi> his <hi>revealed will</hi> to <hi>ours;</hi> we muſt not look to <hi>Gods Will in the depths of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> but his <hi>precepts:</hi> not what God will do himſelf, but what he will have us do; God ſaith, <hi>Beleeve in Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> that's our rule, a Phyſitian offereth cure to all that will come; 'twere a madneſs to diſpute away the opportunity, and ſay, I do not know whether he intendeth it to me: if men were ready to periſh in the deep waters, and a Boat ſhould be offered to carry to land as many as would come in it, to be making ſcruples when we are ready to be drowned, whether this help be intended to us yea, or no, were a very fond thing: in ſuch caſes we would not <hi>wrangle</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:115193:102"/>
but <hi>thankful, take hold</hi> of what is offered. 2. This Doctrine can be no <hi>ground of despair</hi> to any, becauſe reprobation is a <hi>ſealed book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> no man for the preſent can know his reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor is to beleeve himſelf to be a Reprobate; but is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to uſe the means that he may be ſaved: he is no Reprobate that falleth into ſin, but he that perſevereth in ſin unto the end; therefore it is no good concluſion, I am <hi>a ſinner,</hi> therefore I am a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> 'tis midnight, therefore 'twil never be day: this is a Book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, none but the Lamb can open it. 3. The oppoſite opinion, is encumbred with more difficulties and ſcruples: what comfort can a man have in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption?</hi> a man cannot have <hi>ſolid comfort</hi> in that which is common to good and bad, to thoſe that ſhall be damned, and thoſe which ſhall be ſaved, all comfort ariſeth from a <hi>practical ſyllogiſm,</hi> now make the practical ſyllogiſm, according to the principles of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal grace, Chriſt dyed for all men, I am a man, therefore for me,</hi> where humanity, or being a man, is made the ground of claim and intereſt; and then unleſs with <hi>Puccius</hi> and <hi>Huberus,</hi> we hold <hi>univerſal ſalvation,</hi> as well as <hi>univerſal redemption,</hi> the argument wil yield no comfort? how can I according to that opinion, comfort my ſelf in the death of Chriſt, when men maybe damned that have no intereſt in it. 4. As to the other part of this Objection, concerning the profit of this Doctrine, and whether it doth not take off men from <hi>induſtry,</hi> ſo ſome have thought. But I Anſwer no, For, 1. God hath enjoyned the <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> together: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to them that ſayled with him) a Decree was paſt for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that not a man of them ſhould periſh; yet they muſt abide in the Ship; God doth infallibly ſtir up the Elect to the uſe of means, as well as bring to ſuch an end. 2. The right uſe of the Doctrine of reprobation, is to put us upon <hi>examination</hi> or <hi>diligence;</hi> upon, <hi>examination</hi> whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, or have truly repented, that we may <hi>make our calling and election pure, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. For by this means is the ſealed Fountain broken open. Or upon <hi>diligence,</hi> in caſe you finde no fruits of Elective love: pray read, hear,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115193:102"/>
meditate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wait, work out your ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. The Doctrine of Election is of great uſe in the ſpiritual life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we cannot underſtand the freeneſs of Gods love, which is the great means to quicken us to praiſe God, and to beget love to God again: for <hi>as fire kindleth fire, ſo doth love beget love;</hi> 'tis Gods glory to be ſerved out <hi>of love,</hi> and <hi>free conſent:</hi> the devil ruleth his ſlaves by a ſervile awe: well then, if love ſet love a worke, and the beſt ſight of Gods love be in Gods Decree; let them ſay if they dare, that the Doctrine of Gods Decree, is an unprofitable Doctrine: again, nothing taketh off <hi>carnal confidence,</hi> and <hi>glorying in our ſelves</hi> more then Gods choiſe, according to his own pleaſure; nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a <hi>greater ſupport in afflictions,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in diſtreſſes of conſcience. In ſhort, nothing is ſuch a <hi>firm bond of love between beleevers,</hi> then the conſideration that they are all predeſtinated from all eternity, to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting enjoyment of the ſame inheritance, thoſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which laſt onely for this world, cannot be ſo firme a tye.</p>
               <p>3. The next Objection is, How can God call upon them to beleeve; whom he hath paſſed by in the Counſels of his Will, and intendeth never to give them grace, without which they cannot beleeve? I Anſwer, God may require men to beleeve, though he never intended to give them faith; for there is a great deal of difference between <hi>his Decree</hi> and <hi>his Law:</hi> his Law ſheweth what <hi>muſt be,</hi> his Decree what <hi>ſhall be:</hi> God never ſaid <hi>all ſhall beleeve,</hi> but he hath ſaid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. but <hi>all muſt beleeve,</hi> that he hath ſaid again and again, the Goſpel doth not ſignifie, this or that man ſhall be ſaved; but <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> as truly as it can be ſaid to <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> or any elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>If you do not beleeve, you ſhall be damned;</hi> ſo ſurely may it be ſaid to a Reprobate, to <hi>Judas</hi> or any other, <hi>If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you ſhall be ſaved:</hi> if the <hi>Reprobate</hi> have <hi>a like favour,</hi> with the <hi>Elect</hi> in the general offer of grace they are left without excuſe, the tender being ſo great and ſo far the ſame unto both, though the <hi>Elects receiving</hi> be the effect of <hi>ſpecia grace;</hi> yet the <hi>Reprobates rejecting</hi> is <hi>without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:115193:103"/>
he voluntarily turnig back upon his own mercies.</p>
               <p>So much briefly for the vindication of this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>4. Let me now apply it. 1. Let <hi>the Elect</hi> ſo much the more <hi>admire</hi> Gods love to them, becauſe that ſome are paſſed by, your mercies are not every ones mercies; Gods ayme herein was, to <hi>commend his mercy</hi> to the <hi>Veſſels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Rom.</hi> 9. 23. If he had paſſed us by, we could not have blamed his love; if he had puniſhed us eternally, we could not have blamed his juſtice; conſider God hath as much intereſt in them as in you. <hi>All ſouls are mine ſaith the Lord, Ezek.</hi> 18. 4. he was their <hi>Creator</hi> as well as yours, and we are all in our blood involved in the <hi>ſame condemnation;</hi> he ſaw as much of <hi>original ſin</hi> in you as in them, we lay in the ſame <hi>polluted Maſs:</hi> Oh that free grace ſhould make ſuch a difference! He had as much reaſon to chuſe <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> as you; was <hi>not Eſau Jacobs Brother? Mal.</hi> 1. 2. in all points alike, but only in <hi>Gods choiſe,</hi> when men chuſe 'tis for <hi>worth,</hi> who would chuſe <hi>crooked timber</hi> to make Veſſels of honour? yet thus doth the Lord ſingle out the worſt and moſt depraved natures, to form them into a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for himſelf; how ſenſibly many times did God make a diſtinction between you and others in the ſame Ordinance: <hi>One is taken and another left,</hi> and one is taken to grace, and another left to periſh in his own ways, others it may be were hardened by the ſame Sermon by which you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted! Oh how raviſhing is the ſight of Gods love in election, and the diſtinct courſes of his providence!</p>
               <p>2. To preſs us to <hi>diligence:</hi> To make our Election ſure, that we may be out of the fear of being in the number of Reprobates; the great queſtion that concerneth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thy ſoul is, <hi>Whether thou be ordained to eternal Life, or no?</hi> Now, if thou beeſt <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>careleſs,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to uſe the means of ſalvation, the <hi>caſe is decided,</hi> though little to thy comfort; <hi>thou judgeſt thy ſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of eternal life, Acts</hi> 13. 48. A lazy, carnal, careleſs man doth but provide matter of deſpair for himſelf: there are <hi>ſome ſteps</hi> to the accompliſhment of the Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: As <hi>ſottiſh obſtinacy againſt the counſels of the word,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:115193:103"/>
                  <hi>a being given up to the ſpirit of error, a conſtant neglect of means an hardening of our ſelves in the abuſe of grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all theſe are black marks;</hi> a man may recover, but your ſoul is <hi>nigh to death,</hi> therefore beware, leſt thou be found one of them who by ſin are ordained to come to judgement: <hi>Elyes</hi> Sons hearkened not to the Counſel of their Father, becauſe the Lord had a mind to ſlay them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To clear it further, let me tell you, that there are four Notions, which are the ground of all Religion. 1. <hi>That God is, and is One. 2. That God is none of thoſe things that are ſeen, but ſomething more excellent. 3. That God hath a care of humane affairs, and judgeth with equity. 4. That the ſame God is maker of all things, without</hi> himſelf. And to theſe four Notions or principles, are ſuited the four preceps of the firſt Table: in the firſt, we have <hi>Gods unity:</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Gods <hi>Inviſible Nature,</hi> and therefore <hi>Images</hi> are forebidden upon that ground, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 12. In the third, the <hi>knowledge of humane affairs,</hi> even of mens thoughts, and that's the foundation of <hi>an oath;</hi> for the third Commandment doth principally forbid <hi>perjury,</hi> and in an <hi>Oath,</hi> God is invoked as a <hi>witneſs</hi> chiefly of the heart, in which his <hi>Omniſciency</hi> is acknowledged, and appealed to as a <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Avenger,</hi> in which his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is acknowledged; the next principle that God is <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of all things, is eſtabliſhed by the forth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; for the <hi>Sabath</hi> at firſt was inſtituted for that purpoſe, to keep up the <hi>memorial of the Creation</hi> in the world. Now out of theſe <hi>ſpecula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ive notions practicals</hi> flow of their own accord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that God is alone to be <hi>worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, obeyed, honoured, truſted</hi> and as far as we <hi>ſet up other confidences, or are ignorant of his excellency,</hi> or <hi>deny God his worſhip</hi> and <hi>ſervice,</hi> or <hi>ſerve him after an unworthy manner, ſuperſtitiouſly, careleſly, hypocritically, or have groſs opinions</hi>

but not to encourage us in our <hi>failings,</hi> but our <hi>duties:</hi> We were never ſo much obliged to duty as ſince the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now we have more <hi>help</hi> and more <hi>advantages,</hi> ſtronger <hi>motives,</hi> and <hi>greater incouragements:</hi> If we look backward, we are bound in point of <hi>gratitude</hi> to ſerve the Lord, being redeemed hereunto by the <hi>blood of Jeſus;</hi> if we look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we are encouraged by the hopes of <hi>eternal life:</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> could not perſwade by ſuch arguments as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> doth; there is more of the <hi>Rule</hi> known, more of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> poured out, to give us <hi>help</hi> to obſerve it; ſo that from this ſhort abridgement of larger diſcourſes, it appeareth, that the great deſign of the Goſpel is to make us <hi>more like God,</hi> and to free us from the <hi>ſlavery of the Devil,</hi> that we may be better ſervants and ſubjects to God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>There are frequent and conſtant diſſwaſives from this perverting our liberty in Chriſt to the ſervice of any fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:</hi> The Spirit of God foreſaw how corrupt nature in us would tempt us to abuſe our priviledges to an evil purpoſe; yea many had already attempted it in the Apoſtles dayes, as the ſect of the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> the <hi>ſchool</hi> of <hi>Simon,</hi> and after them the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Baſilikians,</hi> who under colour of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical liberty, gave up themſelves to lawleſſe and bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh practices (as before was hinted) therefore by way of prevention, diſſwaſives are very frequent every where, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?

God forbid:</hi> As if he had ſaid, you will not want ſuch corrupt Teachers, nay your hearts will be marvellous apt to frame ſuch kind of conſequences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; but reject them with indignation. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>You are called to liberty, onely uſe not your liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh.</hi> Chriſt hath done his part, purchaſed glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges for you; onely take you heed that you doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them, your baſe hearts are apt enough: ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>As free, but not uſing your liberty as a cloak of malitiouſneſs.</hi> Freedom by Chriſt will be an unfit cover and pretence for ſo vile a practice.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Make him your Teacher;</hi> fleſh and blood will ſtumble in Gods plaineſt wayes, we cannot learn any Goſpel truth of our ſelves, but we are apt to pervert it to an ill uſe.</p>

               <p>1. Are you not the better for the knowledge of it, if you are not the <hi>better,</hi> you are the <hi>worſe;</hi> if you <hi>know Chriſt,</hi> and come ſhort of the houre of his Grace, you <hi>know him in vain,</hi> you make Chriſt and the Goſpel an <hi>uſeleſſe thing,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. with <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. there is a <hi>receiving the Grace of God in vain,</hi> and <hi>a knowing the grace of God in truth,</hi> we receive it in <hi>vain</hi> when we are nothing the better for it; and we receive it in <hi>truth</hi> when we feel the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of it upon our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>conſciences;</hi> thoſe that know the grace in truth, are the more <hi>vigilent,</hi> more <hi>humble,</hi> more <hi>holy,</hi> they are more <hi>diligent</hi> for the grace of God hath a <hi>mighty conſtraint</hi> to urge us to duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. more <hi>humble,</hi> nothing ſo <hi>melting</hi> as Grace, <hi>Zech. 12. 10. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> after ſo much Grace as we have received in Chriſt is the great reaſon and cauſe of <hi>godly ſorrow:</hi> More <hi>holy,</hi> nothing kindles ſuch a <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> againſt ſin as Grace doth, <hi>Ezra 9. 14 Should we again after ſuch a deliverance, &amp;c.</hi> nothing perſwadeth by ſuch <hi>powerful arguments</hi> to the practice of holyneſs, as grace doth, <hi>See Tit.</hi> 2. 11. 12, 13, 14. Therefore what are you the better, if it worketh not thus 'tis ſad.</p>
               <p>2. Are you the worſe ſenſibly for the knowledge of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Do you grow more <hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>neglectful of duties,</hi> as if now there were not ſo much required of you? The Goſpel never taught you that; but your own corrupt hearts; 'tis true, the more Chriſt is preached, the more <hi>Evangelical</hi> a man is in his duties; his heart is taken off more
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115193:118"/>
from <hi>reſting in them,</hi> he doth not pitch his hopes upon the <hi>tale</hi> of <hi>number</hi> of his duties, and he doth not perform them <hi>out of bondage,</hi> but more <hi>clearly, knowingly, comfortablely,</hi> as upon <hi>Goſpel grounds;</hi> but ſtill he will be performing: as knowing that duties can never have <hi>too much of our care,</hi> and <hi>too little of our truſt:</hi> in the Goſpel we have <hi>more help,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all reaſon we ſhould perform <hi>more work:</hi> well then to grow <hi>more lazy,</hi> and <hi>leſs frequent</hi> in the worſhip of God, and the uſe of the means of grace: the more we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Gods grace in Chriſt, is to abuſe grace, which was given us to make us <hi>more chearful,</hi> not more <hi>ſlack</hi> and <hi>negligent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Leſs circumspect and</hi> wary in your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>looſe walking</hi> is an ill ſign: Chriſt himſelf taught us, <hi>To enter in at the ſtreight gate, and to walk in the narrow way, Mat.</hi> 7. 14. When men ſeek more roomth and breadth for their luſts, they pervert the end of the Goſpel, for the Goſpel onely ſheweth, <hi>That the greateſt ſin is pardonable, but the leaſt is not allowable:</hi> the world is much for a <hi>ſhorter cut to Heaven;</hi> but when you have done all, you will finde that the <hi>good, old, long way is the neereſt way home;</hi> ſtill we muſt make <hi>ſtreight ſteps</hi> to our feet: <hi>mortify luſts,</hi> bridle vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and keep cloſe to Rule. <hi>Sin</hi> is the ſame that ever it was, and the <hi>Law</hi> is the ſame, and <hi>God</hi> is as <hi>Holy</hi> and as much <hi>delights in holyneſs</hi> as ever he did; we therefore muſt be <hi>as ſtrict as ever:</hi> 'tis but a <hi>carnal liberty</hi> to have leave to be wanton, to be <hi>free to ſin: Nature</hi> is very apt to hear in that ear, See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. 19. but grace counts it <hi>no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If leſs humble,</hi> ſtill you are guilty, a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin and findeth no remorſe, upon the pretence of Gods <hi>free grace in pardoning,</hi> this is ſtill the wantonneſs which ariſeth from the abuſe of the Goſpel; Gods children never <hi>loath themſelves</hi> more then upon the <hi>remembrance of mercy, Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. never <hi>melted for ſin more,</hi> then when the <hi>warm beams</hi> of Gods love thaw their hearts, that they ſhould ſin againſt a pardoning God, a gracious Father: a good Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every mercy is a new ſtab at heart, <hi>Chriſts</hi>

Note, <hi>That ſenſe of Intereſt in God begets the beſt zeal for the truths and glory of God.</hi> The point conſiſts of two Branches.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That Intereſt in God will beget a zeal for God:</hi> it troubleth a good man to ſee <hi>any one</hi> wronged, much more to ſee his <hi>own relation</hi> wronged, moſt of all to ſee <hi>his God</hi> wronged: can a man profeſs love to God, and not eſpouſe his quarrel? freinds have all things common, <hi>common love</hi> and <hi>common hatred,</hi> wrong the one, and the other is not well at eaſe; ſo it is in the ſpiritual friendſhip between us and God, Pſal. 69. 9. <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me:</hi> injuries done to God and Religion, will as neerly affect us, as thoſe done to our perſons; certainly they that can <hi>be ſilent</hi> in the cauſe of God, have <hi>little affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to him, and are ſo tender of wordly intereſts, do little value an intereſt in God: <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her children, Mat.</hi> 11. 19. they are <hi>Baſtards</hi> and not <hi>Children,</hi> that are afraid or aſhamed to own their <hi>mothers defence,</hi> or can hug thoſe in their boſoms that are enemies to God and his grace, <hi>Pſal. 139. 21. Doe not I hate them O Lord that hate thee? am not I greved with them that riſe up againſt thee?</hi> 'Tis an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his ſincerity, that God and he had the <hi>ſame ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> that he could finde no room in his heart for affection to them, that he had no affection to God, when we came <hi>into covenant with God:</hi> we made a <hi>League</hi> with him <hi>offenſive and defenſive,</hi> to count his <hi>friends</hi> ours, and his <hi>enemies</hi> ours, to hate what he hateth, and to love what he loveth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without breach of covenant we cannot be ſilent in Gods cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and friends to the enemies and abuſers of his grace.</p>
               <p>2. The next Branch is, <hi>That their zeal who have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in God, is the beſt zeal:</hi> now 'tis the beſt partly becauſe <hi>'tis hoteſt,</hi> they that conteſt meerly for <hi>an opinion,</hi> are not ſo earneſt as they that contend out <hi>of affection,</hi> as a ſtranger
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115193:119"/>
ſeeing a man oppreſſed, may chide him that did the wrong, but a <hi>meet relation,</hi> he will interpoſe and venture himſelf in the quarrel.

                     </gap>tereſt, we may as well be afraid of ſome mens zeal againſt errour, as of other proneneſs to it:</hi> Carnal perſons keep a great coyle, and fill the world with <hi>clamour</hi> and <hi>rage,</hi> but their hearts do not flame with zeal upon a <hi>proper intereſt</hi> and do not carry on things in <hi>Gods way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Uſe is to inform us of the reaſon why the ſpirits of godly men are ſo keen againſt ſuch errours as intrench upon the grace of God; why errours about Chriſt are horrible to them, a very abomination to their thoughts; becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are built all their hopes, and in ſuch matters they have <hi>moſt experiences,</hi> therefore their hearts ſparkle within them, others feel a <hi>cold indifferency,</hi> but they a <hi>mighty preſſure</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits.</p>

Well then, let us acknowledge the <hi>dominion of Chriſt,</hi> let him be <hi>Lord alone in his own houſe;</hi> let us yeeld ſubjection and obedience to him; let us beware of depriving him of that honour to which he hath ſo good a right: You will ſay, who are thoſe that deny Chriſt his <hi>Lordſhip?</hi> I anſwer. 1.

               <p>Secondly: he is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which ſignifyeth a <hi>Saviour;</hi> now Chriſt is a Saviour <hi>poſitively</hi> as well as <hi>privately,</hi> he giveth us <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings,</hi> as well as <hi>freedom from miſery,</hi> Joh. 3. 17. <hi>That they ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> Again, he is a Saviour, not onely by <hi>way of deliverance</hi> but by <hi>way of prevention,</hi> he doth not onely <hi>break the ſnare,</hi> but <hi>keep our feet from falling:</hi> He is as a <hi>Shepheard</hi> to lead the flock, as well as a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> to heal the diſeaſed: We doe not take notice of <hi>preventive mercies,</hi> and yet <hi>prevention</hi> is better than <hi>eſcape.</hi> Again, he is a <hi>Saviour by merit,</hi> and <hi>by power;</hi> for he hath not only to doe with <hi>God</hi> but with <hi>Sathan;</hi> God is to be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and <hi>Sathan overcome,</hi> and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcueth us out of the hands of Sathan, and redeemeth us out of the hands of Gods Juſtice. To <hi>reſcue a condemned Malefactor,</hi> and take him by force out of the Executioners hands, is not enough, the Judge alſo muſt be ſatisfied, and paſſe a pardon, or the man is not ſafe: <hi>Chriſt hath pulled us out of the power of darkneſſe,</hi> Col. 1. 13. and in him the <hi>Father is well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3. 17.

               <p>1. Bleſſe God for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he took the cure of our ſalvation into his own hands, he would not truſt an Angel, none was fit for it, <hi>Iſa. 59.

Chriſt in the Goſpels, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epiſtles do often repeat the ſame paſſages: Till you be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them, we muſt inculcate <hi>neceſſary Principles</hi> again and again: God <hi>ſpeaketh once, yea twice, when men regard it not,</hi> Job 33. 14.

Let this which hath been ſaid <hi>prevent cenſure,</hi> look upon it as a providence, when the ſame Truth or Sermon is preſented again, <hi>Surely I have not meditated enough of this truth, I am not enough affected with it, therefore the Lord hath again brought it to my thoughts, or there is ſome new tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation that I ſhall meet with, that I may find the need of this old Truth,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That it is a ſpiritual diſeaſe, <hi>a Surfet of Manna,</hi> when men muſt ſtill be fed with <hi>new things;</hi> no truths are <hi>too plain</hi> for our <hi>mouths,</hi> or <hi>too ſtale</hi> for your <hi>ears;</hi> the itch of novelty puts men upon <hi>ungrounded ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties,</hi> and that maketh way for <hi>errour,</hi> or <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> though you hear nothing but what you are acquainted with be content; they were carnal people that complained they had nothing but the <hi>old Burden,</hi> Jer. 23. 33, 34.

we cannot endure to have an <hi>old ſore</hi> rubbed again; as <hi>Peter</hi> was troubled when Chriſt ſpake to him the third time (as I noted before) that his Apoſtacie ſhould once more be revived. 3. It may juſtifie two duties of great uſe, <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and <hi>Repetition in our Families.</hi> Meditation, for 'tis good to remember Truths that we do already know. <hi>Once hath God ſpoken, and twice have I heard it,</hi> Pſal. 62. 11. we ſhould go over and over it again in our thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt we <hi>learn,</hi> and then we <hi>meditate; S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udy</hi> findeth out a truth, and <hi>Meditation</hi> improveth it; as firſt the meat is taken in, and then the digeſtion is afterward: Conſcience preacheth over the Sermon again to the heart; while the thing is new, it doth more exerciſe <hi>ſtudy</hi> then <hi>meditation;</hi> but when we have once learned it, then our thoughts ſhould work upon it; for meditation is the improvement of a known truth. 2. <hi>Repetition in our Families,</hi> let them hear it again and again, the third blow may make the nail go: If people were humble and ſober, they would have new and freſh thoughts every time a truth is revived upon them: at firſt hearing many are loſt through the wandring and diſtraction of our thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things which upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view may be brought to hand again, at leaſt youth and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt have <hi>line upon line,</hi> as when they learn to write the ſame letters, and the ſame Copie are written over again and again, till the figure of them be formed in their fancies.</p>

               <p>In handling this point, I ſhall open 1. The <hi>hainouſneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> 2. The <hi>Nature</hi> of it. 3. The <hi>Cure</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>hainouſneſs</hi> of the ſin, that we will conſider in<note place="margin">1. Hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The general conſiderations are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. No ſin doth <hi>diſhonour God</hi> ſo much as unbelief doth, 'tis<note place="margin">1. In general.</note> an <hi>interpretative blaſphemy.</hi> a calling into queſtion of his <hi>mercy, power, juſtice,</hi> but eſpecially of his <hi>truth;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a lyar;</hi> You judge him a perſon not fit to be credited; the giving of <hi>the lye</hi> is accounted the greateſt injury and diſgrace amongſt men; for <hi>truth</hi> is the ground of commerce and humane ſociety: So that to ſay a man is <hi>a lyar,</hi> is as much as to ſay a man is unfit to keep company with men: But eſpecially is this a great injury to God, becauſe he ſtandeth more upon <hi>his word,</hi> then upon any other part of his name, <hi>Pſal. 138. 2. He hath magnifyed his word above all his Name:</hi> We have more experience of God in making good his word, then in any other thing. As faith honoureth God, ſo doth unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief diſhonour him; what God doth to the creature, that doth faith to God; God <hi>juſtifieth, ſanctifieth, glorifieth</hi> the creature, and faith is ſaid to <hi>juſtifie God,</hi> Luke 7. 29. To <hi>juſtifie,</hi> is to acquit from accuſation; So doth faith acquit Gods truth in the word, from all the jealouſies which the <hi>carnal world,</hi> and our <hi>carnal hearts</hi> do caſt upon him. Faith is ſaid to <hi>ſanctifie God,</hi> Numb. 20. 12. <hi>To ſanctifie,</hi> is to ſet a part from common uſe; and God is ſanctified when we ſet God aloof, above all ordinary and common cauſes, and can believe that he will make good his word, when the courſe of all things ſeems to contradict it. Faith is ſaid to <hi>glorifie God, Rom.</hi> 4. 20. We glorifie him <hi>declaratively,</hi> when we give him all that excellency which the word giveth

               <p>I do confeſſe the Scriptures do ſpeak ſomewhat ſparingly of the <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> of Angels, it being calculated chiefly for the uſe of man; but ſome hints there are which we ſhal take notice of, and improve not to <hi>ſatisfie curioſity,</hi> but to <hi>ſerve profit.</hi> 1. What is this <hi>firſt eſtate</hi> from which they are departed. I anſwer their original condition of <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>happineſſe;</hi> every creature which the Lord made, he ſaw it to be <hi>good,</hi> much more the Angel whom God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his own train and company, they are called <hi>the Sons of God, Job</hi> 38. 7. becauſe they bore his Image, and that in a more eminent degree then man, as being wholly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſubſtances, juſt, holy, pure, in all qualities repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God their father; 'tis ſaid of man, <hi>thou haſt made him little lower than the Angels,</hi> Pſal. 8. 5. when man was at his beſt there was <hi>an inferiority,</hi> the image of God was given to us in a <hi>leſſe degree,</hi> although we were placed above all viſible creatures, yet then the Angels we were <hi>a little lower;</hi> that they were excellent, appeareth in that the <hi>Angelical obedience</hi> is made the pattern of ours, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 10. And our happineſſe in heaven is expreſſed by the condition of their nature, Matth. 22. 30. <hi>They are as the Angels of God in Heaven;</hi> yea, 'tis notable that when the Scriptures would expreſſe any excellency, they uſe to ſay 'tis fit for Angels; thus <hi>Manna</hi> is called <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 78. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Angels food,</hi> not as if they needed food, ſpirits are not capable of corporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments; but if ſo high a creature ſhould need food, he could have no better. So the <hi>tongue of Angels 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 1. that is, with a tongue becomming creatures of ſo perfect an underſtanding; but you will ſay theſe expreſſions are meant of the <hi>good Angels;</hi> I anſwer that at their firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had the ſame common nature and excellency, as appeareth by the name of <hi>Thrones, Dominions, and Powers,</hi> which they yet retain in common with the <hi>good Angels;</hi> yea

and by that power, wiſedom, and knowledge which is yet left; in their innocency they were <hi>alike good,</hi> and <hi>alike happy,</hi> and could contemplate and behold God, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him with delight as others did; all that is Super-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in the good Angel, is, <hi>the grace of confirmation;</hi> by which they abide in the <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Eighthly, Obſerve <hi>the particular fact is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi> though the <hi>general ſin</hi> may be known, as how this pride was diſcovered, whether in a <hi>thought,</hi> or by ſome <hi>bold attempt</hi> is not known; it doth not ſo much pertain to edification and ſalvation to know their ſin, as to know our own: The Scriptures direct us to <hi>look inward,</hi> 'tis more for our profit to keep out Sathans power, then to know the circumſtances of his fall; let us not fall with him, <hi>Peter</hi> would know <hi>Johns</hi> end, but Chriſt rebuketh him, <hi>what is that to thee? follow thou me;</hi> Joh. 21. 20, 22.

Secondly, apply it for Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is a <hi>new beginning</hi> in Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb. 3. 14.

               <p>4. <hi>Gods power and providence</hi> by which the Angelical ſtrength is bridled and overmaſtered, ſo as they cannot do what they would; thus Rev. 20. 2. Sathan is <hi>ſaid to be bound up for a thouſand years,</hi> that is, in the chains of Gods power, which are ſometimes ſtreighter and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looſer: the Divel was fain to ask leave to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the herd of Swine, <hi>Matth</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The chaines of Gods eternal decree.</hi> As there is a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en chain, the chain of Salvation, which is carried on from link to link, till the <hi>purpoſes of eternal grace</hi> do end in the <hi>poſſeſſion of eternal glory,</hi> ſo there is an <hi>Iron chain of reprobation,</hi> which begins in Gods own <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preterition,</hi> and is carried on in the creatures volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and endeth in their <hi>juſt damnation;</hi> and when once we are ſhut up under theſe bars, <hi>there is no opening, Job</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe chains are eternal chains,</hi> becauſe the wicked Angels ſtand guilty for ever, without hope of recovery or redemption.

               <p>Fourthly, Obſerve how weak the Creatures are, when God marcheth in judgement againſt them: <hi>guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is one of the fallen Angels chains, if God will but arm our own thoughts againſt us, he needeth not bring forces from without, there is enough in that to ſink us into Hell: The Law needeth not bring Brimſtone from Heaven to burn ſinners, nor open the mouth of the great deep to drown them, nor ſhatter the frame of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about our heads; alas, we cannot bear up under the burden of our own conſciences, or the weight of our own
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115193:157"/>
grief, when he layeth his finger upon the conſcience, who can bear it? The Angels excel in ſtrength, and yet the impreſſions of honour laid upon them, are too hard for them to grapple with all, <hi>Prov. 18. 14. a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I challenge all the world, to bring me a man that is able to deal with his own conſcience when God armeth it againſt him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That ſpiritual judgements of all others are moſt ſecure,</hi> to have ſin puniſhed with <hi>obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>hardneſſe in ſinning.</hi> This is nothing but to have the Divels chains layed upon us, a ſad intimation, that we are given up to chains of darkneſſe, <hi>frogs</hi> and <hi>lice,</hi> and <hi>hailſtones</hi> were but <hi>ſoft judgements</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>hard heart:</hi> unleſſe God ſhould ſend us quick into Hell, there cannot an heavier judgement befal us, nay certainly it were better to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to Hell torments, if there could be any expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deliverance, then to be given up to a ſpirit of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for there is no end of that; ſay then, Lord what ever judgement thou bringeſt upon me, bring not thy heavy judgement of an hard heart; 'tis better by far that you ſhould <hi>live miſerably,</hi> then <hi>ſin freely</hi> without remorſe. But what ſins bring on this ſpiritual judgement? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. <hi>an unthankful abuſe of Gods gifts,</hi> The Divels had a glorious and excellent nature, but they were not thankful, obſerve it when you will, you will find it true, that no man was ever puniſhed with hardneſs of heart, but ſome former merciful diſpenſation was abuſed: the Heathens were not thankful for the light of nature, and therefore God gave them up to vile affections <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22, 24.

O thou Child of the Devil and Enemy of all goodneſſe, Cain</hi> that hated his Brother, becauſe <hi>his works were righteous,</hi> was the Divels <hi>Patriarch. 5.

                  <hi>Ignorance,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Sin,</hi> thirdly, <hi>miſery;</hi> as <hi>light</hi> the contrary quality, implyeth <hi>Knowledge, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> becauſe <hi>light</hi> diſcovereth all things. 'Tis put for <hi>knowledge,</hi> becauſe of all bodily qualities, 'tis moſt pure and unmixed, therefore 'tis put for <hi>holineſs,</hi> becauſe 'tis wonderfully pleaſing and delightful to ſenſe, therefore 'tis put for <hi>glory:</hi> ſo contrarywiſe <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the abſence and privation of light, ſignifieth <hi>ignorance,</hi> Rom. 2. 19. <hi>Sin, 1 Pet. 2. 9, Miſery: Pſal.</hi> 107. 11. Now all theſe three make way for one another, <hi>Ignorance</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> for <hi>Miſery,</hi> the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being the great Wheel of the Soule, if it be not right, nothing can be right, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22. ignorance maketh us ſtumble upon ſin, and by ſin we fall into the pit of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>If you ask what kind of Darkneſs is intended here? I anſwer, though all may be implyed; yet chiefly the <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of miſery</hi> is here intended, they being caſt down from the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of the higheſt Heavens, into dark and obſcure babitations, where they want the ſight of God, and the light of his countenance, as when the Sun is gone, there is nothing but darkneſſe in the world; ſo being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the preſence of God, they are fitly ſaid to be held under darkneſs; for as the Sun is to the corporeal world, ſo is God to the world of Spirits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. now their Sun is Eclipſed, and by the interpoſition of the dark cloud of their ſin and obſtinacy; they cannot have the leaſt comfortable glimpſe and fruition of God: to which alſo may be added, the <hi>horrible apprehenſion of their loſs,</hi>

and that terrour and diſcomfort that lyeth upon them, for they have onely ſo much light left, as ſerveth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their torment; I confeſſe 'tis diſputed by Divines, whether the Devils can grieve for the loſſe of the light of Gods countenance, or the want of the <hi>beatifical viſion,</hi> and the ground of doubting is, becauſe there is in the Divels an extream averſeneſſe, enmity, and hatred of God and his Glory; but certain, as they are rational creatures, they cannot but be ſenſible of their loſſe, as alſo the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpirits are, and ſo great a loſſe of happineſſe (for that is the conſideration under which they are ſenſible of it) muſt needs breed horror and torment; they do, not mourn for the abſence of God as the Saints do. out of a principle of holineſſe, and becauſe God is <hi>lovely in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> but as <hi>profitable</hi> to them; &amp; this ſenſe as 'tis accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>deſpair,</hi> ſo with <hi>blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>hatred of God,</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every part of the ſentence that is pronounced upon wicked men, is fitted to beget terrour in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>depart from me,</hi> is apprehended as a miſery, as well as <hi>go into everlaſting torments.</hi> Add further to their <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> that <hi>deſpair</hi> that is upon them, and fearful looking for of the fiery indignation of the Lord, which <hi>deſperate ſorrow</hi> is expreſſed by <hi>utter darkneſs, and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Matth. 22. 13.</p>

when he was ſolemnly inaugurated into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office; but the Prophecy receiveth not its full and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accompliſhment till the day of judgement; to which purpoſe the ſame Scripture is cited by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 14. 10. We ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, for 'tis written, As I live (ſaith the Lord) to me every knee ſhall bow, and mouth ſhall confeſſe.</hi> So that the <hi>bowing of knees,</hi> or ſtooping of enemies is not fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed till then. Chriſt doth now often over-rule the councils and projects of his enemies, and ſmite them with a ſoar deſtruction, but there is not ſuch crouching and trembling, ſo ſenſibly now to be diſcerned as there will be at that day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the day of judgement is a great day, becauſe<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> great things are then done, which will appear if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>preparations</hi> for that day. 2.

               </p>
               <p>1. There is that great noiſe and terrour of the voice of the Lord, which is to be managed by ſome ſpecial An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, by which all the world ſhall be, as it were, ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear before Chriſts Tribunal, See 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 16: and <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. Some expound this Trumpet <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically,</hi> ſome <hi>Literally:</hi> they that expound it <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically,</hi> think it ſignifieth the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> of Chriſt forcing all the world to appear before his judgement ſeat, which is therefore called <hi>a trumpet,</hi> becauſe the ſolemn Aſſemblies among the Jews were ſummoned by ſound of Trumpet; but why may we not take it <hi>Literally,</hi> and in propriety of ſpeech, for the audible ſound of a Trumpet? ſure I am at the giving of the Law, <hi>the voice of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet was exceeding loud;</hi> and the like may be, when he commeth to take an account of our keeping the Law, a ſound of a Trumpet, as a terrible ſommons to all the world, and a near ſign of Chriſts approach, as <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> was the fore-runner of his firſt coming, who <hi>was the</hi>

1. As to their ſins, I enquire, are there none of <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſins amongſt us?

It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom,</hi> &amp;c. We ſin againſt more <hi>light,</hi> more <hi>love,</hi> &amp;c. 2. As to the judgements, though God doth now adays ſmite a Countrey with judgments immediately from Heaven, or make it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unuſeful, as he did <hi>Sodom;</hi> yet his diſpeaſure is no leſs againſt ſin; and if not the ſame, a like judgement, one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grievous may come upon us.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, let us come to open this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in which theſe three things are conſiderable. 1.

               </p>
               <p>1. I begin with the <hi>ſtate of Sodom.</hi> There 1. the <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the place;</hi> there were ſundry goodly Cities, of which <hi>Sodom</hi> was the principal, fairly ſituated in the plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> full of people, and well ſupplyed with Corn, Wine and Oyl, and all earthly contentments; 'tis ſaid, <hi>Gen. 19. 10. Sodom was pleaſant, and as the Garden of the Lord.</hi> And yet afterwards this was the place which was the Scene of ſo much wrath &amp; utter deſolation. What may the wourld learn from hence? that we muſt give an account for common mercies; God reckoned with the ſervant that had but one Talent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. The world is a place of tryal, all men have a truſt committed to them; The Talents of the Heathens were <hi>fruitful ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, food and gladneſſe. Act</hi> 14. 17. God that never left himſelfe <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>without excuſe:</hi> a plentiful ſoil doth not argue a <hi>good people,</hi> but a <hi>good God. Sodom</hi> was pleaſantly and richly ſituated. If we had nothing elſe to anſwer for, but an <hi>Iſland of bleſſings,</hi> how poorly have we diſcharged this truſt? 2. Take notice of their <hi>late deliverance,</hi> four Kings made war upon them, by whom they were carryed captive, and reſcued by <hi>Abraham, Gen. 14. 15, 16 Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances from war and captivity leave a great engagement;</hi> When God hath once ſpared us, if we repent not, the next turn is utter deſtruction. Deliverances if not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are but <hi>reprivals;</hi> we are not ſo much <hi>preſerved,</hi> as <hi>reſerved</hi> to a greater miſery; hoiſted up, that our fall may be the more dreadful; ſnatched out of one miſery, that we may be caſt into a worſe: Oh what have we to anſwer for our late deliverances! <hi>Sodom</hi> was but once ſaved in war, we many times; 'tis to be feared that paſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth our doom, <hi>Pſal. 166. 43. Many times did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, but they provoked him by their counſel, and were brought low for their iniquity:</hi> deliverances not improved are pledges of certain ruine. 3. Gods patience in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them: <hi>Sodom</hi> for a long time ſlept quietly in their ſins unmoleſted, undiſturbed; <note n="*" place="margin">Miſericordia mea ſuadet ut parcam peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum clamor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git ut puniam. <hi>Salvianus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the times of Sodom cry to me:</hi> the Lord profered <hi>Abraham,</hi> if there were but ten righteous perſons found there, he would ſpare the Cities: in four Cities not ten righteous perſons! God is ſilent as long as their ſins would let him be quiet; but then when he could no longer bear, he goeth down to take vengeance: how long doth the Lord protract the ruine of theſe wicked Cities? <hi>juſtice is his ſtrange work,</hi> but 'tis his work; mercy doth much with God, but not all, juſtice muſt be heard, eſpecially when it pleadeth on the behalfe of <hi>abuſed mercy;</hi> God that would ſpare the ſinner, yet hateth the ſinne. When a people do nothing but weary juſtice, and abuſe mercy <note n="*" place="margin">Dominus Chriſtus a dc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino patre <hi>Concil. Syrm.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Lord will raine from the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen</hi> 19. 24. Chriſt will enterpoſe for ſuch a peoples deſtruction; Heaven will rain down Hell upon a people ſo obſtinately wicked. The Lord is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but not ſenſeleſſe: as he will not always <hi>contend,</hi> ſo
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115193:176"/>
not always <hi>forbear. 4. Lots</hi> admonition, it ſeemeth he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reproved them, and therefore do they ſcorn him, <hi>Gen. 19. 9 This one fellow came in to ſojourn amongſt us, and he will needs be a Judge;</hi> his ſoul was not only vexed with thoſe leud courſes, but as occaſion was offered, he ſought to diſſwade them. Thence learn, <hi>That God ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome puniſheth without warning:</hi> the old World had <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Sodom Lots admonitions:</hi> the Lord may ſay to every puniſhed people, as <hi>Reuben</hi> to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>Did not I warn you, and you would not hear? Gen.</hi> 42. 22. Seldome doth he hew a people with the ſword, but firſt he heweth them by Prophets: means of convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction aggravate both the <hi>ſin</hi> and the <hi>judgement:</hi> Ah we have a <hi>clearer light,</hi> and therefore muſt expect an <hi>heavier doome, Matth.</hi> 10 15. ſins are aggravated not onely by the <hi>foulneſſe of the Act,</hi> but the degrees of light againſt which they are committed <hi>Sodom</hi> ſinned ſorely, as to the act, but they could not ſin againſt ſo much light as we do; therefore it ſhall <hi>be eaſier for them at the day of judgement.</hi> 5. They had the benefit of Magiſtracy, thoſe were Cities that were brought into government, we read of the <hi>King of Sodom, Gen.</hi> 14 2. but it ſeems he did not enterpoſe his Authority, but rather connive at, and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the wickedneſſe of this people; yea rather approve and partake with them in their abominations. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>when the vices of inferiours are diſſembled and winked at by Governours, the Lord himſelfe taketh the matter in hand:</hi> and then look for nothing but ſpeedy ruine, the guilt of a Nation is much encreaſed when ſin is tolerated, yea favoured and countenanced, eſpecially when righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is rather reſtrained and curbed then ſin, as the affronts done to <hi>Lot</hi> witneſſed; the end why Magiſtracy was ordained is then perverted, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. Rom.</hi> 13. 5. namely, for the <hi>puniſhment of evil doers</hi> and that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be encouraged; they were puniſhed for allowing the filthineſſe of <hi>ſtrange fleſh.</hi> What will become of us if Magiſtrates ſhould be careleſſe and <hi>wink</hi> at, yea <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance strange opinions,</hi> as horrid and as much againſt

the <hi>light of Chriſtianity,</hi> as that was againſt the <hi>light of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, let us look upon the <hi>ſinnes of Sodom.</hi> See Ezek. 16. 49. <hi>Loe this was the iniquity of thy Siſter Sodom, pride, fulneſs of bread, and aboundance of idleneſs, neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy;</hi> to which adde the ſins of the Text, and then this black roll is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.

               </p>
               <p>1. The Sins. 1. Pride; 'Tis hard to enjoy plenty, and not to grow haughty; proſperous Winds ſoon fill the Sailes, but blowing too ſtrongly, overturn the Veſſel; how few are able to carry a full Cup without ſpilling? to manage plenty without pride? men grow <hi>rich</hi> and then <hi>high minded,</hi> and that's the next way to ruine. 2. <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> an eaſie careleſſe life maketh way for danger, God ſent all into the world for action, ſtanding pooles putrifie, and things not uſed, contract ruſt; ſo doth id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e perſons ſettle into vile and degenerate luſts. 3. <hi>Fulneſſe of bread;</hi> that is corporal delights, Luk. 17. 28. <hi>They eat, they drunk, they bought, they ſold, they builded;</hi> their whole lives were but a diverſion from one pleaſure to another; how ſoon are earthly comforts abuſed into luxury and exceſſe? <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of eſtate</hi> maketh way for <hi>fulneſſe of bread,</hi> and many beaſtly ſins. 4. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmercifulneſſe,</hi> you never knew any <hi>Prodigal,</hi> but they were alſo <hi>uncharitable;</hi> as <hi>Sodom</hi> here and the Epicure, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. and you ſhall ſee <hi>James</hi> 5. 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe that nouriſhed their hearts as in a day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, oppreſſed the labourers; they that ſet their hearts for eaſe and pleaſure, know not the bitterneſſe of griefe, and therefore do not compaſſionate it in others, <hi>Amos 6. 6. 5. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſe,</hi> and fornication, this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the former; fulneſſe of bread muſt be emptied and unladed in luſt. 6. That <hi>beaſtly wickedneſſe</hi> implyed in the Text. When the Angels came to deſtroy them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were of a comely viſage, they came raging at the doors, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. as uſually wickedneſs is encreaſed to the height when God cometh to puniſh it. Well
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115193:177"/>
then if we put all theſe together, they were a <hi>lazy, eaſie, ſecure, oppreſſing, filthy and unclean people:</hi> we may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more at Gods patience that he bore with them ſo long, then at his juſtice, that he puniſhed them ſo ſorely.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Aggravations: 1. Shameleſneſſe, Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 9. they declare their ſin as Sodom, they publiſh it as Gomorrah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when a people are paſt <hi>ſhame</hi> they are paſt <hi>hope,</hi> ſuch do dare God to puniſh them. 2. <hi>Contempt of reproofe,</hi> a ſure fore-runner of ruine, when the <hi>reprover</hi> of ſin is blamed more then the <hi>actor. Lot</hi> ſeemed as <hi>one that mocked, Gen.</hi> 19. 14. when Gods Meſſengers are contemned, he can hold no longer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>their judgement.</hi> The Lord rained from the Lord fire and brimſtone upon them. Obſerve here, 1. The <hi>ſuddainneſſe</hi> the Sun ſhone in the morning as at other times, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 23. they had not the leaſt fear of any ſuch miſchief at hand; God uſually ſurprizeth a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their ſecurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a great calm cometh a ſtorm. <hi>Periſh in the mid way,</hi> Pſal 21. 11. in their full carere,<note place="margin">Sulpher futorem hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They firſt burned with <hi>luſts,</hi> and then with <hi>fire:</hi> they burnt with vile unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural luſts, and therefore againſt the ordinary courſe of nature, fire falleth down from Heaven: in this fire there was ſtink for their filthineſſe. Thus doth God reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate; <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> offered ſtrange fire, and they were conſumed with ſtrange fire comming down from Heaven. <hi>Job</hi> profeſsing his innocency in caſe of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>otherwiſe let my Wife grind to another, and a ſtranger bow down upon her,</hi> Job 31. 11. implying that God would puniſh him in his own bed, if he had violated anothers: in the Goſpel we read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. that he was denied <hi>a drop</hi> that would not give <hi>a crumb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. 3. Obſerve the power of God, God a little before had drowned the world <hi>with Water,</hi> now he conſumeth <hi>Sodom by fire,</hi> all the Elements are at his beck, the Creatures are <hi>his Hosts,</hi> Job. 37. 6. <hi>If God ſay be thou upon the earth,</hi> they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>1. 'Tis certain, <hi>The Angels had a great care about the people of God in ancient times,</hi> Examples are, found every where in the word of God; <hi>Lot</hi> was led out of <hi>Sodom</hi> by Angels, <hi>Daniel</hi> taught by an Angel, <hi>Cornelius</hi> anſwered by an Angel, an Angel withſtood <hi>Balaam</hi> in the way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. An Angel walked with <hi>the three children</hi> in the fiery Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. An Angel ſhutteth up the mouths of Lions, that they might not hurt <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 22. An Angel comforted <hi>Paul</hi> in the Tempeſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 23, 24. Scarce any remarkable thing befell the people of God, but it was accompliſht by their miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The Miniſtry of Angels though not ſo viſible and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as heretofore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Are they not miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſent forth for the Heirs of ſalvation?</hi> all that are called to inherit a bleſſing, were under their tutelage, ſo ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 12. and thoſe inſtances alledged in the former Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are patterns and preſidents by which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may know what to expect; their tutelage then was more viſible and ſenſible, becauſe the Church newly planted, needed to be confirmed, but God would have us live by faith, and expect all our ſupports in a more ſpiritual way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we have not <hi>viſible apparitions,</hi> yet we have <hi>real experiments</hi> of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; the evil Angels appear not, yet we doubt not of the

                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The proper object of their Miniſtry and care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> wicked men are not under their covert and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; 'tis true, they may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under a general care, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who are ſet out in Scripture, as the Types of thoſe that are rejected by the Lord, yet <hi>Gen. 21. 17. An Angel of the Lord came and ſtood by Hagar, and ſaid, the Lord hath heard the cry of the ſad:</hi> though poſſibly this might be, as he was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son; dogs in the Houſe have the Crumbs.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>The Miniſtry of the Angels is over all the children of God, without exception,</hi> not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the <hi>meaneſt Saint</hi> is under their care; Gods love to his people is not diſpenced with reſpect to their peculiar pomp and greatneſs, <hi>Mat. 18. 10. Offend not theſe little ones, for their Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held my Fathers face;</hi> 'tis chiefly meant of thoſe that are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in eſteem and account in the world; the meſſage of Chriſts birth was brought by Angels to <hi>Shepherds,</hi> feeding their flocks in the fields, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>5. As <hi>no Saints are excepted from receiving the benefit of their Miniſtry, ſo no Angels are excepted from being imployed in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>6. <hi>That every ſingle beleever hath his proper and alotted Angel to attend him from his birth to his death, is rather mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of problem and diſpute, than poſitive aſſertion;</hi> there are ſome Scriptures make it <hi>probable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Their Angels ſee my Fathers face,</hi> not <hi>the Angels,</hi> but <hi>their Angels;</hi> but the word there may only imply their <hi>common intereſt</hi> in the whole Hoſt of God; Chriſt doth not ſay that every one of them hath an Angel: as for inſtance, it may be ſaid, theſe <hi>Priſoners</hi> have their <hi>Keepers,</hi> theſe <hi>Scholars</hi> have their <hi>Maſters,</hi> theſe <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> have their <hi>Captains,</hi> it doth not follow that every one hath a particular <hi>Keeper, Maſter, Captain,</hi> &amp;c.

and wait for opening: and if <hi>Peter</hi> had a ſpecial Angel, it followeth not that all have; the meaning probably is, <hi>'Tis a ſpirit that hath aſſumed his ſhape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Though it be not certain that every particular believer hath an Angel deputed to his attendance, yet in the general, there is an aſſurance of a Guardianſhip, and Tutelage from the Angels;</hi> the <hi>Heirs of ſalvation</hi> have them among them; if the whole City hath a ſufficient Guard, 'tis as good as if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Citizen had a diſtinct Souldier to defend him; nay, 'tis more for our comfort that we have many rather then one, we have to do with many <hi>enemies,</hi> and therefore we need <hi>much aſſiſtance,</hi> Pſal 91. 12. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee:</hi> Many Angels are charged with our ſafety, and though they be not ſo particularly converſant about us (as the other opinion conceiveth) yet they <hi>behold the face of God,</hi> and are always in his preſence, and <hi>wait for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Pſal.</hi> 103. 20. who ſo careth for every one as if he had none to care for beſides him.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>This Tutelage is from their firſt conception in the womb, till the tranſlation of body and ſoul into glory;</hi> ſurvey all the paſſages of life from the <hi>Womb</hi> to the <hi>Grave,</hi> nay, after death, till the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> the Miniſtry of Angels doth not wholly ceaſe: their care beginneth as ſoon as the child is quickened in the womb, for then they have another diſtinct charge to look after; and as they are ſervants of providence by their help they are born and brought into the world, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence taketh date thence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. and they, I ſay, are <hi>inſtruments of providence,</hi> they watch over us in <hi>infancy</hi> and <hi>childhood; little ones</hi> are committed to their cuſtody, and <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings</hi> have their Angels, <hi>Mat</hi> 18.

So in <hi>dangers,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, God ſendeth him an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to bring him out, <hi>Acts 12. Ruffinus</hi> ſpeaketh of a young man, a Martyr on the Rack, that had his face wiped by an Angel, and refreſhed by him in the midſt of his pains: nay, in caſual dangers, which we cannot foreſee and prevent, Pſal. 91. 12. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, that thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone;</hi> ſo in <hi>Temptations,</hi> Mat. 4. 11. <hi>they miniſtred to Chriſt,</hi> when he was tempted by the Devil; they came to ſhew how God will deal with his people in like caſes: Once more, they are with us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in death; in the midſt of his Agonies the Lord Jeſus was comforted and refreſhed by an Angel, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 43. ſo they are with the faithful, helping and eaſing them in their ſickneſſes: After death they carry our ſouls to Heaven, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carryed into <hi>Abrahams boſome, Luke</hi> 16. 22. Though the body had not the honour of a pompous burial, yet the ſoul is ſolemnly conveyed by Angels, and gathered up into the communion of the ſouls of juſt men made perfect; as Chriſt himſelf alſo aſcended into Heaven in the company of Angels, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. Once more, after death they guard our bodies in the Grave, as the Angels guarded Chriſts Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2, 3, 4. God did ſet his Guards, as well as well as the High-Prieſts: Their laſt Miniſtry and ſervice about the faithful, is to gather up their bodies at the laſt day <hi>They ſhall gather up the Elect from the four winds, Mat.</hi> 24. 31 and then their Office and charge ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>This Tutelage is ever adminiſtred according to Gods pleaſure,</hi> Pſal. 103. 21. <hi>Ye Miniſters of his that do his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> not <hi>their own,</hi> not <hi>ours, but his pleaſure;</hi> the help of Angels <hi>is more powerful,</hi> but <hi>no more abſolute</hi> then the help of other means, for it dependeth ſtill on the will of God, as all other means of defence and outward ſupport do; their

And ſo at the calling and converſion of a ſinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. when we come to be poſſeſſed of our priviledges in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, It ſerveth for Exhortation to the children of<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> God.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>To wait for the Angels help,</hi> Do you keep in Gods ways and in your Callings, and you ſhall have ſafety and defence, when the Lord ſees it fit for you; remember you are a ſpectacle to God, Men and Angels, in all your actions, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and ſufferings, and bear up with a confidence, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, though you can do little as to the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts intereſt; What cannot God do by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</p>
                  <p>2. To behave our ſelves as thoſe that do expect this help, not <hi>tempting God,</hi> not <hi>grieving the Angels;</hi> We ſhould take heed how we carry our ſelves in regard of this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attendance; our ſins and vanity offendeth them, as it doth God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>3. To obſerve this when 'tis beſtowed upon us; <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him;</hi> and then, <hi>Oh come taſt and ſee,</hi> Pſal. 34. 7, 8.

Partly becauſe this malicious fiend hopeth this way to beat the Lord with his own weapon; when the bodies and Relicks of thoſe Saints, who by the famouſneſs of their examples were likely to draw many to God, do as much, or more, withdraw men from him; and <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> doth as much hurt, as their <hi>example</hi> did good.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us apply it now.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſerveth to humble us, we are the next rank of reaſonable Creatures, but how do we differ from them? their natures ingage them to holineſs, and ours being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted engage us to ſin; their nature will not permit them to ſin, and our nature will not permit us to do that which is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. and yet the Angels are aſhamed of this

Behold he putteth no truſt in his Saints; yea the Heavens are not clean in his ſight.</hi> Theſe holy Angels, when they compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with God, are abaſed; and ſhould not we much more? See alſo <hi>Job</hi> 4. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It ſerveth to <hi>stir us up to holineſs:</hi> you will ſay, where lyeth the Motive? I Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>We are bound as well as they;</hi> they <hi>behold his face,</hi> and we <hi>behold his face in a glaſs;</hi> we are under a Law as well as they, yea commanded to obſerve their pattern, <hi>Mat. 6. 10.

                  <p>2. <hi>We are bound more then they,</hi> as being of an inferior rank: and acts of <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> do chiefly oblige <hi>inferiours,</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> themſelves are inferiour to God; but <hi>dwellers in Houſes of clay,</hi> much more; that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt is emphatical, <hi>Pſal. 103. 20. The Angels that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in ſtrength do his Commandments:</hi> ſhall the <hi>Peaſant</hi> ſcorn that work in which the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf is engaged? if the glorious mighty Angels durſt not ſin againſt God, we ſhould not much more: When <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipped the Angel, he ſaith, <hi>Rev. 22. 9. See thou do it not, for I am thy</hi>
                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:115193:200"/>
                     <hi>fellow ſervant:</hi> Ah who would decline the work, when an Angel is our fellow ſervant? when theſe <hi>mighty ſpirits</hi> put their necks to the work of the Lord, ſhall <hi>ſorry man</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed?</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>We are the more bound for their ſakes,</hi> becauſe of their Tutelage, they are preſent with us: we are awed by a man of gravity, much more ſhould we be by the preſence of an Angel: When <hi>Cato</hi> was upon the Stage, they durſt not call for their <hi>obſcene Sports;</hi> there is an Angel always by you; What reports (think you) will they carry to Chriſt, if they ſhould ſee any thing that is unſeemly? 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 21. I charge you before God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c. The holy Angels are as it were, the <hi>Spies,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers</hi> of Heaven, and do acquaint Chriſt not only with <hi>our miſeries,</hi> but <hi>our ſins:</hi> Gods omni-preſency is a great depth, we cannot fathom it with our thoughts, and therefore it worketh but little with us; the nearer things come to the manner of our preſence, the more do they affect us: conſider the Angels are preſent with you in the Room where (it may be) you are acting your privy wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Again we had need be holy, the rather for the Angels ſake, becauſe elſe we ſhall loſe their Tutelage; they care not to take notice of an impure, obſtinate ſinner, <hi>Pſalm 34. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him:</hi> they that fear God themſelves, delight moſt in them that do likewiſe: ſutableneſs of Spirit and life, breedeth an holy and ſweet familiarity between us; they delight to keep us, and go with us here, that they may lay a Foundation for a more familiar acquaintance in Heaven: Now ſhall we grieve ſuch bleſſed companions! When <hi>Balaam</hi> went to curſe the people of God, a good Angel reſiſteth him, <hi>Num.</hi> 22. 22. If an Angel ſtood in the way of a Sorcerer, much more do they ſeek to ſtop and prevent the miſcarriages and offences of Gods children; will you break forth or go on violently, when an Angel ſtandeth in the way? and leave <hi>their Tutelage</hi> for a luſt? they are holy, and diſallow all carnal enterpriſes, and would withſtand the execution of them: will you conſtrain them to forſake you? You know

                  <p>Thirdly, It teacheth us <hi>to be more awful,</hi> all fear is not ſlaviſh; the Angels that have a pure nature, are afraid to ſin, we have a mixed nature: corruption is already gotten into our ſouls, and therefore have more need of caution; as they that have an enemy without, and a treacherous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within, have need to watch and ward; fear is all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy left us: we cannot ſtop the <hi>flux of natural corruption,</hi> but we may withſtand an actual temptation; as the Angels reſiſt the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of ſin: ſo let us withſtand the <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>propagation</hi> of it; we are always in the preſence of God, and ſhall we affront him to his face? <hi>fear</hi> keepeth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>pure,</hi> and us <hi>holy,</hi> them from the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of ſin, and us from the <hi>commiſſion</hi> of it: ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that feareth always,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. that is, not that perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf with <hi>needleſs terrors</hi> and <hi>ſcruples,</hi> that were a <hi>torture,</hi> not a <hi>bleſſedneſs;</hi> that's the Devils fear, <hi>who believe and tremble:</hi> But when we are always cautious, out of a deep reſpect to God, that we dare not offend him at any time, this is a <hi>bleſſed fear,</hi> like the good Angels fear; as <hi>Michael</hi> here <hi>durſt not bring a rayling accuſation.</hi>

               <p>HEre are two other compariſons, the one taken from <hi>raging Waves,</hi> the other from <hi>wandring Stars:</hi> For the firſt [<hi>Raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own ſhame</hi>] There is a great deal of variety among Interpreters in the application or accomodation of this ſimilitude, ſome go one way, ſome another; Waves are not more various and uncertain in their motions, then they in their expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſome apply it to their <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>inconſtancy,</hi> ſome to their <hi>reſtleſs activity</hi> in ſin, ſome to their <hi>turbulency,</hi> others to their <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>oſtentation;</hi> in ſuch uncertainty what ſhall we fix upon? Two things will direct us, the <hi>ſcope,</hi> and the <hi>force of the words:</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtle in all theſe ſimilitudes is to ſhew, that theſe ſeducers were nothing leſs then what they pretended to be: <hi>Clouds,</hi> but dry bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren clouds; <hi>Trees,</hi> but ſuch as bore either none, or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fruit: <hi>Waves</hi> that ſeemed to mount up unto heaven, and to promiſe great matters, as if they would ſwallow up the whole earth, but being daſhed againſt a Rock, all this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſwelling turneth into a little foam and froth. So <hi>Calvin</hi> applyeth it to the <hi>Libertines,</hi> who ſcorn and diſdain the common forms of ſpeech, and talk of <hi>illumination</hi> and <hi>edification,</hi> ſo that their hearers ſeem to be wrapt into the heavens, but alas they ſuddenly fall into beaſtly errours.</p>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:115193:234"/>
but however 'tis bad enough, when our neceſſities extort theſe complaints from us; want is a time of <hi>praying</hi> not of <hi>murmuring,</hi> the Throne of Grace was erected for <hi>a time of need, Heb.</hi> 4. 16. but 'tis mans uſual cuſtome to change <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> into <hi>ſins,</hi> as <hi>admonition</hi> into <hi>cenſuring,</hi> inſtead of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to men, we ſpeak of men, ſo inſtead of complaining to God, we complain of God, and ſo make murmuring take the room of prayer. Neceſſity is a time to put the promiſes in ſuit, to try faith, to awaken affections, not to provoke murmurings; <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. We may open our mouths in <hi>confeſſions of ſin, humble narratives pleading of promiſes,</hi> but not <hi>in ſelf justifications, ſtormings against Providence,</hi> or words of <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>impatience,</hi> ſo we muſt be dumb and not once open our mouths.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For what we have loſt, we complain when God taketh away ſuch a child, or ſuch a comfort, or blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a confidence of ours, as our affections were much ſet upon, and in bitterneſs of heart ſpeak unworthily of God and his diſpenſations, ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18 33. we hate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back a degree or two, and count it miſerable to be once happy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but oh Chriſtians remember when any thing is loſt 'tis a wonder all is not gone; <hi>Job</hi> loſt all, and yet <hi>bleſſed God, Job</hi> 1. 23. <note n="*" place="margin">Sencea.</note>

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:115193:235"/>
to fall into a deep ſleep, and dream many a fond dream till God take it from under us; he withdraweth comforts to ſee how we will take it, and bear up upon our great and everlaſting hopes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33. <hi>Ye took joyfully the ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your goods,</hi> &amp;c. you will ſay that was by Martyrdom, but your loſs by an ordinary providence; and will not you let God take us willingly as thieves and perſecutors, you have the ſame incouragements, <hi>a beter and enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For what we <hi>affect:</hi> We are wont to murmur at the ſmalneſs of our portion, we have not ſo much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, our condition in the world is not ſo great, ſo rich, ſo honourable, as theirs; we have but a ſingle, but they a double, a <hi>Benjamins</hi> portion: Oh but conſider this it meer murmuring, God never undertook to maintain all his children at the ſame rate, and we cannot expect ſo much; variety of conditions is neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, levelling is not Gods diſpenſation; ſome muſt be high and ſome low; the wiſe preſerver of all things diſtributeth his gifts variouſly, <hi>wealth</hi> to one, <hi>skill</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ſtrength</hi> to a third, one muſt <hi>reign,</hi> another <hi>ſerve,</hi> and all for the common good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a piece of <hi>Arras</hi> is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſeveral parcels; we ſhould all famiſh for company, if all were of one ſort, who ſhould endure the handy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? how low ſoever thou art, thou art there where God hath ſet thee, and there thou muſt tarry till the ſaid invitation of providence call thee higher. Look backward thou haſt made ſome increaſe: <hi>Jacob</hi> took notice that his was become <hi>two droves, Gen.</hi> 32. 10. though when he firſt came into the Country he had nothing but <hi>his ſtaff</hi> in his hand: many of Gods children are not ſo high as thou art, if you murmur; what ſhould others do that have leſs; we caſt our eyes forward on thoſe before us, and becauſe we have not ſo much as they, ſo good trading, houſes ſo well furniſhed, ſuch honour and eſteem in the world, all is as nothing; h you do not look about you to the thouſands that come ſhort of you; you ſay why ſhould not we thrive as they? be preferred as they? <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew why <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>

had a larger meſs, though the reſt at the Table did not; ſo doth the Lord know why he goeth to one, and not to another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let me ſhew you the <hi>hainouſneſs of the ſin,</hi> by the <hi>cauſes</hi> of it. 2. By the <hi>injuſtice</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>cauſes</hi> of murmuring are many, but all naught, as 1. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-love,</hi> when men are conceited of themſelves, they ſtorm that others are preferred before them; a proud man muſt needs be diſcontented, becauſe he ſets an high price upon himſelf, and when others will not come up to his price, he is troubled; you will find ſuch a proud thought riſing in your heart, <hi>that men of your worth are not taken notice of,</hi> and yet they that deſerve leaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and murmure moſt; the beſt ſay, I am not worthy: <hi>real worth</hi> is humble, the loaden boughs hang their heads, the <hi>Nettle</hi> mounteth, when the <hi>Violet</hi> lyeth ſhrouded under its leaves, and is only found out by its own ſcent: All Gods bleſſings are <hi>low</hi> to him that <hi>is high in his own eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Impatience.</hi> We cannot endure the leaſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, touchy nature would be at eaſe, tumbling and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in all kind of pleaſure; therefore as ſoon as we are touched in our skins, we fall a murmuring, <hi>Why is this evil befallen me?</hi> and <hi>Why ſhould I wait upon the Lord any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi> An unſubjection of Will to God, will inevitably put us upon repining.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Preſumption of merit,</hi> where all is of <hi>free coſt,</hi> there is no complaining; Men <hi>aſcribe</hi> to themſelves, when they <hi>preſcribe</hi> to God what he ſhall do for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or how bleſs them; every thing is welcom, where nothing is deſerved; if you keep a man of Almes, you take it ill that he ſhould not be pleaſed with his Diet: when we look to <hi>deſert,</hi> we may wonder more at <hi>what we have,</hi> then <hi>what we want;</hi> God would do us no wrong, if we were reduced to a leſs pittance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if in a <hi>priſon,</hi> 'tis a favour we are not in <hi>hell:</hi> a Malefactor would be glad to commute his puniſhment, a greater for a leſs, <hi>death</hi> for <hi>exile; exile</hi> for <hi>loſs of eſtate,</hi> and then the <hi>whole</hi> for <hi>a part:</hi> Can a firebrand of hell mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure? there is our deſert, but we think God is bound and

that 'tis a wrong that he taketh no more notice of us, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we faſted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. <hi>I am not as other men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>

                  </note> We are too ravenous and greedy upon outward things, and therefore the diſappointment breedeth the more vexation, our deſires and hopes of more, deſtroy the memory and conſideration of what we have: God giveth ſufficiently to ſatisfie our <hi>neceſſities,</hi> and we ſeek to ſupply our <hi>luſts: Luſt</hi> is more given to murmuring then <hi>neceſſity;</hi> Nature is contented with a little, 'tis ſoon ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but luſt enlargeth the deſire as hell.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The injuſtice of it, 'tis injurious to God, to others, to our ſelves: 1. 'Tis injurious to God; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a ſin that pulleth God out of the throne; <hi>you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into judgement with him;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> on the other hand prayeth, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, O Lord,</hi> Murmurers either <hi>deny</hi> his providence, or <hi>tax</hi> it: Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely they <hi>deny</hi> it, as if God did not ſet out to every man his portion, if men did believe that God did govern the world, even as he made the world, why do they not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of <hi>creation</hi> as well as <hi>providence;</hi> we would laugh at him that would murmure becauſe God did not make him an <hi>Angel,</hi> or a <hi>Star,</hi> why is it not as ridiculous to murmure becauſe God hath made thee a <hi>ſubject,</hi> and not a <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>begger,</hi> and not a <hi>rich man;</hi> a <hi>ſervant,</hi> but not a <hi>maſter;</hi> but that they own the hand of God in one, and not in the other; as if the world were governed by <hi>blind chance.</hi> Or elſe they <hi>tax providence,</hi> of <hi>indiſcretion</hi> or <hi>unrighteouſneſs:</hi> 'tis marvellous to ſee how murmuring robbeth God of all

               <p>1.

               <p>Therefore let me proceed with the greateſt Scripture evidence and conviction, and ſtate what is murmuring at the Times: 'Tis forbidden <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 10.

Jeſus Chriſt, and I will be content, though I ſhould begg my bread, and be reduced to raggs and extremity of want; when thy heart was ſtung with ſin, thus deſireous wert thou to reckon upon Chriſt as thy all-ſufficient portion; how grew the * <hi>conſolations of God to be ſmall with thee,</hi> now God tryeth whether thou wilt ſtand to thy word, and thou falleſt a murmuring; it may be juſt with God to dipp his Arrows in venom and vengeance, and ſhoot them into thy ſoul again: Once more, 'tis below <hi>your hopes,</hi> you ſhould have a ſpirit as high as Heaven, and will you ſtorm at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry petty loſs, as he ſaid, <hi>Art thou the Kings ſon in law, and art ſo lean from day to day?</hi> are you Heirs of glory, and ſtand ſo much upon triffles? it ſhould not be.</p>
               <p>Having given you ſome general Conſiderations againſt murmuring, I now come to particular Caſes.</p>
               <p>1. Doeſt thou lye under deep preſting wants? divers have been put to great ſtreights, that have done God more glory: <hi>Muſculas</hi> a great Divine, yet forced to ſerve a Weaver for his ſubſiſtance: <hi>Paul made Tents</hi> that he might not be burdenſome, and ſo prejudice men againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; the more deſtitute, the more ſenſible of the care of providence; God beareth the Purſe for us, when we have but from hand to mouth, we are ſtill ſupplyed; the more immediately you liue upon God, the more you begin the life of Heaven, where God is all in all: Deep poverty is is the ſauce of the preſent life; <hi>Austin</hi> ſaw a beggar frisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his belly was filled, he could find no ſuch delight after the uſe of the creatures, being daily and abundantly ſupplyed; the ſpectacle much wrought upon him.</p>

               <p>The next part of their Character is [<hi>walking after their own lusts,</hi>] This is fitly ſubjoined to the former; for <hi>luſts</hi> make men froward and hard to be pleaſed; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here deſcribed were <hi>exact Libertines,</hi> making their luſts their rule and their law; yea, the moſt bruitiſh of all luſts, the <hi>luſts of the fleſh;</hi> and therefore in <hi>Peter</hi> 'tis 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 10.

ſee my Comentary on <hi>James 1. 14. pag</hi> 105. and 106. for the preſent let it ſuffice to note, that luſt is either <hi>original,</hi> or <hi>actual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It ſignifyeth our <hi>original pronnneſs</hi> to all that is evil, <hi>James</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Actual</hi> luſt, ſo it ſignifieth any evil motion of the heart that ſwerveth from the Law of God, more eſpecially our inordinate deſires and inclinations to <hi>pleaſures, honours</hi> or <hi>profit;</hi> ſometimes they are called <hi>fleſhly luſts, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11. as carrying us out to the ſatisfaction of our bodily and bruitiſh appetites; ſometimes <hi>worldly lusts,</hi> Tit 2. 12. becauſe they are ſtirred by worldly objects; luſts are the <hi>fever</hi> of the ſoul, unnatural heats, tranſgreſſing the Laws of reaſon, and bounds of Religion.</p>
               <p>2. What doth this walking imply; 'tis elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. and by <hi>fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and the mind,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. It noteth,</p>

               <p>2.

               <p>Notes from this Verſe are theſe.</p>
               <p>From that [<hi>Beloved</hi>] which compellation is uſed to note his affection in this writing, the like is uſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 1. <hi>Beloved I thought meet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When we declaim againſt errours, we ſhould do it out of love, and a tender reſpect to the good of ſouls:</hi> In all conqueſts we had need watch our own hearts; people ſuſpect us to act out of <hi>peeviſhneſs</hi> and <hi>ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter affections,</hi> to ſerve a ſect and party, and our ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>faction,</hi> not <hi>zeal,</hi> therefore be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the flame be pure, incenſe muſt not be kindled with ſtrange fire, nor zealous ingagements ariſe from a carnal impulſe.</p>
               <p>Again, we may be earneſt againſt errour, when corrupt men are gotten into eſteem; but 'tis in love to you, if we expreſs our ſelves with ſome warmth and affection, 'tis for God, and your ſouls are concerned: 'tis obſervable <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Diſciple of love,</hi> is moſt earneſt againſt deceivers; <hi>bid them not good ſpeed</hi> ſaith he, 2 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 7. 10. and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in his Epiſtles, <hi>My little children beleeve not every ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there are many Anti.

               <p>From that [<hi>Remember,] Seaſonable remembrance of truths is a great help and relief to the ſoul;</hi> John 2. 22. <hi>When he was riſen from the dead, the Deſciples remembred,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>This ſeparation 1.

               <p>2 <hi>The fault and crime of the Schiſm is not always in thoſe that do actually ſeparate and withdraw, but in thoſe that cauſe it;</hi> a man threatneth death to his wife, hereupon ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth, not <hi>ſhe,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> maketh the ſeparation; <hi>Rome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately continuing her corruptions, and threatning death to thoſe that warn her, the cauſe of ſeparation is in <hi>Rome,</hi> not in us; ſtrings in tune muſt not be brought down to ſtrings out of tune, but the other ſet up to them; <hi>Go not thou to them</hi> (ſaith God to the Prophet) <hi>but let them return to thee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>A ſeparation from corruptions, and a ſeparation from thoſe that are corrupt, are two diſtinct things;</hi> a ſeparation from <hi>corruptions</hi> is always injoyned, but not always from thoſe that are <hi>corrupted,</hi> thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 11. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. ſpeak of a fellowſhip with men in evil works; but now a ſeparation from men that are corrupt, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lawful, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. Come out of her my people,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Jer. 51. 9. She would not be healed,</hi> &amp;c. we may ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſuch as ſeparate from Chriſt, and continue ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtinate in their corruptions; and ſometimes 'tis not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as when a Church is <hi>is reforming,</hi> and <hi>purging out theſe corruptions,</hi> or they are not <hi>of ſuch moment</hi> as that ſuch a deſparate remedy ſhould be uſed; a limb is not to be cut
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:115193:256"/>
off as ſoon as it akerh, but when 'tis rotten and likely to endanger the whole body, when evils are incurable, deadly and contagious; and we can no longer maintain commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion without ſin, at firſt 'tis good to try all things.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>There are ſeveral ſorts of ſeparation,</hi> as theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will manifeſt.  Separation is either

                     <item>2. Poſitive.</item>
                  </list>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt diſtinction, there is a <hi>partial ſeparation</hi> when we withdraw from the communion of the Church in ſome Ordinances and not in other, as in the Supper, but not in praving and hearing of the word.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diſtinction beareth thus: There is a <hi>negative ſeparation,</hi> as when men do not hold communion with ſome Church, but yet do not joyn elſewhere, but continue wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the amendment of that Church: <hi>Poſitive ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is when they embody in another Church way, ſetting up Altar againſt Altar, and threſhold againſt threſhold.</p>
               <p>The third diſtinction is to be underſtood thus. 1. There is a <hi>particular ſeparation</hi> whereby men renounce communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Churches of ſuch a kind and conſtitution, <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> or <hi>univerſal ſeparation</hi> by which men diſclaim all Churches extant in the world, as ſeekers, and many looſe and vagrant perſons, that are as yet to chuſe Religion, or look for new meſſengers from Heaven, to reſolve the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that are now on foot.</p>
               <p>Now the more unjuſt <hi>the ground</hi> is, the more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is the ſin by the <hi>degrees</hi> of it; if our ſeparation be total and poſitive, and to deny all Churches, of what conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever, argueth an high degree of pride and Schiſm.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Faulty ſeparation is that which is raſh, ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi>

               <p>9. <hi>Lawful ſeparation muſt not be ſuddain,</hi> till all due courſes be tryed, 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 7.

               <p>3. For the manner in every moral action; the manner of working is a chief circumſtance, a man may ſin in doing good, but not in doing well: now in prayer where we have immediately to do with God, we ſhould take great heed in what manner we come to him; the right manner is when we come with <hi>affection,</hi> with <hi>confidence,</hi> with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</hi>

               <p>3. Thoſe that have made profeſſion of Love to God, and yet afterwards break with him, bring an ill report up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, as if he were an ill Maſter: I am perſwaded that the Divel in policy lets many men alone for a while to make a ſtrict profeſſion, and ſeem to be full of zeal and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that they may afterwards do Religion a miſchief, whileſt they act for God though they do ſome things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, Sathan never troubleth them, he is at truce with them, till they have gotten a name for the profeſſion of Godlineſs and ſtrictneſs of converſation, and when once they have gotten a name, their fall will be more ſcandalous, more ignominious to themſelves, and diſgraceful to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, verily this is a common experience, we ſee many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; hot and carried out with great impulſions of zeal, and all this while Sathan lets them alone, he knoweth how mutable men are, and how ſoon they begin to tire in the ways of God, therefore lets them alone till they have run themſelves out of breath, that afterward by a more notable defection they may ſhame themſelves and harden others: If <hi>Judas</hi> will be a Diſciple he lets him alone, if <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> will be baptized and <hi>Nicholas</hi> bear Office in the Church he lets them alone, he knoweth the beſt are mutable, that many take up their Religion out of intereſt, that men are ſoon weary of their own ſcrupulouſneſs and rigid obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, that they firſt make Conſcience of all things and

               <p>1. Conſideration, <hi>Remember whence thou art fallen,</hi> pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the caſe; in examination we compare <hi>our ſelves</hi> and <hi>the Law</hi> together, but in this <hi>recollection, our ſelves</hi> and <hi>our ſelves</hi> together; ſadly conſider then what a difference there is between thee and thy ſelf, recall former experiences and ſay as Job 29. 2. 3. <hi>Oh that I were as in moneths paſt, in the dayes when God preſerved me, when his candle ſhined on my head,</hi> or as the Churce, <hi>Hoſea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 7. It was better with me than now,</hi> in our ſerious ſequeſtration and retirements we ſhould have ſuch thoughts as theſe are, <hi>I was wont to ſpend ſome time every day with God, I remember when 'twas a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to me to think of him, now I have no heart to pray or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, no reliſh of communion with his bleſſed majeſty; 'twas the joy of my Soul to be at an Ordinance, the returns of the Sabbath were welcome to me, but now what a wearineſs is it! time was when I had ſweet experiences, and the graces of Gods Spirit were more lively in me, but now all is dead and ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious; time was when a vain thought was burdenſome unto me, but now I can away with ſinful actions; time was when the miſpence of ordinary time was a grief unto my Soul, now I can ſpend the Sabbath unprofitably and never be troubled,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſhould you conſider your eſtate.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Humiliation</hi> intimated in the word <hi>repent;</hi> 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know your ſelves faln, many are convinced of their <hi>collapſed</hi> and <hi>decayed eſtate,</hi> but do not judg themſelves for it in Gods preſence, go bewail it to God, ſmite upon the thigh, praying for pardon; thats the notion of the word [<hi>repent</hi>] here, 'tis not enough to repent of <hi>groſs whoredom, theft, drunkenneſs,</hi> we muſt repent alſo of the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:115193:270"/>
                  <hi>decayes of love,</hi> the blind world thinketh we are to repent of nothing but what is publikely odious: In friendſhip <hi>cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is taken for a <hi>great injury,</hi> go arraign thy ſelf before God for growing cold in his Love and Service.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Reformation, do thy first works,</hi> we muſt not ſpend the time in idle complaints; many are <hi>ſenſible</hi> that do not <hi>repent,</hi> ſome may <hi>repent</hi> that do not <hi>reform,</hi> you muſt not be quiet till you recover your former ſtation; Chriſt puts <hi>Peter</hi> upon a <hi>trebble profeſſion</hi> becauſe of his <hi>trebble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, John</hi> 21. 17.</p>

They cannot endure to hear or think of it; if it might go by voices whether Chriſt ſhould come or no, would they give their voice this way, and ſay <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, yea, come quickly?</hi> If Thiefs and Malefactors ſhould have the liberty to chuſe whither the Aſſizes ſhould be kept or no, would they ever fix it? and look for and long for the time of its approach? No no, but a child of God is <hi>waiting</hi> and <hi>looking</hi> for this happy time.</p>

               <p>2.

               <p>I come now from the <hi>deſcription</hi> to the <hi>aſcription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to him<note place="margin">Obſervat. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>be glory,</hi> &amp;c. Can we beſtow any thing upon God? or wiſh any real worth and excellency to be ſuper-added to him? I anſwer no, the meaning is, that thoſe which are in God already may be firſt more <hi>ſenſibly manifeſted.</hi> Iſa. 64. 2. <hi>Make thy name known among the nations.</hi> 'Tis a great ſatisfaction to Gods people, when any thing of God is diſcovered, they value it above their <hi>own benefit</hi> and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 1. they preferre the glory of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> before their deliverance.</p>
               <p>2. More <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> and <hi>frequently acknowledged,</hi> 'tis a great pleaſure to the Saints to ſee others praiſe God, Pſal. 107. 8. <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. More <hi>deeply eſteemed,</hi> that God may be more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, more in the hearts of men and Angels, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren no not count it enough that God is glorified by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they deſire alſo that God may be glorified by others; as fire turneth all things near it into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo is grace diffuſive; good men are loath to go to Heaven alone, they would travel thither by troops and in company.</p>
               <p>But let us more particularly take a view of this aſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo firſt what is aſcribed, <hi>glory, majeſty, dominion,</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> Let us open theſe words. <hi>Glory</hi> is <hi>clara cum laude notitia,</hi> excellency diſcovered with praiſe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and notech that high honour and eſteem that is due to Chriſt. <hi>Majesty</hi> is the next word, which implieth ſuch greatneſs &amp; excellency as maketh one honoured &amp; preferr'd above all, therefore a ſtile uſually given to <hi>Kings,</hi> but none ſo due as unto Chriſt, who is <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of our Lords.</hi> The third term is <hi>dominion,</hi> which implieth the foveraignty of Chriſt over all things, eſpecially over the people whom he hath purchaſed with his blood. The laſt word is, <hi>power,</hi> which ſignifieth that all ſufficiency in God,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:115193:291"/>
whereby he is able to do all things according to the good pleaſure of his will.</p>
               <p>From hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A gracious heart hath ſuch a ſenſe of Gods worth and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervat. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>perfection, that it would have all things that are honourable and glorious, aſcribed to him,</hi> therefore are divers words here uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When we have done our utmoſt we come ſhort; for Gods <hi>name is exalted above all bleſſing, and above all praiſe, Nehem.</hi> 9. 5. Yet 'tis good to do as much as we can: Love to God will not be ſatisfied with a little praiſe, <hi>I will praiſe him yet more and more,</hi> love inlargeth the heart towards God, if there be any thing more excellent he ſhall have it; well then 'tis a ſign of a dead heart to be a <hi>nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in praiſes,</hi> to be ſparing, careleſs, or cold this way.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>When we think of God, 'tis a relief to the Soul to conſider</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervat. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>of his glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> majeſty, dominion and power;</hi> for this is that which the Apoſtle would have to be <hi>manifeſted, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> and <hi>esteemed</hi> in God, as the ground of our reſpect to him; <hi>it incourageth us in our ſervice,</hi> we need not think ſhame of his ſervice to whom <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> and <hi>majesty</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> belongeth: It <hi>hearteneth us againſt dangers;</hi> ſurely the great and glorious God will bear us out in his work; it <hi>increaſeth our awe and reverence,</hi> ſhall we ſerve God in ſuch ſlight faſhion as we would not ſerve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8. 'tis a leſſening of Gods majeſty, you do not treat him as a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious Potentate,</hi> Mal. 1. 14. <hi>It inviteth our Prayers,</hi> to whom ſhould we go in our neceſſities but to him that hath <hi>Dominion</hi> over all things, and <hi>power</hi> to diſpoſe of them for the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>majesty: It increaſeth our Dependance,</hi> God is glorious, and will maintain the honour of his name and truth of his promiſes: When we are daunted by earthly Potentates 'tis a relief to think of the <hi>majeſty of God,</hi> in compariſon of which all <hi>earthly Grandure</hi> is but the dream of a ſhadow: Again, God that hath a <hi>ſoveraignty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
