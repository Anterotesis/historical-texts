         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the late dreadful
FIRE
AT
Northampton. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe lamentable and dreadful Fire at <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,</hi>
cannot e're this, but be noiſed all over
<hi>England;</hi> but the Pamphlets and Narratives
that have been hitherto publiſhed of this Tragical
ſubject are ſo unfaithful, or at beſt imperfect, that I
thought my ſelf oblieg'd to undeceive and ſatisfie the
world with this ſhort and true accompt therefore.</p>
            <p>It began on <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>September, 1675.</hi>
about Noon, at a poor Womans houſe near Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
on this manner. The Woman fetching a whisp
of Straw to kindle her fire, and going in a Doors
with the ſtraw lighted, the ſudden violence of the
wind blew it out of her hand, and ſeizing the roof of
her Cottage, that had no Chamber over head; blew it
immediately into a flame; inſomuch, that within half
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29964:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an hours time the fire had diffuſed it ſelf above a mile
from the place where it firſt begun, and in five hours
ſpace above three parts in four of that moſt ſpacious
and beautiful Town reduced to aſhes; five inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
likewiſe were ſwallowed up in its ſuddain and
mercileſs flames; <hi>viz.</hi> one man, one Woman, and
three children, beſides many Cattle, Horſes, Cows,
Swine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The names of the principal places, ſtreets, and
Lanes that were burn'd are as followeth: <hi>St. Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi>
the <hi>Horſe-Market, Kings-head-lane, Gold-ſtreet,
Wool-Monger-ſtreet, Kings-well-ſtreet,</hi> part of <hi>Bridge-ſtreet,
Cobs-lane, Crosby-Lane, Cow-lane, Rotten-Row,
St. Gyles's-ſtreet, Farm-Lane, Abbington-ſtreet, Cock-Lane,
Ditus-Lane, New-Lane, Ship-ſtreet,</hi> the <hi>drapery,</hi>
called, <hi>The Womans-Market, Shoo-makers-Row,</hi> the
Butchers ſhops, called, <hi>The guts,</hi> the <hi>Market-hill</hi> and
<hi>Croſs, Mercers-Row;</hi> moſt of theſe ſtreets and Lanes
are burned down to the ground, only in ſome of them
here and there a houſe ſtanding, &amp; as for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
though there were four in the Town, yet three
of them were placed ſo in the out-skirts of it that they
all eſcaped thoſe ſacrilegious flames; onely the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
and moſt beautiful of them, <hi>viz,</hi> that of <hi>All-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>
ſtanding in the heart of the Town was utterly
demolliſhed, not only the leads, but the very bells
melting with the fervency of the heat. The loſs in
general has been computed by very knowing perſons,
and adjudged to amount to above eight hundred
Thouſand pound.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29964:4"/>
This ſhort and faithful relation is able to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to all that knew that antient and famous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
upon which onely account I publiſhed this
Narrative. As for thoſe that enquire after ſuch cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
accidents, meerly becauſe they are new, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them not, for my deſign herein, is rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
men to charity, than gratifie them in their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
and I intend not ſo much the ſatisfaction of thoſe
that are not concern'd, as the conſolation of thoſe that
were any way ſufferers in that dreadful fire, to peruſe
the following pages: to which end I intreat them that
were made publick meerly for their ſakes; and as for
thoſe that are onely fellow ſufferers with them; as
Chriſtians, and particularly of the ſame Nation; it
will well become ſuch to have charitable thoughts of
them, and towards them, not to condemn them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are puniſhed, but as time and ability ſhall
ſerve to receive and aſſiſt them according unto their
powers.</p>
            <p>And for the uſe that all in general may make of
this ſad Judgement, it will be this; namely, That we
turn to the Lord in time, and by a holy complyance
with his commands and obedience to his will to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the wrath of God, who to the incorrigible and
diſobedient is like to prove a conſuming fire, and will
at laſt aſſuredly caſt them into everlaſting burnings.</p>
            <p>For if the ſight of the Dreadful flames did amaze
the beholders, how may it put us in mind of the ſaying
of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>10th.</hi> verſe of the third
Chapter, and the ſecond Epiſtle: But the day of the
Lord will come as a Thief in the night, in the which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29964:5"/>
the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and
the Element ſhall melt with fervent heat, the earth
alſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burned up.
Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved,
what manner of perſons ought ye to be, in all Holy
converſation and godlineſs, looking for and haſting
unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the
Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
ſhall melt with fervent heat; nevertheleſs, we
according to his promiſe look for a new Heaven and
a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs, for
here we have no continuing City, therefore look for
one to come; to ſet our affections on things below,
we ſee how ſuddenly the Lord can ſweep them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
it will be wiſdom to hearken to that ſaying in
Scripture. Lay up for your ſelves treaſure in heaven,
where neither moth nor ruſt can corrupt, nor t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ves
break through to ſteal, for where your treaſure is
there will your hearts be alſo, and for an expedient
and counſel to thoſe that have ſuffered this great
loſs by Fire, let them conſider theſe rules following,
as the beſt and ſureſt way to get Riches in this world,
and lay up treaſure in heaven.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let your firſt and principle care be to get hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and the grace of God that may make you meet
to enjoy his Kingdom, and when you do this God
will not only give you Heaven when you Dye, but
will add alſo as much of this World as he ſeeth to
be good for you, <hi>Matthew 6. 33.</hi> Seek you firſt the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29964:5"/>
Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe
things ſhall be given <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y faith, and ſettle your Love

               </gap> 9. 20. 21.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Repent of your ſins and turn to the Lord
then, though you be brought low he will build you
up again, <hi>Job 27. 23, 24, 25.</hi> If thou return to the
Almighty thou ſhalt be built up, thou ſhalt put away
iniquity far from thy Tabernacles, then ſhalt thou
lay up gold as duſt, and the Gold of Opher as the
ſtones of the Brooks, the Almighty ſhall be thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and thou ſhalt have plenty of ſilver.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Walk in the fear of God, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to keep his commandements, <hi>Proverbs 22. 4.</hi> By
humility and the fear of the Lord are riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and life.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Follow your imployments with diligence,
there is a bleſſing of God goeth along with dilligence
and induſtry in your calings, but the hand of the dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
maketh rich.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, ſeek after Knowledge, and manage all
your affairs with Wiſdom and diſcretion, <hi>Prov.
24. 3 4.</hi> Though wiſdom is an Houſe builded, and
by underſtanding it is eſtabliſhed, by knowledge ſhall
the Chamber be filled with all precious and pleaſant
riches.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Be faithful and upright in all your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
for the upright ſhall have good things in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
the faithful Manſhall abound in Bleſsings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29964:6"/>
               <hi>Pſalm 112. 3, 4.</hi> Wealth and riches ſhall be in his
Houſe, unto the upright ariſeth light and darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Shun thoſe vices that bring men to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and hinder their thriving in the world, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digallity
and love of pleaſure. He that loveth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſhall be a poor man, he that loveth wine and oyl
ſhall not be rich.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, be liberal to the poor, there may be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
ſoul where there is but a ſmall eſtate, and the
more liberal any man is the more likely he is to be a
Rich man.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, and Laſtly, Be content with what God
giveth you, and then though you have never ſo little
you are a Rich Man, the firſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi>
Chapter, and 6 and 7 Verſes. <hi>But godlineſs with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
is great gain, for we brought nothing into this
world; and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</hi>
