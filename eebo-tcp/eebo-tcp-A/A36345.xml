            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A FORM OF Reconciliation, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere was never any ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deliverance afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God Almighty to his Church, but as it proved an occaſion of greater piety to the devout and ſincere Chriſtian, ſo it ſtir'd up a deſire in ſuch as were either it's open enemies, or diſguiſed friends, to joyn themſelves in external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, when they were delivered from their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104068:3"/>
Thus we read of a mixt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that joyned themſelves <note place="margin">2.</note> to the <hi>Jews</hi> and went up with them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Theſe certainly were no others than ſome of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and other nations, who having ſeen the miracles wrought by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and being convinced by them, that they muſt needs be the people of God, in whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo many amazing prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies had been effected, thought it their wiſeſt courſe to forſake the Idolatry of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and joyn themſelves with the Profeſſors of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Samaritans</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd all friendſhip and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note place="margin">5.</note> with the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time <note place="margin">ant. c.</note> of their diſtreſs, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104068:3"/>
court and implore their favour, pretended to be of the of the ſame religion and communion with them, when they were reſtored to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their religion, and the enjoyment of their properties in their own countrey: And it <note place="margin">c. 54</note> was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that their deliverance out of Captivity ſhould be ſo wonderful to the Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about them, that it ſhould invite vaſt numbers of them to joyn themſelves to their communion: And what was thus foretold ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their return out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly come to paſs after their deliverance, for many of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104068:4"/>
Nations that before were their <note place="margin">2.</note> Enemies, did declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in favour of them, and deſired to be admitted to their communion. And as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd thus with the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of our Saviour, it was ſo likewiſe with the Chriſtian Church after it: For 300 years ſhe enjoyed little of delight or quiet in the world, and few or none embraced her Religion, but thoſe that did it on a pure principle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without any regard to ſecular profit or advantages; but when Kings and Princes became nurſing Fathers to the Church, and encouraged the Religion by making Laws for its ſecurity, and countenanc'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104068:4"/>
the profeſſors of it, by large priviledges and promotions in Church and State; then many of the Heathens flock'd to its communion, and embraced the profeſsion of it; not becauſe they loved it better than their own, but becauſe they ſaw it enjoyed the countenance of the State, and found it the ready way to thoſe honours and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which they knew they muſt want in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their own: This having been the ſtate and condition of the Church in former Ages, we have reaſon to believe, will be again the conſequent of that great deliverance that God has afforded her in this Kingdom, it being reaſonable to preſume
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104068:5"/>
that thoſe who never were of her communion, as well as thoſe who Apoſtatized from it, will be deſirous to be received into her communion: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of a principle of ſhame and ſorrow, and the former out of deſperation, as being out of all hopes of ſeeing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to flouriſh again among us, eſpecially ſince it received ſo remarkable a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at a time when they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themſelves with the hopes of an entire eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. And becauſe it is fit that ſome penance ſhould be impoſed on thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook us in time of danger, as well as a method propounded for the admiſsion of thoſe that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104068:5"/>
never were of our communion, that ſo the former may be brought to a due ſenſe of their ſin and danger, and the latter encouraged to continue in our communion, I ſhall therefore preſume to offer my thoughts upon this point, and lay down ſuch a Scheme for the admiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them both, as may ſerve the preſent neceſsities of the Church, 'till the wiſdom of the Convocation ſhall preſcribe another in its ſtead.</p>
            <p>In order to this I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>What the Ancient Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church was, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Penitents that had fallen from her.</hi>

            <p>In the handling of the firſt head, I do not deſign to inſiſt <note place="margin">Peculiar places appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents.</note> upon all the particulars of the ancient diſcipline of Penance, for that would be a laborious and voluminous work, but ſhall only mention ſuch bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it as may be ſerviceable to my preſent deſign, and in order to that I conſider,</p>
            <p>

be reckon'd any Order of penitents, but ſhould rather be eſteemed as perſons that have performed their penance, and ſo were admitted to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire communion with the Church; but notwithſtanding this difference in the number, it is agreed on all hands that there were ſeveral places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſeveral Orders of penitents.</p>

the Emperour in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who <note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. 6. 34.</note> tells us that the Biſhop would not admit him to enter into the Church before he had made a confeſsion of his ſins and ſtood in the place of penitents. And it is plain by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Canon of <hi>Nice,</hi> that it rather ſuppoſeth them as things of long uſe and practice in the Church, then preſcribes any new rules or directions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: And as they were introduced very early into the Church, ſo they continued in practice much longer in the Weſtern than the Eaſtern Church, for the three firſt were abrogated in the fifth Century, ſoon after the days of <hi>Nectarius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:104068:8"/>
but they continued in the Weſtern Church till the ninth Century, as may appear by the Capitulars of <hi>Charles</hi> the <note place="margin">L. 5. c. 71.</note> Great: After which time the diſcipline of penance begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be relax'd, the ſtations of the penitents decay'd with it.</p>

               <hi>2ly,</hi> That the place for the <note place="margin">Where thoſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were.</note> Weepers was in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porch without the doors of the Church, the place for the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was at the further end of the Narthex, the place for the Proſtrate within the body of the Church, but before the Ambon the Pulpit or reading desk, and that for the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtents before the Choire or Chancel: This will be more

evident by applying proofs out out of ancient Writers to each of theſe particulars. Firſt then for the place of the <hi>Weepers,</hi> we have the teſtimonies of <hi>Greg.</hi>

confesſion, the one, before the penance was impoſed, and this was done either in private to the Biſhop, or in publick in the Church, as the Biſhop ſhould direct, the other after the penance was performed: The former of theſe was looked on as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to free the Church from the guilt and the ſcandal of publick ſins, and in the caſe of private ones it was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a means to bring the ſinners to a more due ſence and conviction of their faults: Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> commends it <note place="margin">de pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. c. 9 <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104068:16"/>
Writters for the whole action of Repentance, and this is ſo common in the Greek and Latin Fathers, in <hi>Ireneus,</hi> &amp; <hi>St. Baſil, Tertullian, St. Cyprian, Pacianus,</hi> and others, that the crafty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> make uſe of it as an argument to prove their new Doctrine of Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesſion, and wherever they find the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>confesſio</hi> mentioned, they do not ſo much inquire into the genuine ſenſe of the word, as force it into a proof for the practice of their Church in this particular. Now to me it is a plain evidence that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104068:17"/>
confesſion of ſins in publick was eſtemed a neceſsary part or principal ingredient of Repentance, becauſe it could give a dinomination to the whole action, and make the diſcipline of Repentance to paſs under that name, <hi>2ly.</hi> That the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine of Auricular Confeſsion has been ſuperſtructed upon this foundation: for it is realy nothing elſe but the publick <hi>exomologeſis</hi> reduced to aſhes and ſprang up in the Church out of it's ruines, and as a late <note place="margin">Biſhop Taylor.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104068:17"/>
caſes neceſsary, in very many uſefull, until by the diſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, it became unſufferable, and a bigger ſcandal than thoſe which it did intend to remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> That during the time of their Eccleſiaſtical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <note place="margin">faſting injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> they were required to faſt. There is none of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers on the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of penance, but among the reſt of the auſterities that were practiſed by the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, do mention this of faſting, as a principal part of it, ſometimes under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>jejunium,</hi> ſometimes under the terms of <hi>cibus ſiccus,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104068:18"/>
will be evident, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral periods of the Church and deduce the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of faſting and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it through them; from whence it will appear that tho' it was always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as a part of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential diſcipline, yet it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of different degrees, both as to the manner of faſting and the time of it: <note place="margin">Tert: de paenit. c. 9. 10. 11. 12.

from that ſtory and ſeveral paſsages in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where they deſcribe <note place="margin">de paenit. c. 9. 10.

               </gap> and <hi>cibus</hi> and <hi>potus purus</hi> without any determination of the nature of the faſt or the time of it's continuance.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> Century, as the time of the penance was made more tedious, ſo the time of faſting was inlarged with it, and that faſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a ſpare diet, and an abſtinence from ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104068:19"/>
meats: We read in the <note place="margin">Ancyr. c. 16. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. c. 11. 12. Baſil. Ep.

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:104068:20"/>
From the <hi>4th</hi> Century on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the manner of faſting came to be preſcribed and limited, and then it was thought a tolerable degree of abſtinence, if the penitent did faſt with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as may appear by the Canons of ſeveral Councils and the penitential Canons extant at the end of <hi>Gratians</hi> decrees, and thus things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till the Eleventh Century, at which time the diſipline of the Church began to be Corrupted by the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the eaſe &amp; luxury of the people, and then pilgrimages to the ſhrines of the ſaints, and the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104068:20"/>
entring into Monaſterys, the going on an expedition for the recovery of the Holy-Land, or the maintaining of thoſe that were willing to engage in the Expedition, deſtroyed the ancient diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, and reduced it to that weak and languiſhing ſtate in which it is at preſent.</p>
            <p>

to any unprejudiced man, that they are not altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the will of the Church; that they may be ſuited to her in any ſtate or condition, and may ſtill be reduced to practice when the wiſdom of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſhall think it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: And among theſe I reckon three things former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents confeſſion of his fault, his afflicting himſelf with faſting for a ſeaſon, and his ſtanding for ſome time in a peculiar place of the Church appointed for that purpoſe, before he be admitted to her communion.

circumſtantial and leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things I reckon the diſtinction of their Apparel, and the Aſhes on their Heads, the Sack-cloth on their bodies, and proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ground, the abſtinence from Feaſts, and and all kind of Civil Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Commerce, the macerating of the body, by want of ſleep, and long and ſevere Faſtings, the length of time in which they were forced to continue under the Cenſures of the Church, and wait for Abſolution, before they could receive it, which ſometimes and in ſome caſes, extended to
