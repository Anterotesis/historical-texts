         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>GO on, Great Prince, the mighty Work purſue,</l>
               <l>And reap the Laurels to your Vertue due.</l>
               <l>Go on, and let the ſad <hi>Ierne</hi> ſhare</l>
               <l>Your Glorious Triumphs, as it do's your Care.</l>
               <l>There Victory will on your Arms attend,</l>
               <l>(For Heaven muſt ſure the Juſteſt Cauſe befriend:)</l>
               <l>There urge the Fortune of your growing Fate,</l>
               <l>And kindly prop <hi>Ierne</hi>'s ſinking State.</l>
               <l>Well, now he's Shipt !— See how th' obſequious Main</l>
               <l>And trembling Billows fear to entertain</l>
               <l>So Great a Pledge of Fortune, One to whom</l>
               <l>Fate owes ſo many Victories to come.</l>
               <l>Ceaſe, ceaſe, ye Winds, you need not ſend your Gales,</l>
               <l>His Subjects Loyal Vows will fill the Sails.</l>
               <l>The wondring Sea-gods on their Maſter gaze,</l>
               <l>And Reverend <hi>Triton</hi> on his Trumpet plays:</l>
               <l>No foamy Waves alarm the peaceful Deep,</l>
               <l>The Winds are huſht, the very Tempeſts ſleep;</l>
               <l>Till ſafely landing on the diſtant Shore,</l>
               <l>He views a Place he never ſaw before.</l>
               <l>Behold the Monarch walking on the Strand,</l>
               <l>Whilſt mighty Crowds do blacken all the Sand:</l>
               <l>Guns, Trumpets, Drums, his Welcom all proclaim;</l>
               <l>There's Soul, there's Life, nay, Magic in his Name.</l>
               <l>New Vigour from his Sight the Soldier draws,</l>
               <l>And through all Dangers boldly courts Applauſe;</l>
               <l>A nobler Warmth do's all the Men inſpire,</l>
               <l>Their Breaſts are heated, and they feel the Fire;</l>
               <l>While Peals of artful Thunder rend the Air,</l>
               <l>And their lowd Joy through the large Region bear.</l>
               <l>What Place will firſt our <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Arms employ,</l>
               <l>To give Prefage of future Victory ?</l>
               <l>Th' unequal Force no meaner Town withſtands,</l>
               <l>But beg their Peace with low ſubmiſſive Hands.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cavan</hi> in vain relies upon its Strength,</l>
               <l>And views thoſe Turrets which muſt fall at length.</l>
               <l>Where Valour's wanting, what do Walls avail ?</l>
               <l>Thoſe may be ſtorm'd, but this can never fail.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth, like a bold Torrent, run,</l>
               <l>And ſcorn the weak Attacks of Sword and Gun.</l>
               <l>Forthwith the daſtard <hi>Iriſh</hi> quit the Place,</l>
               <l>And ſcarce dare look our Party in the Face.</l>
               <l>So when Great <hi>Joſuah,</hi> by God's Command,</l>
               <l>With his unconquer'd Hoſt o're-ran the Land,</l>
               <l>The trembling <hi>Canaanite,</hi> poſſeſt with Fear,</l>
               <l>Fled to the Hills, yet ſcarce found Safety there:</l>
               <l>In vain they fought to ſhun approaching Death,</l>
               <l>Begg'd to protract a poor and ſhameful Breath;</l>
               <l>The fiery <hi>Jews</hi> deſtroy the timerous Race,</l>
               <l>And ſhew the hardned <hi>Canaanite</hi> no Grace.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Tredagh</hi> do's next the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms oppoſe,</l>
               <l>Following the Counſel of her <hi>Gallick</hi> Foes:</l>
               <l>At laſt, when no Relief, no Hope is near,</l>
               <l>And Death do's in a thouſand Shapes appear,</l>
               <l>Taught by Experience of former Time,</l>
               <l>When haughty <hi>Cromwel</hi> puniſh'd her great Crime,</l>
               <l>To Article ſhe wiſely do's begin,</l>
               <l>And opes her Gates, and lets the Monarch in.</l>
               <l>Now Naked <hi>Dublin</hi> do our Troops ſurvey,</l>
               <l>A cheap, unguarded, and defenceleſs Prey,</l>
               <l>Unleſs the <hi>French</hi> have labour'd to deſtroy</l>
               <l>The Place they cou'd not any more enjoy.</l>
               <l>And who can tell ? For Fear, with Malice join'd,</l>
               <l>No Bounds, no Limits to their Fury find:</l>
               <l>But if thoſe Blood-hounds thus do ſerve the Iſle,</l>
               <l>All <hi>France</hi> next Year ſhall be its Funeral Pile.</l>
               <l>'Tis far above the Meanneſs of my Verſe,</l>
               <l>Such great Heroick Actions to rehearſe:</l>
               <l>For, ah ! what Tribe of all the Muſe below</l>
               <l>Can our Great Prince in equal Numbers ſhew ?</l>
               <l>But if the Great <hi>Apollo</hi> do's inſpire</l>
               <l>My vig'rous Mind with no fantaſtick Fire,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> will in a Years revolving Space</l>
               <l>Our Mighty <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Glorious Triumphs grace.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jove</hi> did the Iſle from Toads and Spiders free,</l>
               <l>A puny Task, below a Deity:</l>
               <l>But you far greater Miracles renew,</l>
               <l>A larger Laurel to your Worth is due;</l>
               <l>For by the Influence of your careful Toil</l>
